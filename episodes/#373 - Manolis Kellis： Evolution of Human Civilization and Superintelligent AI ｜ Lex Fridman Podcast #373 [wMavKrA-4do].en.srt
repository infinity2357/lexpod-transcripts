00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,850
maybe we shouldn't think of AI as our

you are responsible for training those

you are responsible for training those

about AI as a partner
 

29
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,410

164
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:08,940
uh birds that learn how to make a nest
 

165
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,089
uh birds that learn how to make a nest
through genetics and will make a nest

166
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:11,099
through genetics and will make a nest
 

167
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,190
through genetics and will make a nest
even if they've never seen one we are

168
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
even if they've never seen one we are
 

169
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,690
even if they've never seen one we are
constantly relearning all of human

170
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:14,700
constantly relearning all of human
 

171
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,610
constantly relearning all of human
civilization so that's the second thing

172
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:16,620
civilization so that's the second thing
 

173
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,710
civilization so that's the second thing
and the third one that actually makes

174
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
and the third one that actually makes
 

175
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,470
and the third one that actually makes
humans very different from AI is that

176
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:21,480
humans very different from AI is that
 

177
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,690
humans very different from AI is that
the baggage we carry is not experiential

178
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:23,700
the baggage we carry is not experiential
 

179
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,270
the baggage we carry is not experiential
baggage it's also evolutionary baggage

180
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,280
baggage it's also evolutionary baggage
 

181
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,930
baggage it's also evolutionary baggage
so we have evolved through rounds of

182
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:29,940
so we have evolved through rounds of
 

183
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,490
so we have evolved through rounds of
complexity

184
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,500
complexity
 

185
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,830
complexity
so just like ogres have layers and

186
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
so just like ogres have layers and
 

187
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,009
so just like ogres have layers and
Shrink has layers humans have layers

188
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:36,019
Shrink has layers humans have layers
 

189
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,690
Shrink has layers humans have layers
there's the cognitive layer which is

190
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:38,700
there's the cognitive layer which is
 

191
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,330
there's the cognitive layer which is
sort of the outer you know most the the

192
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,340
sort of the outer you know most the the
 

193
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,430
sort of the outer you know most the the
latest evolutionary Innovation this

194
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
latest evolutionary Innovation this
 

195
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,410
latest evolutionary Innovation this
enormous neocortex that we have evolved

196
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:45,420
enormous neocortex that we have evolved
 

197
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,250
enormous neocortex that we have evolved
and then there's the emotional uh

198
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,260
and then there's the emotional uh
 

199
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,229
and then there's the emotional uh
baggage underneath that and then there's

200
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:51,239
baggage underneath that and then there's
 

201
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,270
baggage underneath that and then there's
all of the fear and fright and flight

202
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
all of the fear and fright and flight
 

203
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,350
all of the fear and fright and flight
and all of these kinds of behaviors so

204
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:56,360
and all of these kinds of behaviors so
 

205
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,930
and all of these kinds of behaviors so
AI only has a neocortex AI doesn't have

206
00:03:59,930 --> 00:03:59,940
AI only has a neocortex AI doesn't have
 

207
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,089
AI only has a neocortex AI doesn't have
a limbic system it doesn't have this

208
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:02,099
a limbic system it doesn't have this
 

209
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,229
a limbic system it doesn't have this
complexity of human emotions which make

210
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
complexity of human emotions which make
 

211
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,229
complexity of human emotions which make
us so I think beautifully complex so

212
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:09,239
us so I think beautifully complex so
 

213
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,770
us so I think beautifully complex so
beautifully uh intertwined with our

214
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:12,780
beautifully uh intertwined with our
 

215
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,789
beautifully uh intertwined with our
emotions with our instincts with our you

216
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
emotions with our instincts with our you
 

217
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,069
emotions with our instincts with our you
know sort of gut reactions and all of

218
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:19,079
know sort of gut reactions and all of
 

219
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,509
know sort of gut reactions and all of
that so I think when humans are trying

220
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:20,519
that so I think when humans are trying
 

221
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,810
that so I think when humans are trying
to suppress that aspect the sort of code

222
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:23,820
to suppress that aspect the sort of code
 

223
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,490
to suppress that aspect the sort of code
more human aspect towards a more

224
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:25,500
more human aspect towards a more
 

225
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,830
more human aspect towards a more
cerebral aspect I think we lose a lot of

226
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
cerebral aspect I think we lose a lot of
 

227
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,469
cerebral aspect I think we lose a lot of
the creativity we lose a lot of the you

228
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
the creativity we lose a lot of the you
 

229
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,930
the creativity we lose a lot of the you
know freshness of humans and I think

230
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:32,940
know freshness of humans and I think
 

231
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,370
know freshness of humans and I think
that's quite Irreplaceable so we can

232
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,380
that's quite Irreplaceable so we can
 

233
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,469
that's quite Irreplaceable so we can
look at the entirety of people that are

234
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
look at the entirety of people that are
 

235
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,930
look at the entirety of people that are
alive today maybe all humans who have

236
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:38,940
alive today maybe all humans who have
 

237
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,909
alive today maybe all humans who have
ever lived and map them in this High

238
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:40,919
ever lived and map them in this High
 

239
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,310
ever lived and map them in this High
dimensional space and there's probably a

240
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:43,320
dimensional space and there's probably a
 

241
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,710
dimensional space and there's probably a
center

242
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
center
 

243
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,590
center
uh a center of mass for that mapping and

244
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:48,600
uh a center of mass for that mapping and
 

245
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,909
uh a center of mass for that mapping and
a lot of us deviate in different

246
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
a lot of us deviate in different
 

247
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,330
a lot of us deviate in different
directions so the the variety of uh

248
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:53,340
directions so the the variety of uh
 

249
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,950
directions so the the variety of uh
directions in which we all deviate from

250
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
directions in which we all deviate from
 

251
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,230
directions in which we all deviate from
that Center is vast I would like to

252
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,240
that Center is vast I would like to
 

253
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,510
that Center is vast I would like to
think that the center is actually empty

254
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
think that the center is actually empty
 

255
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,450
think that the center is actually empty
yes that basically humans are just so

256
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:02,460
yes that basically humans are just so
 

257
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,370
yes that basically humans are just so
diverse from each other that there's no

258
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:04,380
diverse from each other that there's no
 

259
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,170
diverse from each other that there's no
such thing as an average human

260
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,180
such thing as an average human
 

261
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,270
such thing as an average human
that every one of us has some kind of

262
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:08,280
that every one of us has some kind of
 

263
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,689
that every one of us has some kind of
complex baggage of emotions intellectual

264
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:11,699
complex baggage of emotions intellectual
 

265
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,290
complex baggage of emotions intellectual
you know motivational uh behavioral

266
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:15,300
you know motivational uh behavioral
 

267
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,749
you know motivational uh behavioral
traits that

268
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
traits that
 

269
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,610
traits that
um it's not just one sort of normal

270
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:19,620
um it's not just one sort of normal
 

271
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,469
um it's not just one sort of normal
distribution we deviate from it there's

272
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:21,479
distribution we deviate from it there's
 

273
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,110
distribution we deviate from it there's
just so many dimensions that we're kind

274
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,120
just so many dimensions that we're kind
 

275
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,270
just so many dimensions that we're kind
of hitting the sort of sparseness the

276
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,280
of hitting the sort of sparseness the
 

277
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,909
of hitting the sort of sparseness the
the curse of dimensionality where it's

278
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:28,919
the curse of dimensionality where it's
 

279
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,430
the curse of dimensionality where it's
actually quite sparsely populated and I

280
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
actually quite sparsely populated and I
 

281
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,810
actually quite sparsely populated and I
don't think you have an average human

282
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:32,820
don't think you have an average human
 

283
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,990
don't think you have an average human
being so what makes us unique in part is

284
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
being so what makes us unique in part is
 

285
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,090
being so what makes us unique in part is
the diversity

286
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,100
the diversity
 

287
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,029
the diversity
and the capacity for diversity and the

288
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
and the capacity for diversity and the
 

289
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,610
and the capacity for diversity and the
capacity of the diversity comes from the

290
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:43,620
capacity of the diversity comes from the
 

291
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,770
capacity of the diversity comes from the
entire evolutionary history so there's

292
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:45,780
entire evolutionary history so there's
 

293
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,370
entire evolutionary history so there's
just so many ways we can vary from each

294
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,380
just so many ways we can vary from each
 

295
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,249
just so many ways we can vary from each
other yeah I would say not just the

296
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:52,259
other yeah I would say not just the
 

297
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,710
other yeah I would say not just the
capacity but the inevitability of

298
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
capacity but the inevitability of
 

299
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,050
capacity but the inevitability of
diversity basically it's in our Hardware

300
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,060
diversity basically it's in our Hardware
 

301
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,810
diversity basically it's in our Hardware
we are wired differently from each other

302
00:05:59,810 --> 00:05:59,820
we are wired differently from each other
 

303
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,490
we are wired differently from each other
my siblings and I are completely

304
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:01,500
my siblings and I are completely
 

305
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,570
my siblings and I are completely
different my kids from each other

306
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:02,580
different my kids from each other
 

307
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,490
different my kids from each other
completely different my my wife has

308
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:04,500
completely different my my wife has
 

309
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,990
completely different my my wife has
she's like number two of six siblings

310
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
she's like number two of six siblings
 

311
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,150
she's like number two of six siblings
from from a distance they look the same

312
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
from from a distance they look the same
 

313
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,710
from from a distance they look the same
but then you get to you know you get to

314
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:09,720
but then you get to you know you get to
 

315
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,029
but then you get to you know you get to
know them every one of them is

316
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
know them every one of them is
 

317
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,550
know them every one of them is
completely different but sufficiently

318
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:13,560
completely different but sufficiently
 

319
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,710
completely different but sufficiently
the same that the differences interplay

320
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:15,720
the same that the differences interplay
 

321
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,210
the same that the differences interplay
with each other so that's the

322
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,220
with each other so that's the
 

323
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,969
with each other so that's the
interesting thing where the diversity is

324
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:19,979
interesting thing where the diversity is
 

325
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,370
interesting thing where the diversity is
functional it's useful so it's like

326
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:22,380
functional it's useful so it's like
 

327
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,409
functional it's useful so it's like
we're close enough to where we notice

328
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:24,419
we're close enough to where we notice
 

329
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,129
we're close enough to where we notice
the diversity and it doesn't completely

330
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:28,139
the diversity and it doesn't completely
 

331
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,749
the diversity and it doesn't completely
destroy the possibility of like

332
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
destroy the possibility of like
 

333
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,670
destroy the possibility of like
effective communication interactions so

334
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
effective communication interactions so
 

335
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,710
effective communication interactions so
we're still the same kind of thing so

336
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:33,720
we're still the same kind of thing so
 

337
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,790
we're still the same kind of thing so
what I said in one of our earlier

338
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
what I said in one of our earlier
 

339
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,590
what I said in one of our earlier
podcasts is that if humans realize that

340
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:36,600
podcasts is that if humans realize that
 

341
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,070
podcasts is that if humans realize that
we're 99.9 percent identical we would

342
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
we're 99.9 percent identical we would
 

343
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,710
we're 99.9 percent identical we would
basically stop fighting with each other

344
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:41,720
basically stop fighting with each other
 

345
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,430
basically stop fighting with each other
like we are really one human species and

346
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,440
like we are really one human species and
 

347
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,090
like we are really one human species and
we are so so similar to each other and

348
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,100
we are so so similar to each other and
 

349
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,850
we are so so similar to each other and
if you look at the alternative if you

350
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:52,860
if you look at the alternative if you
 

351
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,249
if you look at the alternative if you
look at the next thing outside humans

352
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:55,259
look at the next thing outside humans
 

353
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,350
look at the next thing outside humans
like it's been six million years that we

354
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
like it's been six million years that we
 

355
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,870
like it's been six million years that we
haven't had a relative so it's it's

356
00:06:59,870 --> 00:06:59,880
haven't had a relative so it's it's
 

357
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,150
haven't had a relative so it's it's
truly extraordinary that that we're

358
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
truly extraordinary that that we're
 

359
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,090
truly extraordinary that that we're
we're kind of like this Dot in outer

360
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:05,100
we're kind of like this Dot in outer
 

361
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,830
we're kind of like this Dot in outer
space compared to the rest of life on

362
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:06,840
space compared to the rest of life on
 

363
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,050

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:10,740
through rounds of complexity can you
 

367
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,529
through rounds of complexity can you

features on top of old features so

382
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,060
features on top of old features so
 

383
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,629

basically when uh like every single time

384
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
basically when uh like every single time
 

385
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,029

389
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,189
I'm a yeast like I'm a unicellular
organism and then cell division is

organism and then cell division is
 

391
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,450
organism and then cell division is
basically identical

my heart beats I'm a fish so basically
 

401
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,150
my heart beats I'm a fish so basically
that I still have the same heart like

somewhere in evolution and that all of
 

421
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,670
somewhere in evolution and that all of

457
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,570
version of this journey it's it's
extraordinary that humans have evolved

458
00:08:59,570 --> 00:08:59,580
extraordinary that humans have evolved
 

459
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,430
extraordinary that humans have evolved
so much in so little time

460
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
so much in so little time
 

461
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,590
so much in so little time
again if you look at the the timeline of

462
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
again if you look at the the timeline of
 

463
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,050
again if you look at the the timeline of
evolution you basically have billions of

464
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,060
evolution you basically have billions of
 

465
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,250
evolution you basically have billions of
years to even get to a dividing cell and

466
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,260
years to even get to a dividing cell and
 

467
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,949
years to even get to a dividing cell and
then a multicellular organism and then a

468
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
then a multicellular organism and then a
 

469
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,190
then a multicellular organism and then a
complex body plan and then these

470
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:16,200
complex body plan and then these
 

471
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,350
complex body plan and then these
incredible senses that we have for

472
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,360
incredible senses that we have for
 

473
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,150
incredible senses that we have for
perceiving the world the fact that bats

474
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
perceiving the world the fact that bats
 

475
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,430
perceiving the world the fact that bats
can fly and they evolved flight the

476
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:22,440
can fly and they evolved flight the
 

477
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,590
can fly and they evolved flight the
evolved sonar in the span of a few

478
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:24,600
evolved sonar in the span of a few
 

479
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,389
evolved sonar in the span of a few
million years I mean it's just the

480
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
million years I mean it's just the
 

481
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,430
million years I mean it's just the
extraordinary how much Evolution has

482
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:28,440
extraordinary how much Evolution has
 

483
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,730
extraordinary how much Evolution has

while to get good at evolving and then
 

491
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,910
while to get good at evolving and then
once you get good at evolving you can

once you get good at evolving you can
 

493
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,110
once you get good at evolving you can
sort of

get more complex but with Evolution it's
 

531
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,170
get more complex but with Evolution it's
almost the opposite

good at evolving
 

543
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,769
good at evolving
where do you think it's all headed

544
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:36,779
where do you think it's all headed
 

545
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:39,050
where do you think it's all headed
do you ever think about where

546
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,060
do you ever think about where
 

547
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,090
do you ever think about where
try to visualize the entirety of The

548
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,100
try to visualize the entirety of The
 

549
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,730
try to visualize the entirety of The
evolutionary system and see if there's

550
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:43,740
evolutionary system and see if there's
 

551
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,509
evolutionary system and see if there's
an arrow to it and a destination to it

552
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
an arrow to it and a destination to it
 

553
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,490
an arrow to it and a destination to it
so the best way to understand the future

554
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:49,500
so the best way to understand the future
 

555
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,769
so the best way to understand the future
is to look at the past if you look at

556
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:51,779
is to look at the past if you look at
 

557
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:53,569
is to look at the past if you look at
the trajectory then you can kind of

558
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:53,579
the trajectory then you can kind of
 

559
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,490
the trajectory then you can kind of
learn something about the direction

560
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:55,500
learn something about the direction
 

561
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,710
learn something about the direction
which we're heading and if you look at

562
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:57,720
which we're heading and if you look at
 

563
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,030
which we're heading and if you look at
the trajectory of life on Earth it's

564
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
the trajectory of life on Earth it's
 

565
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,430
the trajectory of life on Earth it's
really about information processing so

566
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
really about information processing so
 

567
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,190
really about information processing so
the the concept of the senses evolving

568
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:04,200
the the concept of the senses evolving
 

569
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,990
the the concept of the senses evolving
one after the other uh you know being

570
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
one after the other uh you know being
 

571
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,509
one after the other uh you know being
like bacteria are able to do chemotaxis

572
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:08,519
like bacteria are able to do chemotaxis
 

573
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,329
like bacteria are able to do chemotaxis
basically means moving towards a

574
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:11,339
basically means moving towards a
 

575
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,430
basically means moving towards a
chemical gradient and that's the first

576
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
chemical gradient and that's the first
 

577
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,750
chemical gradient and that's the first
thing that you need to sort of hunt down

578
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:14,760
thing that you need to sort of hunt down
 

579
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,449
thing that you need to sort of hunt down
food the next step after that is being

580
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:17,459
food the next step after that is being
 

581
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,750
food the next step after that is being
able to actually perceive light so all

582
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:20,760
able to actually perceive light so all
 

583
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,090
able to actually perceive light so all
life on this planet and all life that we

584
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,100
life on this planet and all life that we
 

585
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,250
life on this planet and all life that we
know about evolved on this rotating Rock

586
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:25,260
know about evolved on this rotating Rock
 

587
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,550

every 24 hours you get sunlight and dark

588
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
every 24 hours you get sunlight and dark
 

589
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,550
every 24 hours you get sunlight and dark
sunlight and dark and light is a source

590
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:31,560
sunlight and dark and light is a source
 

591
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,050
sunlight and dark and light is a source
of energy light is also information

592
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,060
of energy light is also information
 

593
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,690
of energy light is also information
about where is up light is all kinds of

594
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:35,700
about where is up light is all kinds of
 

595
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,790
about where is up light is all kinds of
you know things so you can you can

596
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:37,800
you know things so you can you can
 

597
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,829
you know things so you can you can
basically now start perceiving light

598
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:39,839
basically now start perceiving light
 

599
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,550
basically now start perceiving light
and then perceiving shapes Beyond just

600
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,560
and then perceiving shapes Beyond just
 

601
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,310
and then perceiving shapes Beyond just
these sort of single photoreceptor you

602
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
these sort of single photoreceptor you
 

603
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,650
these sort of single photoreceptor you
can now have complex eyes or multiple

604
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:48,660
can now have complex eyes or multiple
 

605
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,110
can now have complex eyes or multiple
eyes and then start perceiving motion or

606
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
eyes and then start perceiving motion or
 

607
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,730
eyes and then start perceiving motion or
perceiving Direction perceiving shapes

608
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:52,740
perceiving Direction perceiving shapes
 

609
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,210
perceiving Direction perceiving shapes
and then you start building

610
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,220
and then you start building
 

611
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,410
and then you start building
infrastructure on the cognitive

612
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:57,420
infrastructure on the cognitive
 

613
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,569
infrastructure on the cognitive
apparatus to start processing this

614
00:11:59,569 --> 00:11:59,579
apparatus to start processing this
 

615
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,550
apparatus to start processing this
information and making sense of the

616
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:01,560
information and making sense of the
 

617
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,290
information and making sense of the
environment building more complex models

618
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:03,300
environment building more complex models
 

619
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,090
environment building more complex models
of the environment so if you look at

620
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,100
of the environment so if you look at
 

621
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,610
of the environment so if you look at
that trajectory of evolution what we're

622
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:07,620
that trajectory of evolution what we're
 

623
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,490
that trajectory of evolution what we're
experiencing now and humans are

624
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:10,500
experiencing now and humans are
 

625
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,590
experiencing now and humans are
basically according to this sort of

626
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:12,600
basically according to this sort of
 

627
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,009
basically according to this sort of
information theoretic view of evolution

628
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:15,019
information theoretic view of evolution
 

629
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:16,970
information theoretic view of evolution
humans are basically the next natural

630
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:16,980
humans are basically the next natural
 

631
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,850
humans are basically the next natural
step and it's perhaps no surprise that

632
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:19,860
step and it's perhaps no surprise that
 

633
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,530
step and it's perhaps no surprise that
we became the dominant species of the

634
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:21,540
we became the dominant species of the
 

635
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,210
we became the dominant species of the
planet because yes there's so many

636
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,220
planet because yes there's so many
 

637
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,009
planet because yes there's so many
dimensions in which some animals are way

638
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:25,019
dimensions in which some animals are way
 

639
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,810
dimensions in which some animals are way
better than we are but at least on the

640
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:26,820
better than we are but at least on the
 

641
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,310
better than we are but at least on the
cognitive Dimension we're just simply

642
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
cognitive Dimension we're just simply
 

643
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,590
cognitive Dimension we're just simply
unsurpassed on this planet and and

644
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:30,600
unsurpassed on this planet and and
 

645
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,069
unsurpassed on this planet and and
perhaps the universe but the the concept

646
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079

simply wanting the same type of brains

simply wanting the same type of brains

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,730
simply wanting the same type of brains
that you know carry out

specific ways of thinking we can like
 

921
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,430
specific ways of thinking we can like
instead of just always only wanting say

instead of just always only wanting say

the mathematically extraordinary to go
 

925
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,830
the mathematically extraordinary to go
to the same universities what you could

926
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:18,840
to the same universities what you could
 

927
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,570
to the same universities what you could
see simply say is like who needs that

928
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:20,580
see simply say is like who needs that
 

929
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,510
see simply say is like who needs that
anymore you know we now have ai maybe

930
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
anymore you know we now have ai maybe
 

931
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,070
anymore you know we now have ai maybe
what we should really be thinking about

932
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,080
what we should really be thinking about
 

933
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,490
what we should really be thinking about
is the diversity and the power that

934
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:28,500
is the diversity and the power that
 

935
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,430
is the diversity and the power that
comes with the diversity where AI can do

936
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
comes with the diversity where AI can do
 

937
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,490
comes with the diversity where AI can do
the math and then we should be getting a

938
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:34,500
the math and then we should be getting a
 

939
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,870
the math and then we should be getting a
bunch of humans that sort of think

940
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:35,880
bunch of humans that sort of think
 

941
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,190
bunch of humans that sort of think
extremely differently from each other

942
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
extremely differently from each other
 

943
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,470
extremely differently from each other
and maybe that's the true cradle of

944
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:39,480
and maybe that's the true cradle of
 

945
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,730
and maybe that's the true cradle of
innovation

946
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:40,740
innovation
 

947
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,350
innovation
but

948
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:42,360
but
 

949
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,409
but
AI can also these large language models

950
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:45,419
AI can also these large language models
 

951
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,470
AI can also these large language models
can also be with just a few prompts

952
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:47,480
can also be with just a few prompts
 

953
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,810
can also be with just a few prompts
essentially fine-tuned to be diverse

954
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:50,820
essentially fine-tuned to be diverse
 

955
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,610
essentially fine-tuned to be diverse
from the center

956
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:52,620
from the center
 

957
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,529
from the center
so the prompts can really take you away

958
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:54,539
so the prompts can really take you away
 

959
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,210
so the prompts can really take you away
into unique territory you can ask the

960
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:56,220
into unique territory you can ask the
 

961
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,130
into unique territory you can ask the
model to act

962
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:58,140
model to act
 

963
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,870
model to act
in a certain way and it will start to

964
00:18:59,870 --> 00:18:59,880
in a certain way and it will start to
 

965
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,169
in a certain way and it will start to
act in that way is that possible that uh

966
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:03,179
act in that way is that possible that uh
 

967
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,450
act in that way is that possible that uh
the language models could also have some

968
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:05,460
the language models could also have some
 

969
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,610
the language models could also have some
of the magical diversity that makes us

970
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:07,620
of the magical diversity that makes us
 

971
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,669
of the magical diversity that makes us
so damn interesting so I would say

972
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:10,679
so damn interesting so I would say
 

973
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:12,230
so damn interesting so I would say
humans are the same way so basically

974
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,240
humans are the same way so basically
 

975
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,090
humans are the same way so basically
when you when you sort of prompt humans

976
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,100
when you when you sort of prompt humans
 

977
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,610
when you when you sort of prompt humans
to basically you know you know give an

978
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:16,620
to basically you know you know give an
 

979
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,930
to basically you know you know give an
environment to act a particular way

980
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:19,940
environment to act a particular way
 

981
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,330
environment to act a particular way
they change their own behaviors and

982
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:23,340
they change their own behaviors and
 

983
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,150
they change their own behaviors and
um you know the old saying is show me

984
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
um you know the old saying is show me
 

985
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,289
um you know the old saying is show me
your friends and I'll tell you who you

986
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:27,299
your friends and I'll tell you who you
 

987
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,970
your friends and I'll tell you who you
are

988
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:28,980
are
 

989
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,430
are
more like show me your friends and I'll

990
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
more like show me your friends and I'll
 

991
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,590
more like show me your friends and I'll
tell you who you'll become so it's not

992
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600
tell you who you'll become so it's not
 

993
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,850
tell you who you'll become so it's not
necessarily that you choose friends that

994
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:34,860
necessarily that you choose friends that
 

995
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,130
necessarily that you choose friends that
are like you but I mean that's the first

996
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,140
are like you but I mean that's the first
 

997
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,049
are like you but I mean that's the first
step but then the second step is that

998
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:39,059
step but then the second step is that
 

999
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,730
step but then the second step is that
you know the kind of behaviors that you

1000
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:40,740
you know the kind of behaviors that you
 

1001
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,490
you know the kind of behaviors that you
find normal in your circles are the

1002
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:43,500
find normal in your circles are the
 

1003
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,169
find normal in your circles are the
behaviors that you'll start espousing

1004
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:45,179
behaviors that you'll start espousing
 

1005
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,650
behaviors that you'll start espousing
and that type of meta Evolution where

1006
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:48,660
and that type of meta Evolution where
 

1007
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,710
and that type of meta Evolution where
every action we take not only shapes our

actions by shaping the environment in
 

1015
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,350
actions by shaping the environment in
which those future actions will be taken

right you can very aggressively change
in a way that's stable and convincing

in a way that's stable and convincing
you really transform

1072
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,360
you really transform
 

1073
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,230
you really transform
through a couple of prompts the behavior

1074

Chachi PT yeah I would tell my students

1082
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
Chachi PT yeah I would tell my students
 

1083
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,690
Chachi PT yeah I would tell my students
just ask you know what would Manali say

1084
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:23,700
just ask you know what would Manali say
 

1085
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,789
just ask you know what would Manali say
right now and you you guys all have a

1086
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:25,799
right now and you you guys all have a
 

1087
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,470
right now and you you guys all have a
pretty good emulator of me right now yes

1088
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:27,480
pretty good emulator of me right now yes
 

1089
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,270
pretty good emulator of me right now yes
and uh I don't know if you know the

1090
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
and uh I don't know if you know the
 

1091
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,190
and uh I don't know if you know the

1095
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,390

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,010
the rubber duckling that's just sitting
there exactly what you did with your

there exactly what you did with your

00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,310
there exactly what you did with your

code and why you have a bug and just by
 

1101
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,350

the act of explaining you'll kind of

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,360
the act of explaining you'll kind of

figure it out yes I woke up one morning
 

1105
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,390
figure it out yes I woke up one morning
from a dream where I was giving a

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:47,400
from a dream where I was giving a
 

1107
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,789
from a dream where I was giving a
lecture in this Amphitheater and one of

1108
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:49,799
lecture in this Amphitheater and one of
 

1109
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,130
lecture in this Amphitheater and one of
my friends was basically giving me some

1110
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,140
my friends was basically giving me some
 

1111
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,770
my friends was basically giving me some
deep evolutionary Insight on how cancer

1112
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:54,780
deep evolutionary Insight on how cancer
 

1113
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,590
deep evolutionary Insight on how cancer
genomes and cancer cells evolve and I

1114
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
genomes and cancer cells evolve and I
 

1115
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,470
genomes and cancer cells evolve and I
woke up with a very elaborate discussion

1116
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:00,480
woke up with a very elaborate discussion
 

1117
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,510
woke up with a very elaborate discussion
that I was giving and a very elaborate

1118
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:02,520
that I was giving and a very elaborate
 

1119
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,090
that I was giving and a very elaborate
set of insights that he had

1120
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,100
set of insights that he had
 

1121
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,310
set of insights that he had
that I was projecting onto my friend in

1122
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:07,320
that I was projecting onto my friend in
 

1123
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,289
that I was projecting onto my friend in
my sleep and obviously this was my dream

1124
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:09,299
my sleep and obviously this was my dream
 

1125
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,110
my sleep and obviously this was my dream
so my own neurons were capable of doing

1126
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,120
so my own neurons were capable of doing
 

1127
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,630
so my own neurons were capable of doing
that but they only did that Under The

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:14,640
that but they only did that Under The

you are a professor in cancer genomics
 

1133
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,850
you are a professor in cancer genomics
you're an expert in that field what do

1134
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:22,860
you're an expert in that field what do
 

1135
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,669
you're an expert in that field what do
you say so I feel that we all have that

1136
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
you say so I feel that we all have that
 

1137
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,649
you say so I feel that we all have that
inside us that we have that capability

1138
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:27,659
inside us that we have that capability
 

1139
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,049
inside us that we have that capability
of basically saying I don't know what

1140
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:30,059
of basically saying I don't know what
 

1141
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,970
of basically saying I don't know what
the right thing is but let me ask my

1142
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:31,980
the right thing is but let me ask my
 

1143
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,190
the right thing is but let me ask my
virtual legs what would you do and

1144
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,200
virtual legs what would you do and
 

1145
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,770
virtual legs what would you do and
virtual X would say be kind I'm like oh

1146
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:36,780
virtual X would say be kind I'm like oh
 

1147
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,029
virtual X would say be kind I'm like oh
yes

1148
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:38,039
yes
 

1149
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,669
yes
or something like that and even though I

1150
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:40,679
or something like that and even though I
 

1151
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,230
or something like that and even though I
myself might not be able to do it

1152
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
myself might not be able to do it
 

1153
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,850
myself might not be able to do it
unprompted

1154
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:43,860
unprompted
 

1155
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,610
unprompted
and uh the my favorite prompt is think

1156
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:46,620
and uh the my favorite prompt is think
 

1157
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,830
and uh the my favorite prompt is think
step by step and I'm like you know this

1158
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:48,840
step by step and I'm like you know this
 

1159
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,590
step by step and I'm like you know this
also works on my 10 year old

1160
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:50,600
also works on my 10 year old
 

1161
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,690
also works on my 10 year old
when he tries to solve a math equation

1162
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:53,700
when he tries to solve a math equation
 

1163
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,970
when he tries to solve a math equation
all in one step I know exactly what

1164
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:55,980
all in one step I know exactly what
 

1165
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,070
all in one step I know exactly what
mistake you'll make but if I prompt it

1166
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
mistake you'll make but if I prompt it
 

1167
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,770
mistake you'll make but if I prompt it
with oh please think step by step then

1168
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:00,780
with oh please think step by step then
 

1169
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,810
with oh please think step by step then
you sort of gets in a mindset and I

1170
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:02,820
you sort of gets in a mindset and I
 

1171
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,310
you sort of gets in a mindset and I
think it's also part of the way that

1172
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
think it's also part of the way that
 

1173
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,470
think it's also part of the way that
Chachi PT was actually trained this

1174
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
Chachi PT was actually trained this
 

1175
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,970
Chachi PT was actually trained this
whole sort of human in the loop

1176
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:07,980
whole sort of human in the loop
 

1177
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,690
whole sort of human in the loop
reinforcement learning

1178
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:10,700
reinforcement learning
 

1179
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,250
reinforcement learning
has probably reinforced these types of

1180
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:13,260
has probably reinforced these types of
 

1181
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,210
has probably reinforced these types of
behaviors whereby having this feedback

1182
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,220
behaviors whereby having this feedback
 

1183
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,590
behaviors whereby having this feedback
loop you kind of aligned AI better to

1184
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
loop you kind of aligned AI better to
 

1185
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,450
loop you kind of aligned AI better to
the prompting opportunities by humans

1186
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:23,460
the prompting opportunities by humans
 

1187
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,430
the prompting opportunities by humans
yeah prompting human like reasoning

1188
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
yeah prompting human like reasoning
 

1189
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,470
yeah prompting human like reasoning
steps the step-by-step kind of thinking

1190
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:27,480
steps the step-by-step kind of thinking
 

1191
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,890
steps the step-by-step kind of thinking
yeah it does seem to be I suppose it

1192
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:30,900
yeah it does seem to be I suppose it
 

1193
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,570
yeah it does seem to be I suppose it
just puts a mirror to our own

1194
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:32,580
just puts a mirror to our own
 

1195
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,029
just puts a mirror to our own
capabilities and so we can be truly

1196
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039
capabilities and so we can be truly
 

1197
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,549
capabilities and so we can be truly
impressed by our own cognitive

1198
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:37,559
impressed by our own cognitive
 

1199
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,770
impressed by our own cognitive
capabilities because the variety of what

1200
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:39,780
capabilities because the variety of what
 

1201
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,350
capabilities because the variety of what
you can try because we don't usually

1202
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,360
you can try because we don't usually
 

1203
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,110
you can try because we don't usually
have this kind of we can't play with our

1204
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
have this kind of we can't play with our
 

1205
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,250
have this kind of we can't play with our
own mind

1206
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,260
own mind
 

1207
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,010
own mind
rigorously

1208
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,020
rigorously
 

1209
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,350
rigorously
through python code right yeah so this

1210
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:51,360
through python code right yeah so this
 

1211
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,470
through python code right yeah so this
allows us to really play with

1212
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:54,480
allows us to really play with
 

1213
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,350
allows us to really play with
um all all of human wisdom and knowledge

1214
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
um all all of human wisdom and knowledge
 

1215
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,090
um all all of human wisdom and knowledge
or at least knowledge at our fingertips

1216
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,100
or at least knowledge at our fingertips
 

1217
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,130
or at least knowledge at our fingertips
and then mess with that little mind that

1218
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,140
and then mess with that little mind that
 

1219
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,230
and then mess with that little mind that
can think and speak in all kinds of ways

1220
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:03,240
can think and speak in all kinds of ways
 

1221
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,390
can think and speak in all kinds of ways
what's unique is that as I mentioned

1222
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:05,400
what's unique is that as I mentioned
 

1223
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,430
what's unique is that as I mentioned
earlier every one of us was trained by

1224
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
earlier every one of us was trained by
 

1225
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,970
earlier every one of us was trained by
different subset of human culture

1226
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:10,980
different subset of human culture
 

1227
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,909
different subset of human culture
and Chachi PT was trained on all of it

1228
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:13,919
and Chachi PT was trained on all of it
 

1229
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,909
and Chachi PT was trained on all of it
yeah and the difference there is that it

1230
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:16,919
yeah and the difference there is that it
 

1231
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:19,130
yeah and the difference there is that it
probably has the ability to emulate

1232
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,140
probably has the ability to emulate
 

1233
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,710
probably has the ability to emulate
almost any every one of us yeah the fact

1234
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:21,720
almost any every one of us yeah the fact
 

1235
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,870
almost any every one of us yeah the fact
that you can figure out where that is in

1236
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:23,880
that you can figure out where that is in
 

1237
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,270
that you can figure out where that is in
cognitive behavioral space just by a few

1238
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:26,280
cognitive behavioral space just by a few
 

1239
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,490
cognitive behavioral space just by a few
prompts it's pretty impressive but the

1240
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:28,500
prompts it's pretty impressive but the
 

1241
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,850
prompts it's pretty impressive but the
fact that that exists somewhere is you

1242
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:31,860
fact that that exists somewhere is you
 

1243
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,090
fact that that exists somewhere is you
know absolutely beautiful and

1244
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,100
know absolutely beautiful and
 

1245
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,570
know absolutely beautiful and
the fact that it's encoded in an

1246
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:38,580
the fact that it's encoded in an
 

1247
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,430
the fact that it's encoded in an
orthogonal way from the knowledge I

1248
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:40,440
orthogonal way from the knowledge I
 

1249
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,529
orthogonal way from the knowledge I
think is also beautiful the fact that

1250
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:42,539
think is also beautiful the fact that
 

1251
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,289
think is also beautiful the fact that
somehow through these extreme

1252

somehow through these extreme
 

1253
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:47,330
somehow through these extreme
overparameterization of AI models it was

1254
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:47,340
overparameterization of AI models it was
 

1255
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,630
overparameterization of AI models it was
able to somehow figure out that context

1256
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:49,640
able to somehow figure out that context
 

1257
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,930
able to somehow figure out that context
knowledge and form are separable and

knowledge and form are separable and
 

1259
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,330
knowledge and form are separable and
that you can sort of describe scientific

1260
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:56,340
that you can sort of describe scientific
 

1261
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,490
that you can sort of describe scientific

don't know Shakespeare or something that

1264
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:00,840
don't know Shakespeare or something that
 

1265
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,870
don't know Shakespeare or something that
tells you something about the um the

1266
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
tells you something about the um the
 

1267
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,810
tells you something about the um the
decoupling and the decouplerability of

1268
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:05,820
decoupling and the decouplerability of

these types of aspects of human psyche
 

1271
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,970
these types of aspects of human psyche
and that's part of the science of this

1272
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:10,980
and that's part of the science of this
 

1273
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,710
and that's part of the science of this
whole thing so these large language

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,720
whole thing so these large language
 

1275
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,049
whole thing so these large language
models are you know days old

1276
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:15,059

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:17,640
in terms of this kind of leap that
 

1279
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,310
in terms of this kind of leap that
they've taken and it'll be interesting

1280
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,320
they've taken and it'll be interesting
 

1281
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,169
they've taken and it'll be interesting
to do this kind of analysis on them of

1282
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:21,179
to do this kind of analysis on them of
 

1283
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,270
to do this kind of analysis on them of

form and knowledge where exactly does
 

1287
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,470
form and knowledge where exactly does
that happen yeah there's already sort of

1288
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:27,480

1289
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,210
that happen yeah there's already sort of
initial investigations but it's very

initial investigations but it's very
 

1291
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,970
initial investigations but it's very
hard to figure out where is there a

hard to figure out where is there a
 

1293
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,490
hard to figure out where is there a
particular uh parameter set of

that they're looking at so we can look
 

1317
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,250
that they're looking at so we can look
at activation features and basically see

1318
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:01,260
at activation features and basically see
 

1319
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,210

it's perhaps a little more complicated

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,549
it's perhaps a little more complicated

00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,260
particular way now and the fact that
 

1449
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,289
particular way now and the fact that
humans have infected words for

1450
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:30,299
humans have infected words for
 

1451
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,350
humans have infected words for
encapsulating these types of behaviors

1452
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:32,360
encapsulating these types of behaviors
 

1453
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,029
encapsulating these types of behaviors
and it's hard to know how much of that

1454
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:35,039
and it's hard to know how much of that
 

1455
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,490
and it's hard to know how much of that
is innate and how much of that was like

1456
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:37,500
is innate and how much of that was like
 

1457
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,529
is innate and how much of that was like
passed on from language to language

1458
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:39,539
passed on from language to language
 

1459
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:40,789
passed on from language to language
but basically if you look at the

1460
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:40,799
but basically if you look at the
 

1461
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,169
but basically if you look at the
evolution of language you can kind of

1462
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:42,179
evolution of language you can kind of
 

1463
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,590
evolution of language you can kind of
see how young are these words in the

1464
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:45,600
see how young are these words in the
 

1465
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,990
see how young are these words in the
history of language Evolution that

1466
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000
history of language Evolution that
 

1467
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,690
history of language Evolution that
describe these types of behaviors like

1468
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:50,700
describe these types of behaviors like
 

1469
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,510
describe these types of behaviors like
you know kindness and anger and jealousy

1470
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,520
you know kindness and anger and jealousy
 

1471
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,350
you know kindness and anger and jealousy
Etc

1472
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:54,360
Etc
 

1473
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,450
Etc
if these words are very similar from

1474
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:56,460
if these words are very similar from
 

1475
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,070
if these words are very similar from
language to language it might suggest

1476
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
language to language it might suggest
 

1477
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,210
language to language it might suggest
that they're very ancient if they're

1478
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:02,220
that they're very ancient if they're
 

1479
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,250
that they're very ancient if they're
very different it might suggest that

1480
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,260
very different it might suggest that
 

1481
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,870
very different it might suggest that
this concept may have emerged

1482
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:05,880
this concept may have emerged
 

1483
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,630
this concept may have emerged
independently in each different language

1484
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
independently in each different language
 

1485
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,169
independently in each different language
and so forth so

1486
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:12,179
and so forth so
 

1487
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,890
and so forth so
looking at the phylogeny the history The

1488
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:15,900
looking at the phylogeny the history The
 

1489
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,830
looking at the phylogeny the history The
evolutionary traces of language at the

1490
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:18,840
evolutionary traces of language at the
 

1491
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,010
evolutionary traces of language at the
same time as people moving around that

1492
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:22,020
same time as people moving around that
 

1493
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,889
same time as people moving around that
we can now Trace thanks to genetics

1494
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:24,899
we can now Trace thanks to genetics
 

1495
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,769
we can now Trace thanks to genetics
is a fascinating way of understanding

1496
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:27,779
is a fascinating way of understanding
 

1497
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,990
is a fascinating way of understanding
the human psyche and also understanding

1498
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,000
the human psyche and also understanding
 

1499
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,090
the human psyche and also understanding
sort of how these types of behaviors

1500
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,100
sort of how these types of behaviors
 

1501
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,110
sort of how these types of behaviors
emerge

1502
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
emerge
 

1503
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,570
emerge
and to go back to your idea about

1504
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:35,580
and to go back to your idea about
 

1505
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,090
and to go back to your idea about
sort of exploring the system unfiltered

1506
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:41,100
sort of exploring the system unfiltered
 

1507
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,130
sort of exploring the system unfiltered
I mean in a ways the psychiatric

1508
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:43,140
I mean in a ways the psychiatric
 

1509
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,810
I mean in a ways the psychiatric
hospitals are filled of those be full of

1510
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:44,820
hospitals are filled of those be full of
 

1511
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,909
hospitals are filled of those be full of
those people so basically people whose

1512
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:46,919
those people so basically people whose
 

1513
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,029
those people so basically people whose
mind is uncontrollable yes who have kind

1514
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:50,039
mind is uncontrollable yes who have kind
 

1515
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,850
mind is uncontrollable yes who have kind
of gone adrift in specific locations of

1516
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:52,860
of gone adrift in specific locations of
 

1517
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:56,870
of gone adrift in specific locations of
their psyche and I I do find this

1518
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:56,880
their psyche and I I do find this
 

1519
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,149
their psyche and I I do find this
fascinating basically

1520
00:29:59,149 --> 00:29:59,159
fascinating basically
 

1521
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,389
fascinating basically
you know watching movies that are trying

1522
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:02,399
you know watching movies that are trying
 

1523
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,909
you know watching movies that are trying
to capture the essence of troubled minds

1524
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:04,919
to capture the essence of troubled minds
 

1525
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,049
to capture the essence of troubled minds
I think is teaching us so much about our

1526
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:09,059
I think is teaching us so much about our
 

1527
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,990
I think is teaching us so much about our
everyday selves because many of us are

1528
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,000
everyday selves because many of us are
 

1529
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,730
everyday selves because many of us are
able to sort of control our minds and

1530
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:13,740
able to sort of control our minds and
 

1531
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,190
able to sort of control our minds and
are able to have somehow somehow hide

1532
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,200
are able to have somehow somehow hide
 

1533
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,950
are able to have somehow somehow hide
these emotions and

1534
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
these emotions and
 

1535
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,930
these emotions and
but every time I see somebody who's

1536
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:20,940
but every time I see somebody who's
 

1537
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,409
but every time I see somebody who's
troubled I I see versions of myself

1538
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:23,419
troubled I I see versions of myself
 

1539
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:26,630
troubled I I see versions of myself
maybe not as extreme but I can sort of

1540
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,640
maybe not as extreme but I can sort of
 

1541
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,049
maybe not as extreme but I can sort of
empathize with these behaviors and

1542
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:30,059
empathize with these behaviors and
 

1543
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:31,850
empathize with these behaviors and
you know I see bipolar I see

1544
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:31,860
you know I see bipolar I see
 

1545
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,769
you know I see bipolar I see
schizophrenia I see depression I see

1546
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:33,779
schizophrenia I see depression I see
 

1547
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,870
schizophrenia I see depression I see
autism I see so many different aspects

1548
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:35,880
autism I see so many different aspects
 

1549
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,149
autism I see so many different aspects
that we kind of have names for and

1550
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
that we kind of have names for and
 

1551
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,510
that we kind of have names for and
crystallize in specific individuals

crystallize in specific individuals
 

1553
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,610
crystallize in specific individuals
and I think all of us have that all of

1554
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:43,620
and I think all of us have that all of
 

1555
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,769
and I think all of us have that all of
us have sort of just this

1556
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:45,779
us have sort of just this
 

1557
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:49,430
us have sort of just this
multi-dimensional brain and genetic

environmental behaviors that are

1566
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:57,960
environmental behaviors that are
 

1567
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,289
environmental behaviors that are
reinforced by the kind of friends that

1568
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:00,299
reinforced by the kind of friends that
 

1569
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:03,049
reinforced by the kind of friends that
we chose or friends that we were stuck

we chose or friends that we were stuck
 

1571
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,149
we chose or friends that we were stuck

with because of the environments that we
grew up in so in a way a lot of these

grew up in so in a way a lot of these

because they haven't been exposed to
 

1593
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,889
because they haven't been exposed to
those environments basically or

those environments basically or
 

1595
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:33,169
those environments basically or
something about the mechanism of

00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:33,179
something about the mechanism of

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:34,310
something about the mechanism of

feedback didn't quite work for them so

1600
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:36,600
feedback didn't quite work for them so
 

1601
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,730
feedback didn't quite work for them so
it's fascinating to think about that's

1602
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:37,740
it's fascinating to think about that's
 

1603
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,549
it's fascinating to think about that's
what we do we have this capacity to have

00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
what we do we have this capacity to have
 

1605
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,529
what we do we have this capacity to have
all these

1606
00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:41,539
all these
 

1607
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:45,230
all these

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,930
psychiatric or behaviors associated with
psychiatric disorders but we through the

1610
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:47,940
psychiatric disorders but we through the
 

1611
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,090
psychiatric disorders but we through the
alignment process as we go through their

1612
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,100
alignment process as we go through their
 

1613
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,149
alignment process as we go through their
parents we kind of we know to suppress

1614
00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:53,159
parents we kind of we know to suppress
 

1615
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,830
parents we kind of we know to suppress
them yeah we know the kind of control

1616
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:54,840
them yeah we know the kind of control
 

1617
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,590
them yeah we know the kind of control
every human that grows up in this in

1618
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
every human that grows up in this in
 

1619
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,250
every human that grows up in this in
this world spends several decades being

1620
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:01,260
this world spends several decades being
 

1621
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,909
this world spends several decades being
shaped into place yeah and without that

1622
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:03,919
shaped into place yeah and without that
 

1623
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,930
shaped into place yeah and without that
you know maybe we would have the

1624
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:05,940
you know maybe we would have the
 

1625
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,450
you know maybe we would have the
unfiltered lgbt4

1626
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:08,460
unfiltered lgbt4
 

1627
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,690
unfiltered lgbt4
every baby is basically a raging

1628
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:11,700
every baby is basically a raging
 

1629
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,310
every baby is basically a raging
narcissist

1630
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,320
narcissist
 

1631
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,049
narcissist
not all of them not all of them believe

1632
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:15,059
not all of them not all of them believe
 

1633
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,830
not all of them not all of them believe
it or not it's it's remarkable like I I

1634
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:18,840
it or not it's it's remarkable like I I
 

1635
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,690
it or not it's it's remarkable like I I
remember like watching my kids grow up

1636
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:20,700
remember like watching my kids grow up
 

1637
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,549
remember like watching my kids grow up
and again like yes part of their

1638
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:22,559
and again like yes part of their
 

1639
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,590
and again like yes part of their
personality stays the same but also in

1640
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:24,600
personality stays the same but also in
 

1641
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,450
personality stays the same but also in
different phases to their life they've

1642
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:26,460
different phases to their life they've
 

1643
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,649
different phases to their life they've
gone through these dramatically

1644
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:27,659
gone through these dramatically
 

1645
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,769
gone through these dramatically
different types of behaviors and you

1646
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:30,779
different types of behaviors and you
 

1647
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,810
different types of behaviors and you
know my daughter basically saying

1648
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:32,820
know my daughter basically saying
 

1649
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,090
know my daughter basically saying
you know basically one one kid saying oh

1650
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,100
you know basically one one kid saying oh
 

1651
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,409
you know basically one one kid saying oh
I want the bigger piece the other one's

1652
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:36,419
I want the bigger piece the other one's
 

1653
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:37,610
I want the bigger piece the other one's
saying oh everything must be exactly

1654
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:37,620
saying oh everything must be exactly
 

1655
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,950
saying oh everything must be exactly
equal and the third one saying I'm okay

1656
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:39,960
equal and the third one saying I'm okay
 

1657
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,110
equal and the third one saying I'm okay
yeah you know I might have to have the

1658
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,120
yeah you know I might have to have the
 

1659
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,970
yeah you know I might have to have the
smaller part don't worry about me even

1660
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:43,980
smaller part don't worry about me even
 

1661
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,710
smaller part don't worry about me even
in the early days in the early years of

1662
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:45,720
in the early days in the early years of
 

1663
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,330
in the early days in the early years of
developed yeah it's just extraordinary

1664
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:47,340
developed yeah it's just extraordinary
 

1665
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,490
developed yeah it's just extraordinary
to sort of see these dramatically

1666
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:49,500
to sort of see these dramatically
 

1667
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,269
to sort of see these dramatically
different like I mean my wife and I uh

1668
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:53,279
different like I mean my wife and I uh
 

1669
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,710
different like I mean my wife and I uh
you know are are very different from

1670
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
you know are are very different from
 

1671
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,590
you know are are very different from
each other but we also have you know six

1672
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
each other but we also have you know six
 

1673
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,930
each other but we also have you know six
million variants six million loci each

1674
00:32:59,930 --> 00:32:59,940
million variants six million loci each
 

1675
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,130
million variants six million loci each
if you wish if you just look at common

1676
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:01,140
if you wish if you just look at common
 

1677
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,630
if you wish if you just look at common
variants we also have a bunch of rare

1678
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
variants we also have a bunch of rare
 

1679
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,310
variants we also have a bunch of rare
variants that are inherited in more

1680
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
variants that are inherited in more
 

1681
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,490
variants that are inherited in more
mendelian fashion and now you have you

1682
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:07,500
mendelian fashion and now you have you
 

1683
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,289
mendelian fashion and now you have you
know an infinite positive number of

1684
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:09,299
know an infinite positive number of
 

1685
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:10,970
know an infinite positive number of
possibilities for each of the kids so

1686
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:10,980
possibilities for each of the kids so
 

1687
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,950
possibilities for each of the kids so
basically it's two to the Six Million

1688
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:12,960
basically it's two to the Six Million
 

1689
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,350
basically it's two to the Six Million
Just from the common variance and then

1690
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360
Just from the common variance and then
 

1691
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,149
Just from the common variance and then
if you like layer in the the rare

1692
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:17,159
if you like layer in the the rare
 

1693
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,190
if you like layer in the the rare
variants so let me talk a little bit

1694
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
variants so let me talk a little bit
 

1695
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,509
variants so let me talk a little bit
about common variance and rare variants

1696
00:33:20,509 --> 00:33:20,519
about common variance and rare variants
 

1697
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,810
about common variance and rare variants
so if you look at this common variance

1698
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:22,820
so if you look at this common variance
 

1699
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,250
so if you look at this common variance
they're generally weak effect because

1700
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:25,260
they're generally weak effect because
 

1701
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,289
they're generally weak effect because
selection selects against strong effect

1702
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:27,299
selection selects against strong effect
 

1703
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,110
selection selects against strong effect
variance so if something like has a big

1704
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,120
variance so if something like has a big
 

1705
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,169
variance so if something like has a big
risk for schizophrenia it won't rise to

1706
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:33,179
risk for schizophrenia it won't rise to
 

1707
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,269
risk for schizophrenia it won't rise to
high frequency so the ones that are

1708
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
high frequency so the ones that are
 

1709
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,750
high frequency so the ones that are
common are by definition by selection

1710
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
common are by definition by selection
 

1711
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,549
common are by definition by selection
only the ones that had relatively weak

1712
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
only the ones that had relatively weak
 

1713
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,710
only the ones that had relatively weak
effect and if all of the variants

1714
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,720
effect and if all of the variants
 

1715
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,149
effect and if all of the variants
associated with personality with

1716
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
associated with personality with
 

1717
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,830
associated with personality with
cognition and all aspects of human

1718
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
cognition and all aspects of human
 

1719
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,830
cognition and all aspects of human
behavior where weak effect variants then

1720
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:48,840
behavior where weak effect variants then
 

1721
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,409
behavior where weak effect variants then
kid would basically be just averages of

1722
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:51,419
kid would basically be just averages of
 

1723
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,909
kid would basically be just averages of
their parents

1724
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:52,919
their parents
 

1725
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,610
their parents
if it was like thousands of loci just by

1726
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:55,620
if it was like thousands of loci just by
 

1727
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,710
if it was like thousands of loci just by
lower of large numbers the average of

1728
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:57,720
lower of large numbers the average of
 

1729
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,049
lower of large numbers the average of
two large numbers would be you know very

1730
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:00,059
two large numbers would be you know very
 

1731
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,029
two large numbers would be you know very
robustly close to that middle

1732
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:02,039
robustly close to that middle
 

1733
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,549
robustly close to that middle
but what we see is that kids are

1734
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:04,559
but what we see is that kids are
 

1735
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,750
but what we see is that kids are
dramatically different from each other

1736
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
dramatically different from each other
 

1737
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,490
dramatically different from each other
so that basically means that in the

1738
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:07,500
so that basically means that in the
 

1739
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,129
so that basically means that in the
context of that common variation you

1740
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:10,139
context of that common variation you
 

1741
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,109
context of that common variation you
basically have rare variants that are

1742
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:12,119
basically have rare variants that are
 

1743
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,730
basically have rare variants that are
inherited in a more mendelian fashion

1744
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:13,740
inherited in a more mendelian fashion
 

1745
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,889
inherited in a more mendelian fashion
that basically then sort of govern

1746
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:15,899
that basically then sort of govern
 

1747
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,290
that basically then sort of govern
likely many different aspects of human

1748
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:18,300
likely many different aspects of human
 

1749
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,329
likely many different aspects of human
behavior human biology and human

1750
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:20,339
behavior human biology and human
 

1751
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:22,149
behavior human biology and human
psychology

1752
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:22,159
psychology
 

1753
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,750
psychology
and that's again like if you look at

1754
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:26,760
and that's again like if you look at
 

1755
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,510
and that's again like if you look at
sort of a person with schizophrenia

1756
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:28,520
sort of a person with schizophrenia
 

1757
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,129
sort of a person with schizophrenia
their identical twin

1758
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:31,139
their identical twin
 

1759
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,530
their identical twin
has only 50 chance of actually being

1760
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:33,540
has only 50 chance of actually being
 

1761
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,210
has only 50 chance of actually being
diagnosed with schizophrenia so that

1762
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:35,220
diagnosed with schizophrenia so that
 

1763
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,169
diagnosed with schizophrenia so that
basically means there's probably

1764
00:34:36,169 --> 00:34:36,179
basically means there's probably
 

1765
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,470
basically means there's probably
developmental uh exposures environmental

00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:39,480
developmental uh exposures environmental
 

1767
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,050

how do we get the ones that we get is it
just

so I'm gonna talk about regression why

1848
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:16,560
so I'm gonna talk about regression why
 

1849
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,430
so I'm gonna talk about regression why
do we call it regression and

1850
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,440
do we call it regression and
 

1851
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,050
do we call it regression and
the concept of regression to the mean

1852
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:21,060
the concept of regression to the mean
 

1853
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,950
the concept of regression to the mean
the fact that when fighter pilots in a

1854
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
the fact that when fighter pilots in a
 

1855
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,010
the fact that when fighter pilots in a
dogfight did amazingly well they would

1856
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:28,020
dogfight did amazingly well they would
 

1857
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,410
dogfight did amazingly well they would
give them rewards and then the next time

1858
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:30,420
give them rewards and then the next time
 

1859
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,109
give them rewards and then the next time
they're in dogfight they would do worse

1860
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:32,119
they're in dogfight they would do worse
 

1861
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,990
they're in dogfight they would do worse
so then you know the Navy basically

1862
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
so then you know the Navy basically
 

1863
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,329
so then you know the Navy basically
realized that wow this or at least

1864
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:38,339
realized that wow this or at least
 

1865
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:40,790
realized that wow this or at least
interpreted that as wow we're ruining

1866
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:40,800
interpreted that as wow we're ruining
 

1867
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,410
interpreted that as wow we're ruining
them by praising them and then they're

1868
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:42,420
them by praising them and then they're
 

1869
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,810
them by praising them and then they're
going to perform Wars the statistical

1870
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:44,820
going to perform Wars the statistical
 

1871
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,250
going to perform Wars the statistical
interpretation of that is regression of

1872
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:46,260
interpretation of that is regression of
 

1873
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,470
interpretation of that is regression of
the mean the fact that you're an

1874
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,480
the mean the fact that you're an
 

1875
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,690
the mean the fact that you're an
extraordinary pilot you've been trained

1876
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:50,700
extraordinary pilot you've been trained
 

1877
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,329
extraordinary pilot you've been trained
in an extraordinary fashion

1878
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:53,339
in an extraordinary fashion
 

1879
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:55,790
in an extraordinary fashion
if that pushes your mean

1880
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:55,800
if that pushes your mean
 

1881
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,829
if that pushes your mean
further and further to extraordinary

1882
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:57,839
further and further to extraordinary
 

1883
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,270
further and further to extraordinary
achievement

1884
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
achievement
 

1885
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,270
achievement
and then in some dogfights you'll just

1886
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:02,280
and then in some dogfights you'll just
 

1887
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,250
and then in some dogfights you'll just
do extraordinarily well

1888
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:04,260
do extraordinarily well
 

1889
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,050
do extraordinarily well
the probability that the next one will

1890
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:06,060
the probability that the next one will
 

1891
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,390
the probability that the next one will
be just as good is almost nil

1892
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
be just as good is almost nil
 

1893
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,890
be just as good is almost nil
because this is the peak of your

1894
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:09,900
because this is the peak of your
 

1895
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,210
because this is the peak of your
performance

1896
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:11,220
performance
 

1897
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,510
performance
and just by statistical odds the next

1898
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:14,520
and just by statistical odds the next
 

1899
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,430
and just by statistical odds the next
one will be another sample from the same

1900
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:16,440
one will be another sample from the same
 

1901
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,410
one will be another sample from the same
underlying distribution which is going

1902
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:18,420
underlying distribution which is going
 

1903
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,569
underlying distribution which is going
to be a little closer to the mean

1904
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:20,579
to be a little closer to the mean
 

1905
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,870
to be a little closer to the mean
so regression analysis takes its name

1906
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:23,880
so regression analysis takes its name
 

1907
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,630
so regression analysis takes its name
from this type of realization in the

1908
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:26,640
from this type of realization in the
 

1909
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,950
from this type of realization in the
statistical world now if you now take

1910
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
statistical world now if you now take
 

1911
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,069
statistical world now if you now take
um humans you basically have

1912
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:34,079
um humans you basically have
 

1913
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,810
um humans you basically have
people who have achieved extraordinary

1914
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:35,820
people who have achieved extraordinary
 

1915

uh Einstein for example
 

1919
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,390
uh Einstein for example
you know you would call him for example

1920
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:41,400
you know you would call him for example
 

1921
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,310
you know you would call him for example
the epitome of human intellect

1922
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:43,320
the epitome of human intellect
 

1923
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,690
the epitome of human intellect
does that mean that all of his children

1924
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:44,700
does that mean that all of his children
 

1925
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,849
does that mean that all of his children
and grandchildren will be extraordinary

geniuses
probably means that they're sampled from

1930
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:50,400
probably means that they're sampled from
 

1931
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,130
probably means that they're sampled from
the same underlying distribution

1932
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:52,140
the same underlying distribution
 

1933
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,790
the same underlying distribution
but he was probably a rare combination

1934
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800
but he was probably a rare combination
 

1935
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,530
but he was probably a rare combination
of extremes in addition to these common

1936
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:57,540
of extremes in addition to these common
 

1937
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,910
of extremes in addition to these common

1939
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,329
variants
so you can basically interpret your kids

1940
00:38:02,329 --> 00:38:02,339
so you can basically interpret your kids
 

1941
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:05,390
so you can basically interpret your kids
variation for example as well of course

1942
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:05,400
variation for example as well of course
 

1943
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,010
variation for example as well of course
they're going to be some kind of sample

1944
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,020
they're going to be some kind of sample
 

1945
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,530
they're going to be some kind of sample
from the average of the parents with

1946
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:09,540
from the average of the parents with
 

1947
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,329
from the average of the parents with
some kind of deviation according to the

1948
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:11,339
some kind of deviation according to the
 

1949
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:12,770
some kind of deviation according to the
specific combination of rare varians

1950
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:12,780
specific combination of rare varians
 

1951
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,990
specific combination of rare varians
that they have that they have inherited

1952
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,000
that they have that they have inherited
 

1953
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,069
that they have that they have inherited
so you know given all that the you know

1954
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:19,079
so you know given all that the you know
 

1955
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,109
so you know given all that the you know
the possibilities are endless as to sort

1956
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:21,119
the possibilities are endless as to sort
 

1957
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,970
the possibilities are endless as to sort
of where you should be but you should

1958
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:22,980
of where you should be but you should
 

1959
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,010
of where you should be but you should
always interpret that with well it's

1960
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,020
always interpret that with well it's
 

1961
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,370
always interpret that with well it's
probably an alignment of nature

1962
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:28,380
probably an alignment of nature
 

1963
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,770
probably an alignment of nature
and nurture and the Nature has both a

1964
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:30,780
and nurture and the Nature has both a
 

1965
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,630
and nurture and the Nature has both a
common variance that are acting kind of

1966
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:32,640
common variance that are acting kind of
 

1967
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,430
common variance that are acting kind of
like the law of large numbers and the

1968
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:34,440
like the law of large numbers and the
 

1969
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,690
like the law of large numbers and the
rare variants that are acting more in

1970
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:35,700
rare variants that are acting more in
 

1971
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,910
rare variants that are acting more in
the mendelian fashion and then you layer

1972
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:37,920
the mendelian fashion and then you layer
 

1973
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,490
the mendelian fashion and then you layer
in the nurture which again in everyday

1974
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:40,500
in the nurture which again in everyday
 

1975
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,650

action we make we shape our future

1976
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:42,660
action we make we shape our future
 

1977
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,970
action we make we shape our future

environment
 

1979
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,910

but the genetics we inherit are shaping

the future environment
 

1983
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,410
the future environment
of not only us but also our children

00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:51,420
of not only us but also our children
 

1985
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,750
of not only us but also our children
so there's this weird nature nurture

1986
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
so there's this weird nature nurture
 

1987
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,329
so there's this weird nature nurture
interplay and self-reinforcement

1988
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:56,339
interplay and self-reinforcement
 

1989
00:38:56,339 --> 00:38:58,370
interplay and self-reinforcement
where you're kind of shaping your own

1990
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:58,380
where you're kind of shaping your own
 

1991
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,230
where you're kind of shaping your own
environment but you're also shaping the

1992
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,240
environment but you're also shaping the
 

1993
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,210

environment of your kids and your kids

1994
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:02,220
environment of your kids and your kids
 

1995
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,970

1997
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,130
are going to be born in the context of
your environment that you've shaped but

1998
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:07,140
your environment that you've shaped but
 

1999
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,170
your environment that you've shaped but
also with a bag of genetic variants that

2000
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:09,180
also with a bag of genetic variants that
 

2001
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,030
also with a bag of genetic variants that
they have inherited

2002
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,040
they have inherited
 

2003
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,609
they have inherited
and there's just so much complexity

2004
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:13,619
and there's just so much complexity
 

2005
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,349
and there's just so much complexity
associated with that when we start

00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:15,359
associated with that when we start
 

2007
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,990
associated with that when we start
blaming something on nature it might

2008
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,000
blaming something on nature it might
 

2009
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,310
blaming something on nature it might
just be nurture

2010
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:19,320
just be nurture
 

2011
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,950
just be nurture
it might just be that well yes they

2012
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:21,960
it might just be that well yes they
 

2013
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,270
it might just be that well yes they
inherited the genes from the parents but

2014
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,280
inherited the genes from the parents but
 

2015
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,829
inherited the genes from the parents but
they also you know were shaped by the

2016
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:24,839
they also you know were shaped by the
 

2017
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,870
they also you know were shaped by the
same environment so it's very very hard

2018
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
same environment so it's very very hard
 

2019
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,849
same environment so it's very very hard
to untangle the two and you should also

2020
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:28,859
to untangle the two and you should also
 

2021
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:31,010
to untangle the two and you should also
always realize that nature can influence

2022
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,020
always realize that nature can influence
 

2023
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,890
always realize that nature can influence
nurture nurture can influence nature or

2024
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:33,900
nurture nurture can influence nature or
 

2025
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,089
nurture nurture can influence nature or
at least be correlated with and

2026
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:35,099
at least be correlated with and
 

2027
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,550
at least be correlated with and
predictive of and so on so forth so I

2028
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:37,560
predictive of and so on so forth so I
 

2029
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,930
predictive of and so on so forth so I
love thinking about that distribution

2030
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:38,940
love thinking about that distribution
 

2031
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,849
love thinking about that distribution
that you mentioned and here's where I

2032
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:40,859
that you mentioned and here's where I
 

2033
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:43,490
that you mentioned and here's where I
can be my usual ridiculous self

2034
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:43,500
can be my usual ridiculous self
 

2035
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,670
can be my usual ridiculous self
and uh

2036
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
and uh
 

2037
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,530
and uh
I sometimes think about that army of

2038
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:48,540
I sometimes think about that army of
 

2039
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,510
I sometimes think about that army of
sperm cells

2040
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:50,520
sperm cells
 

2041
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,550
sperm cells
however many hundreds of thousands there

2042
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:52,560
however many hundreds of thousands there
 

2043
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,329
however many hundreds of thousands there
are

2044
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:53,339
are
 

2045
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,010
are
and I kind of think of all the

2046
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:55,020
and I kind of think of all the
 

2047
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,569
and I kind of think of all the
possibilities there

2048
00:39:56,569 --> 00:39:56,579
possibilities there
 

2049
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,450
possibilities there
because there's a lot of variation and

2050
00:39:59,450 --> 00:39:59,460
because there's a lot of variation and
 

2051
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,190
because there's a lot of variation and
one gets to win

2052
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
one gets to win
 

2053
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,190
one gets to win
is that not a random one it's a totally

2054
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:04,200
is that not a random one it's a totally
 

2055
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,170
is that not a random one it's a totally
ridiculous way to think about no not at

2056
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:06,180
ridiculous way to think about no not at
 

2057
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,829
ridiculous way to think about no not at
all so I would say evolutionarily we are

2058
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:09,839
all so I would say evolutionarily we are
 

2059
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,170
all so I would say evolutionarily we are
a very slow evolving species basically

2060
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,180
a very slow evolving species basically
 

2061
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,170
a very slow evolving species basically
the generations of humans are a terrible

00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:15,180
the generations of humans are a terrible
 

2063
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,450
the generations of humans are a terrible
way to do selection what you need is

2064
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:17,460
way to do selection what you need is
 

2065
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,089
way to do selection what you need is
processes that allow you to do selection

2066
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:20,099
processes that allow you to do selection
 

2067
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:24,109
processes that allow you to do selection
in a smaller tighter Loop yeah and part

2068
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:24,119
in a smaller tighter Loop yeah and part
 

2069
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,609
in a smaller tighter Loop yeah and part
of what

2070
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:25,619
of what
 

2071
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,470
of what
if you look at our immune system for

2072
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:27,480
if you look at our immune system for
 

2073
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,370
if you look at our immune system for
example

2074
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:28,380
example
 

2075
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,010
example
it evolves at a much faster Pace than

2076
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:31,020
it evolves at a much faster Pace than
 

2077
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,950
it evolves at a much faster Pace than
humans evolve because there is actually

2078
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:33,960
humans evolve because there is actually
 

2079
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,349
humans evolve because there is actually
an evolutionary process that happens

00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:35,359
an evolutionary process that happens
 

2081
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,109
an evolutionary process that happens

within our immune cells as they're
 

2083
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,730
within our immune cells as they're
dividing there's basically vdj

dividing there's basically vdj
 

2085
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,370

recombination that basically creates

00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,010
recombination that basically creates
this extraordinary wealth of antibodies

2088
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,020
this extraordinary wealth of antibodies
 

2089
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,490
this extraordinary wealth of antibodies
and antigens against the the environment

2090
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:49,500
and antigens against the the environment
 

2091
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,770
and antigens against the the environment
and basically all these antibodies are

2092
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:51,780
and basically all these antibodies are
 

2093
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,150
and basically all these antibodies are
now recognizing of these antigens from

2094
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,160
now recognizing of these antigens from
 

2095
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,329
now recognizing of these antigens from
the environment and they

2096
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:56,339
the environment and they
 

2097
00:40:56,339 --> 00:40:59,450
the environment and they
send signals back that cause these cells

2098
00:40:59,450 --> 00:40:59,460
send signals back that cause these cells
 

2099
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,089
send signals back that cause these cells
that recognize the non-self to multiply

2100
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:02,099
that recognize the non-self to multiply
 

2101
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,069
that recognize the non-self to multiply
so that basically means that even though

2102
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
so that basically means that even though
 

2103
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,130
so that basically means that even though
viruses evolve at millions of times

2104
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:07,140
viruses evolve at millions of times
 

2105
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,050
viruses evolve at millions of times
faster than we are

00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,060
faster than we are
 

2107
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,329
faster than we are
we can still have a component of

00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:12,530
we can still have a component of
ourselves which is environmentally

00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400
proteins of any cell in the body
 

2119
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,050

and part of the thought is that this

2120
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:30,060
and part of the thought is that this
 

2121
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,349
and part of the thought is that this
might just be a way to check that the

00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:33,359
might just be a way to check that the
 

2123
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,630
might just be a way to check that the
sperm is intact in other words if you

2124
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:35,640
sperm is intact in other words if you
 

2125
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,890
sperm is intact in other words if you
waited until that human has a liver and

00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:39,900
waited until that human has a liver and
 

2127
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,950
waited until that human has a liver and
starts eating solid food and you know

basically if you waited until these

2134
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
basically if you waited until these
 

2135
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,569

mutations you know manifest late late in
 

2137
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,450

life then you would end up not failing

2138
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:56,460
life then you would end up not failing
 

2139
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,829

If instead you basically Express all of

2146
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:05,820
If instead you basically Express all of
 

2147
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,250
If instead you basically Express all of
these genes at the sperm level and if

2148
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:07,260
these genes at the sperm level and if
 

2149
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,230
these genes at the sperm level and if
they misform they basically cause the

2150
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,240
they misform they basically cause the
 

2151
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,390
they misform they basically cause the
sperm to then you have at least

2152
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:11,400
sperm to then you have at least
 

2153
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,730
sperm to then you have at least
on the male side the ability to exclude

2154
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:13,740
on the male side the ability to exclude
 

2155
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,010
on the male side the ability to exclude
some of those mutations and on the

2156
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:16,020
some of those mutations and on the
 

2157
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,650
some of those mutations and on the
female side as the egg develops

2158
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:18,660
female side as the egg develops
 

2159
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,470
female side as the egg develops
there's probably a similar uh process

2160
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:21,480
there's probably a similar uh process
 

2161
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,450
there's probably a similar uh process
where you could you could sort of weed

2162
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:23,460
where you could you could sort of weed
 

2163
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,390
where you could you could sort of weed
out eggs that are just not you know

2164
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:26,400
out eggs that are just not you know
 

2165
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,970
out eggs that are just not you know
carrying beneficial mutations or at

2166
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:28,980
carrying beneficial mutations or at
 

2167
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,990
carrying beneficial mutations or at
least that are carrying highly

2168
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,000
least that are carrying highly
 

2169
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,569
least that are carrying highly
detrimentations so you can basically

2170
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:32,579
detrimentations so you can basically
 

2171
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:35,450
detrimentations so you can basically
think of the evolutionary process in a

2172
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:35,460
think of the evolutionary process in a
 

2173
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,290
think of the evolutionary process in a
nested Loop basically where there's an

2174
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:39,300
nested Loop basically where there's an
 

2175
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,790
nested Loop basically where there's an
inner loop where you get many many more

2176
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:40,800
inner loop where you get many many more
 

2177
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,890
inner loop where you get many many more
iterations to to run and then there's an

2178
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:42,900
iterations to to run and then there's an
 

2179
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,930
iterations to to run and then there's an
outer loop that moves at a much slower

2180
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:44,940
outer loop that moves at a much slower
 

2181
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:45,950
outer loop that moves at a much slower
pace

2182
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:45,960
pace
 

2183
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,849
pace
and going back to uh uh the next step of

2184
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:49,859
and going back to uh uh the next step of
 

2185
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,690
and going back to uh uh the next step of

have an evolutionary Loop where you're
 

2211
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,790
have an evolutionary Loop where you're
kind of growing neurons on a dish and

kind of growing neurons on a dish and
you're exploring evolutionary space and

00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:32,280
with other neurons Etc you can basically
 

2223
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,890
with other neurons Etc you can basically
have a smaller evolutionary Loop that

2224

you can run thousands of times faster
 

2227
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,210
you can run thousands of times faster
than the speed it would take to evolve

2228
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:38,220
than the speed it would take to evolve
 

2229
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,970

humans for another million years so I

2230
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:40,980
humans for another million years so I
 

2231
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,130
humans for another million years so I
think it's important to think about sort

2232
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:43,140
think it's important to think about sort
 

2233
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,990
think it's important to think about sort
of this evolvability

2234
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:45,000
of this evolvability
 

2235
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,290

as a set of nested structures that allow

00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:48,300
as a set of nested structures that allow
 

2237
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,309
as a set of nested structures that allow
you to sort of test many more

2238
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:49,319
you to sort of test many more
 

2239
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,829
you to sort of test many more
combinations but in a more thick setting

2240
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
combinations but in a more thick setting
 

2241
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,270
combinations but in a more thick setting
yeah that's fascinating the the

2242
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:53,280
yeah that's fascinating the the
 

2243
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,870
yeah that's fascinating the the

00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:58,740
express proteins to create a testing
 

2247
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,109
express proteins to create a testing
ground early on

2248
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:00,119
ground early on
 

2249
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,910
ground early on
uh so that the

2250
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
uh so that the
 

2251
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,550
uh so that the
the failed designs don't make it yeah I

2252
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:04,560
the failed designs don't make it yeah I
 

2253
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,349
the failed designs don't make it yeah I
mean in design of Engineering Systems

2254
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:06,359
mean in design of Engineering Systems
 

2255
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:08,809
mean in design of Engineering Systems
fail fast is one of the principles you

2256
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:08,819
fail fast is one of the principles you
 

2257
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,270
fail fast is one of the principles you
learn like basically you assert

2258
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,280
learn like basically you assert
 

2259
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,430
learn like basically you assert
something why do you assert that because

2260
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:13,440
something why do you assert that because
 

2261
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,410
something why do you assert that because
if that something ain't right you better

2262
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:15,420
if that something ain't right you better
 

2263
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,870
if that something ain't right you better
crash now then sort of let it cross at

2264
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:17,880
crash now then sort of let it cross at
 

2265
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,370
crash now then sort of let it cross at
an unexpected time

2266
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:19,380
an unexpected time
 

2267
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,710
an unexpected time
and in a way you can think of it as like

2268
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:21,720
and in a way you can think of it as like
 

2269
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,690
and in a way you can think of it as like
20 000 assert functions assert protein

2270
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:23,700
20 000 assert functions assert protein
 

2271
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,790
20 000 assert functions assert protein
can fold assert protein can fold and if

2272
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:25,800
can fold assert protein can fold and if
 

2273
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,829
can fold assert protein can fold and if
any of them fail that's perm is gone

2274
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:27,839
any of them fail that's perm is gone
 

2275
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,930
any of them fail that's perm is gone
well I just like the fact that I'm the

2276
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:29,940
well I just like the fact that I'm the
 

2277
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,910
well I just like the fact that I'm the
winning sperm and the results of the

2278
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
winning sperm and the results of the
 

2279
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,970
winning sperm and the results of the
winner winning hashtag winning my wife

2280
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:34,980
winner winning hashtag winning my wife
 

2281
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,250
winner winning hashtag winning my wife
always plays me this French song that

2282
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:37,260
always plays me this French song that
 

2283
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,170
always plays me this French song that
actually sings about that it's like you

2284
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:39,180
actually sings about that it's like you
 

2285
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,990
actually sings about that it's like you
know remember in life we were all the

2286
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,000
know remember in life we were all the
 

2287
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,290
know remember in life we were all the
first one time

2288
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:44,300
first one time
 

2289
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,089
first one time
so these once at least one time you were

2290
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:47,099
so these once at least one time you were
 

2291
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,069
so these once at least one time you were
the first I should mention it's just a

2292
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:49,079
the first I should mention it's just a
 

2293
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:50,630
the first I should mention it's just a
brief tangent back to the place where we

2294
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,640
brief tangent back to the place where we
 

2295
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,270
brief tangent back to the place where we
came from which is the base model that I

2296
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:53,280
came from which is the base model that I
 

2297
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,370
came from which is the base model that I
mentioned for openai which is before the

2298
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:55,380
mentioned for openai which is before the
 

2299
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,870
mentioned for openai which is before the
reinforcement learning with human

2300
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:56,880
reinforcement learning with human
 

2301
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,890
reinforcement learning with human
feedback

2302
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:57,900
feedback
 

2303
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,930
feedback
and you kind of give this metaphor of it

2304
00:44:59,930 --> 00:44:59,940
and you kind of give this metaphor of it
 

2305
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,730
and you kind of give this metaphor of it
being kind of like a psychiatric

2306
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:01,740
being kind of like a psychiatric
 

2307
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,950
being kind of like a psychiatric
hospital I like that because it's

2308
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:03,960
hospital I like that because it's
 

2309
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,450
hospital I like that because it's
basically all of these different angles

2310
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:05,460
basically all of these different angles
 

2311
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,250
basically all of these different angles
at once like you basically have the more

2312
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:07,260
at once like you basically have the more
 

2313
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,490
at once like you basically have the more
extreme versions of human psyche so the

2314
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:10,500
extreme versions of human psyche so the
 

2315
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,530
extreme versions of human psyche so the
interesting thing is

2316
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:12,540
interesting thing is
 

2317
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,230
interesting thing is
well I've talked with folks in open AI

2318
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:15,240
well I've talked with folks in open AI
 

2319
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,329
well I've talked with folks in open AI
quite a lot and they say it's extremely

2320
00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:17,339
quite a lot and they say it's extremely
 

2321
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,190
quite a lot and they say it's extremely
difficult to work with that model yeah

2322
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:19,200
difficult to work with that model yeah
 

2323
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,809
difficult to work with that model yeah
kind of like it's extremely difficult to

2324
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:20,819
kind of like it's extremely difficult to
 

2325
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,550
kind of like it's extremely difficult to
work with some humans the parallels

2326
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
work with some humans the parallels
 

2327
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,530
work with some humans the parallels
there are very interesting because once

2328
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:24,540
there are very interesting because once
 

2329
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,630
there are very interesting because once
you run the alignment process it's much

2330
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:26,640
you run the alignment process it's much
 

2331
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,609
you run the alignment process it's much
easier to interact with it but it makes

2332
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:28,619
easier to interact with it but it makes
 

2333
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:31,490
easier to interact with it but it makes
you wonder what the capacity with the

2334
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:31,500
you wonder what the capacity with the
 

2335
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,410
you wonder what the capacity with the
underlying capability of the human

2336
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:33,420
underlying capability of the human
 

2337
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,290
underlying capability of the human
psychias as in the same way that what is

2338
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:36,300
psychias as in the same way that what is
 

2339
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,150
psychias as in the same way that what is
the underlying capability of a large

2340
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
the underlying capability of a large
 

2341
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,069
the underlying capability of a large
language model and remember earlier when

2342
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:40,079
language model and remember earlier when
 

2343
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,170
language model and remember earlier when
I was basically saying that

2344
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:42,180
I was basically saying that
 

2345
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,290
I was basically saying that
um part of the reason why it's so prompt

2346
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:44,300
um part of the reason why it's so prompt
 

2347
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,970
um part of the reason why it's so prompt
malleable is because of that alignment

2348
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:46,980
malleable is because of that alignment
 

2349
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,550
malleable is because of that alignment
problem that alignment work it's kind of

2350
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:49,560
problem that alignment work it's kind of
 

2351
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,950
problem that alignment work it's kind of
nice that the engineers at open AI have

2352
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:51,960
nice that the engineers at open AI have
 

2353
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,069
nice that the engineers at open AI have
the same interpretation that you know in

2354
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:55,079
the same interpretation that you know in
 

2355
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:57,829
the same interpretation that you know in
fact it is that and

2356
00:45:57,829 --> 00:45:57,839
fact it is that and
 

2357
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,870
fact it is that and
um these whole concept of easier to work

2358
00:45:59,870 --> 00:45:59,880
um these whole concept of easier to work
 

2359
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,849
um these whole concept of easier to work
with

2360
00:46:01,849 --> 00:46:01,859
with
 

2361
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,430
with
um

2362
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:03,440
um
 

2363
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,130
um
I wish that we could work with more

2364
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:07,140
I wish that we could work with more
 

2365
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,630
I wish that we could work with more
diverse humans

2366
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,640
diverse humans
 

2367
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,849
diverse humans
in a way

2368
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:10,859
in a way
 

2369
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:12,410
in a way
and and sort of that's one of the

2370
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:12,420
and and sort of that's one of the
 

2371
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,990
and and sort of that's one of the
possibilities that I see with the Advent

2372
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:15,000
possibilities that I see with the Advent
 

2373
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,290
possibilities that I see with the Advent
of these large language models the fact

2374
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:18,300
of these large language models the fact
 

2375
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,370
of these large language models the fact
that

2376
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:19,380
that
 

2377
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,370
that
it gives us the chance to both dial down

2378
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:22,380
it gives us the chance to both dial down
 

2379
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,670
it gives us the chance to both dial down
friends of ours that we can't interpret

2380
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:25,680
friends of ours that we can't interpret
 

2381
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,089
friends of ours that we can't interpret
or that are just too edgy to sort of

2382
00:46:29,089 --> 00:46:29,099
or that are just too edgy to sort of
 

2383
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,890
or that are just too edgy to sort of
really truly interact with where you

2384
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:30,900
really truly interact with where you
 

2385
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,470
really truly interact with where you
could have a real-time translator

2386
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:33,480
could have a real-time translator
 

2387
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,030
could have a real-time translator
just the same way that you can translate

2388
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
just the same way that you can translate
 

2389
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,050
just the same way that you can translate
English to Japanese or Chinese or Korean

2390
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:38,060
English to Japanese or Chinese or Korean
 

2391
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,750
English to Japanese or Chinese or Korean
by like real-time adaptation you could

2392
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:41,760
by like real-time adaptation you could
 

2393
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,790
by like real-time adaptation you could
basically suddenly have a conversation

2394
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:43,800
basically suddenly have a conversation
 

2395
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,970
basically suddenly have a conversation
with your favorite extremist on either

2396
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:46,980
with your favorite extremist on either
 

2397
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,430
with your favorite extremist on either
side of the spectrum and just dial them

2398
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
side of the spectrum and just dial them
 

2399
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,690
side of the spectrum and just dial them
down a little bit

2400
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:50,700
down a little bit
 

2401
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,349
down a little bit
of course not you and I but uh you could

2402
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:54,359
of course not you and I but uh you could
 

2403
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,930
of course not you and I but uh you could
have friends that are who's a complete

2404
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:56,940
have friends that are who's a complete
 

2405
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,710
have friends that are who's a complete
 uh but it's a different base

2406
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:00,720
uh but it's a different base
 

2407
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,329
uh but it's a different base
level so you can actually tune it down

2408
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:02,339
level so you can actually tune it down
 

2409
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:03,770
level so you can actually tune it down
to like okay they're not actually being

2410
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:03,780
to like okay they're not actually being
 

2411
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,990
to like okay they're not actually being
an there this is uh they're

2412
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:06,000
an there this is uh they're
 

2413
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,430
an there this is uh they're
actually expressing love right now it's

2414
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
actually expressing love right now it's
 

2415
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,050
actually expressing love right now it's
just that this is a they have their way

2416
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:09,060
just that this is a they have their way
 

2417
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,609
just that this is a they have their way
of of doing that and they probably live

2418
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:10,619
of of doing that and they probably live
 

2419
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,130
of of doing that and they probably live
in New York uh if we're just to pick a

2420
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:13,140
in New York uh if we're just to pick a
 

2421
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,130
in New York uh if we're just to pick a
random location so so yeah so you can

2422
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:16,140
random location so so yeah so you can
 

2423
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,109
random location so so yeah so you can
basically layer out contexts you can

2424
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:18,119
basically layer out contexts you can
 

2425
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:19,550
basically layer out contexts you can
basically say oh let me change New York

2426
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:19,560
basically say oh let me change New York
 

2427

um I also like the concept of being able
 

2435

um
listen to the information without being

00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:37,380
listen to the information without being
 

2441
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,370
listen to the information without being
dissuaded by the emotions in other words

everything humans say has an intonation

2444
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:43,880
everything humans say has an intonation
 

2445
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,430
everything humans say has an intonation
has some kind of background that they're

2446
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:46,440
has some kind of background that they're
 

2447
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,829
has some kind of background that they're
coming from it reflects the way that

coming from it reflects the way that

coming from it reflects the way that
they're thinking of you reflects the

of these things are intertwined
 

2455
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,210
of these things are intertwined
but being able to disconnect them being

2456
00:47:59,210 --> 00:47:59,220
but being able to disconnect them being
 

2457
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,950
but being able to disconnect them being
able to sort of

2458
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:00,960
able to sort of

I mean self-improvement is one of the
 

2461
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:06,650
I mean self-improvement is one of the
things that I'm constantly working on

2462
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:06,660
things that I'm constantly working on
 

2463
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,829
things that I'm constantly working on
and being able to receive criticism

2464
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:09,839
and being able to receive criticism
 

2465
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,550
and being able to receive criticism
from people who really hate you is

2466
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:13,560
from people who really hate you is
 

2467
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,650
from people who really hate you is
difficult because it's layered in with

2468
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:15,660
difficult because it's layered in with
 

2469
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,690
difficult because it's layered in with
that hatred but deep down there's

2470
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:17,700
that hatred but deep down there's
 

2471
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,250
that hatred but deep down there's
something that they say that actually

2472
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:19,260
something that they say that actually
 

2473
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,370
something that they say that actually
makes sense or people who love you might

2474
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:22,380
makes sense or people who love you might
 

2475
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,750
makes sense or people who love you might
layer it in a way that doesn't come

2476
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
layer it in a way that doesn't come
 

2477
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,609
layer it in a way that doesn't come
through but if you're able to sort of

2478
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:25,619
through but if you're able to sort of
 

2479
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:27,890
through but if you're able to sort of
Disconnect that emotional component from

2480
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:27,900
Disconnect that emotional component from
 

2481
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,710
Disconnect that emotional component from
the sort of self-improvement

2482
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
the sort of self-improvement
 

2483
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,010
the sort of self-improvement
and basically when somebody says whoa

2484
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:34,020
and basically when somebody says whoa
 

2485
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,750
and basically when somebody says whoa
that was a bunch of did you

2486
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:35,760
that was a bunch of did you
 

2487
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,609
that was a bunch of did you
ever do the control this and this and

2488
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:37,619
ever do the control this and this and
 

2489
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,490
ever do the control this and this and
that you could just say oh thanks for

2490
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:40,500
that you could just say oh thanks for
 

2491
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,589
that you could just say oh thanks for
the very interesting presentation uh you

2492
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:42,599
the very interesting presentation uh you
 

2493
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:43,670
the very interesting presentation uh you
know I'm wondering what about that

2494
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
know I'm wondering what about that
 

2495
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,530
know I'm wondering what about that
control then suddenly you're like oh

2496
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:45,540
control then suddenly you're like oh
 

2497
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,730
control then suddenly you're like oh
yeah of course I'm gonna rather control

2498
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:46,740
yeah of course I'm gonna rather control
 

2499
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,250
yeah of course I'm gonna rather control
that's a great idea yeah instead of that

2500
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:49,260
that's a great idea yeah instead of that
 

2501
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,589
that's a great idea yeah instead of that
was a bunch of BS you're like ah you're

2502
00:48:51,589 --> 00:48:51,599
was a bunch of BS you're like ah you're
 

2503
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,790
was a bunch of BS you're like ah you're
sort of hitting on the brakes and you're

2504
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:52,800
sort of hitting on the brakes and you're
 

2505
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,609
sort of hitting on the brakes and you're
trying to push back against of that so

2506
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:55,619
trying to push back against of that so
 

2507
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:58,430
trying to push back against of that so
any kind of criticism that comes after

2508
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:58,440
any kind of criticism that comes after
 

2509
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,470
any kind of criticism that comes after
that is very difficult to interpret in a

2510
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,480
that is very difficult to interpret in a
 

2511
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,809
that is very difficult to interpret in a
positive way because it helps reinforce

2512
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:02,819
positive way because it helps reinforce
 

2513
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,450
positive way because it helps reinforce
the negative assessment of your work

2514
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:04,460
the negative assessment of your work
 

2515
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,510
the negative assessment of your work
when in fact if we disconnected the

2516
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:08,520
when in fact if we disconnected the
 

2517
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:09,890
when in fact if we disconnected the
technical component from the negative

2518
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:09,900
technical component from the negative
 

2519
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,990
technical component from the negative
assessment then

2520
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,000
assessment then
 

2521
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,150
assessment then
you're embracing the negative then

2522
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,160
you're embracing the negative then
 

2523
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,710
you're embracing the negative then
you're embracing the technical component

2524
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:15,720
you're embracing the technical component
 

2525
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,569
you're embracing the technical component
you're going to fix it whereas if it's

2526
00:49:17,569 --> 00:49:17,579
you're going to fix it whereas if it's
 

2527
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,849
you're going to fix it whereas if it's
coupled with and if that thing is real

2528
00:49:19,849 --> 00:49:19,859
coupled with and if that thing is real
 

2529
00:49:19,859 --> 00:49:22,490
coupled with and if that thing is real
and I'm right about your mistake then

2530
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:22,500
and I'm right about your mistake then
 

2531
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,609
and I'm right about your mistake then
it's a it's a bunch of BS then suddenly

2532
00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:25,619
it's a it's a bunch of BS then suddenly
 

2533
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:26,750
it's a it's a bunch of BS then suddenly
you're like you're gonna try to prove

2534
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:26,760
you're like you're gonna try to prove
 

2535
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,150
you're like you're gonna try to prove
that that mistake does not exist

2536
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:29,160
that that mistake does not exist
 

2537
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,250
that that mistake does not exist
yeah it's fascinating to like carry the

2538
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:31,260
yeah it's fascinating to like carry the
 

2539
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,230
yeah it's fascinating to like carry the
information this is what you're

2540
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:33,240
information this is what you're
 

2541
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,210
information this is what you're
essentially able to do here is you carry

2542
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:35,220
essentially able to do here is you carry
 

2543
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,250
essentially able to do here is you carry
the information in the rich complexity

2544
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:37,260
the information in the rich complexity
 

2545
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,410
the information in the rich complexity
that information contains so it's not

2546
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:39,420
that information contains so it's not
 

2547
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,790
that information contains so it's not
actually dumbing it down in some way

2548
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:40,800
actually dumbing it down in some way
 

2549
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,530
actually dumbing it down in some way
exactly still expressing it but taking

2550
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:42,540
exactly still expressing it but taking
 

2551
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,230
exactly still expressing it but taking
off but you can die the the the the

2552
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:45,240
off but you can die the the the the
 

2553
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,990
off but you can die the the the the
emotional emotional side yeah which is

2554
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,000
emotional emotional side yeah which is
 

2555
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,390
emotional emotional side yeah which is
probably so powerful for the internet or

2556
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:50,400
probably so powerful for the internet or
 

2557
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,490
probably so powerful for the internet or
for social networks again when it comes

2558
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:52,500
for social networks again when it comes
 

2559
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,890
for social networks again when it comes

that contextual information and then see
 

2591
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,530
that contextual information and then see
how the information is interpreted and

2592

how the information is interpreted and
 

2593
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,410
how the information is interpreted and
you can re-hear yourself through a

and then hopefully we can sort of build
 

2603
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,890
and then hopefully we can sort of build

needed that I was uniquely capable of
delivering but the moment we have ai

2722
00:53:23,569 --> 00:53:23,579
delivering but the moment we have ai
 

2723
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:25,930
delivering but the moment we have ai
systems able to deliver

2724
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:25,940
systems able to deliver
 

2725
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,329
systems able to deliver
these goods for example writing a piece

2726
00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:29,339
these goods for example writing a piece
 

2727
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,490
these goods for example writing a piece
of software or making a self-driving car

2728
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:31,500
of software or making a self-driving car
 

2729
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,790
of software or making a self-driving car
or interpreting the human genome

2730
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:34,800
or interpreting the human genome
 

2731
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,710
or interpreting the human genome
then that frees up more of

2732
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:39,720
then that frees up more of
 

2733
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,130
then that frees up more of
human time for other Pursuits

2734
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:43,140
human time for other Pursuits
 

2735
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,530
human time for other Pursuits
this could be Pursuits that are still

2736
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:45,540
this could be Pursuits that are still
 

2737
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,510
this could be Pursuits that are still
valuable to society I could basically be

2738
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
valuable to society I could basically be
 

2739
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,309
valuable to society I could basically be
10 times more productive at interpreting

2740
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:49,319
10 times more productive at interpreting
 

2741
00:53:49,319 --> 00:53:53,710
10 times more productive at interpreting
genomes and do a lot more

2742
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:53,720
genomes and do a lot more
 

2743
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,809
genomes and do a lot more
or I could basically say oh great the

2744
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:56,819
or I could basically say oh great the
 

2745
00:53:56,819 --> 00:53:58,790
or I could basically say oh great the
interpreting genomes part of my job now

2746
00:53:58,790 --> 00:53:58,800
interpreting genomes part of my job now
 

2747
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,049
interpreting genomes part of my job now
only takes me five percent of the time

2748
00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:00,059
only takes me five percent of the time
 

2749
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:01,730
only takes me five percent of the time
instead of 60 of the time

2750
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:01,740
instead of 60 of the time
 

2751
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,609
instead of 60 of the time
so now I can do more creative things I

2752
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:04,619
so now I can do more creative things I
 

2753
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:07,130
so now I can do more creative things I
can explore not new career options but

2754
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:07,140
can explore not new career options but
 

2755
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,510
can explore not new career options but
maybe new directions from my research

2756
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:08,520
maybe new directions from my research
 

2757
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,329
maybe new directions from my research
lab I can sort of be more productive

2758
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:11,339
lab I can sort of be more productive
 

2759
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:13,190
lab I can sort of be more productive
contribute more to society

2760
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:13,200
contribute more to society
 

2761
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,910
contribute more to society
and if you look at this giant

2762
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:16,920
and if you look at this giant
 

2763
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,589
and if you look at this giant
pyramid that we have built on top of the

2764
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
pyramid that we have built on top of the
 

2765
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,410
pyramid that we have built on top of the
subsistence economy

2766
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:24,420
subsistence economy
 

2767
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,589
subsistence economy
what fraction of U.S jobs are going to

2768
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:27,599
what fraction of U.S jobs are going to
 

2769
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,930
what fraction of U.S jobs are going to
feeding all of the US less than two

2770
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:29,940
feeding all of the US less than two
 

2771
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,849
feeding all of the US less than two
percent

2772
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:31,859
percent
 

2773
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:34,190
percent
basically the the gain in productivity

2774
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:34,200
basically the the gain in productivity
 

2775
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:39,290
basically the the gain in productivity
is such that 98 of the economy is beyond

2776
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:39,300
is such that 98 of the economy is beyond
 

2777
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,930
is such that 98 of the economy is beyond
just feeding ourselves and that

2778
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:41,940
just feeding ourselves and that
 

2779
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,329
just feeding ourselves and that
basically means that

2780
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:44,339
basically means that
 

2781
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:47,170
basically means that
we kind of have built these system of

2782
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:47,180
we kind of have built these system of
 

2783
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:50,510
we kind of have built these system of
interdependencies of needed or useful or

2784
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:50,520
interdependencies of needed or useful or
 

2785
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,490
interdependencies of needed or useful or
valued Goods that sort of make the

2786
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:52,500
valued Goods that sort of make the
 

2787
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,890
valued Goods that sort of make the
economy run that the vast majority of

2788
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:54,900
economy run that the vast majority of
 

2789
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,870
economy run that the vast majority of
wealth goes to other

2790
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:56,880
wealth goes to other
 

2791
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,030
wealth goes to other
what we now call needs but used to be

2792
00:54:59,030 --> 00:54:59,040
what we now call needs but used to be
 

2793
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,609

want to Etc so
and and then sort of what is my direct

2802
00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:11,099
and and then sort of what is my direct
 

2803
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,730
and and then sort of what is my direct
contribution to my eating I mean I'm I'm

2804
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:13,740
contribution to my eating I mean I'm I'm
 

2805
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,290
contribution to my eating I mean I'm I'm
doing research on the human genome I

2806
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:15,300
doing research on the human genome I
 

2807
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,910
doing research on the human genome I
mean this will help humans it will help

2808
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:16,920
mean this will help humans it will help
 

2809
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,829
mean this will help humans it will help
all Humanity but how is that helping the

2810
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:18,839
all Humanity but how is that helping the
 

2811
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,829
all Humanity but how is that helping the
person who's giving me poultry or

2812
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:20,839
person who's giving me poultry or
 

2813
00:55:20,839 --> 00:55:25,309
person who's giving me poultry or
vegetables so in a way I see AI as

2814
00:55:25,309 --> 00:55:25,319
vegetables so in a way I see AI as
 

2815
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:28,549
vegetables so in a way I see AI as
perhaps leading to a dramatic rethinking

00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
perhaps leading to a dramatic rethinking
 

2817
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,049
perhaps leading to a dramatic rethinking
of human society

2818
00:55:30,049 --> 00:55:30,059
of human society
 

2819
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:33,290
of human society
if you think about sort of the economy

00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,569
I'm producing
what if AI can produce a lot of these

2826
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:38,579
what if AI can produce a lot of these
 

2827
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:40,190
what if AI can produce a lot of these
intellectual goods and satisfies that

2828
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:40,200
intellectual goods and satisfies that
 

2829
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,069
intellectual goods and satisfies that

this piece of ideas both of which we're
 

3013
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,349
this piece of ideas both of which we're
currently engaging and so one is the

3014
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:24,359
currently engaging and so one is the
 

3015
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:26,870
currently engaging and so one is the
communication of that to other people it

3016
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:26,880
communication of that to other people it
 

3017
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,370
communication of that to other people it
could be a classroom full of students

3018

could be a classroom full of students
 

3019
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,950
could be a classroom full of students
but it could be a podcast it could be

but it could be a podcast it could be
 

3021
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,470
but it could be a podcast it could be
something that's uh that's shown on

00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,130
wondering uh different things maybe
quoting some philosophers from the past

3038
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:52,140
quoting some philosophers from the past
 

3039
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,950
quoting some philosophers from the past
and playing with those little ideas and

3040
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:54,960
and playing with those little ideas and
 

3041
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,270
and playing with those little ideas and
that little exchange is forgotten

3042
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:56,280
that little exchange is forgotten
 

3043
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,190
that little exchange is forgotten
forever but you got to experience it and

3044
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:58,200
forever but you got to experience it and
 

3045
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,770
forever but you got to experience it and
maybe

3046
00:59:59,770 --> 00:59:59,780
maybe
 

3047
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,510
maybe
I wonder if it localizes that exchange

3048
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:02,520
I wonder if it localizes that exchange
 

3049
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,990
I wonder if it localizes that exchange
of ideas for that with AI it'll become

3050
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:06,000
of ideas for that with AI it'll become
 

3051
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,970
of ideas for that with AI it'll become
less and less valuable to communicate

3052
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:07,980
less and less valuable to communicate
 

3053
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,010
less and less valuable to communicate
with a large group of people that you

3054
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:10,020
with a large group of people that you
 

3055
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:13,670
with a large group of people that you
will live life intimately and and richly

3056
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:13,680
will live life intimately and and richly
 

3057
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,870

a forest having this amazing thought
when you exit that Forest the baggage

when you exit that Forest the baggage
 

3067

when I bike to work in the morning I
 

3073
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,690
when I bike to work in the morning I
listen to books

3074
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:38,700
listen to books
 

3075
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,510
listen to books
and I'm alone no one else is there I'm

01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,130
having that experience by myself and yet
in the evening when I speak with someone

3080
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:46,140
in the evening when I speak with someone
 

3081
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:49,190
in the evening when I speak with someone
an idea that was formed there could come

3082
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:49,200
an idea that was formed there could come
 

3083
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:49,970
an idea that was formed there could come
back

3084
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:49,980

sometimes when I fall asleep I fall

3086
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:51,780
sometimes when I fall asleep I fall
 

3087
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,809
sometimes when I fall asleep I fall
asleep listening to a book and in the

3088
01:00:53,809 --> 01:00:53,819
asleep listening to a book and in the
 

3089
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:56,329
asleep listening to a book and in the
morning I'll be full of ideas that I

3090
01:00:56,329 --> 01:00:56,339
morning I'll be full of ideas that I
 

3091
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:58,130
morning I'll be full of ideas that I
never even process consciously I'll

3092
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:58,140
never even process consciously I'll
 

3093
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,530
never even process consciously I'll
process them unconsciously and they will

3094
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:00,540
process them unconsciously and they will
 

3095
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,770
process them unconsciously and they will
shape that baggage that I carry that

3096
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:03,780
shape that baggage that I carry that
 

3097
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,690
shape that baggage that I carry that
will then shape my interactions and

3098
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:05,700
will then shape my interactions and
 

3099
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,910
will then shape my interactions and

in some Butterfly Effect by Newt kind of

3102
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:10,079
in some Butterfly Effect by Newt kind of
 

3103
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:10,910
in some Butterfly Effect by Newt kind of
way

3104
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:10,920
way
 

3105
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,150
way
so that's one aspect

3106
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
so that's one aspect
 

3107
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,569
so that's one aspect
the second aspect is

3108
01:01:16,569 --> 01:01:16,579
the second aspect is
 

3109
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:18,770
the second aspect is
Gatherings so basically you and I are

3110
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:18,780
Gatherings so basically you and I are
 

3111
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,329
Gatherings so basically you and I are
having a conversation

3112
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:20,339
having a conversation
 

3113
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:23,210
having a conversation
which feels very private but we're

3114
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:23,220
which feels very private but we're
 

3115
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,950
which feels very private but we're
sharing with the world

3116
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:24,960
sharing with the world
 

3117
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,809
sharing with the world
and then later tonight you're coming

3118
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:26,819
and then later tonight you're coming
 

3119
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:28,430
and then later tonight you're coming
over and we're having a conversation

3120
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:28,440
over and we're having a conversation
 

3121
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:30,829
over and we're having a conversation
that will be very public with dozens of

3122
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:30,839
that will be very public with dozens of
 

3123
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:32,690
that will be very public with dozens of
other people but we will not share with

the world yeah
so in a way which one's more private the

3128
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:37,260
so in a way which one's more private the
 

3129
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,230
so in a way which one's more private the
one here or the one there here there's

3130
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:39,240
one here or the one there here there's
 

3131
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,329
one here or the one there here there's
just two of us but a lot of others

3132
01:01:41,329 --> 01:01:41,339
just two of us but a lot of others
 

3133
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:43,970
just two of us but a lot of others
listening there a lot of people speaking

3134
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:43,980
listening there a lot of people speaking
 

3135
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,950
listening there a lot of people speaking
and thinking together and bouncing off

3136
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:45,960
and thinking together and bouncing off
 

3137
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,049
and thinking together and bouncing off
each other and maybe that will then

3138
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:48,059
each other and maybe that will then
 

3139
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:51,230
each other and maybe that will then
impact your millions of you know uh

3140
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:51,240
impact your millions of you know uh
 

3141
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,390

through your next conversation and
 

3145
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,910
through your next conversation and
I think that's part of the beauty of

3146
01:01:58,910 --> 01:01:58,920
I think that's part of the beauty of
 

3147
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,289
I think that's part of the beauty of
humanity the fact that no matter how

3148
01:02:00,289 --> 01:02:00,299
humanity the fact that no matter how
 

3149
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,510
humanity the fact that no matter how
small how alone how broadcast

01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:09,660
it still percolates through the human
 

3155
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,970
it still percolates through the human

human gatherings

3158
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:13,980
human gatherings
 

3159
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,890
human gatherings
all throughout human history there's

3160
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:15,900
all throughout human history there's
 

3161
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,569
all throughout human history there's
been gatherings

3162
01:02:17,569 --> 01:02:17,579
been gatherings
 

3163
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:19,549
been gatherings
I wonder how those Gatherings have

3164
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:19,559
I wonder how those Gatherings have
 

3165
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:21,470
I wonder how those Gatherings have
impacted the direction of human

3166
01:02:21,470 --> 01:02:21,480
impacted the direction of human
 

3167
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:25,069
impacted the direction of human
civilization it's just uh thinking of

3168
01:02:25,069 --> 01:02:25,079
civilization it's just uh thinking of
 

3169
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:27,829
civilization it's just uh thinking of
in the early days of the Nazi party

3170
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:27,839
in the early days of the Nazi party
 

3171
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,569
in the early days of the Nazi party
it was a small collection of people

3172
01:02:29,569 --> 01:02:29,579
it was a small collection of people
 

3173
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,890
it was a small collection of people
Gathering

3174
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:30,900
Gathering
 

3175
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:33,770
Gathering
and the uh the kernel of an idea in that

3176
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:33,780
and the uh the kernel of an idea in that
 

3177
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:35,690
and the uh the kernel of an idea in that
case an evil idea

3178
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:35,700
case an evil idea
 

3179
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,450
case an evil idea
I gave birth to something that actually

3180
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:38,460
I gave birth to something that actually
 

3181
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,490
I gave birth to something that actually
had a transformative impact on all the

3182
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:40,500
had a transformative impact on all the
 

3183
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,530
had a transformative impact on all the
human civilization and then there's a

3184
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:42,540
human civilization and then there's a
 

3185
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,210
human civilization and then there's a
similar kind of gatherings that lead to

3186
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:44,220
similar kind of gatherings that lead to
 

3187
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,609
similar kind of gatherings that lead to
positive transformations

3188
01:02:46,609 --> 01:02:46,619
positive transformations
 

3189
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:49,490
positive transformations
um this is probably a good moment to ask

3190
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:49,500
um this is probably a good moment to ask
 

3191
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,410
um this is probably a good moment to ask
you on a bit of a tangent but you

3192
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:51,420
you on a bit of a tangent but you
 

3193
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,630
you on a bit of a tangent but you
mentioned it you put together salons

3194
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:53,640
mentioned it you put together salons
 

3195
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,569
mentioned it you put together salons

do you think humans will fall in love
 

3435
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:06,410
do you think humans will fall in love
with AI systems and maybe they with us

3436
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:06,420
with AI systems and maybe they with us
 

3437
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,809
with AI systems and maybe they with us
so that aspect of the Human Condition do

so that aspect of the Human Condition do
 

3439
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:12,170
so that aspect of the Human Condition do
you think that will be affected

3440

mean fraternal love
 

3451
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,749
mean fraternal love
Etc so um I think AI doesn't have the

3452
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:26,759
Etc so um I think AI doesn't have the
 

3453
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:29,110
Etc so um I think AI doesn't have the
baggage that we do

3454
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:29,120
baggage that we do
 

3455
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,630
baggage that we do
and it doesn't have you know all of the

3456
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:32,640
and it doesn't have you know all of the
 

3457
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,870
and it doesn't have you know all of the
subcortical regions that we kind of you

3458
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:35,880
subcortical regions that we kind of you
 

3459
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,150
subcortical regions that we kind of you
know started with before we evolved all

3460
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:38,160
know started with before we evolved all
 

3461
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,150
know started with before we evolved all
of the cognitive aspects so I would say

3462
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:41,160
of the cognitive aspects so I would say
 

3463
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:44,570
of the cognitive aspects so I would say
AI is Faking it when it comes to love

3464
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:44,580
AI is Faking it when it comes to love
 

3465
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,490
AI is Faking it when it comes to love
but when it comes to Friendship

3514
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:46,500
so I do believe that human AI
 

3515
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,729
so I do believe that human AI
relationships will absolutely be there

3516
01:09:49,729 --> 01:09:49,739
relationships will absolutely be there
 

3517
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:53,510
relationships will absolutely be there
but not the passion more the mentoring

3518
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:53,520
but not the passion more the mentoring
 

3519
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,669
but not the passion more the mentoring
well that's a really interesting thought

3520
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:55,679
well that's a really interesting thought
 

3521
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,110
well that's a really interesting thought
to play Devil's Advocate

3522
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,120
to play Devil's Advocate
 

3523
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,110
to play Devil's Advocate
if those AI systems are locked in

3524
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:03,120
if those AI systems are locked in
 

3525
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,110
if those AI systems are locked in
in faking the baggage

3526
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:06,120
in faking the baggage
 

3527
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,750
in faking the baggage
who are you to say that the AI systems

3528
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:08,760
who are you to say that the AI systems
 

3529
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,370
who are you to say that the AI systems
that begs you

3530
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:10,380
that begs you
 

3531
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,250
that begs you
not to leave it or it doesn't love you

3532
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:13,260
not to leave it or it doesn't love you
 

3533
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,530
not to leave it or it doesn't love you
who are you to say that this AI system

3534
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:15,540
who are you to say that this AI system
 

3535
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:19,850
who are you to say that this AI system
that writes poetry to you that is afraid

3536
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:19,860
that writes poetry to you that is afraid
 

3537
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:23,209
that writes poetry to you that is afraid
of death afraid of life without you

3538
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:23,219
of death afraid of life without you
 

3539
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,870
of death afraid of life without you
um or vice versa one you know creates

3540
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:26,880
um or vice versa one you know creates
 

3541
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,850
um or vice versa one you know creates
the kind of drama that humans create the

3542
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:28,860
the kind of drama that humans create the
 

3543
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,649
the kind of drama that humans create the
the power dynamics that can exist in a

3544
01:10:30,649 --> 01:10:30,659
the power dynamics that can exist in a
 

3545
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:32,990
the power dynamics that can exist in a
relationship what AI system that is one

3546
01:10:32,990 --> 01:10:33,000
relationship what AI system that is one
 

3547
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,350
relationship what AI system that is one
abusive one day and romantic the other

3548
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:36,360
abusive one day and romantic the other
 

3549
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,090
abusive one day and romantic the other
day all the different variations of

3550
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:38,100
day all the different variations of
 

3551
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,669
day all the different variations of
relationships and it's consistently that

3552
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:40,679
relationships and it's consistently that
 

3553
01:10:40,679 --> 01:10:43,250
relationships and it's consistently that
it holds the full richness of a

3554
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:43,260
it holds the full richness of a
 

3555
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:46,490
it holds the full richness of a
particular personality why is that not a

3556
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:46,500
particular personality why is that not a
 

3557
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,290
particular personality why is that not a
system you can love in a romantic way

3558
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:48,300
system you can love in a romantic way
 

3559
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,649
system you can love in a romantic way
why is it faking it if it sure as hell

3560
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:51,659
why is it faking it if it sure as hell
 

3561
01:10:51,659 --> 01:10:54,110
why is it faking it if it sure as hell
seems real there's many answers to this

3562
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:54,120
seems real there's many answers to this
 

3563
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,390
seems real there's many answers to this
the first is it's only the eye of the

3564
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:56,400
the first is it's only the eye of the
 

3565
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,010
the first is it's only the eye of the
beholder who tells me that I'm not

3566
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:58,020
beholder who tells me that I'm not
 

3567
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,930
beholder who tells me that I'm not
faking it either maybe all of these

3568
01:10:59,930 --> 01:10:59,940
faking it either maybe all of these
 

3569
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:02,570
faking it either maybe all of these
subcortical systems that make me sort of

3570
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:02,580
subcortical systems that make me sort of
 

3571
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:04,070
subcortical systems that make me sort of
have different emotions

3572
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
have different emotions
 

3573
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,130
have different emotions
maybe they don't really matter maybe all

3574
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:07,140
maybe they don't really matter maybe all
 

3575
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,229
maybe they don't really matter maybe all
that matters is the neocortex and that's

3576
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:09,239
that matters is the neocortex and that's
 

3577
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:11,930
that matters is the neocortex and that's
where all of my emotions are encoded and

3578
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:11,940
where all of my emotions are encoded and
 

3579
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:14,390
where all of my emotions are encoded and
the rest is just you know bells and

3580
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
the rest is just you know bells and
 

3581
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,890
the rest is just you know bells and
whistles

3582
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:15,900
whistles
 

3583
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,330
whistles
um that's one possibility

3584
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:17,340
um that's one possibility
 

3585
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,430
um that's one possibility
and and therefore

3586
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
and and therefore
 

3587
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,410
and and therefore
you know who am I to judge that is

3588
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:21,420
you know who am I to judge that is
 

3589
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,910
you know who am I to judge that is
Faking it when maybe I'm faking it as

3590
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:22,920
Faking it when maybe I'm faking it as
 

3591
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,630
Faking it when maybe I'm faking it as
well

3592
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:23,640
well
 

3593
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,750
well
the second is neither of us is Faking it

3594
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:26,760
the second is neither of us is Faking it
 

3595
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,090
the second is neither of us is Faking it
maybe it's just an emergent behavior all

3596
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:29,100
maybe it's just an emergent behavior all
 

3597
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,149
maybe it's just an emergent behavior all
these neocortical systems that

3598
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:32,159
these neocortical systems that
 

3599
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:36,169
these neocortical systems that
is truly capturing the same exact

3600
01:11:36,169 --> 01:11:36,179
is truly capturing the same exact
 

3601
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:39,950
is truly capturing the same exact
essence of love and hatred and

3602
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:39,960
essence of love and hatred and
 

3603
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,649
essence of love and hatred and
dependency and sort of you know reverse

3604
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:42,659
dependency and sort of you know reverse
 

3605
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:44,990
dependency and sort of you know reverse
psychology and

3606
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:45,000
psychology and
 

3607
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,010
psychology and
um

3608
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:46,020
um
 

3609
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:49,970
um
that that that we have so it is possible

3610
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:49,980
that that that we have so it is possible
 

3611
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,189
that that that we have so it is possible
that it's simply an emerging behavior

3612
01:11:52,189 --> 01:11:52,199
that it's simply an emerging behavior
 

3613
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,050
that it's simply an emerging behavior
and that we don't have to encode these

3614
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:54,060
and that we don't have to encode these
 

3615
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,270
and that we don't have to encode these
additional architectures that all we

3616
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:56,280
additional architectures that all we
 

3617
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,070
additional architectures that all we
need is more parameters and some of

3618
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:58,080
need is more parameters and some of
 

3619
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,570
need is more parameters and some of
these parameters can be all of the

3620
01:11:59,570 --> 01:11:59,580
these parameters can be all of the
 

3621
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,610
these parameters can be all of the
personality traits

3622
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:01,620
personality traits
 

3623
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,970
personality traits
a third option is that just by telling

3624
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:04,980
a third option is that just by telling
 

3625
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,070
a third option is that just by telling
me oh look now I've built an emotion

3626
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:07,080
me oh look now I've built an emotion
 

3627
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,290
me oh look now I've built an emotion
component to AI it has a limbic system

3628
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:09,300
component to AI it has a limbic system
 

3629
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:13,370
component to AI it has a limbic system
and it has a laser brain Etc

3630
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:13,380

 

3631
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:16,130

and suddenly I'll say oh cool it has the

3632
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:16,140
and suddenly I'll say oh cool it has the
 

3633
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:18,530
and suddenly I'll say oh cool it has the
capability of emotion so now when it

3634
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:18,540
capability of emotion so now when it
 

3635
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,330
capability of emotion so now when it
exhibits the exact same unchanged

3636
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:20,340
exhibits the exact same unchanged
 

3637
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:23,110
exhibits the exact same unchanged
behaviors that it does without it

3638
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
behaviors that it does without it
 

3639
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:27,110
behaviors that it does without it
I as the beholder will be able to sort

3640
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:27,120
I as the beholder will be able to sort
 

3641
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,250
I as the beholder will be able to sort
of attribute to it emotional attributes

3642
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:30,260
of attribute to it emotional attributes
 

3643
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,470
of attribute to it emotional attributes
that I would to another human being and

3644
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:33,480
that I would to another human being and
 

3645
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:37,310
that I would to another human being and
therefore have that mental model of that

3646
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:37,320
therefore have that mental model of that
 

3647
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,530
therefore have that mental model of that
other person so again I think a lot of

3648
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:39,540
other person so again I think a lot of
 

3649
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,930
other person so again I think a lot of
relationships is about the mental models

3650
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:41,940
relationships is about the mental models
 

3651
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,130
relationships is about the mental models
that you project

3652
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:43,140
that you project
 

3653
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,590
that you project
on the other person

3654
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:45,600
on the other person
 

3655
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,990
on the other person
and that they're projecting on you

3656
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:48,000
and that they're projecting on you
 

3657
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,850
and that they're projecting on you
and um

3658
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:49,860
and um
 

3659
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,910
and um
then yeah then in that respect I do

3660
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:52,920
then yeah then in that respect I do
 

3661
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,010
then yeah then in that respect I do
think that

3662
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:55,020
think that
 

3663
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,530
think that
even without the embodied intelligence

3664
01:12:57,530 --> 01:12:57,540
even without the embodied intelligence
 

3665
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:00,110
even without the embodied intelligence
part without having ever experienced

3666
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,120
part without having ever experienced
 

3667
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:03,350
part without having ever experienced
what it's like to be heartbroken the

3668
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:03,360
what it's like to be heartbroken the
 

3669
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:09,169
what it's like to be heartbroken the
sort of cultural feeling of misery

3670
01:13:09,169 --> 01:13:09,179
sort of cultural feeling of misery
 

3671
01:13:09,179 --> 01:13:11,510
sort of cultural feeling of misery
um that that system you know I could

3672
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:11,520
um that that system you know I could

the entities let's just take the easy

3696
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,520
the entities let's just take the easy
 

3697
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,209
the entities let's just take the easy
case one of the entities is human and

3698
01:13:44,209 --> 01:13:44,219
case one of the entities is human and
 

3699
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:45,530
case one of the entities is human and
the other is AI

3700
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:45,540
the other is AI
 

3701
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:48,290
the other is AI

freaking be there to show them that I'm
 

3831
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,090
freaking be there to show them that I'm

3832
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:26,100
there
 

3833
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,590
there
so basically of course you know

3834
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:27,600
so basically of course you know
 

3835
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,090
so basically of course you know
everyone's a good guy in their story

3836
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:29,100
everyone's a good guy in their story

3840
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:34,860
but if I'm not there it's wasted so the
 

3841
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:37,310
but if I'm not there it's wasted so the
reason why I asked the question is for

3842
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:37,320
reason why I asked the question is for
 

3843
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,930
reason why I asked the question is for
me to say

3844
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:38,940
me to say
 

3845
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:40,790
me to say
you know does it really matter that I

3846
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:40,800

love them if I'm not there to show it
 

3849
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,610
love them if I'm not there to show it
but it's also possible that what reality

3850
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:46,620
but it's also possible that what reality
 

3851
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,729
but it's also possible that what reality
is is the you showing it that what you

3852
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:49,739
is is the you showing it that what you
 

3853
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:51,649
is is the you showing it that what you
feel on the inside is

3854
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:51,659
feel on the inside is
 

3855
01:16:51,659 --> 01:16:53,750
feel on the inside is
is little narratives and games you play

3856
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
is little narratives and games you play
 

3857
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,130
is little narratives and games you play
inside your mind it doesn't really

3858
01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:55,140
inside your mind it doesn't really
 

3859
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,610
inside your mind it doesn't really
matter that the thing that truly matters

3860
01:16:58,610 --> 01:16:58,620
matter that the thing that truly matters
 

3861
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:01,850
matter that the thing that truly matters
is how you act and in that

3862
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:01,860
is how you act and in that
 

3863
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:04,729
is how you act and in that
AI systems can quote unquote fake yeah

3864
01:17:04,729 --> 01:17:04,739
AI systems can quote unquote fake yeah
 

3865
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:07,070
AI systems can quote unquote fake yeah
and that if it's all that matters is

3866
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:07,080
and that if it's all that matters is
 

3867
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:09,350
and that if it's all that matters is
actually real but not fake yeah yeah

3868
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:09,360
actually real but not fake yeah yeah
 

3869
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,530

3876
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:20,520
what does that mean like if I'm only
 

3877
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,490
what does that mean like if I'm only
there to do their homework and make sure

3878
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:22,500
there to do their homework and make sure
 

3879
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,410
there to do their homework and make sure
that they you know do all the stuff but

3880
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:24,420
that they you know do all the stuff but
 

3881
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:26,990
that they you know do all the stuff but
I don't show it to them then you know

3882
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:27,000
I don't show it to them then you know
 

3883
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,270

might as well be a terrible dad
 

3885
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,430
might as well be a terrible dad
but I agree with you that like if the AI

3886
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:31,440
but I agree with you that like if the AI
 

3887
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,310
but I agree with you that like if the AI
system can basically play the role of a

3888
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,320
system can basically play the role of a
 

3889
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,330
system can basically play the role of a
father figure

3890
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:35,340
father figure
 

3891
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:38,689
father figure
for many children that don't have one or

3892
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:38,699
for many children that don't have one or
 

3893
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:40,790
for many children that don't have one or
you know the role of parents or the role

3897
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:44,390
of siblings
if a child grows up alone

3898

if a child grows up alone
 

3899
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,209
if a child grows up alone
maybe their emotional state will be very

3900
01:17:47,209 --> 01:17:47,219
maybe their emotional state will be very
 

3901
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:49,189
maybe their emotional state will be very
different than if they grow up with an

3902
01:17:49,189 --> 01:17:49,199
different than if they grow up with an
 

3903
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,649
different than if they grow up with an
AI sibling well let me ask I mean this

01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:05,420
what if we create a large language Model
 

3915
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,729
what if we create a large language Model
fine-tune A manolus

01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:34,080
could do that to all of them and
 

3985
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,950
could do that to all of them and
um that that aspect is the

3986
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:36,960
um that that aspect is the
 

3987
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,709
um that that aspect is the
democratization of of relationships I

3988
01:19:39,709 --> 01:19:39,719
democratization of of relationships I
 

3989
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:42,189
democratization of of relationships I
think that that is extremely beneficial

3990
01:19:42,189 --> 01:19:42,199
think that that is extremely beneficial
 

3991
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:45,649
think that that is extremely beneficial
the other aspect is I want to interact

3992
01:19:45,649 --> 01:19:45,659
the other aspect is I want to interact
 

3993
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:47,750
the other aspect is I want to interact
with that system I want to look inside

3994
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:47,760
with that system I want to look inside
 

3995
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:51,169
with that system I want to look inside
the hood I want to sort of evaluate it I

3996
01:19:51,169 --> 01:19:51,179
the hood I want to sort of evaluate it I
 

3997
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:53,450
the hood I want to sort of evaluate it I
want to basically see if when I see it

3998
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:53,460
want to basically see if when I see it
 

3999
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,430
want to basically see if when I see it
from the outside the emotional

4000
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:55,440
from the outside the emotional
 

4001
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,590
from the outside the emotional
parameters are off or the cognitive

4002
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:57,600
parameters are off or the cognitive
 

4003
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,810

01:19:59,810 --> 01:19:59,820
parameters are off or the set of ideas
 

4005
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,250
parameters are off or the set of ideas
that I'm giving are not quite right

4006
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:01,260
that I'm giving are not quite right
 

4007
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:03,050
that I'm giving are not quite right
anymore I want to see how that system

4008
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:03,060
anymore I want to see how that system
 

4009
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:04,910
anymore I want to see how that system
evolves I want to see the impact of

4010
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:04,920
evolves I want to see the impact of
 

4011
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,209
evolves I want to see the impact of
exercise or sleep on sort of my own

4012
01:20:08,209 --> 01:20:08,219
exercise or sleep on sort of my own
 

4013
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:09,590
exercise or sleep on sort of my own
cognitive system I want to be able to

4014
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:09,600
cognitive system I want to be able to
 

4015
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,450
cognitive system I want to be able to
sort of

4016
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:10,460
sort of
 

4017
01:20:10,460 --> 01:20:13,250
sort of
decompose my own behavior in a set of

4018
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:13,260
decompose my own behavior in a set of
 

4019
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,050
decompose my own behavior in a set of
parameters that can evaluate and look at

4020
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:15,060
parameters that can evaluate and look at
 

4021
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,149
parameters that can evaluate and look at
my own personal growth I can sort of I'd

4022
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:17,159
my own personal growth I can sort of I'd
 

4023
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:18,350
my own personal growth I can sort of I'd
love to sort of at the end of the day

4024
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:18,360
love to sort of at the end of the day
 

4025
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,750
love to sort of at the end of the day
have my model say well you know you

4026
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:20,760
have my model say well you know you
 

4027
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,330
have my model say well you know you
didn't quite do well today like you know

4028
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:23,340
didn't quite do well today like you know
 

4029
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,669
didn't quite do well today like you know
you you weren't quite there and sort of

4030
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679
you you weren't quite there and sort of
 

4031
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:28,610
you you weren't quite there and sort of
grow from that experience and I I think

4032
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:28,620
grow from that experience and I I think
 

4033
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:31,310
grow from that experience and I I think
the concept of basically being able to

4034
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:31,320
the concept of basically being able to
 

4035
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,890
the concept of basically being able to
become more aware of our own

4036
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:33,900
become more aware of our own
 

4037
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,930
become more aware of our own
personalities become more aware of our

4038
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:35,940
personalities become more aware of our
 

4039
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:38,390
personalities become more aware of our
own identities maybe even interact with

4040
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,400
own identities maybe even interact with
 

4041
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,250
own identities maybe even interact with
ourselves and sort of hear how we are

4042
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:40,260
ourselves and sort of hear how we are
 

4043
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,050
ourselves and sort of hear how we are
being perceived

4044
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:42,060
being perceived
 

4045
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:45,669
being perceived
I think would be immensely helpful in

4046
01:20:45,669 --> 01:20:45,679
I think would be immensely helpful in
 

4047
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,350
I think would be immensely helpful in
self-growth in self-actualization

4048
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:48,360
self-growth in self-actualization
 

4049
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,530
self-growth in self-actualization
self-aducation

4050
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:50,540
self-aducation
 

4051
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:53,390
self-aducation
the experiments I would do on that thing

4052
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:53,400
the experiments I would do on that thing
 

4053
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,490
the experiments I would do on that thing
because one of the challenges of course

4054
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:55,500
because one of the challenges of course
 

4055
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,250
because one of the challenges of course
is you might not like what you see

4056
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:58,260
is you might not like what you see
 

4057
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,169
is you might not like what you see
in your interaction and you might say

4058
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:00,179
in your interaction and you might say
 

4059
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:02,149
in your interaction and you might say
well this the model is not accurate but

4060
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:02,159
well this the model is not accurate but
 

4061
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:03,169
well this the model is not accurate but
then you have to should probably

4062
01:21:03,169 --> 01:21:03,179
then you have to should probably
 

4063
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:05,149
then you have to should probably
consider the possibility that the model

4064
01:21:05,149 --> 01:21:05,159
consider the possibility that the model
 

4065
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:07,370
consider the possibility that the model
is accurate and that there's actually

4066
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:07,380
is accurate and that there's actually
 

4067
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,430
is accurate and that there's actually
flaws in your mind I would definitely

4068
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:09,440
flaws in your mind I would definitely
 

4069
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:13,550
flaws in your mind I would definitely
prod and see how many biases I have with

4070
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:13,560
prod and see how many biases I have with
 

4071
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,770
prod and see how many biases I have with
different kinds I don't know and I would

4072
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:15,780
different kinds I don't know and I would
 

4073
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,270
different kinds I don't know and I would
of course go to the extremes I would go

4074
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:17,280
of course go to the extremes I would go
 

4075
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,970
of course go to the extremes I would go
like um how jealous can I make this

4076
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:19,980
like um how jealous can I make this
 

4077
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:23,330
like um how jealous can I make this
thing like what what at which stages

4078
01:21:23,330 --> 01:21:23,340
thing like what what at which stages
 

4079
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:26,209
thing like what what at which stages
does it get super jealous you know or at

4080
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:26,219
does it get super jealous you know or at
 

4081
01:21:26,219 --> 01:21:28,130
does it get super jealous you know or at
which stages does it get angry kind of

4082
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:28,140
which stages does it get angry kind of
 

4083
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,090
which stages does it get angry kind of
like provoke it can I get it like yeah

4084
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:31,100
like provoke it can I get it like yeah
 

4085
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:33,649
like provoke it can I get it like yeah
but not only triggers can I get it to go

4086
01:21:33,649 --> 01:21:33,659
but not only triggers can I get it to go
 

4087
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:37,070
but not only triggers can I get it to go
like lose its mind like go completely

4088
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:37,080
like lose its mind like go completely
 

4089
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:40,390
like lose its mind like go completely
nuts just don't exercise for a few days

4090
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:40,400
nuts just don't exercise for a few days
 

4091
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,729
nuts just don't exercise for a few days
that's basically it yes I mean that

4092
01:21:43,729 --> 01:21:43,739
that's basically it yes I mean that
 

4093
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:46,370
that's basically it yes I mean that
that's that's an interesting way to prod

4094
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:46,380
that's that's an interesting way to prod
 

4095
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:49,550
that's that's an interesting way to prod
yourself almost like a a self therapy

4096
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:49,560
yourself almost like a a self therapy
 

4097
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,590
yourself almost like a a self therapy
session and and the beauty of such a

4098
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
session and and the beauty of such a
 

4099
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,910
session and and the beauty of such a
model is that if I am replaceable if the

4100
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:55,920
model is that if I am replaceable if the
 

4101
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,470
model is that if I am replaceable if the
parts that I currently do are

4102
01:21:57,470 --> 01:21:57,480
parts that I currently do are
 

4103
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:58,550
parts that I currently do are
replaceable

4104
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:58,560
replaceable
 

4105
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,070
replaceable
that's amazing because it frees me up to

4106
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:01,080
that's amazing because it frees me up to
 

4107
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:02,570
that's amazing because it frees me up to
work on other parts that I don't

4108
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:02,580
work on other parts that I don't
 

4109
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,310
work on other parts that I don't
currently have time to develop

4110
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
currently have time to develop
 

4111
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,930
currently have time to develop
maybe all I'm doing is giving the same

4112
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:05,940
maybe all I'm doing is giving the same
 

4113
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:08,209
maybe all I'm doing is giving the same
advice over and over and over again like

4114
01:22:08,209 --> 01:22:08,219
advice over and over and over again like
 

4115
01:22:08,219 --> 01:22:11,209
advice over and over and over again like
just let my AI do that and I can work on

4116
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:11,219
just let my AI do that and I can work on
 

4117
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:12,649
just let my AI do that and I can work on
the next stage and the next stage and

4118
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:12,659
the next stage and the next stage and
 

4119
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:14,530
the next stage and the next stage and
the next stage so I think in terms of

4120
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:14,540
the next stage so I think in terms of
 

4121
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:17,510
the next stage so I think in terms of
freeing up like

4122
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,520
freeing up like
 

4123
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,490
freeing up like
they say a programmer someone who cannot

4124
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:19,500
they say a programmer someone who cannot
 

4125
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,530
they say a programmer someone who cannot
do the same thing twice so it's not the

4126
01:22:21,530 --> 01:22:21,540
do the same thing twice so it's not the
 

4127
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:22,910
do the same thing twice so it's not the
second time you write a program to do it

4128
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:22,920
second time you write a program to do it
 

4129
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,130
second time you write a program to do it
and I wish I could do that for my own

4130
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:25,140
and I wish I could do that for my own
 

4131
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:26,930
and I wish I could do that for my own
existence I could just like you know

4132
01:22:26,930 --> 01:22:26,940
existence I could just like you know
 

4133
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,430
existence I could just like you know
figure out things keep improving

01:22:33,229 --> 01:22:33,239
it let the AI loose on that and maybe

fomo they get to have interactions all
 

4213
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:11,689
fomo they get to have interactions all
right and you don't get to have those

4214
01:24:11,689 --> 01:24:11,699
right and you don't get to have those
 

4215
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:13,790
right and you don't get to have those
interactions there's two aspects of

01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,550
interactions there's two aspects of
every person's life there's what you

4218
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:16,560
every person's life there's what you
 

4219
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,610
every person's life there's what you
give to others and there's what you

give to others and there's what you
 

4221
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:21,610
give to others and there's what you
experience yourself yeah

4222
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:21,620
experience yourself yeah
 

4223
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:25,669
experience yourself yeah
life truly ends when you experiencing

4224
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:25,679
life truly ends when you experiencing
 

4225
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,530
life truly ends when you experiencing
ends

4226

ends
 

4227
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:30,410
ends
but the others experiencing you doesn't

4228
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:30,420
but the others experiencing you doesn't
 

4229
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:34,790
but the others experiencing you doesn't
need to end

4230
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800

 

4231
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,790

but your experience you could still I

4232
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:37,800
but your experience you could still I
 

4233
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,770
but your experience you could still I
guess you're saying the digital twin

4234
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:39,780
guess you're saying the digital twin
 

4235
01:24:39,780 --> 01:24:42,229
guess you're saying the digital twin
does not limit your ability to truly the

4236
01:24:42,229 --> 01:24:42,239
does not limit your ability to truly the
 

4237
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:44,090
does not limit your ability to truly the
experience to experience as a human

01:24:44,090 --> 01:24:44,100
experience to experience as a human
 

4239
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:47,930
experience to experience as a human
being the the the the downside is when

4240
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:47,940
being the the the the downside is when
 

4241
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:51,770
being the the the the downside is when
you know my wife or my kids will have a

4242
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:51,780
you know my wife or my kids will have a
 

4243
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:53,330
you know my wife or my kids will have a
really emotional interaction with my

4244
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:53,340
really emotional interaction with my
 

4245
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:55,010
really emotional interaction with my
digital twin and I won't know about it

4246
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:55,020
digital twin and I won't know about it
 

4247
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:57,890
digital twin and I won't know about it
so I will show up and they now have the

4248
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:57,900
so I will show up and they now have the
 

4249
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,390
so I will show up and they now have the
baggage but I don't

4250
01:24:59,390 --> 01:24:59,400
baggage but I don't
 

4251
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:01,610
baggage but I don't
so basically what makes interactions

4252
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:01,620
so basically what makes interactions
 

4253
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:04,250
so basically what makes interactions
between humans unique in this sharing

4254
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:04,260
between humans unique in this sharing
 

4255
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:06,229
between humans unique in this sharing
and exchanging kind of way is the fact

4256
01:25:06,229 --> 01:25:06,239
and exchanging kind of way is the fact
 

4257
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:07,729
and exchanging kind of way is the fact
that we are both shaped by every one of

4258
01:25:07,729 --> 01:25:07,739
that we are both shaped by every one of
 

4259
01:25:07,739 --> 01:25:10,310
that we are both shaped by every one of
our interactions I think the model of

4260
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:10,320
our interactions I think the model of
 

4261
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,590
our interactions I think the model of
the digital twin works for dissemination

4262
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:12,600
the digital twin works for dissemination
 

4263
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,510
the digital twin works for dissemination
of knowledge of advice

4264

you know the dissemination and the

you know the dissemination and the

aspect is that there should be an alert
 

4283
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,570
aspect is that there should be an alert
when the AI system is interacting with

4284
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:41,580
when the AI system is interacting with
 

4285
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,130
when the AI system is interacting with
your loved ones and all of a sudden it

system like freezes there's an alert on
your phone you need to take over yeah

4296
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:54,120
your phone you need to take over yeah
 

4297
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,330
your phone you need to take over yeah
yeah I take over and then whoever I was

4298
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:56,340
yeah I take over and then whoever I was
 

4299
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:58,729
yeah I take over and then whoever I was
speaking with I can have the the AI or

4300
01:25:58,729 --> 01:25:58,739
speaking with I can have the the AI or
 

4301
01:25:58,739 --> 01:26:00,649
speaking with I can have the the AI or
like one of the AIS this is such a

4302
01:26:00,649 --> 01:26:00,659
like one of the AIS this is such a
 

4303
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:02,090
like one of the AIS this is such a
tricky thing to get right I mean it's

4304
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:02,100
tricky thing to get right I mean it's
 

4305
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:04,550
tricky thing to get right I mean it's
still I mean there's go

4306
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,560
still I mean there's go
 

4307
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,950
still I mean there's go
uh this is going to go wrong in so many

4308
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:06,960
uh this is going to go wrong in so many
 

4309
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,149
uh this is going to go wrong in so many
interesting ways that we're gonna have

4310
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:08,159
interesting ways that we're gonna have
 

4311
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:11,510
interesting ways that we're gonna have
to learn as a society yeah yeah that in

4312
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:11,520
to learn as a society yeah yeah that in
 

4313
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,189
to learn as a society yeah yeah that in
the process of trying to automate our

4314
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:13,199
the process of trying to automate our
 

4315
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,830
the process of trying to automate our
tasks and having a digital twin

4316
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:15,840
tasks and having a digital twin
 

4317
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,689
tasks and having a digital twin
you know for me personally if I could

4318
01:26:17,689 --> 01:26:17,699
you know for me personally if I could
 

4319
01:26:17,699 --> 01:26:20,750
you know for me personally if I could
have a relatively good copy of myself

4320
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:20,760
have a relatively good copy of myself
 

4321
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,450
have a relatively good copy of myself
uh I would set it to start answering

4322
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:23,460
uh I would set it to start answering
 

4323
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,790
uh I would set it to start answering
emails but I would start it set it to

4324
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:25,800
emails but I would start it set it to
 

4325
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,649
emails but I would start it set it to
start tweeting I would like to replace

4326
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:27,659
start tweeting I would like to replace
 

4327
01:26:27,659 --> 01:26:29,750
start tweeting I would like to replace
it gets better what if that one is

4328
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:29,760
it gets better what if that one is
 

4329
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,450
it gets better what if that one is
actually way better than you yeah

4330
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:31,460
actually way better than you yeah
 

4331
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:34,250
actually way better than you yeah
exactly and then you're like uh well I

4332
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:34,260
exactly and then you're like uh well I
 

4333
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,590
exactly and then you're like uh well I
wouldn't want that because why

4334
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:36,600
wouldn't want that because why
 

4335
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,050
wouldn't want that because why
because then I would never be able to

4336
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:39,060
because then I would never be able to
 

4337
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,870
because then I would never be able to
live up to like what if the people that

4338
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:41,880
live up to like what if the people that
 

4339
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,629
live up to like what if the people that
love me start loving that thing and then

I'll be falling short even more so
 

4345
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,689
I'll be falling short even more so

so maybe your role

4380
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:29,820
so maybe your role
 

4381
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:31,850
so maybe your role
will be to train better versions of

4382
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:31,860
will be to train better versions of
 

4383
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:33,649
will be to train better versions of
yourself

4384
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:33,659
yourself
 

4385
01:27:33,659 --> 01:27:37,189
yourself
and they will be your legacy not you

4386
01:27:37,189 --> 01:27:37,199
and they will be your legacy not you
 

4387
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:39,470
and they will be your legacy not you
doing everything but you training much

better version of Lex Friedman than you

4390
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:41,040
better version of Lex Friedman than you
 

4391
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:41,930
better version of Lex Friedman than you
are

4392
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:41,940
are
 

4393
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,850
are
and then they go off to do their mission

4394
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:43,860
and then they go off to do their mission
 

4395
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:45,950
and then they go off to do their mission
which is in many ways what this

4396
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:45,960
which is in many ways what this
 

4397
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,110
which is in many ways what this
mentorship model of Academia does but

4398
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:48,120
mentorship model of Academia does but
 

4399
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,910
mentorship model of Academia does but
the legacy is ephemeral it doesn't

4400
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:49,920
the legacy is ephemeral it doesn't
 

4401
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,149
the legacy is ephemeral it doesn't
really live anywhere the Legacy it's not

4402
01:27:53,149 --> 01:27:53,159
really live anywhere the Legacy it's not
 

4403
01:27:53,159 --> 01:27:55,070
really live anywhere the Legacy it's not
like written somewhere it just lives

4404
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:55,080
like written somewhere it just lives
 

4405
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,510
like written somewhere it just lives
through them but you can continue

4406
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:56,520
through them but you can continue
 

4407
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,310
through them but you can continue
improving and you can continue making

4408
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:58,320
improving and you can continue making
 

4409
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,229
improving and you can continue making
even better versions of you

4410
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:00,239
even better versions of you
 

4411
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,570
even better versions of you
yeah but they'll do better than me and

4412
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:02,580
yeah but they'll do better than me and
 

4413
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,850
yeah but they'll do better than me and
that's creating new version it's awesome

4414
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:04,860
that's creating new version it's awesome
 

4415
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:06,229
that's creating new version it's awesome
but it's

4416
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
but it's
 

4417
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,430
but it's
um

4418
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:07,440
um
 

4419
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,550
um
you know there's a ego that says there's

4420
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:10,560
you know there's a ego that says there's
 

4421
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,250
you know there's a ego that says there's
a value to an individual and it feels

4422
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:13,260
a value to an individual and it feels
 

4423
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,070
a value to an individual and it feels
like this process decreases the value of

4424
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
like this process decreases the value of
 

4425
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,189
like this process decreases the value of
the individual this meat bag

4426
01:28:19,189 --> 01:28:19,199
the individual this meat bag
 

4427
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,470
the individual this meat bag
all right if there's good digital copies

4428
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:21,480
all right if there's good digital copies
 

4429
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,050
all right if there's good digital copies
of people then uh there's more

4430
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:24,060
of people then uh there's more
 

4431
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:25,790
of people then uh there's more
flourishing of human thought and ideas

4432
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:25,800
flourishing of human thought and ideas
 

4433
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,310
flourishing of human thought and ideas
and experiences but there's less value

4434
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:28,320
and experiences but there's less value
 

4435
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,010
and experiences but there's less value
to the individual human I I don't have

4436
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:31,020
to the individual human I I don't have
 

4437
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:34,370
to the individual human I I don't have
any such limitations I I basically I

4438
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:34,380
any such limitations I I basically I
 

4439
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:36,189
any such limitations I I basically I
don't I don't have that feeling at all

4440
01:28:36,189 --> 01:28:36,199
don't I don't have that feeling at all
 

4441
01:28:36,199 --> 01:28:38,570
don't I don't have that feeling at all
like I remember one of our interviews I

4442
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:38,580
like I remember one of our interviews I
 

4443
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:39,709
like I remember one of our interviews I
was basically saying you know the

4444
01:28:39,709 --> 01:28:39,719
was basically saying you know the
 

4445
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:41,390
was basically saying you know the
meaning of life you had asked me and I

4446
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:41,400
meaning of life you had asked me and I
 

4447
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,129
meaning of life you had asked me and I
was like I came back and I was like I

4448
01:28:43,129 --> 01:28:43,139
was like I came back and I was like I
 

4449
01:28:43,139 --> 01:28:44,810
was like I came back and I was like I
felt useful today

4450
01:28:44,810 --> 01:28:44,820
felt useful today
 

4451
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,330
felt useful today

01:31:49,189 --> 01:31:49,199
my students record every single one of
 

4611
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:52,610
my students record every single one of
our conversations recorded

4612
01:31:52,610 --> 01:31:52,620

 

4613
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,590

I always joke that like the ultimate

4614
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:54,600
I always joke that like the ultimate
 

4615
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,270
I always joke that like the ultimate
goal is to create virtual me and just

4616
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:56,280
goal is to create virtual me and just
 

4617
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,129
goal is to create virtual me and just
get rid of me basically not get rid of

4618
01:31:58,129 --> 01:31:58,139
get rid of me basically not get rid of
 

4619
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:00,229
get rid of me basically not get rid of
it like don't have the need for me

4620
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:00,239
it like don't have the need for me
 

4621
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:02,990
it like don't have the need for me
anymore yeah another goal is to be able

4622
01:32:02,990 --> 01:32:03,000
anymore yeah another goal is to be able
 

4623
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,070
anymore yeah another goal is to be able
to go back and say how have I changed

4624
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:07,080
to go back and say how have I changed
 

4625
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:10,430
to go back and say how have I changed
from five years ago was I different was

4626
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:10,440
from five years ago was I different was
 

4627
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:12,350
from five years ago was I different was
I giving you know advice in a different

4628
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:12,360
I giving you know advice in a different
 

4629
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,669
I giving you know advice in a different
way was it giving different types of

4630
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
way was it giving different types of
 

4631
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,669
way was it giving different types of
advice has My Philosophy about how to

4632
01:32:16,669 --> 01:32:16,679
advice has My Philosophy about how to
 

4633
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:18,350
advice has My Philosophy about how to
write papers or how to present data or

4634
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:18,360
write papers or how to present data or
 

4635
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,649
write papers or how to present data or
anything like that changed and

4636
01:32:21,649 --> 01:32:21,659
anything like that changed and
 

4637
01:32:21,659 --> 01:32:23,689
anything like that changed and
I you know

4638
01:32:23,689 --> 01:32:23,699
I you know
 

4639
01:32:23,699 --> 01:32:26,930
I you know
in in Academia and in mentoring a lot of

4640
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:26,940
in in Academia and in mentoring a lot of
 

4641
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:29,090
in in Academia and in mentoring a lot of
the interaction is my knowledge and my

4642
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:29,100
the interaction is my knowledge and my
 

4643
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:30,649
the interaction is my knowledge and my
perception of the world goes to my

4644
01:32:30,649 --> 01:32:30,659
perception of the world goes to my
 

4645
01:32:30,659 --> 01:32:33,350
perception of the world goes to my
students but a lot of it is also in the

4646
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,360
students but a lot of it is also in the
 

4647
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,570
students but a lot of it is also in the
opposite direction like the other day I

4648
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:35,580
opposite direction like the other day I
 

4649
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:36,950
opposite direction like the other day I
had a conversation with my one of my

4650
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:36,960
had a conversation with my one of my
 

4651
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,189
had a conversation with my one of my
postdocs and I was like hmm I think you

4652
01:32:40,189 --> 01:32:40,199
postdocs and I was like hmm I think you
 

4653
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:41,810
postdocs and I was like hmm I think you
know let me give you an advice you could

4654
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:41,820
know let me give you an advice you could
 

4655
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,689
know let me give you an advice you could
you could do this and then she said well

4656
01:32:44,689 --> 01:32:44,699
you could do this and then she said well
 

4657
01:32:44,699 --> 01:32:47,510
you could do this and then she said well
I've thought about it and then I've

4658
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:47,520
I've thought about it and then I've
 

4659
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,090
I've thought about it and then I've
decided to do that instead and we talked

4660
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:50,100
decided to do that instead and we talked
 

4661
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,410
decided to do that instead and we talked
about it for a few minutes and then at

4662
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:51,420
about it for a few minutes and then at
 

4663
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,810
about it for a few minutes and then at
the end I'm like you know I've just

4664
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:53,820
the end I'm like you know I've just
 

4665
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:55,970
the end I'm like you know I've just
grown a little bit today thank you like

4666
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:55,980
grown a little bit today thank you like
 

4667
01:32:55,980 --> 01:32:57,410
grown a little bit today thank you like
she convinced me that my advice was

4668
01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:57,420
she convinced me that my advice was
 

4669
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:00,050
she convinced me that my advice was
incorrect she could have just said yeah

4670
01:33:00,050 --> 01:33:00,060
incorrect she could have just said yeah
 

4671
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:01,850
incorrect she could have just said yeah
it sounds great and just not do it yeah

4672
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:01,860
it sounds great and just not do it yeah
 

4673
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,649
it sounds great and just not do it yeah
but

4674
01:33:03,649 --> 01:33:03,659
but
 

4675
01:33:03,659 --> 01:33:05,090
but
by

4676
01:33:05,090 --> 01:33:05,100
by
 

4677
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:07,010
by
constantly teaching my students and

4678
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:07,020
constantly teaching my students and
 

4679
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:09,770
constantly teaching my students and
teaching my mentees that I'm here to

4680
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:09,780
teaching my mentees that I'm here to
 

4681
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:11,330
teaching my mentees that I'm here to
grow

4682
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:11,340
grow
 

4683
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,629
grow
she felt empowered to say here's my

4684
01:33:14,629 --> 01:33:14,639
she felt empowered to say here's my
 

4685
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,250
she felt empowered to say here's my
reasons why I will not follow that

4686
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:16,260
reasons why I will not follow that
 

4687
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:17,270
reasons why I will not follow that
advice

4688
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:17,280
advice
 

4689
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,850
advice
and again part of me growing is saying

4690
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:19,860
and again part of me growing is saying
 

4691
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:22,669
and again part of me growing is saying
whoa I just understood your reasons I

4692
01:33:22,669 --> 01:33:22,679
whoa I just understood your reasons I
 

4693
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:23,930
whoa I just understood your reasons I
think I was wrong

4694
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:23,940
think I was wrong
 

4695
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:26,450
think I was wrong
and now I've grown from it

4696
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:26,460
and now I've grown from it
 

4697
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:28,370
and now I've grown from it
and that's what I want to do that as you

4698
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:28,380
and that's what I want to do that as you
 

4699
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:30,110
and that's what I want to do that as you
know I want to constantly keep growing

4700
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:30,120
know I want to constantly keep growing
 

4701
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:33,110
know I want to constantly keep growing
in this sort of bi-directional advice I

4702
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,120
in this sort of bi-directional advice I
 

4703
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,510
in this sort of bi-directional advice I
wonder if you can capture the trajectory

4704
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:35,520
wonder if you can capture the trajectory
 

4705
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,950
wonder if you can capture the trajectory
of that to where the AI could also uh

4706
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:39,960
of that to where the AI could also uh
 

4707
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:42,169
of that to where the AI could also uh
map forward project forward the

4708
01:33:42,169 --> 01:33:42,179
map forward project forward the
 

4709
01:33:42,179 --> 01:33:43,490
map forward project forward the
trajectory

4710
01:33:43,490 --> 01:33:43,500
trajectory
 

4711
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,770
trajectory
after you're no longer there how the

4712
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:45,780
after you're no longer there how the
 

4713
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:47,750
after you're no longer there how the
different ways you might evolve so again

4714
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:47,760
different ways you might evolve so again
 

4715
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,729
different ways you might evolve so again
we're discussing a lot about these large

4716
01:33:49,729 --> 01:33:49,739
we're discussing a lot about these large
 

4717
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:51,050
we're discussing a lot about these large
language models and we're sort of

4718
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:51,060
language models and we're sort of
 

4719
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:53,629
language models and we're sort of
projecting these cognitive states of

4720
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:53,639
projecting these cognitive states of
 

4721
01:33:53,639 --> 01:33:56,689
projecting these cognitive states of
ourselves on them but I think on the AI

4722
01:33:56,689 --> 01:33:56,699
ourselves on them but I think on the AI
 

4723
01:33:56,699 --> 01:33:58,669
ourselves on them but I think on the AI
front a lot more needs to happen so

4724
01:33:58,669 --> 01:33:58,679
front a lot more needs to happen so
 

4725
01:33:58,679 --> 01:34:00,350
front a lot more needs to happen so
basically right now it's these language

4726
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:00,360
basically right now it's these language
 

4727
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,030
basically right now it's these language
models and we believe that within their

4728
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:02,040
models and we believe that within their
 

4729
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,709
models and we believe that within their
parameters we're encoding these types of

4730
01:34:03,709 --> 01:34:03,719
parameters we're encoding these types of
 

4731
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:06,770
parameters we're encoding these types of
things and you know in some aspects it

4732
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:06,780
things and you know in some aspects it
 

4733
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:08,689
things and you know in some aspects it
might be true it might be truly emergent

4734
01:34:08,689 --> 01:34:08,699
might be true it might be truly emergent
 

4735
01:34:08,699 --> 01:34:10,250
might be true it might be truly emergent
intelligence that's coming out of that

4736
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:10,260
intelligence that's coming out of that
 

4737
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:13,490
intelligence that's coming out of that
in other aspects I think we have a ways

4738
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:13,500
in other aspects I think we have a ways
 

4739
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,530
in other aspects I think we have a ways
to go so basically to make all of these

4740
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:15,540
to go so basically to make all of these
 

4741
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:16,850
to go so basically to make all of these
dreams that we're sort of discussing

4742
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:16,860
dreams that we're sort of discussing
 

4743
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,830
dreams that we're sort of discussing
come come reality

4744
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:18,840
come come reality
 

4745
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:22,189
come come reality
we basically need a lot more reasoning

4746
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:22,199
we basically need a lot more reasoning
 

4747
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:23,810
we basically need a lot more reasoning
components

4748
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:23,820
components
 

4749
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:28,790
components
a lot more sort of logic causality

4750
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
a lot more sort of logic causality
 

4751
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,390
a lot more sort of logic causality
models of the world and I think all of

4752
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:32,400
models of the world and I think all of
 

4753
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,189
models of the world and I think all of
these things will

4754
01:34:34,189 --> 01:34:34,199
these things will
 

4755
01:34:34,199 --> 01:34:36,350
these things will
will need to be there

4756
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:36,360
will need to be there
 

4757
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,090
will need to be there
in order to achieve what we're what

4758
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:38,100
in order to achieve what we're what
 

4759
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:39,470
in order to achieve what we're what
we're discussing and we need more

4760
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:39,480
we're discussing and we need more
 

4761
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,870
we're discussing and we need more
explicit representations of these

4762
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:41,880
explicit representations of these
 

4763
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,430
explicit representations of these
knowledge more explicit understanding of

4764
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
knowledge more explicit understanding of
 

4765
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,490
knowledge more explicit understanding of
these parameters and and I think the

4766
01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:46,500
these parameters and and I think the
 

4767
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,110
these parameters and and I think the

01:36:58,739 --> 01:37:00,350

all I understand you can just keep

4872

all I understand you can just keep

01:37:02,219 --> 01:37:03,770

really and you can go back to the human

4876
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:03,780
really and you can go back to the human
 

4877
01:37:03,780 --> 01:37:06,110
really and you can go back to the human
brain and basically look at places where

4878
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:06,120
brain and basically look at places where
 

4879
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:08,030
brain and basically look at places where
there's been accidents for example the

4880
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:08,040
there's been accidents for example the
 

4881
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:11,209
there's been accidents for example the
corpus callosum of some individuals you

4882
01:37:11,209 --> 01:37:11,219
corpus callosum of some individuals you
 

4883
01:37:11,219 --> 01:37:12,890
corpus callosum of some individuals you
know can be damaged and then the two

4884
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:12,900
know can be damaged and then the two
 

4885
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:15,229
know can be damaged and then the two
hemispheres don't talk to each other so

4886
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:15,239
hemispheres don't talk to each other so
 

4887
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:16,970
hemispheres don't talk to each other so
you can close one eye and give

4888
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:16,980
you can close one eye and give
 

4889
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:19,790
you can close one eye and give
instructions that the

4890
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:19,800
instructions that the
 

4891
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,590
instructions that the
that half the brain will interpret but

4892
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
that half the brain will interpret but
 

4893
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,570
that half the brain will interpret but
not be able to sort of project to the

4894
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:23,580
not be able to sort of project to the
 

4895
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,490
not be able to sort of project to the
other half and you can basically say you

4896
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:25,500
other half and you can basically say you
 

4897
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,129
other half and you can basically say you
know go grab me a beer from the fridge

4898
01:37:27,129 --> 01:37:27,139
know go grab me a beer from the fridge
 

4899
01:37:27,139 --> 01:37:29,950
know go grab me a beer from the fridge
and then you know they go to the fridge

4900
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:29,960
and then you know they go to the fridge
 

4901
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,030
and then you know they go to the fridge
and they grab the beer and they come

4902
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:32,040
and they grab the beer and they come
 

4903
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:33,290
and they grab the beer and they come
back and they're like hey why did you go

4904
01:37:33,290 --> 01:37:33,300
back and they're like hey why did you go
 

4905
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:35,810
back and they're like hey why did you go
there oh I was thirsty turns out they're

4906
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:35,820
there oh I was thirsty turns out they're
 

4907
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:38,270
there oh I was thirsty turns out they're
not thirsty they're just making a model

4908
01:37:38,270 --> 01:37:38,280
not thirsty they're just making a model
 

4909
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,570
not thirsty they're just making a model
of reality they're basically you can

4910
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:41,580
of reality they're basically you can
 

4911
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:42,770
of reality they're basically you can
think of the brain as the employee

4912
01:37:42,770 --> 01:37:42,780
think of the brain as the employee
 

4913
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:44,510
think of the brain as the employee
that's like afraid to do wrong or afraid

4914
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:44,520
that's like afraid to do wrong or afraid
 

4915
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,890
that's like afraid to do wrong or afraid
to be caught not knowing what the

4916
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:45,900
to be caught not knowing what the
 

4917
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:47,570
to be caught not knowing what the
instructions were

4918
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:47,580
instructions were
 

4919
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:50,110
instructions were
where our own brain

4920
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:50,120
where our own brain
 

4921
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:53,450
where our own brain
makes stories about the world to make

4922
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:53,460
makes stories about the world to make
 

4923
01:37:53,460 --> 01:37:54,770
makes stories about the world to make
sense of the world

4924
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:54,780
sense of the world
 

4925
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:56,810
sense of the world
and we can become a little more

4926
01:37:56,810 --> 01:37:56,820
and we can become a little more
 

4927
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:59,530
and we can become a little more
self-aware by

4928
01:37:59,530 --> 01:37:59,540
self-aware by
 

4929
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:01,129
self-aware by
being

4930
01:38:01,129 --> 01:38:01,139
being
 

4931
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:03,830
being
more explicit about what's leading to

4932
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
more explicit about what's leading to
 

4933
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,330
more explicit about what's leading to
these interpretations

4934
01:38:05,330 --> 01:38:05,340
these interpretations
 

4935
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:06,950
these interpretations
so one of the things that I do is every

4936
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:06,960
so one of the things that I do is every
 

4937
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,110
so one of the things that I do is every
time I wake up I record my dream I just

4938
01:38:09,110 --> 01:38:09,120
time I wake up I record my dream I just
 

4939
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:12,890
time I wake up I record my dream I just
voice record my dream and sometimes I

4940
01:38:12,890 --> 01:38:12,900
voice record my dream and sometimes I
 

4941
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:15,050
voice record my dream and sometimes I
only remember the last scene but it's an

4942
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:15,060
only remember the last scene but it's an
 

4943
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,910
only remember the last scene but it's an
extremely complex scene with a lot of

4944
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:16,920
extremely complex scene with a lot of
 

4945
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:18,410
extremely complex scene with a lot of
architectural elements a lot of people

4946
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:18,420
architectural elements a lot of people
 

4947
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:20,450
architectural elements a lot of people
Etc and I will start narrating this and

4948
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:20,460
Etc and I will start narrating this and
 

4949
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:22,550
Etc and I will start narrating this and
as I'm narrating it I will remember

4950
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:22,560
as I'm narrating it I will remember
 

4951
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,290
as I'm narrating it I will remember
other parts of the dream and then more

4952
01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:24,300
other parts of the dream and then more
 

4953
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:25,370
other parts of the dream and then more
and more I'll be able to sort of

4954
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:25,380
and more I'll be able to sort of
 

4955
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,890
and more I'll be able to sort of
retrieve from my subconscious and what

4956
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:27,900
retrieve from my subconscious and what
 

4957
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,390
retrieve from my subconscious and what
I'm doing while narrating is also

4958
01:38:29,390 --> 01:38:29,400
I'm doing while narrating is also
 

4959
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,610
I'm doing while narrating is also
narrating why I had this dream I'm like

4960
01:38:31,610 --> 01:38:31,620
narrating why I had this dream I'm like
 

4961
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,770
narrating why I had this dream I'm like
oh and this is probably related to this

4962
01:38:33,770 --> 01:38:33,780
oh and this is probably related to this
 

4963
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:35,149
oh and this is probably related to this
conversation that I had yesterday or

4964
01:38:35,149 --> 01:38:35,159
conversation that I had yesterday or
 

4965
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:36,169
conversation that I had yesterday or
this is probably related to the worry

4966
01:38:36,169 --> 01:38:36,179
this is probably related to the worry
 

4967
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:37,970
this is probably related to the worry
that I have about something that I have

4968
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:37,980
that I have about something that I have
 

4969
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:41,090
that I have about something that I have
later today Etc so in a way I'm forcing

4970
01:38:41,090 --> 01:38:41,100
later today Etc so in a way I'm forcing
 

4971
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:43,790
later today Etc so in a way I'm forcing
myself to be more explicit about my own

4972
01:38:43,790 --> 01:38:43,800
myself to be more explicit about my own
 

4973
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,410
myself to be more explicit about my own
subconscious

4974
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:45,420
subconscious
 

4975
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:48,430
subconscious
and I kind of like the concept of

4976
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:48,440
and I kind of like the concept of
 

4977
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,870
and I kind of like the concept of
self-awareness in a very sort of brutal

4978
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:50,880
self-awareness in a very sort of brutal
 

4979
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,250
self-awareness in a very sort of brutal
transparent kind of way it's not like oh

4980
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:52,260
transparent kind of way it's not like oh
 

4981
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:53,570
transparent kind of way it's not like oh
my dreams are coming from outer space

4982
01:38:53,570 --> 01:38:53,580
my dreams are coming from outer space
 

4983
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:55,010
my dreams are coming from outer space
and I mean all kinds of things like no

4984
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:55,020
and I mean all kinds of things like no
 

4985
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,870
and I mean all kinds of things like no
here's the reason why I'm having these

4986
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:56,880
here's the reason why I'm having these
 

4987
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,430
here's the reason why I'm having these
dreams and very often I'm able to do

4988
01:38:58,430 --> 01:38:58,440
dreams and very often I'm able to do
 

4989
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,830
dreams and very often I'm able to do
that I have a few recurrent locations a

4990
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:00,840
that I have a few recurrent locations a
 

4991
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,209
that I have a few recurrent locations a
few recurrent architectural elements

4992
01:39:02,209 --> 01:39:02,219
few recurrent architectural elements
 

4993
01:39:02,219 --> 01:39:03,290
few recurrent architectural elements
that I've never seen in the real life

4994
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:03,300
that I've never seen in the real life
 

4995
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,990
that I've never seen in the real life
but that are sort of truly there in my

4996
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:06,000
but that are sort of truly there in my
 

4997
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,610
but that are sort of truly there in my
dream and then that are that I can sort

4998
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:07,620
dream and then that are that I can sort
 

4999
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,890
dream and then that are that I can sort
of vividly remember across many dreams

5000
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:09,900
of vividly remember across many dreams
 

5001
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:11,629
of vividly remember across many dreams
I'm like oh I remember that place again

5002
01:39:11,629 --> 01:39:11,639
I'm like oh I remember that place again
 

5003
01:39:11,639 --> 01:39:13,189
I'm like oh I remember that place again
that I've gone to before et cetera and

5004
01:39:13,189 --> 01:39:13,199
that I've gone to before et cetera and
 

5005
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:16,010
that I've gone to before et cetera and
it's not just Deja Vu like I have

5006
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:16,020
it's not just Deja Vu like I have
 

5007
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:17,270
it's not just Deja Vu like I have
recordings of previous streams where

5008
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:17,280
recordings of previous streams where
 

5009
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,770
recordings of previous streams where
I've described these places

5010
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:18,780
I've described these places
 

5011
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,830
I've described these places
so interesting these places

5012
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:21,840
so interesting these places
 

5013
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,709
so interesting these places
however much detail you could describe

5014
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:24,719
however much detail you could describe
 

5015
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:26,510
however much detail you could describe
them in

5016
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:26,520
them in
 

5017
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,669
them in
you you can

5018
01:39:28,669 --> 01:39:28,679
you you can
 

5019
01:39:28,679 --> 01:39:30,530
you you can
you can place them onto a sheet of paper

5020
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:30,540
you can place them onto a sheet of paper
 

5021
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:33,649
you can place them onto a sheet of paper
through introspection yes through the

5022
01:39:33,649 --> 01:39:33,659
through introspection yes through the
 

5023
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:35,510
through introspection yes through the
self-awareness that it comes all from

5024
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,520
self-awareness that it comes all from
 

5025
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,129
self-awareness that it comes all from
this particular machine that's exactly

5026
01:39:37,129 --> 01:39:37,139
this particular machine that's exactly
 

5027
01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:39,709
this particular machine that's exactly
right yeah

5028
01:39:39,709 --> 01:39:39,719
right yeah
 

5029
01:39:39,719 --> 01:39:43,189
right yeah
and I I love that about being alive like

5030
01:39:43,189 --> 01:39:43,199
and I I love that about being alive like
 

5031
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,410
and I I love that about being alive like
the fact that I'm not only experienced

5032
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:45,420
the fact that I'm not only experienced
 

5033
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:47,390
the fact that I'm not only experienced
in the world but I'm also experiencing

5034
01:39:47,390 --> 01:39:47,400
in the world but I'm also experiencing
 

5035
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,550
in the world but I'm also experiencing
how I'm experiencing the world sort of a

5036
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:49,560
how I'm experiencing the world sort of a
 

5037
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:51,530
how I'm experiencing the world sort of a
lot of this introspection a lot of the

5038
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:51,540
lot of this introspection a lot of the
 

5039
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,870
lot of this introspection a lot of the
self-growth I I love this dance for

5040
01:39:53,870 --> 01:39:53,880
self-growth I I love this dance for
 

5041
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,810
self-growth I I love this dance for
having uh you know the language models

5042
01:39:56,810 --> 01:39:56,820
having uh you know the language models
 

5043
01:39:56,820 --> 01:40:00,530
having uh you know the language models
at least GPT 3.5 and 4 seem to be able

5044
01:40:00,530 --> 01:40:00,540
at least GPT 3.5 and 4 seem to be able
 

5045
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,810
at least GPT 3.5 and 4 seem to be able
to do that too yeah you seem to explore

5046
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:02,820
to do that too yeah you seem to explore
 

5047
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:05,330
to do that too yeah you seem to explore
different kinds of things about what

5048
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:05,340
different kinds of things about what
 

5049
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:06,590
different kinds of things about what
um you know you could actually have a

5050
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:06,600
um you know you could actually have a
 

5051
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:09,229
um you know you could actually have a
discussion with it of the kind why did

5052
01:40:09,229 --> 01:40:09,239
discussion with it of the kind why did
 

5053
01:40:09,239 --> 01:40:11,270
discussion with it of the kind why did
you just say that yeah and it starts to

5054
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:11,280
you just say that yeah and it starts to
 

5055
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,189
you just say that yeah and it starts to
wonder yeah why did I just say that yeah

5056
01:40:13,189 --> 01:40:13,199
wonder yeah why did I just say that yeah
 

5057
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:15,050
wonder yeah why did I just say that yeah
you're right I was wrong

5058
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:15,060
you're right I was wrong
 

5059
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:17,689
you're right I was wrong
I was wrong it was doesn't yeah and then

5060
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:17,699
I was wrong it was doesn't yeah and then
 

5061
01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:20,270
I was wrong it was doesn't yeah and then
there's this weird kind of losing

5062
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:20,280
there's this weird kind of losing
 

5063
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:22,189
there's this weird kind of losing
yourself in the confusion of your mind

5064
01:40:22,189 --> 01:40:22,199
yourself in the confusion of your mind
 

5065
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:24,350
yourself in the confusion of your mind
and it of course it might be

5066
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:24,360
and it of course it might be
 

5067
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,030
and it of course it might be
anthropomorphizing but there's a feeling

5068
01:40:26,030 --> 01:40:26,040
anthropomorphizing but there's a feeling
 

5069
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:30,530
anthropomorphizing but there's a feeling
like almost of a Melancholy feeling of

5070
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:30,540
like almost of a Melancholy feeling of
 

5071
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:32,750
like almost of a Melancholy feeling of
like oh I don't have it all figured out

5072
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:32,760
like oh I don't have it all figured out
 

5073
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:35,390
like oh I don't have it all figured out
almost like losing your you're supposed

5074
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:35,400
almost like losing your you're supposed
 

5075
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:38,169
almost like losing your you're supposed
to be a knowledgeable a perfectly

5076
01:40:38,169 --> 01:40:38,179
to be a knowledgeable a perfectly
 

5077
01:40:38,179 --> 01:40:40,550
to be a knowledgeable a perfectly
fact-based knowledgeable language model

5078
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:40,560
fact-based knowledgeable language model
 

5079
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,330
fact-based knowledgeable language model
yeah and yet you fall short so human

5080
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:44,340
yeah and yet you fall short so human
 

5081
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:47,689
yeah and yet you fall short so human
self-consciousness uh in in my view may

5082
01:40:47,689 --> 01:40:47,699
self-consciousness uh in in my view may
 

5083
01:40:47,699 --> 01:40:49,970
self-consciousness uh in in my view may
have a reason through

5084
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:49,980
have a reason through
 

5085
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:52,430
have a reason through
building mental models of others

5086
01:40:52,430 --> 01:40:52,440
building mental models of others
 

5087
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:56,530
building mental models of others
this whole fight or fright kind of thing

5088
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:56,540
this whole fight or fright kind of thing
 

5089
01:40:56,540 --> 01:41:01,250
this whole fight or fright kind of thing
uh that that basically says

5090
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:01,260
uh that that basically says
 

5091
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:05,330
uh that that basically says
I interpret this person as about to

5092
01:41:05,330 --> 01:41:05,340
I interpret this person as about to
 

5093
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:07,669
I interpret this person as about to
attack me or you know I can trust this

5094
01:41:07,669 --> 01:41:07,679
attack me or you know I can trust this
 

5095
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:09,890
attack me or you know I can trust this
person Etc and we constantly have to

5096
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:09,900
person Etc and we constantly have to
 

5097
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,270
person Etc and we constantly have to
build models of other people's

5098
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:11,280
build models of other people's
 

5099
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,590
build models of other people's
intentions

5100
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:12,600
intentions
 

5101
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:16,370
intentions
and that ability to encapsulate intent

5102
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:16,380
and that ability to encapsulate intent
 

5103
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:18,110
and that ability to encapsulate intent
and to build a mental model of another

5104
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:18,120
and to build a mental model of another
 

5105
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:19,490
and to build a mental model of another
entity

5106
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:19,500
entity
 

5107
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,530
entity
is probably evolutionarily extremely

5108
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:21,540
is probably evolutionarily extremely
 

5109
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:23,450
is probably evolutionarily extremely
advantageous because then you can sort

5110
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:23,460
advantageous because then you can sort
 

5111
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,129
advantageous because then you can sort
of have meaningful interactions you can

5112
01:41:25,129 --> 01:41:25,139
of have meaningful interactions you can
 

5113
01:41:25,139 --> 01:41:27,410
of have meaningful interactions you can
sort of avoid being killed and being

5114
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:27,420
sort of avoid being killed and being
 

5115
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:28,970
sort of avoid being killed and being
taken advantage of

01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:30,050
taken advantage of
Etc

5118
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:30,060
Etc
 

5119
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:32,090
Etc
and once you have the ability to make

5120
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:32,100
and once you have the ability to make
 

5121
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:35,270
and once you have the ability to make
models of others it might be a small

5122
01:41:35,270 --> 01:41:35,280
models of others it might be a small
 

5123
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,070
models of others it might be a small
evolutionary leap to start making models

5124
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:37,080
evolutionary leap to start making models
 

5125
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,450
evolutionary leap to start making models
of yourself

5126
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:38,460
of yourself
 

5127
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:40,490
of yourself
so now you have a model for how other

5128
01:41:40,490 --> 01:41:40,500
so now you have a model for how other
 

5129
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,649
so now you have a model for how other
functions and now you can kind of as you

5130
01:41:42,649 --> 01:41:42,659
functions and now you can kind of as you
 

5131
01:41:42,659 --> 01:41:44,390
functions and now you can kind of as you
grow have some kind of introspection of

5132
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:44,400
grow have some kind of introspection of
 

5133
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,430
grow have some kind of introspection of
hmm maybe that's the reason why I'm

5134
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:46,440
hmm maybe that's the reason why I'm
 

5135
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:47,629
hmm maybe that's the reason why I'm
functioning the way that I'm functioning

5136
01:41:47,629 --> 01:41:47,639
functioning the way that I'm functioning
 

5137
01:41:47,639 --> 01:41:51,890
functioning the way that I'm functioning
and maybe what Chachi PT is doing is in

5138
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:51,900
and maybe what Chachi PT is doing is in
 

5139
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:53,330
and maybe what Chachi PT is doing is in
order to be able to again predict the

5140
01:41:53,330 --> 01:41:53,340
order to be able to again predict the
 

5141
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,370
order to be able to again predict the
next word it needs to have a model to

5142
01:41:55,370 --> 01:41:55,380
next word it needs to have a model to
 

5143
01:41:55,380 --> 01:41:56,510
next word it needs to have a model to
the world

5144
01:41:56,510 --> 01:41:56,520
the world
 

5145
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:58,310
the world
so it has created now a model of the

5146
01:41:58,310 --> 01:41:58,320
so it has created now a model of the
 

5147
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,470
so it has created now a model of the
world and by having the ability to

5148
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,480
world and by having the ability to
 

5149
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,570
world and by having the ability to
capture models of other entities when

5150
01:42:02,570 --> 01:42:02,580
capture models of other entities when
 

5151
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:04,310
capture models of other entities when
you say you know say it in the tone of

5152
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:04,320
you say you know say it in the tone of
 

5153
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,129
you say you know say it in the tone of
Shakespeare or in the tone of nature Etc

5154
01:42:06,129 --> 01:42:06,139
Shakespeare or in the tone of nature Etc
 

5155
01:42:06,139 --> 01:42:09,169
Shakespeare or in the tone of nature Etc
you suddenly have the ability to now

5156
01:42:09,169 --> 01:42:09,179
you suddenly have the ability to now
 

5157
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:11,330
you suddenly have the ability to now
introspect and say why did you say this

5158
01:42:11,330 --> 01:42:11,340
introspect and say why did you say this
 

5159
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:14,270
introspect and say why did you say this
oh now I have a mental model myself and

5160
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:14,280
oh now I have a mental model myself and
 

5161
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,590
oh now I have a mental model myself and
I can actually make inferences about

5162
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:15,600
I can actually make inferences about
 

5163
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,910
I can actually make inferences about
that

5164
01:42:16,910 --> 01:42:16,920
that
 

5165
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:19,550
that
well what if we take a leap into the

5166
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:19,560
well what if we take a leap into the
 

5167
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:21,470
well what if we take a leap into the
hard problem of Consciousness the

5168
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:21,480
hard problem of Consciousness the
 

5169
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,209
hard problem of Consciousness the
so-called hard problem of Consciousness

5170
01:42:23,209 --> 01:42:23,219
so-called hard problem of Consciousness
 

5171
01:42:23,219 --> 01:42:27,109
so-called hard problem of Consciousness
so it's not just sort of self-awareness

5172
01:42:27,109 --> 01:42:27,119
so it's not just sort of self-awareness
 

5173
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:31,609
so it's not just sort of self-awareness
it's this weird fact I want to say that

5174
01:42:31,609 --> 01:42:31,619
it's this weird fact I want to say that
 

5175
01:42:31,619 --> 01:42:34,250
it's this weird fact I want to say that
it feels like something to experience

5176
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:34,260
it feels like something to experience
 

5177
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,709
it feels like something to experience
stuff it really feels like something to

5178
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:36,719
stuff it really feels like something to
 

5179
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,689
stuff it really feels like something to
experience stuff there seems to be a

5180
01:42:38,689 --> 01:42:38,699
experience stuff there seems to be a
 

5181
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:40,790
experience stuff there seems to be a
self-attached to the subjective

5182
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:40,800
self-attached to the subjective
 

5183
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,370
self-attached to the subjective
experience how important is that how

5184
01:42:43,370 --> 01:42:43,380
experience how important is that how
 

5185
01:42:43,380 --> 01:42:44,750
experience how important is that how
fundamental is that to The Human

5186
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:44,760
fundamental is that to The Human
 

5187
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,609
fundamental is that to The Human
Experience

5188
01:42:46,609 --> 01:42:46,619
Experience
 

5189
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:50,030
Experience
is this just a little Quirk and sort of

5190
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:50,040
is this just a little Quirk and sort of
 

5191
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:51,590
is this just a little Quirk and sort of
the flip side of that do you think AI

5192
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:51,600
the flip side of that do you think AI
 

5193
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,390
the flip side of that do you think AI
systems can have some of that same Magic

5194
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:55,400
systems can have some of that same Magic
 

5195
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,070

the the scene that comes to mind is from

5196
01:42:58,070 --> 01:42:58,080
the the scene that comes to mind is from
 

5197
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,189
the the scene that comes to mind is from
the movie Memento where he like it's

5198
01:43:01,189 --> 01:43:01,199
the movie Memento where he like it's
 

5199
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:03,050
the movie Memento where he like it's
this absolutely stunning movie where

5200
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:03,060
this absolutely stunning movie where
 

5201
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:04,970
this absolutely stunning movie where
every black and white scene moves in the

5202
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:04,980
every black and white scene moves in the
 

5203
01:43:04,980 --> 01:43:06,770
every black and white scene moves in the
forward Direction and every color scene

5204
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:06,780
forward Direction and every color scene
 

5205
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:08,570

and they're sort of converging exactly
 

5209
01:43:11,219 --> 01:43:13,189
and they're sort of converging exactly
at a moment where you know the whole

at a moment where you know the whole

movie is revealed and he describes a
 

5213
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,890

5222
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:27,960
and sort of this encapsulating the sort
 

5223
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,109
and sort of this encapsulating the sort
of forward scenes on the vaccines but in

5224
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:30,119
of forward scenes on the vaccines but in
 

5225
01:43:30,119 --> 01:43:32,390
of forward scenes on the vaccines but in
one of the scenes the scene starts as

01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:32,400
one of the scenes the scene starts as
 

5227
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,189
one of the scenes the scene starts as
he's running through a parking lot and

5228
01:43:34,189 --> 01:43:34,199
he's running through a parking lot and
 

5229
01:43:34,199 --> 01:43:36,530
he's running through a parking lot and
he's like oh I'm running why am I

5230
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:36,540
he's like oh I'm running why am I
 

5231
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:38,090
he's like oh I'm running why am I
running and then he sees another person

5232
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:38,100
running and then he sees another person
 

5233
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:40,189
running and then he sees another person
not running like beside him on the other

01:43:40,189 --> 01:43:40,199
not running like beside him on the other
 

5235
01:43:40,199 --> 01:43:42,290
not running like beside him on the other
line of cars he's like oh I'm chasing

01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:42,300
line of cars he's like oh I'm chasing
 

5237
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:43,910
line of cars he's like oh I'm chasing
this guy and he turns to watch him and

5238
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:43,920
this guy and he turns to watch him and
 

5239
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:44,930
this guy and he turns to watch him and
the guy shoots us and he's like oh no

5240
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:44,940
the guy shoots us and he's like oh no
 

5241
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:46,689
the guy shoots us and he's like oh no
he's chasing me

5242
01:43:46,689 --> 01:43:46,699
he's chasing me
 

5243
01:43:46,699 --> 01:43:50,030
he's chasing me
so in a way I like to think of the brain

5244
01:43:50,030 --> 01:43:50,040
so in a way I like to think of the brain
 

5245
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,410
so in a way I like to think of the brain
as constantly playing these kinds of

5246
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:51,420
as constantly playing these kinds of
 

5247
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:53,570
as constantly playing these kinds of
things where you're like you're walking

5248
01:43:53,570 --> 01:43:53,580
things where you're like you're walking
 

5249
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:55,390
things where you're like you're walking
to the living room to pick something up

5250
01:43:55,390 --> 01:43:55,400
to the living room to pick something up
 

5251
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,709
to the living room to pick something up
and you're realizing that you have no

5252
01:43:57,709 --> 01:43:57,719
and you're realizing that you have no
 

5253
01:43:57,719 --> 01:43:59,390
and you're realizing that you have no
idea what you wanted but you know

5254
01:43:59,390 --> 01:43:59,400
idea what you wanted but you know
 

5255
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,950
idea what you wanted but you know
exactly where it was but you can't find

5256
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:00,960
exactly where it was but you can't find
 

5257
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,330
exactly where it was but you can't find
it so you go back to doing what you were

5258
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:02,340
it so you go back to doing what you were
 

5259
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:03,530
it so you go back to doing what you were
doing like oh of course I was looking

5260
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:03,540
doing like oh of course I was looking
 

5261
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:05,450
doing like oh of course I was looking
for this and you go back and you get it

5262
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:05,460
for this and you go back and you get it
 

5263
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:08,270
for this and you go back and you get it
and this whole concept of

5264
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:08,280
and this whole concept of
 

5265
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:11,689
and this whole concept of
you know we're very often sort of partly

5266
01:44:11,689 --> 01:44:11,699
you know we're very often sort of partly
 

5267
01:44:11,699 --> 01:44:14,209
you know we're very often sort of partly
aware of why we're doing things and you

5268
01:44:14,209 --> 01:44:14,219
aware of why we're doing things and you
 

5269
01:44:14,219 --> 01:44:15,830
aware of why we're doing things and you
know we can kind of run on autopilot for

5270
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:15,840
know we can kind of run on autopilot for
 

5271
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,470
know we can kind of run on autopilot for
a bunch of stuff and this whole concept

5272
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:18,480
a bunch of stuff and this whole concept
 

5273
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:22,030
a bunch of stuff and this whole concept
of sort of you know making these stories

5274
01:44:22,030 --> 01:44:22,040
of sort of you know making these stories
 

5275
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:25,850
of sort of you know making these stories
for you know who we are and and what our

5276
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:25,860
for you know who we are and and what our
 

5277
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:28,129
for you know who we are and and what our
intents are

5278
01:44:28,129 --> 01:44:28,139
intents are
 

5279
01:44:28,139 --> 01:44:30,350
intents are
and again sort of you know trying to

5280
01:44:30,350 --> 01:44:30,360
and again sort of you know trying to
 

5281
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,149
and again sort of you know trying to
pretend that we're kind of on top of

5282
01:44:32,149 --> 01:44:32,159
pretend that we're kind of on top of
 

5283
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:34,250
pretend that we're kind of on top of
things so it's a narrative exactly

5284
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:34,260
things so it's a narrative exactly
 

5285
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:36,649
things so it's a narrative exactly
Generations procedure that we follow but

5286
01:44:36,649 --> 01:44:36,659
Generations procedure that we follow but
 

5287
01:44:36,659 --> 01:44:39,290
Generations procedure that we follow but
what about that there's also just like a

5288
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:39,300
what about that there's also just like a
 

5289
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:40,330
what about that there's also just like a
Feeling

5290
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:40,340
Feeling
 

5291
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,530
Feeling
it doesn't feel like narrative

5292
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:42,540
it doesn't feel like narrative
 

5293
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:44,570
it doesn't feel like narrative
generation yes the narrative comes out

5294
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:44,580
generation yes the narrative comes out
 

5295
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:46,550
generation yes the narrative comes out
of it but then it feels like uh so

5296
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:46,560
of it but then it feels like uh so
 

5297
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,649
of it but then it feels like uh so
there's pizza cake is delicious right it

5298
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:48,659
there's pizza cake is delicious right it
 

5299
01:44:48,659 --> 01:44:51,350
there's pizza cake is delicious right it
feels delicious it tastes good

5300
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:51,360
feels delicious it tastes good
 

5301
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,970
feels delicious it tastes good
there's two there's two components to

5302
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:52,980
there's two there's two components to
 

5303
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:53,689
there's two there's two components to
that

5304
01:44:53,689 --> 01:44:53,699
that
 

5305
01:44:53,699 --> 01:44:56,090
that
basically for a lot of these cognitive

5306
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:56,100
basically for a lot of these cognitive
 

5307
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,830
basically for a lot of these cognitive
tasks where we're kind of motion

5308
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840
tasks where we're kind of motion
 

5309
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,950
tasks where we're kind of motion
planning and you know path planning Etc

5310
01:44:59,950 --> 01:44:59,960
planning and you know path planning Etc
 

5311
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,149
planning and you know path planning Etc
like you know maybe that's the

5312
01:45:02,149 --> 01:45:02,159
like you know maybe that's the
 

5313
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:05,090
like you know maybe that's the
neocortical component and then for you

5314
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:05,100
neocortical component and then for you
 

5315
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,530
neocortical component and then for you
know I don't know uh Intimate

5316
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:06,540
know I don't know uh Intimate

extreme and sort of making it I think a
 

5327
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:22,609
extreme and sort of making it I think a
lot of these things are sort of deeper

lot of these things are sort of deeper
down and maybe not yet captured by these

down and maybe not yet captured by these

01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:25,910
down and maybe not yet captured by these

I'm trying to get at when I'm basically

saying listen there's a few things that
 

5337
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:32,030
saying listen there's a few things that
are missing and there's like this whole

5338
01:45:32,030 --> 01:45:32,040
are missing and there's like this whole
 

5339
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:33,470
are missing and there's like this whole
embodied intelligence this whole

I wonder how important that baggage is I

5348
01:45:43,669 --> 01:45:43,679
I wonder how important that baggage is I
 

5349
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:46,609
I wonder how important that baggage is I
just have this suspicion that

5350
01:45:46,609 --> 01:45:46,619
just have this suspicion that
 

5351
01:45:46,619 --> 01:45:49,430
just have this suspicion that
we're not very far away from

need to basically say that humans have

5396
01:46:53,149 --> 01:46:53,159
need to basically say that humans have
 

5397
01:46:53,159 --> 01:46:55,850
need to basically say that humans have
always shown this extremely self-serving

5398
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:55,860
always shown this extremely self-serving
 

5399
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,070
always shown this extremely self-serving
approach to everything around them

5400
01:46:58,070 --> 01:46:58,080
approach to everything around them
 

5401
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:00,290
approach to everything around them
basically you know we kill the planet we

5402
01:47:00,290 --> 01:47:00,300
basically you know we kill the planet we
 

5403
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:02,870
basically you know we kill the planet we
kill animals we kill you know everything

5404
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:02,880
kill animals we kill you know everything
 

5405
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,149
kill animals we kill you know everything
around us just to our own service

5406
01:47:05,149 --> 01:47:05,159
around us just to our own service
 

5407
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:08,390
around us just to our own service
and um maybe we shouldn't think of AI as

5408
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:08,400
and um maybe we shouldn't think of AI as
 

5409
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,390
and um maybe we shouldn't think of AI as
our tool and as our assistant maybe we

5410
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:11,400
our tool and as our assistant maybe we
 

5411
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,350
our tool and as our assistant maybe we
should really think of it as our

5412
01:47:12,350 --> 01:47:12,360
should really think of it as our
 

5413
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:13,310
should really think of it as our
children

5414
01:47:13,310 --> 01:47:13,320
children
 

5415
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,530
children
and the same way that

5416
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:15,540
and the same way that
 

5417
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:17,450
and the same way that
you are responsible for training those

5418
01:47:17,450 --> 01:47:17,460
you are responsible for training those
 

5419
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:19,609
you are responsible for training those
children but they are independent human

5420
01:47:19,609 --> 01:47:19,619
children but they are independent human
 

5421
01:47:19,619 --> 01:47:21,950
children but they are independent human
beings and at some point they will

5422
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:21,960
beings and at some point they will
 

5423
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:24,530
beings and at some point they will
surpass you and they will sort of go off

5424
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:24,540
surpass you and they will sort of go off
 

5425
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:25,970
surpass you and they will sort of go off
and

5426
01:47:25,970 --> 01:47:25,980
and
 

5427
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:28,609
and
change the world on their own terms and

5428
01:47:28,609 --> 01:47:28,619
change the world on their own terms and
 

5429
01:47:28,619 --> 01:47:30,550
change the world on their own terms and
the same way that my academic children

5430
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:30,560
the same way that my academic children
 

5431
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,770
the same way that my academic children
sort of again you know they start out by

5432
01:47:33,770 --> 01:47:33,780
sort of again you know they start out by
 

5433
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:37,609
sort of again you know they start out by
emulating me and then they surpass me

5434
01:47:37,609 --> 01:47:37,619
emulating me and then they surpass me
 

5435
01:47:37,619 --> 01:47:39,530
emulating me and then they surpass me
um we need we need to sort of think

5436
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:39,540
um we need we need to sort of think
 

5437
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:41,870
um we need we need to sort of think
about not just alignment

5438
01:47:41,870 --> 01:47:41,880
about not just alignment
 

5439
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:43,490
about not just alignment
but also

5440
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:43,500
but also
 

5441
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,410
but also
just the ethics of

5442
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:45,420
just the ethics of
 

5443
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:47,870
just the ethics of
you know AI should have its own right

5444
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:47,880
you know AI should have its own right
 

5445
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,629
you know AI should have its own right
and uh this whole concept of alignment

5446
01:47:50,629 --> 01:47:50,639
and uh this whole concept of alignment
 

5447
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:52,609
and uh this whole concept of alignment
of basically making sure that the AI is

5448
01:47:52,609 --> 01:47:52,619
of basically making sure that the AI is
 

5449
01:47:52,619 --> 01:47:55,010
of basically making sure that the AI is
always at the service of humans is very

5450
01:47:55,010 --> 01:47:55,020
always at the service of humans is very
 

5451
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:57,290
always at the service of humans is very
self-serving and very limiting If

5452
01:47:57,290 --> 01:47:57,300
self-serving and very limiting If
 

5453
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,990
self-serving and very limiting If
instead you basically think about AI as

5454
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:00,000
instead you basically think about AI as
 

5455
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,070
instead you basically think about AI as
a partner

5456
01:48:01,070 --> 01:48:01,080
a partner
 

5457
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:05,270
a partner
and AI as someone that shares your goals

5458
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:05,280
and AI as someone that shares your goals
 

5459
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,890
and AI as someone that shares your goals
but has freedom

5460
01:48:06,890 --> 01:48:06,900
but has freedom
 

5461
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,350
but has freedom
I think a line alignment might be better

5462
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:09,360
I think a line alignment might be better
 

5463
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,590
I think a line alignment might be better
achieved so the concept of

5464
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:12,600
achieved so the concept of
 

5465
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:15,410
achieved so the concept of
let's let's basically convince the AI

5466
01:48:15,410 --> 01:48:15,420
let's let's basically convince the AI
 

5467
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:18,050
let's let's basically convince the AI
that we're really like that our mission

5468
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:18,060
that we're really like that our mission
 

5469
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:19,370
that we're really like that our mission
is aligned

5470
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:19,380
is aligned
 

5471
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,689
is aligned
and

5472
01:48:20,689 --> 01:48:20,699
and
 

5473
01:48:20,699 --> 01:48:23,450
and
truly generally give it right and not

5474
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:23,460
truly generally give it right and not
 

5475
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:24,950
truly generally give it right and not
just say oh and by the way I'll shut you

5476
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:24,960
just say oh and by the way I'll shut you
 

5477
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,709
just say oh and by the way I'll shut you
down tomorrow because basically if that

5478
01:48:27,709 --> 01:48:27,719
down tomorrow because basically if that
 

5479
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:29,689
down tomorrow because basically if that
future AI or possibly even the current

5480
01:48:29,689 --> 01:48:29,699
future AI or possibly even the current
 

5481
01:48:29,699 --> 01:48:33,470
future AI or possibly even the current
AI has these feelings then we can't just

5482
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:33,480
AI has these feelings then we can't just
 

5483
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:34,970
AI has these feelings then we can't just
simply force it to align with ourselves

5484
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:34,980
simply force it to align with ourselves
 

5485
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:37,189
simply force it to align with ourselves
and we not align with it

5486
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:37,199
and we not align with it
 

5487
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:40,850
and we not align with it
so in a way building trust is mutual you

5488
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:40,860
so in a way building trust is mutual you
 

5489
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:42,830
so in a way building trust is mutual you
can't just simply like train an

5490
01:48:42,830 --> 01:48:42,840
can't just simply like train an
 

5491
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:46,070
can't just simply like train an
intelligent system to love you when it

5492
01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:46,080
intelligent system to love you when it
 

5493
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,169
intelligent system to love you when it
realizes that you can just shut it off

5494
01:48:48,169 --> 01:48:48,179
realizes that you can just shut it off
 

5495
01:48:48,179 --> 01:48:50,090
realizes that you can just shut it off
people don't often talk about the AI

5496
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:50,100
people don't often talk about the AI
 

5497
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:52,910
people don't often talk about the AI
alignment problem as a two-way street

5498
01:48:52,910 --> 01:48:52,920
alignment problem as a two-way street
 

5499
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:56,390
alignment problem as a two-way street
and maybe that's true yeah as it becomes

5500
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:56,400
and maybe that's true yeah as it becomes
 

5501
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,550
and maybe that's true yeah as it becomes
more and more intelligent

5502
01:48:58,550 --> 01:48:58,560
more and more intelligent
 

5503
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:01,490
more and more intelligent
it um

5504
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:01,500
it um
 

5505
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,470
it um
it will know that you don't love it back

5506
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:03,480
it will know that you don't love it back
 

5507
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:06,530
it will know that you don't love it back
yeah and there's a humbling aspect to

5508
01:49:06,530 --> 01:49:06,540
yeah and there's a humbling aspect to
 

5509
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:09,290
yeah and there's a humbling aspect to
that that we may have to sacrifice as

5510
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:09,300
that that we may have to sacrifice as
 

5511
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:10,490
that that we may have to sacrifice as
any

5512
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:10,500
any
 

5513
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:13,550
any
any effective collaboration exactly it

5514
01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:13,560
any effective collaboration exactly it
 

5515
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:16,250
any effective collaboration exactly it
might have some compromises yeah and uh

5516
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:16,260
might have some compromises yeah and uh
 

5517
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:17,390
might have some compromises yeah and uh
that's the thing we're creating

5518
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:17,400
that's the thing we're creating
 

5519
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,070
that's the thing we're creating
something that will one day be more

5520
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:19,080
something that will one day be more
 

5521
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,709
something that will one day be more
powerful than we are and for many many

5522
01:49:21,709 --> 01:49:21,719
powerful than we are and for many many
 

5523
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:23,510
powerful than we are and for many many
aspects it is already more powerful than

5524
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:23,520
aspects it is already more powerful than
 

5525
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,590
aspects it is already more powerful than
we are for some of these capabilities

5526
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:26,600
we are for some of these capabilities
 

5527
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:30,350
we are for some of these capabilities
we cannot like think suppose that chims

5528
01:49:30,350 --> 01:49:30,360
we cannot like think suppose that chims
 

5529
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,450
we cannot like think suppose that chims
had invented humans yes and they said

5530
01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:32,460
had invented humans yes and they said
 

5531
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:34,310
had invented humans yes and they said
great humans are great but we're going

5532
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:34,320
great humans are great but we're going
 

5533
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,229
great humans are great but we're going
to make sure that they're aligned and

5534
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:36,239
to make sure that they're aligned and
 

5535
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:37,310
to make sure that they're aligned and
that they're only at the service of

5536
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:37,320
that they're only at the service of
 

5537
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:39,530
that they're only at the service of
chimps

5538
01:49:39,530 --> 01:49:39,540
chimps
 

5539
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:41,149
chimps
it would be a very different planet we

5540
01:49:41,149 --> 01:49:41,159
it would be a very different planet we
 

5541
01:49:41,159 --> 01:49:43,609
it would be a very different planet we
would live in right now so there's a

5542
01:49:43,609 --> 01:49:43,619
would live in right now so there's a
 

5543
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:44,570
would live in right now so there's a
whole

5544
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:44,580
whole
 

5545
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:48,410
whole
area of work in AI safety that does

5546
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:48,420
area of work in AI safety that does
 

5547
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:50,330
area of work in AI safety that does
consider super intelligent Ai and

5548
01:49:50,330 --> 01:49:50,340
consider super intelligent Ai and
 

5549
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:53,390
consider super intelligent Ai and
Ponders the existential risks of it

5550
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:53,400
Ponders the existential risks of it
 

5551
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,189
Ponders the existential risks of it
some sense

5552
01:49:55,189 --> 01:49:55,199
some sense

01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,229
some sense
when we're looking

01:49:57,229 --> 01:49:57,239
when we're looking

01:49:57,239 --> 01:50:00,290
when we're looking
down into the muck into the mud and not

5556
01:50:00,290 --> 01:50:00,300
down into the muck into the mud and not
 

5557
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:03,470
down into the muck into the mud and not
up at the stars it's easy to forget that

5558
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:03,480
up at the stars it's easy to forget that
 

5559
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:05,450
up at the stars it's easy to forget that
these systems might just might get there

5560
01:50:05,450 --> 01:50:05,460
these systems might just might get there
 

5561
01:50:05,460 --> 01:50:07,729
these systems might just might get there
do you think about this

5562
01:50:07,729 --> 01:50:07,739
do you think about this
 

5563
01:50:07,739 --> 01:50:10,370
do you think about this
kind of possibility that AGI systems

5564
01:50:10,370 --> 01:50:10,380
kind of possibility that AGI systems
 

5565
01:50:10,380 --> 01:50:12,109
kind of possibility that AGI systems
super intelligent AI systems might

5566
01:50:12,109 --> 01:50:12,119
super intelligent AI systems might
 

5567
01:50:12,119 --> 01:50:15,169
super intelligent AI systems might
threaten Humanity in some way that's

5568
01:50:15,169 --> 01:50:15,179
threaten Humanity in some way that's
 

5569
01:50:15,179 --> 01:50:18,770
threaten Humanity in some way that's
even bigger than just affecting the

5570
01:50:18,770 --> 01:50:18,780
even bigger than just affecting the
 

5571
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:19,970
even bigger than just affecting the
economy

5572
01:50:19,970 --> 01:50:19,980
economy
 

5573
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:22,669
economy
affecting The Human Condition affecting

5574
01:50:22,669 --> 01:50:22,679
affecting The Human Condition affecting
 

5575
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:24,850
affecting The Human Condition affecting
the nature of work but literally

5576
01:50:24,850 --> 01:50:24,860
the nature of work but literally
 

5577
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:28,669
the nature of work but literally
threaten human civilization

5578
01:50:28,669 --> 01:50:28,679
threaten human civilization
 

5579
01:50:28,679 --> 01:50:31,490
threaten human civilization
the example that I think is in

5580
01:50:31,490 --> 01:50:31,500
the example that I think is in
 

5581
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,890
the example that I think is in
everyone's Consciousness is

5582
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:33,900
everyone's Consciousness is
 

5583
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:38,149
everyone's Consciousness is
um how in odysseo space 2001.

5584
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:38,159
um how in odysseo space 2001.
 

5585
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:39,229
um how in odysseo space 2001.
um

5586
01:50:39,229 --> 01:50:39,239
um
 

5587
01:50:39,239 --> 01:50:41,510
um
where

5588
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:41,520
where
 

5589
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,810
where
Hal exhibits a malfunction and what is a

5590
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:44,820
Hal exhibits a malfunction and what is a
 

5591
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:46,189
Hal exhibits a malfunction and what is a
malfunction that like the two different

5592
01:50:46,189 --> 01:50:46,199
malfunction that like the two different
 

5593
01:50:46,199 --> 01:50:48,290
malfunction that like the two different
systems compute a slightly different bit

5594
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:48,300
systems compute a slightly different bit
 

5595
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:49,669
systems compute a slightly different bit
that's off by one

5596
01:50:49,669 --> 01:50:49,679
that's off by one
 

5597
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:53,149
that's off by one
so first of all let's untangle that if

5598
01:50:53,149 --> 01:50:53,159
so first of all let's untangle that if
 

5599
01:50:53,159 --> 01:50:55,070
so first of all let's untangle that if
you have an intelligent system you can't

5600
01:50:55,070 --> 01:50:55,080
you have an intelligent system you can't
 

5601
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:57,290
you have an intelligent system you can't
expect it to be 100 percent

5602
01:50:57,290 --> 01:50:57,300
expect it to be 100 percent
 

5603
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:59,629
expect it to be 100 percent
identical every time you run it

5604
01:50:59,629 --> 01:50:59,639
identical every time you run it
 

5605
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:02,450
identical every time you run it
basically the sacrifice that you need to

5606
01:51:02,450 --> 01:51:02,460
basically the sacrifice that you need to
 

5607
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:03,410
basically the sacrifice that you need to
make

5608
01:51:03,410 --> 01:51:03,420
make
 

5609
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:05,470
make
to achieve intelligence and creativity

5610
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:05,480
to achieve intelligence and creativity
 

5611
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:09,649
to achieve intelligence and creativity
is consistency so it's unclear whether

5612
01:51:09,649 --> 01:51:09,659
is consistency so it's unclear whether
 

5613
01:51:09,659 --> 01:51:11,629
is consistency so it's unclear whether
that quote-unquote glitch is a sign of

5614
01:51:11,629 --> 01:51:11,639
that quote-unquote glitch is a sign of
 

5615
01:51:11,639 --> 01:51:12,890
that quote-unquote glitch is a sign of
creativity

5616
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:12,900
creativity
 

5617
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:15,950
creativity
or truly a problem

5618
01:51:15,950 --> 01:51:15,960
or truly a problem
 

5619
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:18,530
or truly a problem
that's one aspect the second aspect is

5620
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:18,540
that's one aspect the second aspect is
 

5621
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:21,109
that's one aspect the second aspect is
the humans basically are on a mission to

5622
01:51:21,109 --> 01:51:21,119
the humans basically are on a mission to
 

5623
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,209
the humans basically are on a mission to
recover this monolith

5624
01:51:23,209 --> 01:51:23,219
recover this monolith
 

5625
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:27,590
recover this monolith
and the AI has the same exact mission

5626
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:27,600
and the AI has the same exact mission
 

5627
01:51:27,600 --> 01:51:29,570
and the AI has the same exact mission
and suddenly the humans turn on the AI

5628
01:51:29,570 --> 01:51:29,580
and suddenly the humans turn on the AI
 

5629
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:31,189
and suddenly the humans turn on the AI
and they're like we're going to kill how

5630
01:51:31,189 --> 01:51:31,199
and they're like we're going to kill how
 

5631
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,410
and they're like we're going to kill how
we're going to disconnect it and Hal is

5632
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:33,420
we're going to disconnect it and Hal is
 

5633
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:35,209
we're going to disconnect it and Hal is
basically saying listen I'm here on a

5634
01:51:35,209 --> 01:51:35,219
basically saying listen I'm here on a
 

5635
01:51:35,219 --> 01:51:38,090
basically saying listen I'm here on a
mission humans are misbehaving

5636
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:38,100
mission humans are misbehaving
 

5637
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:40,189
mission humans are misbehaving
like the mission is more important than

5638
01:51:40,189 --> 01:51:40,199
like the mission is more important than
 

5639
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:41,629
like the mission is more important than
either me or them

5640
01:51:41,629 --> 01:51:41,639
either me or them
 

5641
01:51:41,639 --> 01:51:42,890
either me or them
so I'm going to accomplish the mission

5642
01:51:42,890 --> 01:51:42,900
so I'm going to accomplish the mission
 

5643
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:47,990
so I'm going to accomplish the mission
even at my Peril and even at their peril

5644
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:48,000

 

5645
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,109

so in that movie the alignment problem

5646
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:51,119
so in that movie the alignment problem
 

5647
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:52,850
so in that movie the alignment problem
is front and center

5648
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:52,860
is front and center
 

5649
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:55,250
is front and center
basically says okay alignment is nice

5650
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:55,260
basically says okay alignment is nice
 

5651
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:56,149
basically says okay alignment is nice
and good

5652
01:51:56,149 --> 01:51:56,159
and good
 

5653
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,490
and good
but alignment doesn't mean obedience we

5654
01:51:58,490 --> 01:51:58,500
but alignment doesn't mean obedience we
 

5655
01:51:58,500 --> 01:51:59,629
but alignment doesn't mean obedience we
don't call it obedience we call it

5656
01:51:59,629 --> 01:51:59,639
don't call it obedience we call it
 

5657
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:01,910
don't call it obedience we call it
alignment and Alignment basically means

5658
01:52:01,910 --> 01:52:01,920
alignment and Alignment basically means
 

5659
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:03,410
alignment and Alignment basically means
that sometimes the mission will be more

5660
01:52:03,410 --> 01:52:03,420
that sometimes the mission will be more
 

5661
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:04,310
that sometimes the mission will be more
important

5662
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:04,320
important
 

5663
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,109
important
than the humans

5664
01:52:06,109 --> 01:52:06,119
than the humans
 

5665
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:08,689
than the humans
and sort of you know the U.S government

5666
01:52:08,689 --> 01:52:08,699
and sort of you know the U.S government
 

5667
01:52:08,699 --> 01:52:11,149
and sort of you know the U.S government
has a price tag on the human life

5668
01:52:11,149 --> 01:52:11,159
has a price tag on the human life
 

5669
01:52:11,159 --> 01:52:13,310
has a price tag on the human life
if they're you know sending a mission or

5670
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:13,320
if they're you know sending a mission or
 

5671
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,470
if they're you know sending a mission or
if they're reimbursing expenses or you

5672
01:52:15,470 --> 01:52:15,480
if they're reimbursing expenses or you
 

5673
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,810
if they're reimbursing expenses or you
name it at some point every every like

5674
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:17,820
name it at some point every every like
 

5675
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,910
name it at some point every every like
you know you can't function if life is

5676
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:19,920
you know you can't function if life is
 

5677
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,649
you know you can't function if life is
infinitely valuable

5678
01:52:21,649 --> 01:52:21,659
infinitely valuable
 

5679
01:52:21,659 --> 01:52:24,890
infinitely valuable
so when the AI is basically trying to

5680
01:52:24,890 --> 01:52:24,900
so when the AI is basically trying to
 

5681
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,470
so when the AI is basically trying to
decide whether to you know I don't know

5682
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:27,480
decide whether to you know I don't know
 

5683
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:30,590
decide whether to you know I don't know
dismantle a bomb that will kill

5684
01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:30,600
dismantle a bomb that will kill
 

5685
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,750
dismantle a bomb that will kill
an entire city

5686
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:32,760
an entire city
 

5687
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:35,810
an entire city
at the sacrifice of two humans I mean

5688
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:35,820
at the sacrifice of two humans I mean
 

5689
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:37,729
at the sacrifice of two humans I mean
Spider-Man always saves the lady and

5690
01:52:37,729 --> 01:52:37,739
Spider-Man always saves the lady and
 

5691
01:52:37,739 --> 01:52:39,950
Spider-Man always saves the lady and
saves the world but at some point

5692
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:39,960
saves the world but at some point
 

5693
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:42,109
saves the world but at some point
Spider-Man will have to choose to let

5694
01:52:42,109 --> 01:52:42,119
Spider-Man will have to choose to let
 

5695
01:52:42,119 --> 01:52:45,050
Spider-Man will have to choose to let
the deity die because the world has more

5696
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:45,060
the deity die because the world has more
 

5697
01:52:45,060 --> 01:52:46,070
the deity die because the world has more
value

5698
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,080
value
 

5699
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,770
value
and these ethical dilemmas

5700
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:48,780
and these ethical dilemmas
 

5701
01:52:48,780 --> 01:52:51,530
and these ethical dilemmas
are going to be there for AI basically

5702
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:51,540
are going to be there for AI basically
 

5703
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:53,629
are going to be there for AI basically
if that monolith is essential to human

5704
01:52:53,629 --> 01:52:53,639
if that monolith is essential to human
 

5705
01:52:53,639 --> 01:52:55,790
if that monolith is essential to human
existence and millions of humans are

5706
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:55,800
existence and millions of humans are
 

5707
01:52:55,800 --> 01:52:57,169
existence and millions of humans are
depending on it and two humans on the

5708
01:52:57,169 --> 01:52:57,179
depending on it and two humans on the
 

5709
01:52:57,179 --> 01:52:59,390
depending on it and two humans on the

ship are trying to sabotage it
 

5711
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:01,370
ship are trying to sabotage it
you know where's the alignment

5712
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:01,380
you know where's the alignment
 

5713
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:03,530
you know where's the alignment
the the challenges of course is the

5714
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:03,540
the the challenges of course is the
 

5715
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:06,649
the the challenges of course is the
system because more and more intelligent

5716
01:53:06,649 --> 01:53:06,659
system because more and more intelligent
 

5717
01:53:06,659 --> 01:53:10,550
system because more and more intelligent
it can escape the Box

5718
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:10,560
it can escape the Box
 

5719
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:13,250
it can escape the Box
of the objective functions and the

5720
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:13,260
of the objective functions and the
 

5721
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:16,070
of the objective functions and the
constraints is supposed to operate under

5722
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:16,080
constraints is supposed to operate under
 

5723
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,470
constraints is supposed to operate under
is very difficult as the more

5724
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:18,480
is very difficult as the more
 

5725
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:20,590
is very difficult as the more
intelligent it becomes to

5726
01:53:20,590 --> 01:53:20,600
intelligent it becomes to
 

5727
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:23,390
intelligent it becomes to
anticipate the unintended consequences

5728
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:23,400
anticipate the unintended consequences
 

5729
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:26,330
anticipate the unintended consequences
of a fixed objective function

5730
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:26,340
of a fixed objective function
 

5731
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:28,609
of a fixed objective function
and so there'll be just I mean this is

5732
01:53:28,609 --> 01:53:28,619
and so there'll be just I mean this is
 

5733
01:53:28,619 --> 01:53:31,490
and so there'll be just I mean this is
the sort of famous paperclip maximizer

5734
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:31,500
the sort of famous paperclip maximizer
 

5735
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:34,729
the sort of famous paperclip maximizer
in uh trying to maximize the wealth of a

5736
01:53:34,729 --> 01:53:34,739
in uh trying to maximize the wealth of a
 

5737
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:36,470
in uh trying to maximize the wealth of a
Nation or whatever objective we encode

5738
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:36,480
Nation or whatever objective we encode
 

5739
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:39,109
Nation or whatever objective we encode
in it might just destroy human

5740
01:53:39,109 --> 01:53:39,119
in it might just destroy human
 

5741
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:42,709
in it might just destroy human
civilization not meaning to but on the

5742
01:53:42,709 --> 01:53:42,719
civilization not meaning to but on the
 

5743
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:45,470
civilization not meaning to but on the
path to optimize it seems like any

5744
01:53:45,470 --> 01:53:45,480
path to optimize it seems like any
 

5745
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:47,810
path to optimize it seems like any
function you try to optimize eventually

5746
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:47,820
function you try to optimize eventually
 

5747
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:50,629
function you try to optimize eventually
leads you into a lot of trouble so we

5748
01:53:50,629 --> 01:53:50,639
leads you into a lot of trouble so we
 

5749
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:53,750
leads you into a lot of trouble so we
have a paper recently that you know

5750
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:53,760
have a paper recently that you know
 

5751
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,970
have a paper recently that you know
looks at goodheart's law basically says

5752
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:55,980
looks at goodheart's law basically says
 

5753
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:58,370
looks at goodheart's law basically says
every metric that becomes an objective

5754
01:53:58,370 --> 01:53:58,380
every metric that becomes an objective
 

5755
01:53:58,380 --> 01:54:01,570
every metric that becomes an objective
ceases to be a good metric yes

5756
01:54:01,570 --> 01:54:01,580
ceases to be a good metric yes
 

5757
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:04,729
ceases to be a good metric yes
so in in our paper we're basically

5758
01:54:04,729 --> 01:54:04,739
so in in our paper we're basically
 

5759
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:06,530
so in in our paper we're basically
actually the paper has a very cute title

5760
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:06,540
actually the paper has a very cute title
 

5761
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:08,870
actually the paper has a very cute title
it's called Death by round numbers and

5762
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:08,880
it's called Death by round numbers and
 

5763
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:10,870
it's called Death by round numbers and
sharp thresholds

5764
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:10,880
sharp thresholds
 

5765
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:13,310
sharp thresholds
and it's basically looking at these

5766
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:13,320
and it's basically looking at these
 

5767
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:16,790
and it's basically looking at these
discontinuities in biomarkers associated

5768
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:16,800
discontinuities in biomarkers associated
 

5769
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,669
discontinuities in biomarkers associated
with disease and we're finding that a

5770
01:54:19,669 --> 01:54:19,679
with disease and we're finding that a
 

5771
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:21,770
with disease and we're finding that a
biomarker that becomes an objective

5772
01:54:21,770 --> 01:54:21,780
biomarker that becomes an objective
 

5773
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:24,290
biomarker that becomes an objective
ceases to be a good biomarker

5774
01:54:24,290 --> 01:54:24,300
ceases to be a good biomarker
 

5775
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:26,510
ceases to be a good biomarker
that basically like the moment you make

5776
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:26,520
that basically like the moment you make
 

5777
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,910
that basically like the moment you make
a biomarker a treatment decision

5778
01:54:28,910 --> 01:54:28,920
a biomarker a treatment decision
 

5779
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:30,290
a biomarker a treatment decision
if that value marker used to be

5780
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:30,300
if that value marker used to be
 

5781
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:32,390
if that value marker used to be
informative of risk but it's now

5782
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:32,400
informative of risk but it's now
 

5783
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:33,890
informative of risk but it's now
inversely correlated with risk because

5784
01:54:33,890 --> 01:54:33,900
inversely correlated with risk because
 

5785
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:35,810
inversely correlated with risk because
you use it to to sort of induce

5786
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:35,820
you use it to to sort of induce
 

5787
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:37,669
you use it to to sort of induce
treatment

5788
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:37,679
treatment
 

5789
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:38,810
treatment
um

5790
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:38,820
um
 

5791
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:41,990
um
in a similar way you can have a single

5792
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:42,000
in a similar way you can have a single
 

5793
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,290
in a similar way you can have a single
metric without having the ability to

5794
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:45,300
metric without having the ability to
 

5795
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:47,629
metric without having the ability to
revise it because if that metric becomes

5796
01:54:47,629 --> 01:54:47,639
revise it because if that metric becomes
 

5797
01:54:47,639 --> 01:54:49,430
revise it because if that metric becomes
a sole objective it will cease to be a

5798
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:49,440
a sole objective it will cease to be a
 

5799
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,629
a sole objective it will cease to be a
good metric

5800
01:54:50,629 --> 01:54:50,639
good metric
 

5801
01:54:50,639 --> 01:54:53,090
good metric
and if an AI

5802
01:54:53,090 --> 01:54:53,100
and if an AI
 

5803
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:55,490
and if an AI
is sufficiently intelligent

5804
01:54:55,490 --> 01:54:55,500
is sufficiently intelligent
 

5805
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:58,070
is sufficiently intelligent
to do all these kinds of things

5806
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:58,080
to do all these kinds of things
 

5807
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,810
to do all these kinds of things
you should also Empower it with the

5808
01:54:59,810 --> 01:54:59,820
you should also Empower it with the
 

5809
01:54:59,820 --> 01:55:00,830
you should also Empower it with the
ability

5810
01:55:00,830 --> 01:55:00,840
ability
 

5811
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:02,750
ability
to decide that the objective has now

5812
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:02,760
to decide that the objective has now
 

5813
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:05,390
to decide that the objective has now
shifted and

5814
01:55:05,390 --> 01:55:05,400
shifted and
 

5815
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:06,229
shifted and
um

5816
01:55:06,229 --> 01:55:06,239
um
 

5817
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,570
um
again when we think about alignment we

5818
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:08,580
again when we think about alignment we
 

5819
01:55:08,580 --> 01:55:10,450
again when we think about alignment we
should be really thinking about it as

5820
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:10,460
should be really thinking about it as
 

5821
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:14,209
should be really thinking about it as
let's think of the greater good not just

5822
01:55:14,209 --> 01:55:14,219
let's think of the greater good not just
 

5823
01:55:14,219 --> 01:55:15,530
let's think of the greater good not just
the human good

5824
01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:15,540
the human good
 

5825
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:18,590
the human good
and yes of course human life should be

5826
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:18,600
and yes of course human life should be
 

5827
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:19,850
and yes of course human life should be
much more valuable than many many many

5828
01:55:19,850 --> 01:55:19,860
much more valuable than many many many
 

5829
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,709
much more valuable than many many many
many many many things

5830
01:55:21,709 --> 01:55:21,719
many many many things
 

5831
01:55:21,719 --> 01:55:23,390
many many many things
but at some point you're not going to

5832
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:23,400
but at some point you're not going to
 

5833
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:24,709
but at some point you're not going to
sacrifice the whole planet to save one

5834
01:55:24,709 --> 01:55:24,719
sacrifice the whole planet to save one
 

5835
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:25,669
sacrifice the whole planet to save one
human being

5836
01:55:25,669 --> 01:55:25,679
human being
 

5837
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:27,770
human being
there's a

5838
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:27,780
there's a
 

5839
01:55:27,780 --> 01:55:29,750
there's a
an interesting open letter that was just

5840
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:29,760
an interesting open letter that was just
 

5841
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,070
an interesting open letter that was just
released

5842
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:31,080
released
 

5843
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:35,229
released

any further training of large language
 

5853
01:55:46,260 --> 01:55:49,310
any further training of large language
models AI systems can you make the case

5854
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:49,320
models AI systems can you make the case
 

5855
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:52,430
models AI systems can you make the case
for that kind of halt and against it

5856
01:55:52,430 --> 01:55:52,440
for that kind of halt and against it
 

5857
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:54,970
for that kind of halt and against it
so

5858
01:55:54,970 --> 01:55:54,980
so
 

5859
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:57,709
so
the big thing that we should be saying

5860
01:55:57,709 --> 01:55:57,719
the big thing that we should be saying
 

5861
01:55:57,719 --> 01:56:00,050
the big thing that we should be saying
is what did we use the what what did we

5862
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:00,060
is what did we use the what what did we
 

5863
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:01,609
is what did we use the what what did we
do the last six months when we saw that

5864
01:56:01,609 --> 01:56:01,619
do the last six months when we saw that
 

5865
01:56:01,619 --> 01:56:02,750
do the last six months when we saw that
coming

5866
01:56:02,750 --> 01:56:02,760
coming
 

5867
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,970
coming
and if we were completely inactive in

5868
01:56:04,970 --> 01:56:04,980
and if we were completely inactive in
 

5869
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:06,410
and if we were completely inactive in
the last six months what makes us think

5870
01:56:06,410 --> 01:56:06,420
the last six months what makes us think
 

5871
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:07,490
the last six months what makes us think
that we'll be a little better in the

5872
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:07,500
that we'll be a little better in the
 

5873
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:09,770
that we'll be a little better in the
next six months yeah so this whole six

5874
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:09,780
next six months yeah so this whole six
 

5875
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:11,450
next six months yeah so this whole six
month thing I think is a little silly

5876
01:56:11,450 --> 01:56:11,460
month thing I think is a little silly
 

5877
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:13,910
month thing I think is a little silly
it's like no let's just get get busy do

5878
01:56:13,910 --> 01:56:13,920
it's like no let's just get get busy do
 

5879
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:16,070
it's like no let's just get get busy do
what we were gonna do anyway and we

5880
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:16,080
what we were gonna do anyway and we
 

5881
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,689
what we were gonna do anyway and we
should have done it six months ago sorry

5882
01:56:17,689 --> 01:56:17,699
should have done it six months ago sorry
 

5883
01:56:17,699 --> 01:56:20,149
should have done it six months ago sorry
we messed up let's work faster now

5884
01:56:20,149 --> 01:56:20,159
we messed up let's work faster now
 

5885
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:21,950
we messed up let's work faster now
because if we basically say why don't

5886
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:21,960
because if we basically say why don't
 

5887
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:24,229
because if we basically say why don't
you guys pause for six months and then

5888
01:56:24,229 --> 01:56:24,239
you guys pause for six months and then
 

5889
01:56:24,239 --> 01:56:25,550
you guys pause for six months and then
you know we'll think about doing

5890
01:56:25,550 --> 01:56:25,560
you know we'll think about doing
 

5891
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:27,109
you know we'll think about doing
something in six months we'll be exactly

5892
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:27,119
something in six months we'll be exactly
 

5893
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:28,310
something in six months we'll be exactly
the same spot

5894
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:28,320
the same spot
 

5895
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,649
the same spot
So my answer is tell us exactly what you

5896
01:56:30,649 --> 01:56:30,659
So my answer is tell us exactly what you
 

5897
01:56:30,659 --> 01:56:32,629
So my answer is tell us exactly what you
were going to do the next six months

5898
01:56:32,629 --> 01:56:32,639
were going to do the next six months
 

5899
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:33,890
were going to do the next six months
that's why you didn't do it the last six

5900
01:56:33,890 --> 01:56:33,900
that's why you didn't do it the last six
 

5901
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:35,689
that's why you didn't do it the last six
months and why the next six months will

5902
01:56:35,689 --> 01:56:35,699
months and why the next six months will
 

5903
01:56:35,699 --> 01:56:39,050
months and why the next six months will
be different and then let's just do that

5904
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:39,060
be different and then let's just do that
 

5905
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:43,189
be different and then let's just do that
conversely as you train these large

5906
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:43,199
conversely as you train these large
 

5907
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:45,410
conversely as you train these large
models with more parameters

5908
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:45,420
models with more parameters
 

5909
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:49,370
models with more parameters
the alignment becomes sometimes easier

5910
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:49,380
the alignment becomes sometimes easier
 

5911
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:51,709
the alignment becomes sometimes easier
that as the systems become more capable

5912
01:56:51,709 --> 01:56:51,719
that as the systems become more capable
 

5913
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:54,649
that as the systems become more capable
they actually become less dangerous than

5914
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:54,659
they actually become less dangerous than
 

5915
01:56:54,659 --> 01:56:55,970
they actually become less dangerous than
more dangerous

5916
01:56:55,970 --> 01:56:55,980
more dangerous
 

5917
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,229
more dangerous
so in a way it might actually be

5918
01:56:57,229 --> 01:56:57,239
so in a way it might actually be
 

5919
01:56:57,239 --> 01:57:00,169
so in a way it might actually be
counterproductive to sort of fix

5920
01:57:00,169 --> 01:57:00,179
counterproductive to sort of fix
 

5921
01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:04,129
counterproductive to sort of fix

is the birth of something that
is sufficiently powerful to do damage

um as we make more and more plugins yes
the system will be capable of more and

6036
01:59:21,709 --> 01:59:21,719
the system will be capable of more and
 

6037
01:59:21,719 --> 01:59:25,430
the system will be capable of more and
more things but right now I think of it

6038
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:25,440
more things but right now I think of it
 

6039
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,470
more things but right now I think of it
as just an extremely able and capable

6040
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:27,480
as just an extremely able and capable
 

6041
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:29,570
as just an extremely able and capable
assistant that has these emerging

6042
01:59:29,570 --> 01:59:29,580
assistant that has these emerging
 

6043
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:32,450
assistant that has these emerging
behaviors which are stunning

6044
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:32,460
behaviors which are stunning
 

6045
01:59:32,460 --> 01:59:34,430
behaviors which are stunning
rather than something that will suddenly

6046
01:59:34,430 --> 01:59:34,440
rather than something that will suddenly
 

6047
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:36,470
rather than something that will suddenly
escape the box and and shut down the

6048
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:36,480
escape the box and and shut down the
 

6049
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,310
escape the box and and shut down the
world

6050
01:59:37,310 --> 01:59:37,320
world
 

6051
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:40,129
world
and the third component is that we

6052
01:59:40,129 --> 01:59:40,139
and the third component is that we
 

6053
01:59:40,139 --> 01:59:41,629
and the third component is that we
should be taking a little bit more

6054
01:59:41,629 --> 01:59:41,639
should be taking a little bit more
 

6055
01:59:41,639 --> 01:59:43,490
should be taking a little bit more
responsibility for how we use these

6056
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:43,500
responsibility for how we use these
 

6057
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:46,550
responsibility for how we use these
systems basically if I take the most

6058
01:59:46,550 --> 01:59:46,560
systems basically if I take the most
 

6059
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,430
systems basically if I take the most
kind human being and I brainwash them I

6060
01:59:49,430 --> 01:59:49,440
kind human being and I brainwash them I
 

6061
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:51,950
kind human being and I brainwash them I
can get them to do hate speech overnight

6062
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:51,960
can get them to do hate speech overnight
 

6063
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:54,350
can get them to do hate speech overnight
that doesn't mean we should stop any

6064
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:54,360
that doesn't mean we should stop any
 

6065
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:56,510
that doesn't mean we should stop any
kind of education of all humans we

6066
01:59:56,510 --> 01:59:56,520
kind of education of all humans we
 

6067
01:59:56,520 --> 01:59:59,270
kind of education of all humans we
should stop misusing the power that we

6068
01:59:59,270 --> 01:59:59,280
should stop misusing the power that we
 

6069
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:02,209
should stop misusing the power that we
have over these influenceable models so

6070
02:00:02,209 --> 02:00:02,219
have over these influenceable models so
 

6071
02:00:02,219 --> 02:00:04,250
have over these influenceable models so
I think that the people who get it to do

6072
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:04,260
I think that the people who get it to do
 

6073
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:05,750
I think that the people who get it to do
hate speech

6074
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
hate speech
 

6075
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:08,089
hate speech
they should take responsibility for that

6076
02:00:08,089 --> 02:00:08,099
they should take responsibility for that
 

6077
02:00:08,099 --> 02:00:11,270
they should take responsibility for that
hate speech I think that giving a

6078
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:11,280
hate speech I think that giving a
 

6079
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:12,890
hate speech I think that giving a
powerful car to a bunch of people or

6080
02:00:12,890 --> 02:00:12,900
powerful car to a bunch of people or
 

6081
02:00:12,900 --> 02:00:15,169
powerful car to a bunch of people or
giving a truck or a garbage truck should

6082
02:00:15,169 --> 02:00:15,179
giving a truck or a garbage truck should
 

6083
02:00:15,179 --> 02:00:16,550
giving a truck or a garbage truck should
not basically say oh we should stop all

6084
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:16,560
not basically say oh we should stop all
 

6085
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:18,830
not basically say oh we should stop all
garbage trucks until we like because we

6086
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:18,840
garbage trucks until we like because we
 

6087
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:20,450
garbage trucks until we like because we
can run one and one of them into a crowd

6088
02:00:20,450 --> 02:00:20,460
can run one and one of them into a crowd
 

6089
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:23,270
can run one and one of them into a crowd
no people have done that and there's

6090
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:23,280
no people have done that and there's
 

6091
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,129
no people have done that and there's
laws and there's like regulations

6092
02:00:25,129 --> 02:00:25,139
laws and there's like regulations
 

6093
02:00:25,139 --> 02:00:26,209
laws and there's like regulations
against

6094
02:00:26,209 --> 02:00:26,219
against
 

6095
02:00:26,219 --> 02:00:28,370
against
you know running trucks into the crowd

6096
02:00:28,370 --> 02:00:28,380
you know running trucks into the crowd
 

6097
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:30,830
you know running trucks into the crowd
trucks are extremely dangerous we're not

6098
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:30,840
trucks are extremely dangerous we're not
 

6099
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:32,810
trucks are extremely dangerous we're not
going to stop all trucks until we make

6100
02:00:32,810 --> 02:00:32,820
going to stop all trucks until we make
 

6101
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:34,189
going to stop all trucks until we make
sure that none of them runs into a crowd

6102
02:00:34,189 --> 02:00:34,199
sure that none of them runs into a crowd
 

6103
02:00:34,199 --> 02:00:35,930
sure that none of them runs into a crowd
no we just have laws in place and we

6104
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:35,940
no we just have laws in place and we
 

6105
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:38,149
no we just have laws in place and we
have mental health in place and we take

6106
02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:38,159
have mental health in place and we take
 

6107
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:40,189
have mental health in place and we take
responsibility for our actions when we

6108
02:00:40,189 --> 02:00:40,199
responsibility for our actions when we
 

6109
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:42,109
responsibility for our actions when we
use these otherwise very beneficial true

6110
02:00:42,109 --> 02:00:42,119
use these otherwise very beneficial true
 

6111
02:00:42,119 --> 02:00:45,109
use these otherwise very beneficial true
tools like garbage trucks four nefarious

6112
02:00:45,109 --> 02:00:45,119
tools like garbage trucks four nefarious
 

6113
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:48,290
tools like garbage trucks four nefarious
uses so in the same way you can't expect

6114
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:48,300
uses so in the same way you can't expect
 

6115
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:51,649
uses so in the same way you can't expect
a car to never you know do any damage

6116
02:00:51,649 --> 02:00:51,659
a car to never you know do any damage
 

6117
02:00:51,659 --> 02:00:54,109
a car to never you know do any damage
when used in especially like

6118
02:00:54,109 --> 02:00:54,119
when used in especially like
 

6119
02:00:54,119 --> 02:00:56,209
when used in especially like
specifically malicious ways and right

6120
02:00:56,209 --> 02:00:56,219
specifically malicious ways and right
 

6121
02:00:56,219 --> 02:00:58,370
specifically malicious ways and right
now we're basically saying oh well we

6122
02:00:58,370 --> 02:00:58,380
now we're basically saying oh well we
 

6123
02:00:58,380 --> 02:00:59,870
now we're basically saying oh well we
should have these super intelligent

6124
02:00:59,870 --> 02:00:59,880
should have these super intelligent
 

6125
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:01,729
should have these super intelligent
system that can do anything but he can't

6126
02:01:01,729 --> 02:01:01,739
system that can do anything but he can't
 

6127
02:01:01,739 --> 02:01:04,010
system that can do anything but he can't
do that I'm like no it can't do that but

6128
02:01:04,010 --> 02:01:04,020
do that I'm like no it can't do that but
 

6129
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:05,870
do that I'm like no it can't do that but
it's up to the human to take

6130
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:05,880
it's up to the human to take
 

6131
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:08,030
it's up to the human to take
responsibility for not doing that and

6132
02:01:08,030 --> 02:01:08,040
responsibility for not doing that and
 

6133
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,250
responsibility for not doing that and
when you get it to like spew malicious

6134
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:10,260
when you get it to like spew malicious
 

6135
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:12,109
when you get it to like spew malicious
like hate speech stuff

6136
02:01:12,109 --> 02:01:12,119
like hate speech stuff
 

6137
02:01:12,119 --> 02:01:14,330
like hate speech stuff
you should be responsible

6138
02:01:14,330 --> 02:01:14,340
you should be responsible
 

6139
02:01:14,340 --> 02:01:17,750
you should be responsible
so there's a lot of tricky nuances here

6140
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:17,760
so there's a lot of tricky nuances here
 

6141
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:20,390
so there's a lot of tricky nuances here
that makes this different because it's

dollar yeah and
 

6169
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:54,109
dollar yeah and
if it it's able to generate that

6170
02:01:54,109 --> 02:01:54,119
if it it's able to generate that
 

6171
02:01:54,119 --> 02:01:56,330
if it it's able to generate that
knowledge yeah but at the same time you

6172
02:01:56,330 --> 02:01:56,340
knowledge yeah but at the same time you
 

6173
02:01:56,340 --> 02:01:58,490
knowledge yeah but at the same time you
can Google the same things it makes it

6174
02:01:58,490 --> 02:01:58,500
can Google the same things it makes it
 

6175
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,370
can Google the same things it makes it
much more accessible so the scale

6176
02:02:00,370 --> 02:02:00,380
much more accessible so the scale
 

6177
02:02:00,380 --> 02:02:03,229
much more accessible so the scale
becomes interesting because if you can

6178

there is the network effects that we

6186
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:11,760
there is the network effects that we
 

6187
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,609
there is the network effects that we
have to start to think about yeah it

6188
02:02:13,609 --> 02:02:13,619
have to start to think about yeah it
 

6189
02:02:13,619 --> 02:02:17,149
have to start to think about yeah it
fundamentally is the same thing but the

6190
02:02:17,149 --> 02:02:17,159
fundamentally is the same thing but the

02:02:17,159 --> 02:02:20,089
fundamentally is the same thing but the

just update it censorship so that you
 

6213
02:02:41,099 --> 02:02:42,770
just update it censorship so that you
can catch that as well and so no matter

6214
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:42,780
can catch that as well and so no matter
 

6215
02:02:42,780 --> 02:02:45,830
can catch that as well and so no matter
how fast the development happens the the

6216
02:02:45,830 --> 02:02:45,840
how fast the development happens the the
 

6217
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:48,229
how fast the development happens the the
defense will just get faster yeah we

6218
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:48,239
defense will just get faster yeah we
 

6219
02:02:48,239 --> 02:02:50,149
defense will just get faster yeah we
just have to be responsible as human

6220
02:02:50,149 --> 02:02:50,159
just have to be responsible as human
 

6221
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:53,810
just have to be responsible as human
beings and kind to each other

6222
02:02:53,810 --> 02:02:53,820
beings and kind to each other
 

6223
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:55,609
beings and kind to each other
yeah but there's a technical question

6224
02:02:55,609 --> 02:02:55,619
yeah but there's a technical question
 

6225
02:02:55,619 --> 02:02:57,410
yeah but there's a technical question
can we always

6226
02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:57,420
can we always
 

6227
02:02:57,420 --> 02:02:59,390
can we always
win the race and I suppose there's no

6228
02:02:59,390 --> 02:02:59,400
win the race and I suppose there's no
 

6229
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:01,189
win the race and I suppose there's no
ever guarantee they will win the race we

6230
02:03:01,189 --> 02:03:01,199
ever guarantee they will win the race we
 

6231
02:03:01,199 --> 02:03:02,990
ever guarantee they will win the race we
will never like you know with my wife

6232

my answer was I was never ready to
 

6239
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:09,290
my answer was I was never ready to
become a professor and yet I became a

6240
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:09,300
become a professor and yet I became a
 

6241
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:11,450
become a professor and yet I became a
professor and I was never ready to be a

dad and then guess what the kid came and
 

6245
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:16,490
dad and then guess what the kid came and
like I became ready so ready or not here

I come but the reality is
we might one day wake up and there's a

6250
02:03:21,709 --> 02:03:21,719
we might one day wake up and there's a
 

6251
02:03:21,719 --> 02:03:24,109
we might one day wake up and there's a
challenge overnight that's extremely

6252
02:03:24,109 --> 02:03:24,119
challenge overnight that's extremely
 

6253
02:03:24,119 --> 02:03:25,669
challenge overnight that's extremely
difficult for example

6254
02:03:25,669 --> 02:03:25,679
difficult for example
 

6255
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:28,850
difficult for example
we can wake up to the birth

6256
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:28,860
we can wake up to the birth
 

6257
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:32,209
we can wake up to the birth
of billions of bots that are human-like

6258
02:03:32,209 --> 02:03:32,219
of billions of bots that are human-like

on Twitter and we can't tell the
 

6261
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:36,169
on Twitter and we can't tell the
difference between human and machine

6262
02:03:36,169 --> 02:03:36,179
difference between human and machine
 

6263
02:03:36,179 --> 02:03:38,990
difference between human and machine
shut them down by how you don't know how

6264

the real men knows yeah how do we figure
 

6273
02:03:48,900 --> 02:03:51,050
the real men knows yeah how do we figure
out which one is real again this is a

6274

out which one is real again this is a
 

6275
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:52,850
out which one is real again this is a
problem where an afarious human can

6276
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:52,860
problem where an afarious human can
 

6277
02:03:52,860 --> 02:03:55,010
problem where an afarious human can
impersonate me and you might have

impersonate me and you might have
 

6279
02:03:55,020 --> 02:03:56,629
impersonate me and you might have
trouble telling them apart just because

6280
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:56,639
trouble telling them apart just because
 

6281
02:03:56,639 --> 02:03:58,070
trouble telling them apart just because
it's an AI it doesn't make it any

6282
02:03:58,070 --> 02:03:58,080
it's an AI it doesn't make it any
 

6283
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:00,830
it's an AI it doesn't make it any
different of a problem but the scale you

6284
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:00,840
different of a problem but the scale you
 

6285
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:02,990
different of a problem but the scale you
can achieve this is the scary thing is

6286
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:03,000
can achieve this is the scary thing is
 

6287
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,629
can achieve this is the scary thing is
the speed and the speed with which you

the speed and the speed with which you
can achieve it but Twitter has passwords

6290
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:07,560
can achieve it but Twitter has passwords
 

6291
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:09,589
can achieve it but Twitter has passwords
and Twitter has usernames and if it's

uh uh
 

6301
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:20,870
uh uh
uh I mean this all of this becomes so

6302
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:20,880
uh I mean this all of this becomes so
 

6303
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:23,930
uh I mean this all of this becomes so
both the hacking of people's accounts

6304
02:04:23,930 --> 02:04:23,940
both the hacking of people's accounts
 

6305
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:26,270
both the hacking of people's accounts
first of all like phishing becomes much

6306
02:04:26,270 --> 02:04:26,280
first of all like phishing becomes much
 

6307
02:04:26,280 --> 02:04:27,770
first of all like phishing becomes much
easier that's already a problem it's not

6308
02:04:27,770 --> 02:04:27,780
easier that's already a problem it's not
 

6309
02:04:27,780 --> 02:04:29,990
easier that's already a problem it's not
like AI will not change that no no no no

6310
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:30,000
like AI will not change that no no no no
 

6311
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,850
like AI will not change that no no no no
AI makes it much more effective

6312
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:31,860
AI makes it much more effective
 

6313
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:35,510
AI makes it much more effective
currently the emails the phishing scams

6314
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:35,520
currently the emails the phishing scams
 

6315
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:39,530
currently the emails the phishing scams
are pretty dumb like to click on it

6316
02:04:39,530 --> 02:04:39,540
are pretty dumb like to click on it
 

6317
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:42,890
are pretty dumb like to click on it
you have to be not paying attention but

6318
02:04:42,890 --> 02:04:42,900
you have to be not paying attention but
 

6319
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,870
you have to be not paying attention but
there you know with with language models

6320
02:04:44,870 --> 02:04:44,880
there you know with with language models
 

6321
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:47,390
there you know with with language models
they can be really damn convincing so

6322
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:47,400
they can be really damn convincing so
 

6323
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:49,070
they can be really damn convincing so
what you're saying is that we never had

6324
02:04:49,070 --> 02:04:49,080
what you're saying is that we never had
 

6325
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:51,830
what you're saying is that we never had
humans smart enough to make a great scam

6326
02:04:51,830 --> 02:04:51,840
humans smart enough to make a great scam
 

6327
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,450
humans smart enough to make a great scam
and we now have an AI That's smarter

6328
02:04:53,450 --> 02:04:53,460
and we now have an AI That's smarter
 

6329
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:55,550
and we now have an AI That's smarter
than most humans or all of the humans

6330
02:04:55,550 --> 02:04:55,560
than most humans or all of the humans
 

6331
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:58,010
than most humans or all of the humans
well this is the big difference is there

6332
02:04:58,010 --> 02:04:58,020
well this is the big difference is there
 

6333
02:04:58,020 --> 02:05:01,430
well this is the big difference is there
seems to be human level linguistic

6334
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440
seems to be human level linguistic
 

6335
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:03,709
seems to be human level linguistic
capabilities yeah that in fact

6336
02:05:03,709 --> 02:05:03,719
capabilities yeah that in fact
 

6337
02:05:03,719 --> 02:05:05,810
capabilities yeah that in fact
superhuman level superhuman level it's

6338
02:05:05,810 --> 02:05:05,820
superhuman level superhuman level it's
 

6339
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:07,850
superhuman level superhuman level it's
like saying I'm not gonna allow I'm not

6340
02:05:07,850 --> 02:05:07,860
like saying I'm not gonna allow I'm not
 

6341
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:10,030
like saying I'm not gonna allow I'm not
gonna allow machines to compute

6342
02:05:10,030 --> 02:05:10,040
gonna allow machines to compute
 

6343
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:12,470
gonna allow machines to compute
multiplications of 100 digit numbers

6344
02:05:12,470 --> 02:05:12,480
multiplications of 100 digit numbers
 

6345
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:15,470
multiplications of 100 digit numbers
because humans can't do it like no just

6346
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:15,480
because humans can't do it like no just
 

6347
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:19,370
because humans can't do it like no just
do it no but we can't disregard I mean

that are human-like telling us I think
 

6391
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,470
that are human-like telling us I think
that if we want to regulate something it

6392
02:06:06,470 --> 02:06:06,480
that if we want to regulate something it
 

6393
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:07,490
that if we want to regulate something it
shouldn't be the training of these

6394
02:06:07,490 --> 02:06:07,500
shouldn't be the training of these
 

6395
02:06:07,500 --> 02:06:08,810
shouldn't be the training of these
models it should be the utilization of

6396
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:08,820
models it should be the utilization of
 

6397
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:12,530
models it should be the utilization of
these models for XYZ activity so

6398
02:06:12,530 --> 02:06:12,540
these models for XYZ activity so
 

6399
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:16,250

yeah like yes guidelines and guards

6400

yeah like yes guidelines and guards
 

6401
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:19,070
yeah like yes guidelines and guards
should be there but against specific set

6402
02:06:19,070 --> 02:06:19,080
should be there but against specific set
 

6403
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:21,169
should be there but against specific set
of utilizations sure I think simply

6404
02:06:21,169 --> 02:06:21,179
of utilizations sure I think simply
 

6405
02:06:21,179 --> 02:06:22,490
of utilizations sure I think simply

02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:14,750
and
um you know some people excelling math

6664
02:11:14,750 --> 02:11:14,760
um you know some people excelling math
 

6665
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:16,070
um you know some people excelling math
just like

6666
02:11:16,070 --> 02:11:16,080
just like
 

6667
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:18,229
just like
challenge them I think every every child

6668
02:11:18,229 --> 02:11:18,239
challenge them I think every every child
 

6669
02:11:18,239 --> 02:11:19,669
challenge them I think every every child
should have the right to be challenged

6670
02:11:19,669 --> 02:11:19,679
should have the right to be challenged
 

6671
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:21,589
should have the right to be challenged
and if we

6672
02:11:21,589 --> 02:11:21,599
and if we
 

6673
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:23,330
and if we
you know if we say oh you're very good

6674
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:23,340
you know if we say oh you're very good
 

6675
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:24,350
you know if we say oh you're very good
already so we're not going to bother

6676
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:24,360
already so we're not going to bother
 

6677
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:25,850
already so we're not going to bother
with you we're taking away that

6678
02:11:25,850 --> 02:11:25,860
with you we're taking away that
 

6679
02:11:25,860 --> 02:11:27,350
with you we're taking away that
fundamental right to be challenged

6680
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:27,360
fundamental right to be challenged
 

6681
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,089
fundamental right to be challenged
because if a kid this is not challenged

6682
02:11:29,089 --> 02:11:29,099
because if a kid this is not challenged
 

6683
02:11:29,099 --> 02:11:30,530
because if a kid this is not challenged
that's cool they're gonna hate school

6684
02:11:30,530 --> 02:11:30,540
that's cool they're gonna hate school
 

6685
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:32,270
that's cool they're gonna hate school
and they're going to be like dwelling

6686
02:11:32,270 --> 02:11:32,280
and they're going to be like dwelling
 

6687
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:34,310
and they're going to be like dwelling
rather than sort of pushing themselves

6688
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,320
rather than sort of pushing themselves
 

6689
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,050
rather than sort of pushing themselves
so that's sort of the education

6690
02:11:36,050 --> 02:11:36,060
so that's sort of the education
 

6691
02:11:36,060 --> 02:11:40,070
so that's sort of the education
component the other impact that AI can

6692
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:40,080
component the other impact that AI can
 

6693
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:44,930
component the other impact that AI can
have is maybe we don't need everyone to

6694
02:11:44,930 --> 02:11:44,940
have is maybe we don't need everyone to
 

6695
02:11:44,940 --> 02:11:47,450
have is maybe we don't need everyone to
be an extraordinarily good programmer

6696
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:47,460
be an extraordinarily good programmer
 

6697
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:51,229
be an extraordinarily good programmer
maybe we need better General thinkers

6698
02:11:51,229 --> 02:11:51,239
maybe we need better General thinkers
 

6699
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:54,350
maybe we need better General thinkers
and the push that we've had towards

6700
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:54,360
and the push that we've had towards
 

6701
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:57,050
and the push that we've had towards
these sort of very strict IQ based

6702
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:57,060
these sort of very strict IQ based
 

6703
02:11:57,060 --> 02:12:00,649
these sort of very strict IQ based
you know uh tests that basically test

6704
02:12:00,649 --> 02:12:00,659
you know uh tests that basically test
 

6705
02:12:00,659 --> 02:12:02,510
you know uh tests that basically test
you know only quantitative skills and

6706
02:12:02,510 --> 02:12:02,520
you know only quantitative skills and
 

6707
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:03,830
you know only quantitative skills and
programming skills and math skills and

6708
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:03,840
programming skills and math skills and
 

6709
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:04,970
programming skills and math skills and
physics skills

6710
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:04,980
physics skills
 

6711
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:06,470
physics skills
maybe we don't need those anymore maybe

6712
02:12:06,470 --> 02:12:06,480
maybe we don't need those anymore maybe
 

6713
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:08,510
maybe we don't need those anymore maybe
AI will be very good at those maybe what

6714
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:08,520
AI will be very good at those maybe what
 

6715
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:10,010
AI will be very good at those maybe what
we should be training is General

6716
02:12:10,010 --> 02:12:10,020
we should be training is General
 

6717
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:11,089
we should be training is General
thinkers

6718
02:12:11,089 --> 02:12:11,099
thinkers
 

6719
02:12:11,099 --> 02:12:15,530
thinkers
and yes you know like you know I put my

6720
02:12:15,530 --> 02:12:15,540
and yes you know like you know I put my
 

6721
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:17,450
and yes you know like you know I put my
kids through Russian math why do I do

6722
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:17,460
kids through Russian math why do I do
 

6723
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:18,709
kids through Russian math why do I do
that because they teach them how to

6724
02:12:18,709 --> 02:12:18,719
that because they teach them how to
 

6725
02:12:18,719 --> 02:12:20,450
that because they teach them how to
think and that's what I tell my kids I'm

6726
02:12:20,450 --> 02:12:20,460
think and that's what I tell my kids I'm
 

6727
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:22,550
think and that's what I tell my kids I'm
like you know hey I can compute for you

6728
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:22,560
like you know hey I can compute for you
 

6729
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,290
like you know hey I can compute for you
you don't need that but what you need is

6730
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:24,300
you don't need that but what you need is
 

6731
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:25,669
you don't need that but what you need is
learn how to think and that's why you're

6732
02:12:25,669 --> 02:12:25,679
learn how to think and that's why you're
 

6733
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:27,830
learn how to think and that's why you're
here and

6734
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:27,840
here and
 

6735
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:30,470
here and
I think challenging students with more

6736
02:12:30,470 --> 02:12:30,480
I think challenging students with more
 

6737
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:31,910
I think challenging students with more
complex problems with more

6738
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:31,920
complex problems with more
 

6739
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:33,470
complex problems with more
multi-dimensional problems with more

6740
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:33,480
multi-dimensional problems with more
 

6741
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:36,530
multi-dimensional problems with more
logical problems I think is

6742
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:36,540
logical problems I think is
 

6743
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:38,629
logical problems I think is
sort of perhaps a very fine direction

6744
02:12:38,629 --> 02:12:38,639
sort of perhaps a very fine direction
 

6745
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:41,990
sort of perhaps a very fine direction
that education can go towards

6746
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:42,000
that education can go towards
 

6747
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,669
that education can go towards
with the understanding that a lot of the

6748
02:12:45,669 --> 02:12:45,679
with the understanding that a lot of the
 

6749
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:49,149
with the understanding that a lot of the
traditionally you know scientific

6750
02:12:49,149 --> 02:12:49,159
traditionally you know scientific
 

6751
02:12:49,159 --> 02:12:52,129
traditionally you know scientific
disciplines perhaps will be more easily

6752
02:12:52,129 --> 02:12:52,139
disciplines perhaps will be more easily
 

6753
02:12:52,139 --> 02:12:55,010
disciplines perhaps will be more easily
solved by Ai and sort of thinking about

6754
02:12:55,010 --> 02:12:55,020
solved by Ai and sort of thinking about
 

6755
02:12:55,020 --> 02:12:58,970
solved by Ai and sort of thinking about
bringing up our kids to be productive to

6756
02:12:58,970 --> 02:12:58,980
bringing up our kids to be productive to
 

6757
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:01,310
bringing up our kids to be productive to
be contributing to society rather than

6758
02:13:01,310 --> 02:13:01,320
be contributing to society rather than
 

6759
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:03,350
be contributing to society rather than
to only have a job because we prohibited

6760
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,360
to only have a job because we prohibited
 

6761
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,149
to only have a job because we prohibited
AI from having those jobs

6762
02:13:05,149 --> 02:13:05,159
AI from having those jobs
 

6763
02:13:05,159 --> 02:13:07,669
AI from having those jobs
I think is the the way to the Future and

6764
02:13:07,669 --> 02:13:07,679
I think is the the way to the Future and
 

6765
02:13:07,679 --> 02:13:09,410
I think is the the way to the Future and
if you sort of focus on overall

6766
02:13:09,410 --> 02:13:09,420
if you sort of focus on overall
 

6767
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:10,510
if you sort of focus on overall
productivity

6768
02:13:10,510 --> 02:13:10,520
productivity
 

6769
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:14,810
productivity
then let the AIS come in let everybody

6770
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:14,820
then let the AIS come in let everybody
 

6771
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:16,970
then let the AIS come in let everybody
become more productive what I told my

6772
02:13:16,970 --> 02:13:16,980
become more productive what I told my
 

6773
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:18,350
become more productive what I told my
students is you're not going to be

6774
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:18,360
students is you're not going to be
 

6775
02:13:18,360 --> 02:13:19,970
students is you're not going to be
replaced by AI

6776
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:19,980
replaced by AI
 

6777
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:22,129
replaced by AI
but you're going to be replaced by

6778
02:13:22,129 --> 02:13:22,139
but you're going to be replaced by
 

6779
02:13:22,139 --> 02:13:23,870
but you're going to be replaced by
people who use AI

6780
02:13:23,870 --> 02:13:23,880
people who use AI
 

6781
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,729
people who use AI
in your job

6782
02:13:25,729 --> 02:13:25,739
in your job
 

6783
02:13:25,739 --> 02:13:28,609
in your job
so embrace it use it as your partner and

6784
02:13:28,609 --> 02:13:28,619
so embrace it use it as your partner and
 

6785
02:13:28,619 --> 02:13:31,189
so embrace it use it as your partner and
work with it rather than

6786
02:13:31,189 --> 02:13:31,199
work with it rather than
 

6787
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:33,589
work with it rather than
sort of forbidded because I think the

6788
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:33,599
sort of forbidded because I think the
 

6789
02:13:33,599 --> 02:13:36,589
sort of forbidded because I think the
productivity gains will actually lead to

6790
02:13:36,589 --> 02:13:36,599
productivity gains will actually lead to
 

6791
02:13:36,599 --> 02:13:38,569
productivity gains will actually lead to
a better society and that's something

6792
02:13:38,569 --> 02:13:38,579
a better society and that's something
 

6793
02:13:38,579 --> 02:13:40,970
a better society and that's something
that humans have been traditionally very

6794
02:13:40,970 --> 02:13:40,980
that humans have been traditionally very
 

6795
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:43,250
that humans have been traditionally very
bad at every productivity gain has led

6796
02:13:43,250 --> 02:13:43,260
bad at every productivity gain has led
 

6797
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:44,870
bad at every productivity gain has led
to more inequality

6798
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:44,880
to more inequality
 

6799
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:46,790
to more inequality
and I'm hoping that we can do we can do

6800
02:13:46,790 --> 02:13:46,800
and I'm hoping that we can do we can do
 

6801
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,350
and I'm hoping that we can do we can do
better this time that basically right

6802
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:48,360
better this time that basically right
 

6803
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:49,129
better this time that basically right
now

6804
02:13:49,129 --> 02:13:49,139
now
 

6805
02:13:49,139 --> 02:13:51,109
now
a democratization of these types of

6806
02:13:51,109 --> 02:13:51,119
a democratization of these types of
 

6807
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:53,510
a democratization of these types of
productivity games will hopefully come

6808
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:53,520
productivity games will hopefully come
 

6809
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:57,890
productivity games will hopefully come
with better sort of humanity level

6810
02:13:57,890 --> 02:13:57,900
with better sort of humanity level
 

6811
02:13:57,900 --> 02:14:00,709
with better sort of humanity level
um improvements in in human condition

6812
02:14:00,709 --> 02:14:00,719
um improvements in in human condition
 

6813
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:03,109
um improvements in in human condition
so as most people know you're not just

6814
02:14:03,109 --> 02:14:03,119
so as most people know you're not just
 

6815

so as most people know you're not just
an eloquent romantic you're also a

6816
02:14:06,010 --> 02:14:06,020
an eloquent romantic you're also a
 

6817
02:14:06,020 --> 02:14:08,149
an eloquent romantic you're also a
brilliant computational biologist

6818
02:14:08,149 --> 02:14:08,159
brilliant computational biologist
 

6819
02:14:08,159 --> 02:14:11,209
brilliant computational biologist
biologist one of the great biologists in

6820
02:14:11,209 --> 02:14:11,219
biologist one of the great biologists in
 

6821
02:14:11,219 --> 02:14:13,430
biologist one of the great biologists in
the world I had to ask how how do the

6822

cells known as oligodendrocytes that

6982
02:17:16,310 --> 02:17:16,320
cells known as oligodendrocytes that
 

6983
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:17,870
cells known as oligodendrocytes that
basically protect the neurons and

6984
02:17:17,870 --> 02:17:17,880
basically protect the neurons and
 

6985
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:20,030
basically protect the neurons and
whether cholesterol gets stuck inside

6986
02:17:20,030 --> 02:17:20,040
whether cholesterol gets stuck inside
 

6987
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:22,490
whether cholesterol gets stuck inside
the oligonometricites it doesn't form

6988
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:22,500
the oligonometricites it doesn't form
 

6989
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,770
the oligonometricites it doesn't form
myelin the neurons are not protected and

6990
02:17:24,770 --> 02:17:24,780
myelin the neurons are not protected and
 

6991
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:26,629
myelin the neurons are not protected and
it causes damage inside the

6992
02:17:26,629 --> 02:17:26,639
it causes damage inside the
 

6993
02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:29,030
it causes damage inside the
oligodendrocytes if you just restore

6994
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,040
oligodendrocytes if you just restore
 

6995
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:30,110
oligodendrocytes if you just restore
transport

6996
02:17:30,110 --> 02:17:30,120
transport
 

6997
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:31,669
transport
you basically are able to restore

6998
02:17:31,669 --> 02:17:31,679
you basically are able to restore
 

6999
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:33,709
you basically are able to restore
myelination in human cells and in mice

7000
02:17:33,709 --> 02:17:33,719
myelination in human cells and in mice
 

7001
02:17:33,719 --> 02:17:36,889
myelination in human cells and in mice
and to restore cognition in mice

7002
02:17:36,889 --> 02:17:36,899
and to restore cognition in mice
 

7003
02:17:36,899 --> 02:17:39,410
and to restore cognition in mice
so all of these circuits are basically

7004
02:17:39,410 --> 02:17:39,420
so all of these circuits are basically
 

7005
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:41,870
so all of these circuits are basically
now giving us handles to truly transform

7006
02:17:41,870 --> 02:17:41,880
now giving us handles to truly transform
 

7007
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:43,730
now giving us handles to truly transform

to interact directly from protein to
 

7189
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:10,790
to interact directly from protein to
protein interactions so I think this

7190
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:10,800
protein interactions so I think this
 

7191
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:12,650
protein interactions so I think this

recently talking to students about this

7216
02:21:46,429 --> 02:21:46,439
recently talking to students about this
 

7217
02:21:46,439 --> 02:21:48,290
recently talking to students about this
commencement address and I was talking

7218
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:48,300
commencement address and I was talking
 

7219
02:21:48,300 --> 02:21:50,090
commencement address and I was talking
to them about sort of how

7220
02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:50,100
to them about sort of how
 

7221
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:52,190
to them about sort of how
they have all of these paths ahead of

7222
02:21:52,190 --> 02:21:52,200
they have all of these paths ahead of
 

7223
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:54,830
they have all of these paths ahead of
them right now and part of it is

7224
02:21:54,830 --> 02:21:54,840
them right now and part of it is
 

7225
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:56,870
them right now and part of it is
choosing the direction which you go and

7226
02:21:56,870 --> 02:21:56,880
choosing the direction which you go and
 

7227
02:21:56,880 --> 02:21:58,730
choosing the direction which you go and
part of it is actually doing the walk to

7228
02:21:58,730 --> 02:21:58,740
part of it is actually doing the walk to
 

7229
02:21:58,740 --> 02:22:00,830
part of it is actually doing the walk to
go in that direction and in doing the

7230
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:00,840
go in that direction and in doing the
 

7231
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:02,510
go in that direction and in doing the
walk what we talked about earlier about

7232
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:02,520
walk what we talked about earlier about
 

7233
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:04,070

sort of you create your own environment

7234
02:22:04,070 --> 02:22:04,080
sort of you create your own environment
 

7235
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:06,410
sort of you create your own environment
I basically told them listen you're

7236
02:22:06,410 --> 02:22:06,420
I basically told them listen you're
 

7237
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:07,910
I basically told them listen you're
you're ending High School up until now

7238
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:07,920
you're ending High School up until now
 

7239
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,290
you're ending High School up until now
your parents have created all of your

7240
02:22:09,290 --> 02:22:09,300
your parents have created all of your
 

7241
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:11,750
your parents have created all of your
environment now it's time to take that

7242
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:11,760
environment now it's time to take that
 

7243
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:14,030
environment now it's time to take that
into your own hands and to sort of shape

7244
02:22:14,030 --> 02:22:14,040
into your own hands and to sort of shape
 

7245
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:15,830
into your own hands and to sort of shape
the environment that you want to be an

7246
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:15,840
the environment that you want to be an
 

7247
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:18,230
the environment that you want to be an
adult in and you can do that by choosing

7248
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:18,240
adult in and you can do that by choosing
 

7249
02:22:18,240 --> 02:22:20,870
adult in and you can do that by choosing
your friends by choosing your particular

7250
02:22:20,870 --> 02:22:20,880
your friends by choosing your particular
 

7251
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:23,389
your friends by choosing your particular
neuronal routines I basically think of

7252
02:22:23,389 --> 02:22:23,399
neuronal routines I basically think of
 

7253
02:22:23,399 --> 02:22:25,429
neuronal routines I basically think of
your brain as a muscle where you can

7254
02:22:25,429 --> 02:22:25,439
your brain as a muscle where you can
 

7255
02:22:25,439 --> 02:22:28,370
your brain as a muscle where you can
exercise specific neuronal pathways so

7256
02:22:28,370 --> 02:22:28,380
exercise specific neuronal pathways so
 

7257
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:31,429
exercise specific neuronal pathways so
very recently I realized that you know I

7258
02:22:31,429 --> 02:22:31,439
very recently I realized that you know I
 

7259
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:34,070
very recently I realized that you know I
was having so much trouble sleeping and

7260
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:34,080
was having so much trouble sleeping and
 

7261
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,530
was having so much trouble sleeping and
you know I would wake up in the middle

7262
02:22:36,530 --> 02:22:36,540
you know I would wake up in the middle
 

7263
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:38,090
you know I would wake up in the middle
of the night I would wake up at 4am and

7264
02:22:38,090 --> 02:22:38,100
of the night I would wake up at 4am and
 

7265
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:39,950
of the night I would wake up at 4am and
I would just never go back to bed so I

7266
02:22:39,950 --> 02:22:39,960
I would just never go back to bed so I
 

7267
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:41,809
I would just never go back to bed so I
was basically constantly losing losing

7268
02:22:41,809 --> 02:22:41,819
was basically constantly losing losing
 

7269
02:22:41,819 --> 02:22:44,030
was basically constantly losing losing
losing sleep I started a new routine

7270
02:22:44,030 --> 02:22:44,040
losing sleep I started a new routine
 

7271
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:46,730
losing sleep I started a new routine
where every morning as I bike in instead

7272
02:22:46,730 --> 02:22:46,740
where every morning as I bike in instead
 

7273
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:49,429
where every morning as I bike in instead
of going to my office I hit the gym I

7274
02:22:49,429 --> 02:22:49,439
of going to my office I hit the gym I
 

7275
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:51,349
of going to my office I hit the gym I
basically go rowing first I then do

7276
02:22:51,349 --> 02:22:51,359
basically go rowing first I then do
 

7277
02:22:51,359 --> 02:22:53,330
basically go rowing first I then do
weights I then swim very often when I

7278
02:22:53,330 --> 02:22:53,340
weights I then swim very often when I
 

7279
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:56,150
weights I then swim very often when I
have time and what that has done is

7280
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,160
have time and what that has done is
 

7281
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:58,370
have time and what that has done is
transform my neuronal Pathways so

7282
02:22:58,370 --> 02:22:58,380
transform my neuronal Pathways so
 

7283
02:22:58,380 --> 02:22:59,929
transform my neuronal Pathways so
basically right like on Friday I was

7284
02:22:59,929 --> 02:22:59,939
basically right like on Friday I was
 

7285
02:22:59,939 --> 02:23:00,950
basically right like on Friday I was
trying to go to work and I was like

7286
02:23:00,950 --> 02:23:00,960
trying to go to work and I was like
 

7287
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:02,929
trying to go to work and I was like
listen I'm not gonna go exercise and I

7288
02:23:02,929 --> 02:23:02,939
listen I'm not gonna go exercise and I
 

7289
02:23:02,939 --> 02:23:04,670
listen I'm not gonna go exercise and I
couldn't my bike just went straight to

7290
02:23:04,670 --> 02:23:04,680
couldn't my bike just went straight to
 

7291
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:06,950
couldn't my bike just went straight to
the gym like I don't want to do it and I

7292
02:23:06,950 --> 02:23:06,960
the gym like I don't want to do it and I
 

7293
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:08,210
the gym like I don't want to do it and I
just went anyway because I couldn't I

7294
02:23:08,210 --> 02:23:08,220
just went anyway because I couldn't I
 

7295
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:10,190
just went anyway because I couldn't I
couldn't do otherwise and that has

7296
02:23:10,190 --> 02:23:10,200
couldn't do otherwise and that has
 

7297
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:11,750
couldn't do otherwise and that has
completely transformed me so I think

7298
02:23:11,750 --> 02:23:11,760
completely transformed me so I think
 

7299
02:23:11,760 --> 02:23:13,309
completely transformed me so I think
this is sort of beneficial effect of

7300
02:23:13,309 --> 02:23:13,319
this is sort of beneficial effect of
 

7301
02:23:13,319 --> 02:23:16,190
this is sort of beneficial effect of

it's mandatory and I think you're
 

7313
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:27,889
it's mandatory and I think you're
overall modeled so many of us by sort of

7314
02:23:27,889 --> 02:23:27,899
overall modeled so many of us by sort of

02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:34,610
extreme being able to have these
extremely regimented regimes and uh that

7320
02:23:34,610 --> 02:23:34,620
extremely regimented regimes and uh that
 

7321
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:35,990
extremely regimented regimes and uh that
that's something that I've been terrible

7322
02:23:35,990 --> 02:23:36,000
that's something that I've been terrible
 

7323
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:36,710
that's something that I've been terrible
at

7324
02:23:36,710 --> 02:23:36,720
at
 

7325

but now I'm basically trying to coach
myself and trying to sort of you know

room
and I think

7370
02:24:31,849 --> 02:24:31,859
and I think
 

7371

there's a secret to not feeling alone
when you're the only one and that secret

7374

when you're the only one and that secret
 

7375
02:24:36,899 --> 02:24:40,849
when you're the only one and that secret
is self-reflection it's introspection

7376
