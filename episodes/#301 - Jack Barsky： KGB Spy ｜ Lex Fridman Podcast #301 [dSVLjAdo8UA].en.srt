let's start with a big basic question
 

73
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,030
let's start with a big basic question
what is the kgb committee

74
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040

 

75
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,830

right so that is the committee of uh

76
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
right so that is the committee of uh
 

77
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,270
right so that is the committee of uh
state security yeah there's an

78
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
state security yeah there's an
 

79
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,190
state security yeah there's an
apostrophe

80
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200

 

81
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,910

00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
threat okay and bs means this without
 

83
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,870
threat okay and bs means this without
right

84
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
right
 

85
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,789
right
and i guess that directly translates to

86
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
and i guess that directly translates to
 

87
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,990
and i guess that directly translates to
security without threat so and

88
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,000
security without threat so and

149
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,550
uh great competent individuals to work
for you

150
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
for you
 

151
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,550

and this is kind of strange it's it's
 

335
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,870
and this is kind of strange it's it's
almost dichotomous uh

336
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
almost dichotomous uh
 

337
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,710
almost dichotomous uh
because you know i was

338
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
because you know i was
 

339
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,670
because you know i was
running around lying to everybody and

340
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
running around lying to everybody and
 

341
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,270
running around lying to everybody and
you know i couldn't fundamentally be

342
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
you know i couldn't fundamentally be
 

343
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,189
you know i couldn't fundamentally be
trusted but the relationship that i had

344
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
trusted but the relationship that i had
 

345
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,309
trusted but the relationship that i had
with the kgb was based on trust if they

346
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
with the kgb was based on trust if they
 

347
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,670
with the kgb was based on trust if they
don't if they don't trust me they don't

348
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
don't if they don't trust me they don't
 

349
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,150
don't if they don't trust me they don't
send me out and if i don't trust him i'm

350
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
send me out and if i don't trust him i'm
 

351
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,670
send me out and if i don't trust him i'm
not going

352
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
not going
 

353
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,990
not going
and i eventually broke that trust and

354
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
and i eventually broke that trust and
 

355
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,710
and i eventually broke that trust and
they knew there was always that danger

356
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
they knew there was always that danger
 

357
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,950
they knew there was always that danger
they knew that because something about

358
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
they knew that because something about
 

359
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,909
they knew that because something about
you

360
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
you
 

361
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,990
you
or just something about human beings no

362
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
or just something about human beings no
 

363
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,510
or just something about human beings no
there were

364
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
there were
 

365
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,830
there were
there were hints about uh

366
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
there were hints about uh
 

367
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,430
there were hints about uh
you know how long

368
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
you know how long
 

369
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,790
you know how long
my assignment would be so 10 to 12 years

370
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
my assignment would be so 10 to 12 years
 

371
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,230
my assignment would be so 10 to 12 years
and you see

372
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
and you see
 

373
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,029
and you see
it makes sense all right i was becoming

374
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
it makes sense all right i was becoming
 

375
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,070
it makes sense all right i was becoming
an american and over time i would become

376
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
an american and over time i would become
 

377
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,070
an american and over time i would become
more and more american and there was

378
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
more and more american and there was
 

379
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,110
more and more american and there was
always a chance that i liked it more

380
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
always a chance that i liked it more
 

381
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,270
always a chance that i liked it more
here than there that that i was really

382
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
here than there that that i was really
 

383
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,390
here than there that that i was really
successful in what i was supposed to do

384
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
successful in what i was supposed to do

386
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
and it sort of happened but in my case
 

387
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,309
and it sort of happened but in my case
it happened because of i fathered a

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,509
afterwards after i you know retired and
then started doing some research i had

compartmentalization

526
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
compartmentalization
 

527
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,110
compartmentalization
uh and and that

528
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
uh and and that
 

529
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,790
uh and and that
was based on

530
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
was based on
 

531
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,949
was based on
you know the communist movement while it

532
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
you know the communist movement while it
 

533
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,550
you know the communist movement while it
was still underground

534
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
was still underground
 

535
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,269
was still underground
you know the the cells were very small

536
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
you know the the cells were very small
 

537
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,110
you know the the cells were very small
and the so that maybe there were three

538
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
and the so that maybe there were three
 

539
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,509
and the so that maybe there were three
four members in one cell that knew one

540
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
four members in one cell that knew one
 

541
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,470
four members in one cell that knew one
another

542
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
another
 

543
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,310
another
and then they had a liaison to another

544
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
and then they had a liaison to another
 

545
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,509
and then they had a liaison to another
cell so with

546
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
cell so with
 

547
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,230
cell so with
the bottom line is if if you got one one

548
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
the bottom line is if if you got one one
 

549
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,310
the bottom line is if if you got one one
of those folks were caught

550
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
of those folks were caught
 

551
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,870
of those folks were caught
they could maybe betray four people or

552
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
they could maybe betray four people or
 

553
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,910
they could maybe betray four people or
three something like that and in the kgb

554
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
three something like that and in the kgb

with a hierarchy
 

891
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,350
with a hierarchy
so and who gets to the top

892
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:29,360
so and who gets to the top
 

893
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,910
so and who gets to the top
the the ones that are that want to go to

894
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
the the ones that are that want to go to
 

895
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,269
the the ones that are that want to go to
the top the ones that believe in

896
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
the top the ones that believe in
 

897
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,949
the top the ones that believe in
themselves the ones the ones that know

898
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:34,959
themselves the ones the ones that know
 

899

better than everybody else
 

901
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,389
better than everybody else
and once you have that hierarchy

902
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
and once you have that hierarchy
 

903
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,189
and once you have that hierarchy
established there is no guarantee that

904
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
established there is no guarantee that
 

905
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,590
established there is no guarantee that
it doesn't that that it won't go bad and

it doesn't that that it won't go bad and
 

907
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,069
it doesn't that that it won't go bad and
actually when you look at history

908
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
actually when you look at history
 

909
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,790
actually when you look at history
every such hierarchy has gone bad you

910
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
every such hierarchy has gone bad you
 

911
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,590
every such hierarchy has gone bad you
know

912
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600

but let's step away from that for a
 

929
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,549
but let's step away from that for a
second

930
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559

now the the the technical guys you know
they taught me something i didn't know

4244
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:31,199
they taught me something i didn't know
 

4245
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,950
they taught me something i didn't know
that made sense uh

4246
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:32,960
that made sense uh
 

4247
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,830
that made sense uh
um

4248
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
um
 

4249
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,070
um
what nikolai some of the stuff that he

4250
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:36,080
what nikolai some of the stuff that he
 

4251
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,870
what nikolai some of the stuff that he
taught me

4252
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:38,880

 

4253
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,630

was somewhat questionable he was a

4254
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:40,640
was somewhat questionable he was a
 

4255
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,310
was somewhat questionable he was a
generalist

4256
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:42,320
generalist
 

4257
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,910
generalist
and some things he didn't know really

4258
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:43,920
and some things he didn't know really
 

4259
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,030
and some things he didn't know really
well so i could have like asked probed a

4260
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:47,040
well so i could have like asked probed a
 

4261
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,550
well so i could have like asked probed a
little bit but i didn't

4262
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
little bit but i didn't
 

4263
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,709
little bit but i didn't
so i just played along

4264
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:50,719
so i just played along
 

4265
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,350
so i just played along
so this new apartment was uh

4266
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:53,360
so this new apartment was uh
 

4267
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,750
so this new apartment was uh
it was a studio it had a

4268
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:55,760
it was a studio it had a
 

4269
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,709
it was a studio it had a
kitchen

4270
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:56,719
kitchen
 

4271
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,709
kitchen
with running cold water

4272
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
with running cold water
 

4273
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:01,990
with running cold water
and the bathroom was just one flight

4274
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:02,000
and the bathroom was just one flight
 

4275
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,149
and the bathroom was just one flight
down the toilet not a bathroom uh one

4276
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:04,159
down the toilet not a bathroom uh one
 

4277
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:05,750
down the toilet not a bathroom uh one
flight down the

4278
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:05,760
flight down the
 

4279
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,709
flight down the
stairs an upgrade it was a big upgrade

4280
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
stairs an upgrade it was a big upgrade
 

4281
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:10,229
stairs an upgrade it was a big upgrade
yeah and he gave me

4282
01:18:10,229 --> 01:18:10,239
yeah and he gave me
 

4283
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:11,910
yeah and he gave me
uh i think he gave me a thousand mark to

4284
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:11,920
uh i think he gave me a thousand mark to
 

4285
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,310
uh i think he gave me a thousand mark to
buy buy furniture

4286
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:14,320
buy buy furniture
 

4287
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,830
buy buy furniture
and in that place i

4288
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
and in that place i
 

4289
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,669
and in that place i
actually i also bought a tv and started

4290
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
actually i also bought a tv and started
 

4291
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,750
actually i also bought a tv and started
watching west german television so

4292
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:19,760
watching west german television so
 

4293
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,950
watching west german television so
so it

4294
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:20,960
so it
 

4295
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,550
so it
i finally had a

4296
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:22,560
i finally had a
 

4297
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,870
i finally had a
decent place to stay

4298
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:24,880
decent place to stay
 

4299
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:27,270
decent place to stay
um and the

4300
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:27,280
um and the
 

4301
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,310
um and the
the

4302
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:28,320
the
 

4303
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,070

01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:37,520
what were sort of if you do an overview
 

4313
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:39,189
what were sort of if you do an overview
systematic of what was the training

so uh let me start with a trade craft

4324
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:51,600

optimize it's like the balance security
 

4407
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,110
optimize it's like the balance security
and like humans being able to actually

01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
and like humans being able to actually

and like humans being able to actually
yeah no i got to disagree it was neither

4410
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,360
yeah no i got to disagree it was neither
 

4411
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,110
yeah no i got to disagree it was neither
efficient nor convenient okay it would

4412
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,120
efficient nor convenient okay it would
 

4413
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,590
efficient nor convenient okay it would
took a long time

4414
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:33,600
took a long time
 

4415
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,070
took a long time
when what was what was significantly

4416
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:36,080
when what was what was significantly
 

4417
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,430
when what was what was significantly
easier to do

4418
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:37,440
easier to do
 

4419
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,990
easier to do
uh but uh that would require you to have

4420
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:40,000
uh but uh that would require you to have
 

4421
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,149
uh but uh that would require you to have
spy paraphernalia with you this is

4422
01:20:42,149 --> 01:20:42,159
spy paraphernalia with you this is
 

4423
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,470
spy paraphernalia with you this is
what's called a one-time pad

4424
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:44,480
what's called a one-time pad
 

4425
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,030
what's called a one-time pad
so you have the set of numbers

4426
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:47,040
so you have the set of numbers
 

4427
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,070
so you have the set of numbers
on on the sheet of paper

paper right and uh the reason that they
 

4467
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,790
paper right and uh the reason that they
gave me a manual one is because i

4468
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:28,800
gave me a manual one is because i
 

4469
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,709
gave me a manual one is because i
literally i had

literally i had

01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:40,870
that uh
only a spy can have and that was a

only a spy can have and that was a
 

4481
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,350
only a spy can have and that was a
a writing pad with uh

a writing pad with uh
 

4483
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,510
a writing pad with uh
where the first 10 pages or so were

that was used for secret writing
 

4489
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,590
that was used for secret writing
uh but you really would have to know

4490
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
uh but you really would have to know
 

4491
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,110
uh but you really would have to know
what you're looking for to you know you

4492
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:53,120
what you're looking for to you know you
 

4493
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:55,189
what you're looking for to you know you
see this pad it was bought at you a

4494
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:55,199
see this pad it was bought at you a
 

4495
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,270
see this pad it was bought at you a
walmart and can you explain a little a

4496
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:57,280
walmart and can you explain a little a
 

4497
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,110
walmart and can you explain a little a
little further what what is the chemical

4498
01:21:59,110 --> 01:21:59,120
little further what what is the chemical
 

4499
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,470
little further what what is the chemical
here that

4500
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
here that
 

4501
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,470
here that
what are we talking about so how i i

4502
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:02,480
what are we talking about so how i i
 

4503
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,990
what are we talking about so how i i
don't understand how it's possible to

4504
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:04,000
don't understand how it's possible to
 

4505
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,149
don't understand how it's possible to
have a physical pad that does the

4506
01:22:06,149 --> 01:22:06,159
have a physical pad that does the
 

4507
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:09,270
have a physical pad that does the
encryption without any computing

4508
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:09,280
encryption without any computing
 

4509
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,830
encryption without any computing
i how does it include right so so no no

4510
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:11,840
i how does it include right so so no no
 

4511
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,430
i how does it include right so so no no
it doesn't it doesn't do any work you

4512
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:13,440
it doesn't it doesn't do any work you
 

4513
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,950
it doesn't it doesn't do any work you
know so

4514
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:14,960
know so
 

4515
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,390
know so
and the uh the communication that the

4516
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:18,400
and the uh the communication that the
 

4517
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,669
and the uh the communication that the
encrypted communication was uh was a

4518
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:21,679
encrypted communication was uh was a
 

4519
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,030
encrypted communication was uh was a
set of uh

4520
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,040
set of uh
 

4521
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,669
set of uh
uh groups of five

4522
01:22:25,669 --> 01:22:25,679
uh groups of five
 

4523
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:27,750
uh groups of five
five digits and then another five and

4524
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:27,760
five digits and then another five and
 

4525
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,149
five digits and then another five and
there's always a gap in between

4526
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:30,159
there's always a gap in between
 

4527
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,910
there's always a gap in between
uh and

4528
01:22:31,910 --> 01:22:31,920
uh and
 

4529
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,149
uh and
so let's say if i get this radio

4530
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:34,159
so let's say if i get this radio
 

4531
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:35,750
so let's say if i get this radio
transmission i write them all down and

4532
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:35,760
transmission i write them all down and
 

4533
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,310
transmission i write them all down and
then i then i use my uh develop my

4534
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:38,320
then i then i use my uh develop my
 

4535
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,390
then i then i use my uh develop my
algorithm and then i do mathematics

4536
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:40,400
algorithm and then i do mathematics
 

4537
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,550
algorithm and then i do mathematics
either addition or subtraction

4538
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560
either addition or subtraction
 

4539
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,790
either addition or subtraction
the resulting set of digits

4540
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:44,800
the resulting set of digits
 

4541
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,709
the resulting set of digits
had that then had a one-to-one

4542
01:22:46,709 --> 01:22:46,719
had that then had a one-to-one
 

4543
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:49,189
had that then had a one-to-one
correlation to letters and this is an

4544
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:49,199
correlation to letters and this is an
 

4545
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:52,470
correlation to letters and this is an
easy way to then do the correlation yes

4546
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:52,480
easy way to then do the correlation yes
 

4547
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,229
easy way to then do the correlation yes
well that's cool that's uh you're saying

4548
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:54,239
well that's cool that's uh you're saying
 

4549
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,470
well that's cool that's uh you're saying
the algorithm was not efficient it was

4550
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:56,480
the algorithm was not efficient it was
 

4551
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,030
the algorithm was not efficient it was
not oh the manual it took a long time

4552
01:22:59,030 --> 01:22:59,040
not oh the manual it took a long time
 

4553
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,550
not oh the manual it took a long time
and and you can't make an arrow

4554
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,560
and and you can't make an arrow
 

4555
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,350
and and you can't make an arrow
right uh would you know where can you is

4556
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:05,360
right uh would you know where can you is
 

4557
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,830
right uh would you know where can you is
it easy to debug no you no you do it

4558
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:07,840
it easy to debug no you no you do it
 

4559
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:08,790
it easy to debug no you no you do it
twice

4560
01:23:08,790 --> 01:23:08,800
twice
 

4561
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,070
twice
you do it twice and that's how you

4562
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
you do it twice and that's how you
 

4563
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,390
you do it twice and that's how you
change it's identical then you know

4564
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:12,400
change it's identical then you know
 

4565
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,390
change it's identical then you know
but like if it's not then

4566
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:14,400
but like if it's not then
 

4567
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,830
but like if it's not then

surveillance

4620
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:10,960
surveillance
 

4621
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:13,110
surveillance
you know some trickery and

4622
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120
you know some trickery and
 

4623
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,790
you know some trickery and
and uh

4624
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:14,800
and uh
 

4625
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,189
and uh
surveillance detection routes where you

4626
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:17,199
surveillance detection routes where you
 

4627
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,350
surveillance detection routes where you
wander around in the city

4628
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
wander around in the city
 

4629
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,590
wander around in the city
for three hours

4630
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:21,600
for three hours
 

4631
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,030
for three hours
and

4632
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:23,040
and
 

4633
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,550
and
determine whether you're being followed

4634

4638
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:28,080
that requires you to plan the route very
 

4639
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,110
that requires you to plan the route very
well

well
 

4641
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,750
well
i give you one example that uh that will

4642

i give you one example that uh that will
 

4643
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,430
i give you one example that uh that will
illustrate that

and at the bottom of the hill
 

4661
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,709
and at the bottom of the hill
there was a telephone booth

4662
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:54,719

so it wasn't like this right it wasn't a
 

4671
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:04,390
so it wasn't like this right it wasn't a
giveaway this was normal it was natural

4672
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:04,400
giveaway this was normal it was natural
 

4673
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,270
giveaway this was normal it was natural
so yeah i could see if somebody would

4674
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,280
so yeah i could see if somebody would
 

4675
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,270
so yeah i could see if somebody would
come walking after me you know these

4676
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:09,280
come walking after me you know these
 

4677
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,910
come walking after me you know these
kinds of things or you would uh

kinds of things or you would uh
 

4679
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,510
kinds of things or you would uh
you know use um

4680
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:13,520
you know use um
 

4681
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,470
you know use um
public transportation uh

4682
01:25:16,470 --> 01:25:16,480
public transportation uh
 

4683
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,390
public transportation uh
big buildings

4684
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:18,400
big buildings
 

4685
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,470
big buildings
uh where you

4686
01:25:20,470 --> 01:25:20,480
uh where you
 

4687
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,870
uh where you
needed to use an elevator and see who's

4688
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:22,880
needed to use an elevator and see who's
 

4689
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,070
needed to use an elevator and see who's
because

4690
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:24,080
because
 

4691
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,350
because
surveillance

4692
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:25,360
surveillance
 

4693
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:27,669
surveillance
the the object of surveillance is to

4694
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:27,679
the the object of surveillance is to
 

4695
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:30,070
the the object of surveillance is to
never lose sight of the individual who

4696
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,080
never lose sight of the individual who
 

4697
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,390
never lose sight of the individual who
you're surveilling because at that point

4698
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
you're surveilling because at that point
 

4699
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,310
you're surveilling because at that point
you may miss the window where he does

4700
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:34,320
you may miss the window where he does
 

4701
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,709
you may miss the window where he does
something that that you're looking for

4702
01:25:36,709 --> 01:25:36,719
something that that you're looking for
 

4703
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,390
something that that you're looking for
so somebody

4704
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,400
so somebody
 

4705
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,709
so somebody
always has to come close right did you

4706
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:40,719
always has to come close right did you
 

4707
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,430
always has to come close right did you
have to also study

4708
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:43,440
have to also study
 

4709
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,430
have to also study
surveillance no

4710
01:25:45,430 --> 01:25:45,440
surveillance no
 

4711
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,350
surveillance no
counter surveillance

4712
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:47,360
counter surveillance
 

4713
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:51,270
counter surveillance
and what helped me in in all my training

4714
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:51,280
and what helped me in in all my training
 

4715
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,270
and what helped me in in all my training
uh you know i would

4716
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:53,280
uh you know i would
 

4717
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,070
uh you know i would
be uh would have a competition with the

4718
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:56,080
be uh would have a competition with the
 

4719
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,910
be uh would have a competition with the
folks that were coming that were

4720
01:25:57,910 --> 01:25:57,920
folks that were coming that were
 

4721
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,270
folks that were coming that were
following me

4722
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,280
following me
 

4723
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,470
following me
and me

4724
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:00,480
and me
 

4725
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,550
and me
and i beat them every time

4726
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:02,560
and i beat them every time
 

4727
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,950
and i beat them every time
uh they were at a disadvantage because

4728
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:04,960
uh they were at a disadvantage because
 

4729
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:07,189
uh they were at a disadvantage because
one of them always had to be close and

4730
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
one of them always had to be close and
 

4731
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,510
one of them always had to be close and
and if you saw the same face twice you

4732
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:09,520
and if you saw the same face twice you
 

4733
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,390
and if you saw the same face twice you
know

4734
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:10,400
know
 

4735
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,149
know
that you were being followed and i had a

4736
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:12,159
that you were being followed and i had a
 

4737
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:15,270
that you were being followed and i had a
very very good uh memory for for faces

4738
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,280
very very good uh memory for for faces
 

4739
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,189
very very good uh memory for for faces
so basically figure out a fixed route

4740
01:26:19,189 --> 01:26:19,199
so basically figure out a fixed route
 

4741
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,189
so basically figure out a fixed route
and then a fixed route that allows you

4742
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:21,199
and then a fixed route that allows you
 

4743
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,870
and then a fixed route that allows you
to uh

4744
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880
to uh
 

4745
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,070
to uh
survey the area and then record the

4746
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:26,080
survey the area and then record the
 

4747
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,629
survey the area and then record the
faces you've seen inside your mind

4748
01:26:28,629 --> 01:26:28,639
faces you've seen inside your mind
 

4749
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,030
faces you've seen inside your mind
and if uh you see multiple times a

4750
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:31,040
and if uh you see multiple times a
 

4751
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,270
and if uh you see multiple times a
single face that's that's a bad sign and

4752
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:33,280
single face that's that's a bad sign and
 

4753
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,110
single face that's that's a bad sign and
they they could they could uh

4754
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:35,120
they they could they could uh
 

4755
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,270
they they could they could uh
you use uh different clothes

4756
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:37,280
you use uh different clothes
 

4757
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:40,149
you use uh different clothes
yeah uh but they didn't have

4758
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:40,159
yeah uh but they didn't have
 

4759
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,870
yeah uh but they didn't have
was face masks yeah the cia does

4760
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:42,880
was face masks yeah the cia does
 

4761
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,070
was face masks yeah the cia does
nowadays

4762
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,080
nowadays
 

4763
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,510
nowadays
they can give you a different face

4764
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:45,520
they can give you a different face
 

4765
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,910
they can give you a different face
within seconds

4766
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:47,920
within seconds
 

4767
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,590
within seconds
yeah

4768
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:49,600
yeah
 

4769
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,950
yeah
so

4770
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:52,960

 

4771
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:59,189

i mean again you talk about paranoia

4772
01:26:59,189 --> 01:26:59,199

 

4773
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:01,350

is that part of the is that a big part

4774
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:01,360
is that part of the is that a big part
 

4775
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,189
is that part of the is that a big part
of the job

4776
01:27:03,189 --> 01:27:03,199
of the job
 

4777
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:05,669
of the job
uh counter surveillance like being

4778
01:27:05,669 --> 01:27:05,679
uh counter surveillance like being
 

4779
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,030
uh counter surveillance like being
constantly paranoid that you're being

4780
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:07,040
constantly paranoid that you're being
 

4781
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:07,990
constantly paranoid that you're being
watched

4782
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,000
watched
 

4783
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,510
watched
yeah i was supposed to isn't that quite

4784
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:09,520
yeah i was supposed to isn't that quite
 

4785
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,149
yeah i was supposed to isn't that quite
stressful so is that is that one of the

4786
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:12,159
stressful so is that is that one of the
 

4787
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:13,510
stressful so is that is that one of the
is that actually an effective way to

4788
01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:13,520
is that actually an effective way to
 

4789
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,669
is that actually an effective way to
operate uh no but it sort of becomes a

4790
01:27:15,669 --> 01:27:15,679
operate uh no but it sort of becomes a
 

4791
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,110
operate uh no but it sort of becomes a
routine uh i was told to do it uh while

4792
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:19,120
routine uh i was told to do it uh while
 

4793
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,189
routine uh i was told to do it uh while
in the u.s uh once a month

4794
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:21,199
in the u.s uh once a month
 

4795
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:24,310
in the u.s uh once a month
and uh okay it's like a cleaning out oh

4796
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
and uh okay it's like a cleaning out oh
 

4797
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,629
and uh okay it's like a cleaning out oh
not every day no no no no no once a

4798
01:27:26,629 --> 01:27:26,639
not every day no no no no no once a
 

4799
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:27,830
not every day no no no no no once a
month or

4800
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:27,840
month or
 

4801
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,590
month or
before i would say mail a letter with

4802
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:29,600
before i would say mail a letter with
 

4803
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,830
before i would say mail a letter with
secret writing

4804
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:30,840
secret writing
 

4805
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,669
secret writing
so i was sure that you know nobody saw

4806
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
so i was sure that you know nobody saw
 

4807
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,470
so i was sure that you know nobody saw
me put an envelope into

4808
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:36,480
me put an envelope into
 

4809
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,669
me put an envelope into
a

4810
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:37,679
a
 

4811
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:39,590
a
postbox so this is one of the tools in

4812
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,600
postbox so this is one of the tools in
 

4813
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,189
postbox so this is one of the tools in
your toolbox so there's morse code

4814
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:41,199
your toolbox so there's morse code
 

4815
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,950
your toolbox so there's morse code
there's yes the decryption and

4816
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:42,960
there's yes the decryption and
 

4817
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,229
there's yes the decryption and
encryption there's the kind of

4818
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:44,239
encryption there's the kind of
 

4819
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:46,629
encryption there's the kind of
surveillance photography

4820
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:46,639
surveillance photography
 

4821
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:50,390
surveillance photography
photography um making making micro dots

4822
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:50,400
photography um making making micro dots
 

4823
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,229
photography um making making micro dots
you know what a micro dot is

4824
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:52,239
you know what a micro dot is
 

4825
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:55,189
you know what a micro dot is
well that's uh that's uh

4826
01:27:55,189 --> 01:27:55,199
well that's uh that's uh
 

4827
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:56,229
well that's uh that's uh
you use

4828
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:56,239
you use
 

4829
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,870
you use
you you take a photograph

4830
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:58,880
you you take a photograph
 

4831
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,030
you you take a photograph
and you use a microscope in reverse

4832
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:03,040
and you use a microscope in reverse
 

4833
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,390
and you use a microscope in reverse
and make

4834
01:28:04,390 --> 01:28:04,400
and make
 

4835
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,070
and make
that photograph

4836
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:06,080
that photograph
 

4837
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,270
that photograph
really small

4838
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:07,280
really small
 

4839
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,149
really small
so small that it's like the the

4840
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:10,159
so small that it's like the the
 

4841
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,310
so small that it's like the the
head of a pin

4842
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:12,320
head of a pin
 

4843
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,709
head of a pin
that can be used to uh

4844
01:28:14,709 --> 01:28:14,719
that can be used to uh
 

4845
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:17,270
that can be used to uh
hide under opposite stamp

4846
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:17,280
hide under opposite stamp
 

4847
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,149
hide under opposite stamp
yeah

4848
01:28:18,149 --> 01:28:18,159
yeah
 

4849
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,110
yeah
in reality i knew how to make them

4850
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,120
in reality i knew how to make them
 

4851
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,629
in reality i knew how to make them
but in reality they

4852
01:28:22,629 --> 01:28:22,639
but in reality they
 

4853
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:24,550
but in reality they
they never asked me to to make use of

4854
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:24,560
they never asked me to to make use of
 

4855
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,189
they never asked me to to make use of
that uh technique so it's a sort of an

4856
01:28:27,189 --> 01:28:27,199
that uh technique so it's a sort of an
 

4857
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:29,590
that uh technique so it's a sort of an
encryption mechanism for photographs

4858
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:29,600
encryption mechanism for photographs
 

4859
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,470
encryption mechanism for photographs
yeah so what we do nowadays is an embed

4860
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:32,480
yeah so what we do nowadays is an embed
 

4861
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,590
yeah so what we do nowadays is an embed
code in

4862
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:33,600
code in
 

4863
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,229
code in
in uh pdfs and stuff like that right

4864
01:28:36,229 --> 01:28:36,239
in uh pdfs and stuff like that right
 

4865
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,790
in uh pdfs and stuff like that right
yep beautiful okay all right so that

4866
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:38,800
yep beautiful okay all right so that
 

4867
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:41,189
yep beautiful okay all right so that
that was a learning a training process

4868
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:41,199
that was a learning a training process
 

4869
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,350
that was a learning a training process
both in the physical space

4870
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:43,360
both in the physical space
 

4871
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,390
both in the physical space
yes

4872
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:44,400
yes
 

4873
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,830
yes
algorithmically

4874
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:45,840
algorithmically
 

4875
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,629
algorithmically
is there other things oh you bet uh

4876
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:48,639
is there other things oh you bet uh
 

4877
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:53,030
is there other things oh you bet uh
interestingly enough the uh i was um

4878
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:53,040
interestingly enough the uh i was um
 

4879
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,270
interestingly enough the uh i was um
the first book i was given to read was

4880
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:55,280
the first book i was given to read was
 

4881
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,189
the first book i was given to read was
the history of this uh these uh

4882
01:28:57,189 --> 01:28:57,199
the history of this uh these uh
 

4883
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,629
the history of this uh these uh
communist party of the soviet union

4884
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:00,639
communist party of the soviet union
 

4885
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,550
communist party of the soviet union
also understand that's interesting

4886
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:02,560
also understand that's interesting
 

4887
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,149
also understand that's interesting
because you said you had to read western

4888
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:04,159
because you said you had to read western
 

4889
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,669
because you said you had to read western
literature yeah that too how much how

4890
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:05,679
literature yeah that too how much how
 

4891
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,270
literature yeah that too how much how
much reading

01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:07,280
much reading
 

4893
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,910
much reading
so history how much history of politics

4894
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:09,920

which is not necessarily the best way
because

5202
01:34:32,629 --> 01:34:32,639

5222
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:55,440
that meant but yeah well so it builds a
 

5223
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,109
that meant but yeah well so it builds a
good foundation for a language just

5224
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:57,119
good foundation for a language just
 

5225
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:59,030
good foundation for a language just
getting a large vocabulary yes it's

5226
01:34:59,030 --> 01:34:59,040
getting a large vocabulary yes it's
 

5227
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,629
getting a large vocabulary yes it's
really interesting there's something i

5228
01:35:00,629 --> 01:35:00,639
really interesting there's something i
 

5229
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,229
really interesting there's something i
do which is called space repetition

5230
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:02,239
do which is called space repetition
 

5231
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,990
do which is called space repetition
which is a programmatic way of doing

5232
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:04,000
which is a programmatic way of doing
 

5233
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,189
which is a programmatic way of doing
this kind of system that you've

5234
01:35:05,189 --> 01:35:05,199
this kind of system that you've
 

5235
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,629
this kind of system that you've
developed yourself

5236
01:35:06,629 --> 01:35:06,639
developed yourself
 

5237
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:07,590
developed yourself
which is

5238
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:07,600
which is
 

5239
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,550
which is
if you

5240
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:08,560
if you
 

5241
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,709
if you
successfully remember a thing

5242
01:35:10,709 --> 01:35:10,719
successfully remember a thing
 

5243
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:13,030
successfully remember a thing
it's going to be a longer time before it

5244
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:13,040
it's going to be a longer time before it
 

5245
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,870
it's going to be a longer time before it
brings it up to you again yeah

5246
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:14,880
brings it up to you again yeah
 

5247
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:18,070
brings it up to you again yeah
now that's requires a computer

5248
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:18,080
now that's requires a computer
 

5249
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,070
now that's requires a computer
to keep track of my information if you

5250
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:20,080
to keep track of my information if you
 

5251
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,669
to keep track of my information if you
have cars that's a really interesting

5252
01:35:21,669 --> 01:35:21,679
have cars that's a really interesting
 

5253
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:24,149
have cars that's a really interesting
pile system one two three four five you

5254
01:35:24,149 --> 01:35:24,159
pile system one two three four five you
 

5255
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:26,709
pile system one two three four five you
upgrade it one two three four five maybe

5256
01:35:26,709 --> 01:35:26,719
upgrade it one two three four five maybe
 

5257
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:29,030
upgrade it one two three four five maybe
i wouldn't go to the archive and go to

5258
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:29,040
i wouldn't go to the archive and go to
 

5259
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,270
i wouldn't go to the archive and go to
number two to pile one right away maybe

5260
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:31,280
number two to pile one right away maybe
 

5261
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,470
number two to pile one right away maybe
i would

5262
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:32,480
i would
 

5263
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,149
i would
go to like i don't know

5267
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:37,350
pile
five perhaps is probably the right place

5268
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:37,360
five perhaps is probably the right place
 

5269
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,350
five perhaps is probably the right place
to put it because you have to go through

learn
 

5277
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,070
learn
definitely language but also facts like

01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,189
it was a
it was a dumbed down fortran

5382
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:37,199
it was a dumbed down fortran
 

5383
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:37,990
it was a dumbed down fortran
but

5384
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,000
but
 

5385
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,870
but
listen

5386
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880
listen
 

5387
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,149
listen
so

5388
01:37:40,149 --> 01:37:40,159
so
 

5389
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:43,030
so
i i see the ability i see what what you

5390
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:43,040
i i see the ability i see what what you
 

5391
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,430
i i see the ability i see what what you
can do with this i program the sign

5392
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:45,440
can do with this i program the sign
 

5393
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,390
can do with this i program the sign
curve

5394
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:46,400
curve
 

5395
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,750
curve
and then i

5396
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:47,760
and then i
 

5397
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,030
and then i
divided

5398
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:49,040
divided
 

5399
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,109
divided
the design curve into really really

5400
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:51,119
the design curve into really really
 

5401
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,910
the design curve into really really
small rectangles and then ran the

5402
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:53,920
small rectangles and then ran the
 

5403
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,709
small rectangles and then ran the
program and it came up with the right

5404
01:37:56,709 --> 01:37:56,719
program and it came up with the right
 

5405
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,229
program and it came up with the right
area

5406
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:58,239
area
 

5407
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,870
area
wow this is great that's incredible it's

5408
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:00,880
wow this is great that's incredible it's
 

5409
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,950
wow this is great that's incredible it's
incredible it's so powerful

5410
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:02,960
incredible it's so powerful
 

5411
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,229
incredible it's so powerful
it's uh

5412
01:38:04,229 --> 01:38:04,239
it's uh

didn't know it it's interesting that kgb
didn't put a

6908
02:04:36,709 --> 02:04:36,719
didn't put a
 

6909
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:38,870
didn't put a
high value to that kind of integration

6910

high value to that kind of integration
 

6911
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,470

they didn't know what they didn't know

6912
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:40,480
they didn't know what they didn't know
 

6913
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:42,709
they didn't know what they didn't know
yeah and and by the way this was mutual

6914
02:04:42,709 --> 02:04:42,719
yeah and and by the way this was mutual
 

6915
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:45,270
yeah and and by the way this was mutual
do you think the cia had

6916
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:45,280
do you think the cia had
 

6917
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,830
do you think the cia had
good knowledge of the russian culture ah

6918
02:04:47,830 --> 02:04:47,840
good knowledge of the russian culture ah
 

6919
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:48,870
good knowledge of the russian culture ah
same thing

6920
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:48,880
same thing
 

6921
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:50,550
same thing
and so um

6922
02:04:50,550 --> 02:04:50,560
and so um
 

6923
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:52,470
and so um
there was a lot of lack of understanding

6924
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:52,480
there was a lot of lack of understanding
 

6925
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,149
there was a lot of lack of understanding
because good good intelligence could

6926
02:04:54,149 --> 02:04:54,159
because good good intelligence could
 

6927
02:04:54,159 --> 02:04:57,109
because good good intelligence could
have uh possibly avoided some of the

6928
02:04:57,109 --> 02:04:57,119
have uh possibly avoided some of the
 

6929
02:04:57,119 --> 02:04:59,270
have uh possibly avoided some of the
uh high tension that situations that we

6930
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280
uh high tension that situations that we
 

6931
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,750
uh high tension that situations that we
had when when in the 80s we got close to

6932
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:01,760
had when when in the 80s we got close to
 

6933
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:03,669
had when when in the 80s we got close to
nuclear war

6934
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:03,679
nuclear war
 

6935
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:05,669
nuclear war
so good intelligence would be

6936
02:05:05,669 --> 02:05:05,679
so good intelligence would be
 

6937
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:08,069
so good intelligence would be
integrating yourself in society yes

6938
02:05:08,069 --> 02:05:08,079
integrating yourself in society yes
 

6939
02:05:08,079 --> 02:05:10,310
integrating yourself in society yes
and understanding that ronald reagan was

6940

02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:13,030
and understanding that ronald reagan was
not a warmonger but he was talking about

6942

not a warmonger but he was talking about
 

6943
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:14,950
not a warmonger but he was talking about
the end times because he was a a

6944
02:05:14,950 --> 02:05:14,960
the end times because he was a a

02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:16,310
the end times because he was a a

christian
 

6947

christian
but then that kind of integration can be

6948
02:05:17,990 --> 02:05:18,000
but then that kind of integration can be
 

6949
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,750
but then that kind of integration can be
dangerous because

6950
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:19,760
dangerous because
 

6951
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:21,830
dangerous because
you start to question the propaganda the

6952
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:21,840
you start to question the propaganda the
 

6953
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:22,870
you start to question the propaganda the
narratives

6954

6955
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:25,669

all they always have to have the options
 

6961
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,589
all they always have to have the options
of ignoring the intelligence that

6962
02:05:31,589 --> 02:05:31,599
of ignoring the intelligence that
 

6963
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:33,669
of ignoring the intelligence that
they're getting right

02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:05,920
it's a straight one way that all the
 

7049
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:07,990
it's a straight one way that all the
intelligence agencies control the

7050
02:07:07,990 --> 02:07:08,000
intelligence agencies control the
 

7051
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,830

02:07:18,229 --> 02:07:18,239
well
 

7061
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:19,189
well
uh

7062
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:19,199
uh
 

7063
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:20,709
uh
so the question is which way the

7064
02:07:20,709 --> 02:07:20,719
so the question is which way the
 

7065
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:22,149
so the question is which way the
direction goes but you're saying that

7066
02:07:22,149 --> 02:07:22,159
direction goes but you're saying that
 

7067
02:07:22,159 --> 02:07:24,790
direction goes but you're saying that
there is um it's not one way flow of

7068
02:07:24,790 --> 02:07:24,800
there is um it's not one way flow of
 

7069
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,430
there is um it's not one way flow of
power i would think so

7070
02:07:27,430 --> 02:07:27,440
power i would think so
 

7071
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:30,229
power i would think so
and and i also believe it exists but

7072
02:07:30,229 --> 02:07:30,239
and and i also believe it exists but

you know that that we know of
a good point this is very difficult uh

7184
02:09:30,709 --> 02:09:30,719
a good point this is very difficult uh
 

7185
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:33,109
a good point this is very difficult uh
the the the question is

7186
02:09:33,109 --> 02:09:33,119
the the the question is
 

7187
02:09:33,119 --> 02:09:35,109
the the the question is
how many lines

7188
02:09:35,109 --> 02:09:35,119
how many lines
 

7189
02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:37,589
how many lines
are intelligence agencies

7190
02:09:37,589 --> 02:09:37,599
are intelligence agencies
 

7191
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:39,750
are intelligence agencies
willing to cross

7192
02:09:39,750 --> 02:09:39,760
willing to cross
 

7193
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:41,589
willing to cross
to attain

7194
02:09:41,589 --> 02:09:41,599
to attain
 

7195
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:43,669
to attain
to achieve the goal i

7196
02:09:43,669 --> 02:09:43,679
to achieve the goal i
 

7197
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:46,870
to achieve the goal i
i i think none of these agencies

7198
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:46,880
i i think none of these agencies
 

7199
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:49,350
i i think none of these agencies
have the ultimate line i i think

7200
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:49,360
have the ultimate line i i think
 

7201
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:51,030
have the ultimate line i i think
eventually

7202
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:51,040
eventually
 

7203
02:09:51,040 --> 02:09:53,589
eventually
the last line will be crossed if

7204
02:09:53,589 --> 02:09:53,599
the last line will be crossed if
 

7205
02:09:53,599 --> 02:09:56,229
the last line will be crossed if
they believe it's necessary

7206
02:09:56,229 --> 02:09:56,239
they believe it's necessary
 

7207
02:09:56,239 --> 02:09:57,990
they believe it's necessary

deniability

7250
02:10:43,109 --> 02:10:43,119
deniability
 

7251
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:44,870
deniability
i don't think putin gave a direct

7252
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:44,880
i don't think putin gave a direct
 

7253
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:47,189

command as they do that he would just
 

7255
02:10:47,199 --> 02:10:49,430
command as they do that he would just
maybe muse it would be nice if something

7256
02:10:49,430 --> 02:10:49,440
maybe muse it would be nice if something
 

7257
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,870
maybe muse it would be nice if something
were to happen

7258
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:50,880
were to happen
 

7259
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:52,709
were to happen
and then somebody picks it up and does

7260
02:10:52,709 --> 02:10:52,719
and then somebody picks it up and does
 

7261
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:54,790
and then somebody picks it up and does
it

7262
02:10:54,790 --> 02:10:54,800
it
 

7263
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:57,669
it
is there can you steel man the case

7264
02:10:57,669 --> 02:10:57,679
is there can you steel man the case
 

7265

indirect obama who who who would know

7268
02:11:03,669 --> 02:11:03,679
indirect obama who who who would know
 

7269
02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:05,830
indirect obama who who who would know
who would know you know just

7270
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:05,840
who would know you know just
 

7271
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,990
who would know you know just
well the the international

7272
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:08,000
well the the international
 

7273
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,310
well the the international
the reputation

7274
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:10,320
the reputation
 

7275
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:11,589
the reputation
perhaps

7276
02:11:11,589 --> 02:11:11,599
perhaps
 

7277
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:13,510
perhaps
um

7278
02:11:13,510 --> 02:11:13,520
um
 

7279
02:11:13,520 --> 02:11:15,830
um
perhaps catalyzed by putin himself is

7280
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:15,840
perhaps catalyzed by putin himself is
 

7281
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:18,870
perhaps catalyzed by putin himself is
that he is the kind of person that would

7282
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:18,880
that he is the kind of person that would
 

7283
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:21,510
that he is the kind of person that would
directly or indirectly make those orders

7284
02:11:21,510 --> 02:11:21,520
directly or indirectly make those orders
 

7285
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:22,870
directly or indirectly make those orders
perhaps

7286
02:11:22,870 --> 02:11:22,880
perhaps
 

7287
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:24,950
perhaps
the case there is he's somebody to be

7288
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:24,960
the case there is he's somebody to be
 

7289
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:27,109
the case there is he's somebody to be
feared and thereby you yeah we are sure

7290
02:11:27,109 --> 02:11:27,119
feared and thereby you yeah we are sure
 

7291
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:31,990
feared and thereby you yeah we are sure
out there uh but the act itself

7292
02:11:31,990 --> 02:11:32,000

 

7293
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,189

the the

7294
02:11:33,189 --> 02:11:33,199
the the
 

7295
02:11:33,199 --> 02:11:35,030
the the
the poisoning of uh

7296
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:35,040
the poisoning of uh
 

7297
02:11:35,040 --> 02:11:36,950
the poisoning of uh
litvinenko and uh

7298
02:11:36,950 --> 02:11:36,960
litvinenko and uh
 

7299
02:11:36,960 --> 02:11:38,870
litvinenko and uh
oh and then the the assassination of the

7300
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:38,880
oh and then the the assassination of the
 

7301
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:41,350
oh and then the the assassination of the
bulgarian uh markov

7302
02:11:41,350 --> 02:11:41,360
bulgarian uh markov
 

7303
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:43,669
bulgarian uh markov
and with the with the umbrella

7304
02:11:43,669 --> 02:11:43,679
and with the with the umbrella
 

7305
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:45,430
and with the with the umbrella
and and they all

7306
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:45,440
and and they all
 

7307
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:47,430
and and they all
directly traced back to

7308
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:47,440
directly traced back to
 

7309
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:49,990
directly traced back to
russian uh soviet intelligence

7310
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,000
russian uh soviet intelligence
 

7311
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,790
russian uh soviet intelligence
uh and so that's enough to be feared

7312
02:11:52,790 --> 02:11:52,800
uh and so that's enough to be feared
 

7313
02:11:52,800 --> 02:11:56,149
uh and so that's enough to be feared
right um

7314
02:11:56,149 --> 02:11:56,159

 

7315
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:57,990

my answer that i gave you is an educated

7316
02:11:57,990 --> 02:11:58,000
my answer that i gave you is an educated
 

7317
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:58,790
my answer that i gave you is an educated
guess

7318
02:11:58,790 --> 02:11:58,800
guess
 

7319
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,229
guess
you know i

7320
02:12:00,229 --> 02:12:00,239
you know i
 

7321
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:02,310
you know i
i can't pretend to know this for sure

7322
02:12:02,310 --> 02:12:02,320
i can't pretend to know this for sure
 

7323
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:04,470
i can't pretend to know this for sure
but it's frustrating to me because

7324
02:12:04,470 --> 02:12:04,480
but it's frustrating to me because
 

7325
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:05,669
but it's frustrating to me because
there's a lot of people listening to

7326
02:12:05,669 --> 02:12:05,679
there's a lot of people listening to
 

7327
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:07,430
there's a lot of people listening to
this would say

7328
02:12:07,430 --> 02:12:07,440
this would say
 

7329
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:08,550
this would say
would even

7330
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:08,560
would even
 

7331
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:09,990
would even
sort of

7332
02:12:09,990 --> 02:12:10,000

02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:22,950
is
as dangerous

7828
02:21:22,950 --> 02:21:22,960
as dangerous
 

7829
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:25,590
as dangerous
as i have uh lived through

7830
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:25,600
as i have uh lived through
 

7831
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:27,750
as i have uh lived through
in my entire life i believe

7832
02:21:27,750 --> 02:21:27,760
in my entire life i believe
 

7833
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:30,550
in my entire life i believe
and beca because it's not necessarily at

7834
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:30,560
and beca because it's not necessarily at
 

7835
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:32,950
and beca because it's not necessarily at
the highest point of escalation but it

7836
02:21:32,950 --> 02:21:32,960
the highest point of escalation but it
 

7837
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:36,469
the highest point of escalation but it
will be in my view a protracted crisis

7838
02:21:36,469 --> 02:21:36,479
will be in my view a protracted crisis
 

7839
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:38,389
will be in my view a protracted crisis
and the longer that crisis lasts the

7840
02:21:38,389 --> 02:21:38,399
and the longer that crisis lasts the
 

7841
02:21:38,399 --> 02:21:40,630
and the longer that crisis lasts the
more of a chance there is

7842
02:21:40,630 --> 02:21:40,640
more of a chance there is
 

7843
02:21:40,640 --> 02:21:42,389
more of a chance there is
of an accident

7844
02:21:42,389 --> 02:21:42,399
of an accident
 

7845
02:21:42,399 --> 02:21:43,349
of an accident
yeah

7846
02:21:43,349 --> 02:21:43,359
yeah
 

7847
02:21:43,359 --> 02:21:45,190
yeah
one rocket yep

7848
02:21:45,190 --> 02:21:45,200
one rocket yep
 

7849
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:47,830
one rocket yep
there seems to be a strong incentive to

7850
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:47,840
there seems to be a strong incentive to
 

7851
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:50,230
there seems to be a strong incentive to
prolong to do siege tactics to prolong

7852
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:50,240
prolong to do siege tactics to prolong
 

7853
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:53,110
prolong to do siege tactics to prolong
this conflict over

7854
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:53,120
this conflict over
 

7855
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:55,349
this conflict over
perhaps many years which is terrifying

7856
02:21:55,349 --> 02:21:55,359
perhaps many years which is terrifying
 

7857
02:21:55,359 --> 02:21:58,389
perhaps many years which is terrifying
to think about yeah and over that one a

7858
02:21:58,389 --> 02:21:58,399
to think about yeah and over that one a
 

7859
02:21:58,399 --> 02:22:00,309
to think about yeah and over that one a
single rocket

7860
02:22:00,309 --> 02:22:00,319
single rocket
 

7861
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:02,389
single rocket
can lead to

7862
02:22:02,389 --> 02:22:02,399
can lead to
 

7863
02:22:02,399 --> 02:22:04,150
can lead to
given that there's leaders

7864
02:22:04,150 --> 02:22:04,160
given that there's leaders
 

7865
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:05,910
given that there's leaders
that might not that might be losing

7866
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:05,920
that might not that might be losing
 

7867
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:08,870
that might not that might be losing
their mind yeah

7868
02:22:08,870 --> 02:22:08,880
their mind yeah
 

7869
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:10,950
their mind yeah
and ukraine is not part of nato the

7870
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:10,960
and ukraine is not part of nato the
 

7871
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:12,790
and ukraine is not part of nato the
thing i'm really afraid of

7872
02:22:12,790 --> 02:22:12,800
thing i'm really afraid of
 

7873
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:13,990
thing i'm really afraid of
is that

7874
02:22:13,990 --> 02:22:14,000
is that
 

7875
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:18,070
is that
somebody might think it's a good idea

7876
02:22:18,070 --> 02:22:18,080
somebody might think it's a good idea
 

7877
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:20,230
somebody might think it's a good idea
but for russia so putin might think it's

7878
02:22:20,230 --> 02:22:20,240
but for russia so putin might think it's
 

7879
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:23,270
but for russia so putin might think it's
a good idea for russia to send a message

7880
02:22:23,270 --> 02:22:23,280
a good idea for russia to send a message
 

7881
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:26,630
a good idea for russia to send a message
by launching a nuke against ukraine

7882
02:22:26,630 --> 02:22:26,640
by launching a nuke against ukraine
 

7883
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:28,710
by launching a nuke against ukraine
because they're not part of nato

7884
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:28,720
because they're not part of nato
 

7885
02:22:28,720 --> 02:22:30,389
because they're not part of nato

if russia nukes ukraine to send a
 

7893
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:39,270
if russia nukes ukraine to send a
message

7894
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:39,280
message
 

7895
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:41,110
message
i don't know if anyone knows the answer

7896
02:22:41,110 --> 02:22:41,120
i don't know if anyone knows the answer

uh that needs to be followed to
to

7906
02:22:51,190 --> 02:22:51,200
to
 

7907
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:53,910
to
launch a nuclear strike from from from

launch a nuclear strike from from from
 

7909
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:56,150

now we have different very kind of
 

7933
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:17,349
now we have different very kind of
anecdotal perspectives on these things

7934
02:23:17,349 --> 02:23:17,359
anecdotal perspectives on these things
 

7935
02:23:17,359 --> 02:23:19,110
anecdotal perspectives on these things
but the people i've interacted with in

the dod department of defense
 

7939
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:22,950
the dod department of defense
in the military

7940
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:22,960
in the military
 

7941
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:25,270
in the military
there is a compartmentalization

7942
02:23:25,270 --> 02:23:25,280
there is a compartmentalization
 

7943
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:27,750
there is a compartmentalization
there is a bureaucracy and within that

7944
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:27,760
there is a bureaucracy and within that
 

7945
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:29,590
there is a bureaucracy and within that
giant bureaucracy there's incompetence

7946
02:23:29,590 --> 02:23:29,600
giant bureaucracy there's incompetence
 

7947
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:31,190
giant bureaucracy there's incompetence
we'd like to think

7948
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:31,200
we'd like to think
 

7949
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:33,030
we'd like to think
that there is like

7950
02:23:33,030 --> 02:23:33,040
that there is like
 

7951
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:36,230
that there is like
really well organized for really

really well organized for really
 

7953
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:38,630
really well organized for really
important things there's going to be the

7954
02:23:38,630 --> 02:23:38,640
important things there's going to be the
 

7955
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,630
important things there's going to be the
best of the best in the world that's

best of the best in the world that's
 

7957
02:23:40,640 --> 02:23:42,630
best of the best in the world that's
going to execute and the correct

7958
02:23:42,630 --> 02:23:42,640
going to execute and the correct
 

7959
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:45,750
going to execute and the correct
decisions both geopolitically militarily

7960
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:45,760
decisions both geopolitically militarily
 

7961
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:47,349
decisions both geopolitically militarily
all that kind of stuff and i've seen

7962
02:23:47,349 --> 02:23:47,359
all that kind of stuff and i've seen
 

7963
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:49,429
all that kind of stuff and i've seen
enough to know

7964
02:23:49,429 --> 02:23:49,439
enough to know
 

7965
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:51,590
enough to know
that competence at any level of

7966
02:23:51,590 --> 02:23:51,600
that competence at any level of
 

7967
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:53,590
that competence at any level of
government at any level in the military

7968
02:23:53,590 --> 02:23:53,600
government at any level in the military
 

7969
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:55,349
government at any level in the military
is not guaranteed let's go back to the

7970
02:23:55,349 --> 02:23:55,359
is not guaranteed let's go back to the
 

7971
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:57,190
is not guaranteed let's go back to the
law of hierarchy

7972
02:23:57,190 --> 02:23:57,200
law of hierarchy
 

7973
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:59,590
law of hierarchy
the the government is is the biggest

7974
02:23:59,590 --> 02:23:59,600
the the government is is the biggest
 

7975
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:01,270
the the government is is the biggest
hierarchy there is

7976
02:24:01,270 --> 02:24:01,280
hierarchy there is
 

7977
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:02,710
hierarchy there is
and so

7978
02:24:02,710 --> 02:24:02,720
and so
 

7979
02:24:02,720 --> 02:24:05,590
and so
invariably politicians find their way to

7980
02:24:05,590 --> 02:24:05,600
invariably politicians find their way to
 

7981
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:09,590
invariably politicians find their way to
the top and once you have politics in uh

7982
02:24:09,590 --> 02:24:09,600
the top and once you have politics in uh
 

7983
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:11,750
the top and once you have politics in uh
dictating

7984
02:24:11,750 --> 02:24:11,760
dictating
 

7985
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:14,950
dictating
substantive decisions they're they're

7986
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:14,960
substantive decisions they're they're
 

7987
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:16,550
substantive decisions they're they're
going to be weak or wrong

7988
02:24:16,550 --> 02:24:16,560
going to be weak or wrong
 

7989
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:17,270
going to be weak or wrong
it's

7990
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:17,280

8591
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:56,389
with with this this this this kind of a
very detailed

he has this whole idea

8602
02:35:08,790 --> 02:35:08,800
he has this whole idea
 

8603
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:11,349
he has this whole idea
that there's uh 15 to 20 years i need it

8604
02:35:11,349 --> 02:35:11,359
that there's uh 15 to 20 years i need it

for demoralization
 

8607
02:35:14,319 --> 02:35:18,150
for demoralization
where you're

8608
02:35:18,150 --> 02:35:18,160

 

8609
02:35:18,160 --> 02:35:20,070

you're basically infiltrating a country

8610
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:20,080
you're basically infiltrating a country
 

8611
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:22,230
you're basically infiltrating a country
from a young or people from a young age

8612
02:35:22,230 --> 02:35:22,240
from a young or people from a young age
 

8613
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:23,590
from a young or people from a young age
manipulating their mind you're

8614
02:35:23,590 --> 02:35:23,600
manipulating their mind you're
 

8615
02:35:23,600 --> 02:35:25,349
manipulating their mind you're
destabilizing them that's the second

8616
02:35:25,349 --> 02:35:25,359
destabilizing them that's the second
 

8617
02:35:25,359 --> 02:35:27,590
destabilizing them that's the second
step that takes two to five years

8618
02:35:27,590 --> 02:35:27,600
step that takes two to five years
 

8619
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,510
step that takes two to five years
you uh target the country's foreign

8620
02:35:29,510 --> 02:35:29,520
you uh target the country's foreign
 

8621
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:31,670
you uh target the country's foreign
relations defense and economy you create

8622
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:31,680
relations defense and economy you create
 

8623
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:33,830
relations defense and economy you create
a crisis artificially and then you

8624
02:35:33,830 --> 02:35:33,840
a crisis artificially and then you
 

8625
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:36,469
a crisis artificially and then you
normalize it as as if it uh always was

8626
02:35:36,469 --> 02:35:36,479
normalize it as as if it uh always was
 

8627
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:39,270
normalize it as as if it uh always was
this way so it's basically saying

8628
02:35:39,270 --> 02:35:39,280
this way so it's basically saying
 

8629
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:43,670
this way so it's basically saying
that the kgb is capable of at scale

8630
02:35:43,670 --> 02:35:43,680
that the kgb is capable of at scale
 

8631
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:47,349
that the kgb is capable of at scale
uh over many years

8632
02:35:47,349 --> 02:35:47,359
uh over many years
 

8633
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:50,309
uh over many years
manipulate an entire population of

people
right and this is kind of um

8638
02:35:54,870 --> 02:35:54,880
right and this is kind of um
 

8639
02:35:54,880 --> 02:35:56,070
right and this is kind of um
there's a lot of

theories that
 

8645
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:02,790
theories that
are amenable to this kind of idea now my

8646
02:36:02,790 --> 02:36:02,800
are amenable to this kind of idea now my
 

8647
02:36:02,800 --> 02:36:04,550
are amenable to this kind of idea now my
own experience

8648
02:36:04,550 --> 02:36:04,560
own experience
 

8649
02:36:04,560 --> 02:36:06,950
own experience
is that there is in fact just a giant

8650
02:36:06,950 --> 02:36:06,960
is that there is in fact just a giant
 

8651
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:08,630
is that there is in fact just a giant
amount of incompetence

8652
02:36:08,630 --> 02:36:08,640
amount of incompetence
 

8653
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:10,230
amount of incompetence
and this is something that's actually

8654
02:36:10,230 --> 02:36:10,240
and this is something that's actually
 

8655
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:12,550
and this is something that's actually
very difficult to pull off because yes

8656
02:36:12,550 --> 02:36:12,560
very difficult to pull off because yes
 

8657
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:16,309
very difficult to pull off because yes
it's incredibly

8658
02:36:16,309 --> 02:36:16,319

 

8659
02:36:16,319 --> 02:36:18,550

um

8660
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:18,560
um
 

8661
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,990
um
incredibly difficult to achieve this

8662
02:36:19,990 --> 02:36:20,000
incredibly difficult to achieve this
 

8663
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,550
incredibly difficult to achieve this
kind of manipulation i think it would it

8664
02:36:22,550 --> 02:36:22,560
kind of manipulation i think it would it
 

8665
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:25,910
kind of manipulation i think it would it
would require

8666
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:25,920

 

8667
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:28,230

first of all not much bureaucracy not

8668
02:36:28,230 --> 02:36:28,240
first of all not much bureaucracy not
 

8669
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:29,990
first of all not much bureaucracy not
much slowing down you have to have

8670
02:36:29,990 --> 02:36:30,000
much slowing down you have to have
 

8671
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,190
much slowing down you have to have
incredible

8672
02:36:31,190 --> 02:36:31,200
incredible
 

8673
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:32,950
incredible
in the modern world digital systems are

8674
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:32,960
in the modern world digital systems are
 

8675
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:34,830
in the modern world digital systems are
able to do surveillance

8676
02:36:34,830 --> 02:36:34,840
able to do surveillance
 

8677
02:36:34,840 --> 02:36:38,070
able to do surveillance
manipulation there has to be a strategy

8678
02:36:38,070 --> 02:36:38,080
manipulation there has to be a strategy
 

8679
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:40,870
manipulation there has to be a strategy
that is carried out in secrecy across a

8680
02:36:40,870 --> 02:36:40,880
that is carried out in secrecy across a
 

8681
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:43,590
that is carried out in secrecy across a
huge number of people effectively

8682
02:36:43,590 --> 02:36:43,600
huge number of people effectively
 

8683
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,830
huge number of people effectively
that also requires you to hire the best

8684
02:36:45,830 --> 02:36:45,840
that also requires you to hire the best
 

8685
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,830
that also requires you to hire the best
people in the world

people in the world
 

8687
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:50,630
people in the world
and i think it's difficult to execute on

8688
02:36:50,630 --> 02:36:50,640
and i think it's difficult to execute on
 

8689
02:36:50,640 --> 02:36:52,389
and i think it's difficult to execute on
this kind of thing

8690
02:36:52,389 --> 02:36:52,399
this kind of thing

there has to be i mean there is it's
 

8707
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:11,830
there has to be i mean there is it's
very difficult to do now

8708
02:37:11,830 --> 02:37:11,840
very difficult to do now
 

8709
02:37:11,840 --> 02:37:14,150
very difficult to do now
nevertheless especially with technology

02:37:14,150 --> 02:37:14,160
nevertheless especially with technology
 

8711
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:15,910
nevertheless especially with technology
this becomes easier and easier so the

8712
02:37:15,910 --> 02:37:15,920
this becomes easier and easier so the
 

8713
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:16,630
this becomes easier and easier so the
bar

02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:21,030
comes lower and lower to achieve
mass surveillance becomes easier and

8718
02:37:21,030 --> 02:37:21,040
mass surveillance becomes easier and
 

8719
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:23,750
mass surveillance becomes easier and
easier and easier uh mass manipulation

8720
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:23,760
easier and easier uh mass manipulation
 

8721
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:25,990
easier and easier uh mass manipulation
through platforms because we're now

8722
02:37:25,990 --> 02:37:26,000
through platforms because we're now
 

8723
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,150
through platforms because we're now
digitally connected you can now do that

8724
02:37:28,150 --> 02:37:28,160
digitally connected you can now do that
 

8725
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:29,750
digitally connected you can now do that
kind of manipulation so it becomes more

8726
02:37:29,750 --> 02:37:29,760
kind of manipulation so it becomes more
 

8727
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:31,190
kind of manipulation so it becomes more
and more realistic that you could do

8728
02:37:31,190 --> 02:37:31,200
and more realistic that you could do
 

8729
02:37:31,200 --> 02:37:32,950
and more realistic that you could do
this kind of thing but

8730
02:37:32,950 --> 02:37:32,960
this kind of thing but
 

8731
02:37:32,960 --> 02:37:36,230
this kind of thing but
you're saying that no intelligence first

8732
02:37:36,230 --> 02:37:36,240
you're saying that no intelligence first
 

8733
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:39,190
you're saying that no intelligence first
of all intelligence is hard

8734

in a way that it's also
 

8741
02:37:47,040 --> 02:37:48,630
in a way that it's also
not just collecting information about

8742
02:37:48,630 --> 02:37:48,640
not just collecting information about
 

8743
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:50,230
not just collecting information about
the populace but manipulating the

8744
02:37:50,230 --> 02:37:50,240
the populace but manipulating the
 

8745
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:52,469
the populace but manipulating the
populace is very very difficult right

8746
02:37:52,469 --> 02:37:52,479
populace is very very difficult right
 

8747
02:37:52,479 --> 02:37:54,550
populace is very very difficult right
now let me now give you an another

8748

now let me now give you an another
 

8749
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:56,469
now let me now give you an another
argument why i think that besmanov was a

people to be secretive
 

9021

but
what i

9024
02:42:45,910 --> 02:42:45,920

9025
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:48,710

03:04:37,429 --> 03:04:37,439
now you have to have to take it
 

10223
03:04:37,439 --> 03:04:39,190
now you have to have to take it
seriously to some degree because i know

10224
03:04:39,190 --> 03:04:39,200

10231
03:04:45,120 --> 03:04:47,750
assassinating or at least trying to
assassinate the factor so

assassinate the factor so
 

10233
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:50,389
assassinate the factor so
uh that that obviously raised the the

10234
03:04:50,389 --> 03:04:50,399
uh that that obviously raised the the
 

10235
03:04:50,399 --> 03:04:53,349
uh that that obviously raised the the
stakes a little bit uh but i i i just

10236
03:04:53,349 --> 03:04:53,359
stakes a little bit uh but i i i just
 

10237

talked myself into believing this was
 

10239
03:04:55,040 --> 03:04:56,550
talked myself into believing this was
just uh

10240
03:04:56,550 --> 03:04:56,560
just uh
 

10241
03:04:56,560 --> 03:04:58,309
just uh
a bad phrasing
