73
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,710
don't think we're quite up to that yet
but uh maybe you're from the future lex

74
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
but uh maybe you're from the future lex
 

75
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,870
but uh maybe you're from the future lex
if you did would you tell me is that is

76
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
if you did would you tell me is that is
 

77
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,550
if you did would you tell me is that is
that a good thing to tell a language

78
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
that a good thing to tell a language

that it is in fact um ai maybe we're in

82
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
that it is in fact um ai maybe we're in
 

83
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,230
that it is in fact um ai maybe we're in
a kind of meta turing test uh probably

84
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
a kind of meta turing test uh probably
 

85
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,830
a kind of meta turing test uh probably
probably it would be a good idea not to

86
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
probably it would be a good idea not to
 

87
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,190
probably it would be a good idea not to
tell you so it doesn't change your

88
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,200
tell you so it doesn't change your
 

89
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,710
tell you so it doesn't change your
behavior right this is a kind of

90
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
behavior right this is a kind of
 

91
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,390
behavior right this is a kind of
heisenberg uncertainty principle

92
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
heisenberg uncertainty principle
 

93
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,069
heisenberg uncertainty principle
situation if i told you you behave

94
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
situation if i told you you behave
 

95
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,510
situation if i told you you behave
differently yeah maybe that's what's

96
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
differently yeah maybe that's what's
 

97
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,270
differently yeah maybe that's what's
happening with us of course this is a

98
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
happening with us of course this is a
 

99
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,510
happening with us of course this is a
benchmark from the future where they

100
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
benchmark from the future where they
 

101
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,830
benchmark from the future where they
replay 2022 as a year before ais were

102
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
replay 2022 as a year before ais were
 

103
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,870
replay 2022 as a year before ais were
good enough yet and now we want to see

104
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
good enough yet and now we want to see
 

105
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,749
good enough yet and now we want to see
is it going to pass exactly

106
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
is it going to pass exactly
 

107
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,429
is it going to pass exactly
if i was such a

108
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
if i was such a
 

109
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,109
if i was such a
program would you be able to tell do you

110
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
program would you be able to tell do you
 

111
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,910
program would you be able to tell do you
think so to the touring test question

112
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
think so to the touring test question
 

113
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,190
think so to the touring test question
you've talked about

114
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:03,200

 

115
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,670

the benchmark for solving intelligence

116
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
the benchmark for solving intelligence
 

117
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,109
the benchmark for solving intelligence
what would be the impressive thing

118
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
what would be the impressive thing
 

119
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,630
what would be the impressive thing
you've talked about winning a nobel

120
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
you've talked about winning a nobel
 

121
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,270
you've talked about winning a nobel
prize in a system winning a nobel prize

122
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
prize in a system winning a nobel prize
 

123
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,350
prize in a system winning a nobel prize
but i still return to the touring test

124
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
but i still return to the touring test
 

125
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,030
but i still return to the touring test
as a compelling test the spirit of the

126
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
as a compelling test the spirit of the
 

127
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,110
as a compelling test the spirit of the
touring test is a compelling test

128
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
touring test is a compelling test
 

129
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,790
touring test is a compelling test
yeah the turing test of course it's been

130
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
yeah the turing test of course it's been
 

131
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,630
yeah the turing test of course it's been
unbelievably influential and turing's

132
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:20,640
unbelievably influential and turing's
 

133
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,030
unbelievably influential and turing's
one of my all-time heroes but i think if

134
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
one of my all-time heroes but i think if
 

135
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,869
one of my all-time heroes but i think if
you look back at the 1950 papers

136
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
you look back at the 1950 papers
 

137
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,869
you look back at the 1950 papers
original paper and read the original

138
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
original paper and read the original
 

139
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,869
original paper and read the original
you'll see i don't think he meant it to

140
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
you'll see i don't think he meant it to
 

141
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,190
you'll see i don't think he meant it to
be a rigorous formal test i think it was

142
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,200
be a rigorous formal test i think it was
 

143
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,030
be a rigorous formal test i think it was
more like a thought experiment almost a

144
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
more like a thought experiment almost a
 

145
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,710
more like a thought experiment almost a
bit of philosophy he was writing if you

146
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
bit of philosophy he was writing if you
 

147
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,550
bit of philosophy he was writing if you
look at the style of the paper and you

148
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
look at the style of the paper and you
 

149
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,990
look at the style of the paper and you
can see he didn't specify it very

150
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
can see he didn't specify it very
 

151
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,070
can see he didn't specify it very
rigorously so for example he didn't

152
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
rigorously so for example he didn't
 

153
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,869
rigorously so for example he didn't
specify the knowledge that the expert or

154
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
specify the knowledge that the expert or
 

155
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,509
specify the knowledge that the expert or
judge would have um not you know how

156
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
judge would have um not you know how
 

157
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,670
judge would have um not you know how
much time would they have to investigate

158
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
much time would they have to investigate
 

159
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,509
much time would they have to investigate
this so these important parameters if

160
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
this so these important parameters if
 

161
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,150
this so these important parameters if
you were gonna make it uh a true sort of

162
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
you were gonna make it uh a true sort of
 

163
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,430
you were gonna make it uh a true sort of
formal test

164
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
formal test
 

165
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,470
formal test
um and you know some by some measures

166
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
um and you know some by some measures
 

167
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,309
um and you know some by some measures
people claimed the turing test passed

168
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
people claimed the turing test passed
 

169
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,830
people claimed the turing test passed
several you know a decade ago i remember

170
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
several you know a decade ago i remember
 

171
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,509
several you know a decade ago i remember
someone claiming that with a with a kind

172
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
someone claiming that with a with a kind
 

173
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,390
someone claiming that with a with a kind
of very bog standard normal uh

174
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
of very bog standard normal uh
 

175
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,949
of very bog standard normal uh
logic model um because they pretended it

176
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
logic model um because they pretended it
 

177
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,589
logic model um because they pretended it
was a it was a kid so the the judges

178
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
was a it was a kid so the the judges
 

179
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,670
was a it was a kid so the the judges
thought that the machine you know was

180
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
thought that the machine you know was
 

181
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,710
thought that the machine you know was
was a was a child so um that would be

182
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
was a was a child so um that would be
 

183
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,190
was a was a child so um that would be
very different from an expert ai person

184
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
very different from an expert ai person
 

185
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,030
very different from an expert ai person
uh interrogating a machine and knowing

186
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
uh interrogating a machine and knowing
 

187
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,309
uh interrogating a machine and knowing
how it was built and so on so i think um

188
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
how it was built and so on so i think um
 

189
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,670
how it was built and so on so i think um
you know we should probably move away

190
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
you know we should probably move away
 

191
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,390
you know we should probably move away
from that as a formal test and move more

192
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
from that as a formal test and move more
 

193
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,509
from that as a formal test and move more
towards a general test where we test the

194
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
towards a general test where we test the
 

195
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,149
towards a general test where we test the
ai capabilities on a range of tasks and

196
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:32,159
ai capabilities on a range of tasks and
 

197
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,630
ai capabilities on a range of tasks and
see if it reaches human level or above

198
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
see if it reaches human level or above
 

199
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,270
see if it reaches human level or above
performance on maybe thousands perhaps

200
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
performance on maybe thousands perhaps
 

201
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,270
performance on maybe thousands perhaps
even millions of tasks eventually and

202
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
even millions of tasks eventually and
 

203
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,830
even millions of tasks eventually and
cover the entire sort of cognitive space

204
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
cover the entire sort of cognitive space
 

205
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,350
cover the entire sort of cognitive space
so i think

206
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
so i think
 

207
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,949
so i think
for its time it was an amazing thought

208
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
for its time it was an amazing thought
 

209
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,270
for its time it was an amazing thought
experiment and also 1950s obviously it

210
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
experiment and also 1950s obviously it
 

211
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,270
experiment and also 1950s obviously it
was barely the dawn of the computer age

212
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
was barely the dawn of the computer age
 

213
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,350
was barely the dawn of the computer age
so of course he only thought about text

214
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
so of course he only thought about text
 

215
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,509
so of course he only thought about text
and now um we have a lot more different

216
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:53,519
and now um we have a lot more different
 

217
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,470
and now um we have a lot more different
inputs

218
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
inputs
 

219
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,949
inputs
so yeah maybe the better thing to test

220
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
so yeah maybe the better thing to test
 

221
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,789
so yeah maybe the better thing to test
is the generalizability so across

222
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
is the generalizability so across
 

223
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,949
is the generalizability so across
multiple tasks but i think it's also

224
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
multiple tasks but i think it's also
 

225
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,550
multiple tasks but i think it's also
possible as as systems like god show

226
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
possible as as systems like god show
 

227
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,509
possible as as systems like god show
that

228
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
that
 

229
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,429
that
eventually that might map right back to

230
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
eventually that might map right back to
 

231
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,190
eventually that might map right back to
language so you might be able to

232
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
language so you might be able to
 

233
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,509
language so you might be able to
demonstrate your ability to generalize

234
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
demonstrate your ability to generalize
 

235
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,110
demonstrate your ability to generalize
across tasks

236
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120
across tasks
 

237
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,350
across tasks
by then communicating your ability to

238
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
by then communicating your ability to
 

239
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,509
by then communicating your ability to
generalize across tasks which is kind of

240
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
generalize across tasks which is kind of
 

241
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,030
generalize across tasks which is kind of
what we do through conversation anyway

242
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
what we do through conversation anyway
 

243
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,710
what we do through conversation anyway
when we jump around

244
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
when we jump around
 

245
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,550
when we jump around
ultimately what's in there in that

246
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
ultimately what's in there in that
 

247
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,950
ultimately what's in there in that
conversation is not just you moving

248
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
conversation is not just you moving
 

249
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,870
conversation is not just you moving
around knowledge

250
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
around knowledge
 

251
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,110
around knowledge
it's you moving around like these

252
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
it's you moving around like these
 

253
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,749
it's you moving around like these
entirely different modalities of

254
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
entirely different modalities of
 

255
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,950
entirely different modalities of
understanding that ultimately map to

256
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
understanding that ultimately map to
 

257
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,870
understanding that ultimately map to
your ability to

258
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
your ability to
 

259
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,430
your ability to
to uh operate successfully in all these

260
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
to uh operate successfully in all these
 

261
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,469
to uh operate successfully in all these
domains which you can think of as tasks

262
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
domains which you can think of as tasks
 

263
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,950
domains which you can think of as tasks
yeah i think certainly we as humans use

264
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
yeah i think certainly we as humans use
 

265
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,430
yeah i think certainly we as humans use
language as our main generalization

266
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
language as our main generalization
 

267
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,990
language as our main generalization
communication tool so i think we end up

268
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
communication tool so i think we end up
 

269
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,310
communication tool so i think we end up
thinking in language and expressing our

270
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
thinking in language and expressing our
 

271
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,950
thinking in language and expressing our
solutions in language um so it's going

272
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
solutions in language um so it's going
 

273
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,390
solutions in language um so it's going
to be very powerful

274
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
to be very powerful
 

275
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,070
to be very powerful
uh uh mode in which to uh explain you

276
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
uh uh mode in which to uh explain you
 

277
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,590
uh uh mode in which to uh explain you
know the system to explain what it's

278
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
know the system to explain what it's
 

279
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,870
know the system to explain what it's
doing um but i don't think it's the only

280
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
doing um but i don't think it's the only
 

281
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,150
doing um but i don't think it's the only
uh uh modality that matters so i think

282
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
uh uh modality that matters so i think
 

283
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,590
uh uh modality that matters so i think
there's gonna be a lot of you know

284
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
there's gonna be a lot of you know
 

285
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,870
there's gonna be a lot of you know
there's there's a lot of different ways

286
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:10,880
there's there's a lot of different ways
 

287
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,830
there's there's a lot of different ways
to express uh capabilities uh other than

288
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
to express uh capabilities uh other than
 

289
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,430
to express uh capabilities uh other than
just language

290
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
just language
 

291
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,710
just language
yeah visual

292
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
yeah visual
 

293
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,909
yeah visual
robotics body language

294
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
robotics body language
 

295
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,029
robotics body language
um

296
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
um
 

297
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,950
um
yeah action is the interactive aspect of

298
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
yeah action is the interactive aspect of
 

299
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,790
yeah action is the interactive aspect of
all that that's all part of it but

300
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
all that that's all part of it but
 

301
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,230
all that that's all part of it but
what's interesting with gato is that

302
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:26,240
what's interesting with gato is that
 

303
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,870
what's interesting with gato is that
it's a it's it's it's sort of pushing

304
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
it's a it's it's it's sort of pushing
 

305
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,710
it's a it's it's it's sort of pushing
prediction to the maximum in terms of

306
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
prediction to the maximum in terms of
 

307
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,710
prediction to the maximum in terms of
like you know mapping arbitrary

308
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:32,720
like you know mapping arbitrary
 

309
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,790
like you know mapping arbitrary
sequences to other sequences and sort of

310
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
sequences to other sequences and sort of
 

311
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,070
sequences to other sequences and sort of
just predicting what's going to happen

312
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
just predicting what's going to happen
 

313
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,629
just predicting what's going to happen
next so prediction seems to be

314
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
next so prediction seems to be
 

315
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,950
next so prediction seems to be
fundamental to intelligence

316
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
fundamental to intelligence
 

317
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,790
fundamental to intelligence
and what you're predicting

318
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
and what you're predicting
 

319
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,950
and what you're predicting
doesn't so much matter yeah it seems

320
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
doesn't so much matter yeah it seems
 

321
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,629
doesn't so much matter yeah it seems
like you can generalize that quite well

322
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
like you can generalize that quite well
 

323
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,230
like you can generalize that quite well
so obviously language models predict the

324
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
so obviously language models predict the
 

325
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,870
so obviously language models predict the

00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,990
general agent one could call it so far
but um you know that itself can be

sufficiently rigorous to where you can
run that test and i still think

366
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
run that test and i still think
 

367
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,029
run that test and i still think
something like the touring test will at

something like the touring test will at

humor all those kinds of things but that

humor all those kinds of things but that
 

395
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,909
humor all those kinds of things but that
ultimately can boil down to language it

place where it truly shines i think so

406
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
place where it truly shines i think so
 

407
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,870
place where it truly shines i think so
because it's such an important kind of

408
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
because it's such an important kind of
 

409
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,029
because it's such an important kind of
input output for us i think you're right

410
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
input output for us i think you're right
 

411
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,870
input output for us i think you're right
i think the turing test that what the

412
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
i think the turing test that what the
 

413
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,270
i think the turing test that what the
the kind of the the philosophy behind it

414
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
the kind of the the philosophy behind it
 

415
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,230
the kind of the the philosophy behind it
which is the idea of can can a machine

416
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
which is the idea of can can a machine
 

417
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,870
which is the idea of can can a machine
mimic the behaviors of a human and men

mimic the behaviors of a human and men
 

419
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,029
mimic the behaviors of a human and men
and i would say wider than just language

420
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
and i would say wider than just language
 

421
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,629
and i would say wider than just language
and text

422
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
and text
 

423
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,550
and text
then you know in terms of actions and

424
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
then you know in terms of actions and
 

425
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,230
then you know in terms of actions and
everything else creativity all these

426
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
everything else creativity all these
 

427
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,629
everything else creativity all these
things then um if it can sort of match

428
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
things then um if it can sort of match
 

429
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,270

then i think we have a you know true

432
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
then i think we have a you know true
 

433
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,710
then i think we have a you know true
intelligence so i thought from that

434
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:50,720
intelligence so i thought from that
 

435
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,469
intelligence so i thought from that
perspective you're right i think he did

436
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
perspective you're right i think he did
 

437
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,830
perspective you're right i think he did
formulate the right uh kind of uh setup

438
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
formulate the right uh kind of uh setup
 

439
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,830
formulate the right uh kind of uh setup
i just i think there'll be a kind of

440
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
i just i think there'll be a kind of
 

441
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,189
i just i think there'll be a kind of
humor

442
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
humor

back to this conversation
 

447
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,990
back to this conversation
and thinking about the touring test

448
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
and thinking about the touring test
 

449
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,550
and thinking about the touring test
and uh also thinking about

450
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,560
and uh also thinking about
 

451
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,309
and uh also thinking about
by that time they would know which year

452
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
by that time they would know which year
 

453
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,189
by that time they would know which year
they were finally able to sort of cross

454

they were finally able to sort of cross
 

455
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,550
they were finally able to sort of cross

the threshold of human level
 

457
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,110
the threshold of human level
intelligence and think

458
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
intelligence and think
 

459
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,869
intelligence and think
how funny it is that we humans were

460
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
how funny it is that we humans were
 

461
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,830
how funny it is that we humans were
still

462
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
still
 

463
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,309
still
confused about this whole problem

464
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
confused about this whole problem
 

465
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,550
confused about this whole problem
that has been long ago been solved

466
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
that has been long ago been solved
 

467
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,309
that has been long ago been solved
well hello to the ai agents of the

future anyway so going back to your
 

471
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,270
future anyway so going back to your
to your journey when did you fall in

472
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
to your journey when did you fall in
 

473
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,589
to your journey when did you fall in
love with programming first

474
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
love with programming first
 

475
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,430
love with programming first
well it's pretty uh pretty young age

476
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
well it's pretty uh pretty young age
 

477
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,350
well it's pretty uh pretty young age
actually so um

478
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
actually so um
 

479
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,829
actually so um
you know i started off uh actually games

480
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:39,839
you know i started off uh actually games
 

481
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,829
you know i started off uh actually games
was my first love so starting to play

482
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
was my first love so starting to play
 

483
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,589
was my first love so starting to play
chess when i was around four years old

484
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
chess when i was around four years old
 

485
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,590
chess when i was around four years old
and then um it was actually with

486
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
and then um it was actually with
 

487
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,910
and then um it was actually with
winnings from a chess competition that i

488
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
winnings from a chess competition that i
 

489
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,590
winnings from a chess competition that i
managed to buy my first chess computer

490
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
managed to buy my first chess computer
 

491
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,790
managed to buy my first chess computer
when i was about eight years old it was

492
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
when i was about eight years old it was
 

493
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,030
when i was about eight years old it was
a zx spectrum which was hugely popular

494
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
a zx spectrum which was hugely popular
 

495
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,630
a zx spectrum which was hugely popular
in the uk at the time

496
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
in the uk at the time
 

497
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,350
in the uk at the time
and uh it's amazing machine because i

498
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
and uh it's amazing machine because i
 

499
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,269
and uh it's amazing machine because i
think it trained a whole generation of

500
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
think it trained a whole generation of
 

501
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,430
think it trained a whole generation of
programmers in the uk because it was so

502
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
programmers in the uk because it was so
 

503
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,030
programmers in the uk because it was so
accessible you know you literally

504
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
accessible you know you literally
 

505
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,550
accessible you know you literally
switched it on and there was the basic

506
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
switched it on and there was the basic
 

507
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,030
switched it on and there was the basic
prompt and you could just get going and

508
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
prompt and you could just get going and
 

509
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,790
prompt and you could just get going and
um my parents didn't really know

510
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
um my parents didn't really know
 

511
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,630
um my parents didn't really know
anything about computers so but because

512
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
anything about computers so but because
 

513
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,470
anything about computers so but because
it was my money from a chess competition

514
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
it was my money from a chess competition
 

515
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,110
it was my money from a chess competition
i could i could say i i wanted to buy it

516
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
i could i could say i i wanted to buy it
 

517
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,949
i could i could say i i wanted to buy it
uh and then you know i just went to

518
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
uh and then you know i just went to
 

519
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,150
uh and then you know i just went to
bookstores got books on programming and

520
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
bookstores got books on programming and
 

521
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,550
bookstores got books on programming and
um started typing in you know the

522
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
um started typing in you know the
 

523
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,870
um started typing in you know the
programming code and and then of course

524
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
programming code and and then of course
 

525
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,630
programming code and and then of course
um once you start doing that you start

526
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
um once you start doing that you start
 

527
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,150
um once you start doing that you start
adjusting it and then making your own

528
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
adjusting it and then making your own
 

529
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,070
adjusting it and then making your own
games and that's when i fell in love

530
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
games and that's when i fell in love
 

531
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,509
games and that's when i fell in love
with computers and realized that they

532
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
with computers and realized that they
 

533
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,190
with computers and realized that they
were a very magical device um in a way i

534
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
were a very magical device um in a way i
 

535
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,389
were a very magical device um in a way i
kind of i would have been able to

536
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
kind of i would have been able to
 

537
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,910
kind of i would have been able to
explain this at the time but i felt that

538
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
explain this at the time but i felt that
 

539
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,430
explain this at the time but i felt that
they were sort of almost a magical

540
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
they were sort of almost a magical
 

541
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,670
they were sort of almost a magical
extension of your mind i always had this

542
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
extension of your mind i always had this
 

543
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,190
extension of your mind i always had this
feeling and i've always loved this about

544
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
feeling and i've always loved this about
 

545
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,030
feeling and i've always loved this about
computers that you can set them off

546
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
computers that you can set them off
 

547
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,430
computers that you can set them off
doing something some task for you you

548
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
doing something some task for you you
 

549
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,350
doing something some task for you you
can go to sleep come back the next day

550
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
can go to sleep come back the next day
 

551
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,389
can go to sleep come back the next day
and it's solved

552
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
and it's solved
 

553
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,190
and it's solved
um you know that feels magical to me so

554
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
um you know that feels magical to me so
 

555
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,790
um you know that feels magical to me so
i mean all machines do that to some

556
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
i mean all machines do that to some
 

557
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,870
i mean all machines do that to some
extent they all enhance our natural

558
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
extent they all enhance our natural
 

559
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,630
extent they all enhance our natural
capabilities obviously cars make us

560
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
capabilities obviously cars make us
 

561
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,030
capabilities obviously cars make us
allow us to move faster than we can run

562
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
allow us to move faster than we can run
 

563
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,509
allow us to move faster than we can run
but this was a machine to extend the

564
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
but this was a machine to extend the
 

565
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,389
but this was a machine to extend the
mind

566
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
mind
 

567
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,110
mind
and and then of course ai is the

568
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
and and then of course ai is the
 

569
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,269
and and then of course ai is the
ultimate expression of what a machine

570
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
ultimate expression of what a machine
 

571
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,069
ultimate expression of what a machine
may be able to do or learn so

572
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
may be able to do or learn so
 

573
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,910
may be able to do or learn so
very naturally for me that thought

574
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
very naturally for me that thought
 

575
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,910
very naturally for me that thought
extended into into ai quite quickly

576
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
extended into into ai quite quickly
 

577
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,389
extended into into ai quite quickly
remember the the programming language

578
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
remember the the programming language
 

579
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,750
remember the the programming language
that was first

580
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
that was first
 

581
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,030
that was first
started

582
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
started
 

583
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,470
started
special to the machine no it was just

584
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,480
special to the machine no it was just
 

585
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,990
special to the machine no it was just
the base it was just i think it was just

586
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
the base it was just i think it was just
 

587
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,069
the base it was just i think it was just
basic uh on the zx spectrum i don't know

588
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
basic uh on the zx spectrum i don't know
 

589
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,910
basic uh on the zx spectrum i don't know
what specific form it was and then later

590
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
what specific form it was and then later
 

591
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,110
what specific form it was and then later
on i got a commodore amiga which uh

592
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
on i got a commodore amiga which uh
 

593
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,110
on i got a commodore amiga which uh
was a fantastic machine no you're just

594
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
was a fantastic machine no you're just
 

595
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,030
was a fantastic machine no you're just
showing off so yeah well lots of my

596
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
showing off so yeah well lots of my
 

597
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,110
showing off so yeah well lots of my
friends had atari st's and i i managed

598
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
friends had atari st's and i i managed
 

599
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,790
friends had atari st's and i i managed
to get amigas it was a bit more powerful

600
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:38,800
to get amigas it was a bit more powerful
 

601
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,949
to get amigas it was a bit more powerful
and uh and that was incredible and used

602
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
and uh and that was incredible and used
 

603
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,990
and uh and that was incredible and used
to do um programming in assembler and

604
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
to do um programming in assembler and
 

605
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,870
to do um programming in assembler and
and uh also amos basic this this

606
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
and uh also amos basic this this
 

607
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,630
and uh also amos basic this this
specific form of basic it was incredible

608
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
specific form of basic it was incredible
 

609
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,870
specific form of basic it was incredible
actually as well all my coding skills

610
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
actually as well all my coding skills
 

611
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,110
actually as well all my coding skills
and when did you fall in love with ai so

612
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
and when did you fall in love with ai so
 

613
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,430
and when did you fall in love with ai so
when did you first

614
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
when did you first
 

615
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,030
when did you first
start to gain an understanding that you

616
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
start to gain an understanding that you
 

617
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,509
start to gain an understanding that you
can not just write programs that

618
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
can not just write programs that
 

619
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,509
can not just write programs that
do some mathematical operations for you

620
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
do some mathematical operations for you
 

621
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,470
do some mathematical operations for you
while you sleep but something that's

622
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
while you sleep but something that's
 

623
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,389
while you sleep but something that's
a keen to

624
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
a keen to
 

625
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,710
a keen to
bringing an entity to life

626
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
bringing an entity to life
 

627
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,590
bringing an entity to life
sort of

628
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
sort of
 

629
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,750
sort of
a thing that can figure out something

630
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:11,760
a thing that can figure out something
 

631
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,750
a thing that can figure out something
more complicated than uh

632
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
more complicated than uh
 

633
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,750
more complicated than uh
than a simple mathematical operation

634
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
than a simple mathematical operation
 

635
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,509
than a simple mathematical operation
yeah so there was a few stages for me

636
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
yeah so there was a few stages for me
 

637
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,910
yeah so there was a few stages for me
all while i was very young so first of

638
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
all while i was very young so first of
 

639
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,750
all while i was very young so first of
all as i was trying to improve at

640
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
all as i was trying to improve at
 

641
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,350
all as i was trying to improve at
playing chess i was captaining various

642
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
playing chess i was captaining various
 

643
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,949
playing chess i was captaining various
england junior chess teams and at the

644
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
england junior chess teams and at the
 

645
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,630
england junior chess teams and at the
time when i was about you know maybe 10

646
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:26,640
time when i was about you know maybe 10
 

647

thinking processes so that leads you to
 

677
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,470
thinking processes so that leads you to
thinking about thinking how is your

678
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
thinking about thinking how is your
 

679
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,550
thinking about thinking how is your
brain coming up with these ideas why is

680
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
brain coming up with these ideas why is
 

681
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,949
brain coming up with these ideas why is
it making mistakes how can you how can

682
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
it making mistakes how can you how can
 

683
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,710
it making mistakes how can you how can
you improve that thought process but the

684
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
you improve that thought process but the
 

685
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,870
you improve that thought process but the
second thing is that you it was just the

686
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
second thing is that you it was just the
 

687
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,949
second thing is that you it was just the
beginning this was like in the in the

688
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
beginning this was like in the in the
 

689
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,269
beginning this was like in the in the
early 80s mid 80s of chess computers if

690
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
early 80s mid 80s of chess computers if
 

691
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,629
early 80s mid 80s of chess computers if
you remember they were physical boards

692
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
you remember they were physical boards
 

693
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,150
you remember they were physical boards
like the one we have in front of us and

694
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
like the one we have in front of us and
 

695
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,990
like the one we have in front of us and
you pressed down the you know the

696
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
you pressed down the you know the
 

697
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,310
you pressed down the you know the
squares and i think kasparov had a

698
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
squares and i think kasparov had a
 

699
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,269
squares and i think kasparov had a
branded version of it that i i i got and

700
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
branded version of it that i i i got and
 

701

remember my first ai program being uh
 

737
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,269
remember my first ai program being uh
programming my amiga it couldn't it

738
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
programming my amiga it couldn't it
 

739

i wrote a program for it to play othello
 

745
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,230
i wrote a program for it to play othello
reversey it's sometimes called i think

746

reversey it's sometimes called i think
 

747
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,629
reversey it's sometimes called i think
in the u.s and so a slightly simpler

748
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
in the u.s and so a slightly simpler
 

749
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,550
in the u.s and so a slightly simpler
game than chess but i used all of the

game than chess but i used all of the
 

751
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,470
game than chess but i used all of the
principles that chess programs had alpha

752
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
principles that chess programs had alpha
 

753
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,470
principles that chess programs had alpha
beta search all of that and that was my

754
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
beta search all of that and that was my
 

755
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,750
beta search all of that and that was my
first ai program i remember that very

756
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
first ai program i remember that very
 

757
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,670
first ai program i remember that very
well was around 12 years old so that

758
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
well was around 12 years old so that
 

759
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,829
well was around 12 years old so that
that that brought me into ai and then

760
00:13:21,829 --> 00:13:21,839
that that brought me into ai and then
 

761
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,230
that that brought me into ai and then
the second part was later on uh when i

762
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
the second part was later on uh when i
 

763
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,550
the second part was later on uh when i
was around 1617 and i was writing games

764
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
was around 1617 and i was writing games
 

765
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,710
was around 1617 and i was writing games
professionally designing games uh

766
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:28,720
professionally designing games uh
 

767
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,870
professionally designing games uh
writing a game called theme park which

768
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
writing a game called theme park which
 

769
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,910
writing a game called theme park which
um had ai as a core gameplay component

770
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
um had ai as a core gameplay component
 

771
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,790
um had ai as a core gameplay component
as part of the simulation um and it sold

772
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
as part of the simulation um and it sold
 

773
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,069
as part of the simulation um and it sold
you know millions of copies around the

774
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
you know millions of copies around the
 

775
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,230
you know millions of copies around the
world and people loved the way that the

776
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:40,240
world and people loved the way that the
 

777
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,150
world and people loved the way that the
ai even though it was relatively simple

778
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
ai even though it was relatively simple
 

779
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,030
ai even though it was relatively simple
by today's ai standards um was was

780
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
by today's ai standards um was was
 

781
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,629
by today's ai standards um was was
reacting to the way you as the player

782
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
reacting to the way you as the player
 

783
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,790
reacting to the way you as the player
played it so it was called a sandbox

784
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:48,800
played it so it was called a sandbox
 

785
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,550
played it so it was called a sandbox
game so it's one of the first types of

786
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
game so it's one of the first types of
 

787
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,949
game so it's one of the first types of
games like that along with simcity and

788
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
games like that along with simcity and
 

789
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,550
games like that along with simcity and
it meant that every game you played was

790
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
it meant that every game you played was
 

791
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,590
it meant that every game you played was
unique

792
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
unique
 

793
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,350
unique
is there something you could say just on

794
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
is there something you could say just on
 

795
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,790
is there something you could say just on
a small tangent

796
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
a small tangent
 

797
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,750
a small tangent
about

798
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
about

really impressive ai that you've seen in

804
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
really impressive ai that you've seen in
 

805
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,030
really impressive ai that you've seen in
games and maybe what does it take to

806
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
games and maybe what does it take to
 

807
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,189
games and maybe what does it take to
create ai system and how hard of a

808
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
create ai system and how hard of a
 

809
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,069
create ai system and how hard of a
problem is that so a million questions

810
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
problem is that so a million questions
 

811
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,230
problem is that so a million questions
just as a brief tangent

812
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
just as a brief tangent
 

813
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,230
just as a brief tangent
well look i think um

814
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
well look i think um
 

815
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,550
well look i think um
games uh games have been significant in

816
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
games uh games have been significant in
 

817
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,150
games uh games have been significant in
my life for three reasons so first of

818
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
my life for three reasons so first of
 

819
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,069
my life for three reasons so first of
all to to i was playing them and

820
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
all to to i was playing them and
 

821
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,069
all to to i was playing them and
training myself on games when i was a

822
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:28,079
training myself on games when i was a
 

823
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,310
training myself on games when i was a
kid then i went through a phase of

824
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
kid then i went through a phase of
 

825
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,949
kid then i went through a phase of
designing games and writing ai4 games so

826
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
designing games and writing ai4 games so
 

827
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,269
designing games and writing ai4 games so
all the games i i professionally wrote

828
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
all the games i i professionally wrote
 

829
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,750
all the games i i professionally wrote
uh had ai as a core component and that

830
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
uh had ai as a core component and that
 

831
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,790
uh had ai as a core component and that
was mostly in the in the 90s and the

832
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
was mostly in the in the 90s and the
 

833
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,389
was mostly in the in the 90s and the
reason i was doing that in games

834
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
reason i was doing that in games
 

835
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,389
reason i was doing that in games
industry was at the time the games

836
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
industry was at the time the games
 

837
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,150
industry was at the time the games
industry i think was the cutting edge of

838
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
industry i think was the cutting edge of
 

839
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,389
industry i think was the cutting edge of
technology so whether it was graphics

840
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
technology so whether it was graphics
 

841
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,310
technology so whether it was graphics
with people like john carmack and quake

842
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
with people like john carmack and quake
 

843
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,670
with people like john carmack and quake
and those kind of things or ai i think

844
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
and those kind of things or ai i think
 

845
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,350
and those kind of things or ai i think
actually all the action was going on in

846
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
actually all the action was going on in
 

847
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,269
actually all the action was going on in
games and and we've seen we're still

848
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
games and and we've seen we're still
 

849
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,710
games and and we've seen we're still
reaping the benefits of that even with

850
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:58,720
reaping the benefits of that even with
 

851
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,949
reaping the benefits of that even with
things like gpus which you know i find

852
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
things like gpus which you know i find
 

853
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,310
things like gpus which you know i find
ironic was obviously invented for

854
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
ironic was obviously invented for
 

855
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,910
ironic was obviously invented for
graphics computer graphics but then

856
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
graphics computer graphics but then
 

857
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,069
graphics computer graphics but then
turns out to be amazingly useful for ai

858
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
turns out to be amazingly useful for ai
 

859
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,590
turns out to be amazingly useful for ai
it just turns out everything's a matrix

860
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
it just turns out everything's a matrix
 

861
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,829
it just turns out everything's a matrix
multiplication it appears you know in

862
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
multiplication it appears you know in
 

863
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,030
multiplication it appears you know in
the whole world

864
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
the whole world
 

865
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,069
the whole world
so um so i think games at the time had

866
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
so um so i think games at the time had
 

867
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,150
so um so i think games at the time had
the most cutting edge ai and a lot of

868
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
the most cutting edge ai and a lot of
 

869
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,790
the most cutting edge ai and a lot of
the the games uh uh we you know i was

870
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
the the games uh uh we you know i was
 

871
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,230
the the games uh uh we you know i was
involved in writing so there was a game

872
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,240
involved in writing so there was a game
 

873
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,590
involved in writing so there was a game
called black and white which was one

874
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
called black and white which was one
 

875
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,030
called black and white which was one
game i was involved with in the early

876
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
game i was involved with in the early
 

877
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,509
game i was involved with in the early
stages of which i still think is the

878
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:25,519
stages of which i still think is the
 

879
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,790
stages of which i still think is the
most um

880
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
most um
 

881
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,949
most um
impressive uh example of reinforcement

882
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
impressive uh example of reinforcement
 

883
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,030
impressive uh example of reinforcement
learning in a computer game so in that

884
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
learning in a computer game so in that
 

885
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,870
learning in a computer game so in that
game you know you trained a little pet

886
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:32,880
game you know you trained a little pet
 

887
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,189
game you know you trained a little pet
animal uh and

888
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
animal uh and
 

889
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,870
animal uh and
yeah and it sort of learned from how you

890
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
yeah and it sort of learned from how you
 

891
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,389
yeah and it sort of learned from how you
were treating it so if you treated it

892
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
were treating it so if you treated it
 

893
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,870
were treating it so if you treated it
badly then it became mean yeah and then

894
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
badly then it became mean yeah and then
 

895
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,790
badly then it became mean yeah and then
it would be mean to to your villagers

896
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
it would be mean to to your villagers
 

897
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,470
it would be mean to to your villagers
and your and your population the sort of

898
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
and your and your population the sort of
 

899
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,990
and your and your population the sort of
uh the little tribe that you were

900
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
uh the little tribe that you were
 

901
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,990
uh the little tribe that you were
running uh but if you were kind to it

902
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
running uh but if you were kind to it
 

903
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,670
running uh but if you were kind to it
then it would be kind and people were

904
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
then it would be kind and people were
 

905
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,749
then it would be kind and people were
fascinated by how that was and so was i

906
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
fascinated by how that was and so was i
 

907
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,189
fascinated by how that was and so was i
to be honest with the way it kind of

908
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
to be honest with the way it kind of
 

909
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,829
to be honest with the way it kind of
developed and um especially the mapping

910
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
developed and um especially the mapping
 

911
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,150
developed and um especially the mapping
to good and evil yeah it made you made

912
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
to good and evil yeah it made you made
 

913
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,110
to good and evil yeah it made you made
you realize made me realize that you can

914
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
you realize made me realize that you can
 

915
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,110
you realize made me realize that you can
sort of in the way in the choices you

916
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
sort of in the way in the choices you
 

917
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,110
sort of in the way in the choices you
make can define

918
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
make can define
 

919
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,150
make can define
uh the

920
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
uh the
 

921
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,189
uh the
where you end up and that means

922
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
where you end up and that means
 

923
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,670
where you end up and that means
all of us are capable of the good

924
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
all of us are capable of the good
 

925
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,470
all of us are capable of the good
uh evil it all matters in uh the

926
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
uh evil it all matters in uh the
 

927
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,389
uh evil it all matters in uh the
different choices along the trajectory

928
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
different choices along the trajectory
 

929
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,230
different choices along the trajectory
to those places that you make it's

930
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
to those places that you make it's
 

931
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,310
to those places that you make it's
fascinating i mean games can do that

932
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
fascinating i mean games can do that
 

933
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,910
fascinating i mean games can do that
philosophically to you and it's rare it

934
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
philosophically to you and it's rare it
 

935
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,829
philosophically to you and it's rare it
seems rare yeah well games are i think a

936
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
seems rare yeah well games are i think a
 

937
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,150
seems rare yeah well games are i think a
unique medium because um you as the

938
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
unique medium because um you as the
 

939
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,430
unique medium because um you as the
player you're not just passively

940
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
player you're not just passively
 

941
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,230
player you're not just passively
consuming the the entertainment right

942
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
consuming the the entertainment right
 

943
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,710
consuming the the entertainment right
you're actually actively involved as an

944
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
you're actually actively involved as an
 

945
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,110
you're actually actively involved as an
as a as an agent so i think that's what

946
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
as a as an agent so i think that's what
 

947
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,550
as a as an agent so i think that's what
makes it in some ways can be more

948
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
makes it in some ways can be more
 

949
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,470
makes it in some ways can be more
visceral than other other mediums like

950
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
visceral than other other mediums like
 

951
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,389
visceral than other other mediums like
you know films and books so the second

952
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
you know films and books so the second
 

953
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,150
you know films and books so the second
so that was you know designing ai and

954
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
so that was you know designing ai and
 

955
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,350
so that was you know designing ai and
games and then the third use uh uh i've

956
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
games and then the third use uh uh i've
 

957
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,590
games and then the third use uh uh i've
we've used of ai is in deep mind from

958
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
we've used of ai is in deep mind from
 

959
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,749
we've used of ai is in deep mind from
the beginning which is using games as a

960
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
the beginning which is using games as a
 

961
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,710
the beginning which is using games as a
testing ground for proving out ai

962
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720

testing ground for proving out ai
algorithms and developing ai algorithms

964
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
algorithms and developing ai algorithms
 

965
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,590

and that was a that was a sort of um a

966
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
and that was a that was a sort of um a
 

967
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,189
and that was a that was a sort of um a
core component of our vision at the

968
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
core component of our vision at the
 

969
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,030
core component of our vision at the
start of deepmind was that we would use

970
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
start of deepmind was that we would use
 

971
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,910
start of deepmind was that we would use
games very heavily uh as our main

972
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:03,920
games very heavily uh as our main
 

973
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,909

testing ground certainly to begin with

974
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:05,919
testing ground certainly to begin with
 

975
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,750
testing ground certainly to begin with
um because it's super efficient to use

976
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
um because it's super efficient to use
 

977
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,230
um because it's super efficient to use
games and also you know it's very easy

978
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
games and also you know it's very easy
 

979
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,789
games and also you know it's very easy
to have metrics to see how well your

980
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
to have metrics to see how well your
 

981
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,789
to have metrics to see how well your
systems are improving and what direction

982
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
systems are improving and what direction
 

983
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,069
systems are improving and what direction
your ideas are going in and whether

984
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
your ideas are going in and whether
 

985
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,230
your ideas are going in and whether
you're making incremental improvements

986
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
you're making incremental improvements
 

987
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,309
you're making incremental improvements
and because those games are often rooted

988
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
and because those games are often rooted
 

989
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,909
and because those games are often rooted
in something that humans did for a long

990
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
in something that humans did for a long
 

991
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,270
in something that humans did for a long
time beforehand

992
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
time beforehand
 

993
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,669
time beforehand
there's already a strong

00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
there's already a strong

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,270
there's already a strong
set of rules like it's already a damn

good benchmark yes it's really good for

998
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
good benchmark yes it's really good for
 

999
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,190
good benchmark yes it's really good for
so many reasons because you've got

1000
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
so many reasons because you've got
 

1001
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,870
so many reasons because you've got
you've got you've got clear measures of

1002
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
you've got you've got clear measures of
 

1003
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,430
you've got you've got clear measures of
how good humans can be at these things

1004
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:35,440
how good humans can be at these things
 

1005
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,029
how good humans can be at these things
and in some cases like go we've been

1006
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
and in some cases like go we've been
 

1007
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,909
and in some cases like go we've been
playing it for thousands of years um and

1008
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
playing it for thousands of years um and
 

1009
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,990
playing it for thousands of years um and
and uh often they have scores or at

1010
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
and uh often they have scores or at
 

1011
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,310
and uh often they have scores or at
least win conditions so it's very easy

1012
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,320
least win conditions so it's very easy
 

1013
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,909
least win conditions so it's very easy
for reward learning systems to get a

1014
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
for reward learning systems to get a
 

1015
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,430
for reward learning systems to get a
reward it's very easy to specify what

1016
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
reward it's very easy to specify what
 

1017
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,549
reward it's very easy to specify what
that reward is um and uh also at the end

1018
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
that reward is um and uh also at the end
 

1019
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,789
that reward is um and uh also at the end
it's easy to you know to test uh

1020
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
it's easy to you know to test uh
 

1021
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,470
it's easy to you know to test uh
externally you know

1022
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
externally you know
 

1023
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,789
externally you know
how strong is your system by of course

1024
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
how strong is your system by of course
 

1025
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,310
how strong is your system by of course
playing against you know the world's

1026
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
playing against you know the world's
 

1027
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,029
playing against you know the world's
strongest players at those games so it's

1028
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
strongest players at those games so it's
 

1029
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,630
strongest players at those games so it's
it's so good for so many reasons and

1030
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
it's so good for so many reasons and
 

1031
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,470
it's so good for so many reasons and
it's also very efficient to run

1032
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
it's also very efficient to run
 

1033
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,710
it's also very efficient to run

parallel on the cloud so um i think

1036
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:09,600
parallel on the cloud so um i think
 

1037
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,590
parallel on the cloud so um i think
there's a huge reason why we were so

1038
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
there's a huge reason why we were so
 

1039
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,830
there's a huge reason why we were so

2010 how come we were able to progress

1042
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
2010 how come we were able to progress
 

1043
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,789
2010 how come we were able to progress
so quickly because we'd utilize games

1044
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
so quickly because we'd utilize games
 

1045
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,950
so quickly because we'd utilize games

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,549
it's humbling to realize that the things
we think are impossible now perhaps will

1122
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
we think are impossible now perhaps will
 

1123
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,669
we think are impossible now perhaps will
be done

1124
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
be done
 

1125
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,990
be done
in the future there's something

1126
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
in the future there's something
 

1127
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,350
in the future there's something
really powerful about a game ai system

1128
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
really powerful about a game ai system
 

1129
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,270
really powerful about a game ai system
being a human being in a game that

1130
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
being a human being in a game that
 

1131
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,870
being a human being in a game that
drives that message

1132
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
drives that message
 

1133
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,110
drives that message
uh home for like millions billions of

1134
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
uh home for like millions billions of
 

1135
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,310
uh home for like millions billions of
people especially in the case of go sure

1136
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
people especially in the case of go sure
 

1137
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,149
people especially in the case of go sure
well look i think it's a i mean it has

1138
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:02,159
well look i think it's a i mean it has
 

1139
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,070
well look i think it's a i mean it has
been a fascinating journey and and

1140
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,080
been a fascinating journey and and
 

1141
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,950
been a fascinating journey and and
especially as i i think about it from i

1142
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:06,960
especially as i i think about it from i
 

1143
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,950
especially as i i think about it from i
can understand it from both sides both

1144
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
can understand it from both sides both
 

1145
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,470
can understand it from both sides both
as the ai

1146
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:10,480
as the ai
 

1147
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,750
as the ai
you know creators of the ai um but also

1148
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
you know creators of the ai um but also
 

1149
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,149
you know creators of the ai um but also
as a games player originally so you know

1150
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:16,159
as a games player originally so you know
 

1151
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,590
as a games player originally so you know
it was a it was a really interesting it

1152
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,600
it was a it was a really interesting it
 

1153
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,390
it was a it was a really interesting it
was i mean it was a fantastic um but

1154
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
was i mean it was a fantastic um but
 

1155
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,070
was i mean it was a fantastic um but
also somewhat bittersweet moment the

1156
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
also somewhat bittersweet moment the
 

1157
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,190
also somewhat bittersweet moment the
alphago match for me um uh seeing that

1158
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
alphago match for me um uh seeing that
 

1159
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,110
alphago match for me um uh seeing that
and and and being obviously heavily

1160
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
and and and being obviously heavily
 

1161
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,830
and and and being obviously heavily
heavily involved in that um but you know

1162
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
heavily involved in that um but you know
 

1163
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,710
heavily involved in that um but you know
as you say chess has been uh the i mean

1164
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:32,720
as you say chess has been uh the i mean
 

1165
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,310
as you say chess has been uh the i mean
kasparov i think rightly called it the

1166
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
kasparov i think rightly called it the
 

1167
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,510
kasparov i think rightly called it the
drosophila of of intelligence right so

1168
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,520
drosophila of of intelligence right so
 

1169
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,590
drosophila of of intelligence right so
it's sort of i i love that phrase and

1170
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
it's sort of i i love that phrase and
 

1171
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,909
it's sort of i i love that phrase and
and i think he's right because chess has

1172
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
and i think he's right because chess has
 

1173
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,710
and i think he's right because chess has
been um hand in hand with ai from the

1174
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:44,720
been um hand in hand with ai from the
 

1175
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,270
been um hand in hand with ai from the
beginning of the the whole field right

1176
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
beginning of the the whole field right
 

1177
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,510
beginning of the the whole field right
so i think every ai practitioner

1178
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
so i think every ai practitioner
 

1179
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,190
so i think every ai practitioner
starting with turing and claude shannon

1180
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
starting with turing and claude shannon
 

1181
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,350
starting with turing and claude shannon
and all those uh the sort of forefathers

1182
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
and all those uh the sort of forefathers
 

1183
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,710
and all those uh the sort of forefathers
of of of of the field um tried their

1184
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:56,720
of of of of the field um tried their
 

1185
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,710
of of of of the field um tried their
hand at writing a chess program uh i've

1186
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
hand at writing a chess program uh i've
 

1187
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,549
hand at writing a chess program uh i've
got original audition of claude

1188
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
got original audition of claude
 

1189
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,990
got original audition of claude
shannon's first chess program i think it

1190
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
shannon's first chess program i think it
 

1191
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,750
shannon's first chess program i think it
was 1949 uh the the original sort of uh

1192
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:05,760
was 1949 uh the the original sort of uh
 

1193
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,789
was 1949 uh the the original sort of uh
paper and um they all did that and

1194
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799
paper and um they all did that and
 

1195
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,549
paper and um they all did that and
turing famously wrote a chess program

1196
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
turing famously wrote a chess program
 

1197
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,230
turing famously wrote a chess program
that but all the computers around there

1198
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,240
that but all the computers around there
 

1199
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,830
that but all the computers around there
were obviously too slow to run it so he

1200
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
were obviously too slow to run it so he
 

1201
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,669
were obviously too slow to run it so he
had to run he had to be the computer

1202
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:15,679
had to run he had to be the computer
 

1203
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,990
had to run he had to be the computer
right so he literally i think spent two

1204
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
right so he literally i think spent two
 

1205
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,070
right so he literally i think spent two
or three days running his own program by

1206
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,080
or three days running his own program by
 

1207
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,750
or three days running his own program by
hand with pencil and paper and playing

1208
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
hand with pencil and paper and playing
 

1209
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,750
hand with pencil and paper and playing
playing a friend of his uh with his

1210
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:23,760
playing a friend of his uh with his
 

1211
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,909
playing a friend of his uh with his
chess program so

1212
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
chess program so
 

1213
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,310
chess program so
of course deep blue was a huge moment uh

1214
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
of course deep blue was a huge moment uh
 

1215
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,270
of course deep blue was a huge moment uh
beating

1216
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
beating
 

1217
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,750
beating
off um but actually when that happened i

1218
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:31,760
off um but actually when that happened i
 

1219
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,669
off um but actually when that happened i
remember that very very vividly of

1220
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
remember that very very vividly of
 

1221
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,430
remember that very very vividly of
course because it was you know chess and

1222
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
course because it was you know chess and
 

1223
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,350
course because it was you know chess and
computers and ai all the things i loved

1224
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
computers and ai all the things i loved
 

1225
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,270
computers and ai all the things i loved
and i was at college at the time but i

1226
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
and i was at college at the time but i
 

1227
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,789
and i was at college at the time but i
remember coming away from that being

1228
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:40,799
remember coming away from that being
 

1229
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,110
remember coming away from that being
more impressed by kasparov's mind than i

1230
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
more impressed by kasparov's mind than i
 

1231
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,270
more impressed by kasparov's mind than i
was by deep blue because here was

1232
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
was by deep blue because here was
 

1233
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,909
was by deep blue because here was
kasparov with his human mind not only

1234
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
kasparov with his human mind not only
 

1235
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,430
kasparov with his human mind not only
could he play chess more or less to the

1236
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:49,440
could he play chess more or less to the
 

1237
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,270
could he play chess more or less to the
same level as this brute of a

1238
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
same level as this brute of a
 

1239
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,669
same level as this brute of a
calculation machine um but of course

1240
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,679
calculation machine um but of course
 

1241
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,270
calculation machine um but of course
kasparov can do everything else humans

1242
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
kasparov can do everything else humans
 

1243
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,270
kasparov can do everything else humans
can do ride a bike talk many languages

1244
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
can do ride a bike talk many languages
 

1245
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,950
can do ride a bike talk many languages
do politics all the rest of the amazing

1246
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
do politics all the rest of the amazing
 

1247
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,510
do politics all the rest of the amazing
things that kasparov does and so with

1248
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,520
things that kasparov does and so with
 

1249
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,750
things that kasparov does and so with
the same brain yeah and and yet deep

1250
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:03,760
the same brain yeah and and yet deep
 

1251
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,950
the same brain yeah and and yet deep
blue uh brilliant as it was at chess it

1252
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
blue uh brilliant as it was at chess it
 

1253
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,549
blue uh brilliant as it was at chess it
had been hand coded for chess and um

1254
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
had been hand coded for chess and um
 

1255
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,110
had been hand coded for chess and um
actually had distilled the knowledge of

1256
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
actually had distilled the knowledge of
 

1257
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,590
actually had distilled the knowledge of
chess grand masters uh into into a cool

1258
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:15,600
chess grand masters uh into into a cool
 

1259
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,669
chess grand masters uh into into a cool
program but it couldn't do anything else

1260
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:17,679
program but it couldn't do anything else
 

1261
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,350
program but it couldn't do anything else
like it couldn't even play a strictly

1262
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
like it couldn't even play a strictly
 

1263
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,909
like it couldn't even play a strictly
simpler game like tic-tac-toe so um

1264
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:21,919
simpler game like tic-tac-toe so um
 

1265
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,110
simpler game like tic-tac-toe so um
something to me was missing from um

1266
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
something to me was missing from um
 

1267
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,190
something to me was missing from um
intelligence from that system that we

1268
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
intelligence from that system that we
 

1269
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,710
intelligence from that system that we
would regard as intelligence and i think

1270
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
would regard as intelligence and i think
 

1271
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,190
would regard as intelligence and i think
it was this idea of generality and and

1272
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
it was this idea of generality and and
 

1273
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,909
it was this idea of generality and and
also learning yeah um so and that's what

1274
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:33,919
also learning yeah um so and that's what
 

1275
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,549
also learning yeah um so and that's what
we tried to do out with alphago yeah we

1276
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
we tried to do out with alphago yeah we
 

1277
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,950
we tried to do out with alphago yeah we
alphago and alpha zero mu zero and then

1278
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
alphago and alpha zero mu zero and then
 

1279
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,669
alphago and alpha zero mu zero and then
got on all the things that uh we'll get

1280
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:41,679
got on all the things that uh we'll get
 

1281
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,669
got on all the things that uh we'll get
into some parts of there's just a

1282
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
into some parts of there's just a
 

1283
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,070
into some parts of there's just a
fascinating trajectory here but let's

1284
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
fascinating trajectory here but let's
 

1285
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,029
fascinating trajectory here but let's
just stick on chess briefly uh on the

1286
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:49,039
just stick on chess briefly uh on the
 

1287
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,830
just stick on chess briefly uh on the
human side of chess you've proposed that

1288
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
human side of chess you've proposed that
 

1289
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,590
human side of chess you've proposed that
from a game design perspective the thing

1290
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,600
from a game design perspective the thing
 

1291
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,029
from a game design perspective the thing
that makes chess

1292
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
that makes chess
 

1293
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,270
that makes chess
compelling as a game

1294
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
compelling as a game
 

1295
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,430
compelling as a game
uh is that there's a creative tension

1296
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440
uh is that there's a creative tension
 

1297
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,950
uh is that there's a creative tension
between a bishop

1298
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:00,960
between a bishop
 

1299
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,789
between a bishop
and the knight

1300
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
and the knight
 

1301
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,390
and the knight
can you explain this first of all it's

1302
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:04,400
can you explain this first of all it's
 

1303
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,549
can you explain this first of all it's
really interesting to think about what

1304
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:06,559
really interesting to think about what
 

1305
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,630
really interesting to think about what
makes the game compelling

1306
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
makes the game compelling
 

1307
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,909
makes the game compelling
makes it stick across centuries

1308
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
makes it stick across centuries
 

1309
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,350
makes it stick across centuries
yeah i was sort of thinking about this

1310
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
yeah i was sort of thinking about this
 

1311
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,950
yeah i was sort of thinking about this
and actually a lot of even amazing chess

1312
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:14,960
and actually a lot of even amazing chess
 

1313
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,710
and actually a lot of even amazing chess
players don't think about it necessarily

1314
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
players don't think about it necessarily
 

1315
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,310
players don't think about it necessarily
from a games designer point of view so

1316
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:18,320
from a games designer point of view so
 

1317
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,310
from a games designer point of view so
it's with my game design hat on that i

1318
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320
it's with my game design hat on that i
 

1319
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,909
it's with my game design hat on that i
was thinking about this why is chess so

1320
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
was thinking about this why is chess so
 

1321
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,950
was thinking about this why is chess so
compelling

1322
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
compelling
 

1323
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,310
compelling
and i think a critical uh reason is the

1324
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
and i think a critical uh reason is the
 

1325
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,549
and i think a critical uh reason is the
the dynamicness of of of the different

1326
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:28,559
the dynamicness of of of the different
 

1327
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,830
the dynamicness of of of the different
kind of chess positions you can have

1328
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:29,840
kind of chess positions you can have
 

1329
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,430
kind of chess positions you can have
whether they're closed or open and other

1330
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
whether they're closed or open and other
 

1331
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,110
whether they're closed or open and other
things comes from the bishop and the

1332
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
things comes from the bishop and the
 

1333
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,510
things comes from the bishop and the
night so if you think about how

1334
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
night so if you think about how
 

1335
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,149
night so if you think about how
different the the the capabilities of

1336
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
different the the the capabilities of
 

1337
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,510
different the the the capabilities of
the bishop and knight are in terms of

1338
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
the bishop and knight are in terms of
 

1339
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,390
the bishop and knight are in terms of
the way they move and then somehow chess

1340
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400
the way they move and then somehow chess
 

1341
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,990
the way they move and then somehow chess
has evolved to balance those two

1342
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
has evolved to balance those two
 

1343
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,070
has evolved to balance those two
capabilities more or less equally so

1344
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
capabilities more or less equally so
 

1345
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,070
capabilities more or less equally so
they're both roughly worth three points

1346
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
they're both roughly worth three points
 

1347
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,909
they're both roughly worth three points
each so you think that dynamics was

1348
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
each so you think that dynamics was
 

1349
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,190
each so you think that dynamics was
always there and then the rest of the

1350
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:51,200
always there and then the rest of the
 

1351
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,350
always there and then the rest of the
rules are kind of trying to stabilize

1352
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:53,360
rules are kind of trying to stabilize
 

1353
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,950
rules are kind of trying to stabilize
the game well maybe i mean it's sort of

1354
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
the game well maybe i mean it's sort of
 

1355
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,990
the game well maybe i mean it's sort of
i don't know his chicken and egg

1356
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
i don't know his chicken and egg
 

1357
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,510
i don't know his chicken and egg
situation probably both came together

1358
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
situation probably both came together
 

1359
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,110
situation probably both came together
but the fact that it's got to this

1360
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,120
but the fact that it's got to this
 

1361
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,350
but the fact that it's got to this
beautiful equilibrium where you can have

1362
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
beautiful equilibrium where you can have
 

1363
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,710
beautiful equilibrium where you can have
the bishop and knight they're so

1364
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:02,720
the bishop and knight they're so
 

1365
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,669
the bishop and knight they're so
different in power um but so equal in

1366
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
different in power um but so equal in
 

1367
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,669
different in power um but so equal in
value across the set of the universe of

1368
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
value across the set of the universe of
 

1369
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,149
value across the set of the universe of
all positions right somehow they've been

1370
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:10,159
all positions right somehow they've been
 

1371
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,070
all positions right somehow they've been
balanced by humanity over hundreds of

1372
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
balanced by humanity over hundreds of
 

1373
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,870
balanced by humanity over hundreds of
years um i think gives gives the game

1374
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
years um i think gives gives the game
 

1375
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,110
years um i think gives gives the game
the creative tension uh that you can

1376
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120
the creative tension uh that you can
 

1377
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,190
the creative tension uh that you can
swap the bishop and knights uh for a

1378
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
swap the bishop and knights uh for a
 

1379
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,870
swap the bishop and knights uh for a
bishop for a knight and you you they're

1380
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
bishop for a knight and you you they're
 

1381
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,470
bishop for a knight and you you they're
more or less worth the same but now you

1382
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
more or less worth the same but now you
 

1383
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,990
more or less worth the same but now you
aim for a different type of position if

1384
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,000
aim for a different type of position if
 

1385
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,350
aim for a different type of position if
you have the knight you want a closed

1386
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360
you have the knight you want a closed
 

1387
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,870
you have the knight you want a closed
position if you have the bishop you want

1388
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:26,880
position if you have the bishop you want
 

1389
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,789
position if you have the bishop you want
an open position so i think that creates

1390
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
an open position so i think that creates
 

1391
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,789
an open position so i think that creates
a lot of the creative tension in chess

1392
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:30,799
a lot of the creative tension in chess
 

1393
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,630
a lot of the creative tension in chess
so some kind of controlled creative

1394
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,640
so some kind of controlled creative
 

1395
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,909
so some kind of controlled creative
tension

1396
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:33,919
tension
 

1397
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,909
tension
from an ai perspective

1398
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919
from an ai perspective
 

1399
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,669
from an ai perspective
do you think ai systems convention

1400
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:37,679
do you think ai systems convention
 

1401
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,430
do you think ai systems convention
design games that are optimally

1402
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:39,440
design games that are optimally
 

1403
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,430
design games that are optimally
compelling to humans

1404
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
compelling to humans
 

1405
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,710
compelling to humans
well that's an interesting question you

1406
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
well that's an interesting question you
 

1407
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,710
well that's an interesting question you
know sometimes i get asked about

1408
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
know sometimes i get asked about
 

1409
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,789
know sometimes i get asked about
ai and creativity and and this and the

1410
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
ai and creativity and and this and the
 

1411
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,390
ai and creativity and and this and the
way i answered that is relevant to that

1412
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
way i answered that is relevant to that
 

1413
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,990
way i answered that is relevant to that
question which is that i think they're

1414
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000
question which is that i think they're
 

1415
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,310
question which is that i think they're
different levels of creativity one could

1416
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:52,320
different levels of creativity one could
 

1417
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,630
different levels of creativity one could
say so i think um if we define

1418
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
say so i think um if we define
 

1419
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,149
say so i think um if we define
creativity as coming up with something

1420
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
creativity as coming up with something
 

1421
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,230
creativity as coming up with something
original right that's that's useful for

1422
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240
original right that's that's useful for
 

1423
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,710
original right that's that's useful for
a purpose then you know i think the kind

1424
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:00,720
a purpose then you know i think the kind
 

1425
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,549
a purpose then you know i think the kind
of lowest level of creativity is like an

1426
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
of lowest level of creativity is like an
 

1427
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,029
of lowest level of creativity is like an
interpolation so an averaging of all the

1428
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:05,039
interpolation so an averaging of all the
 

1429
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,190
interpolation so an averaging of all the
examples you see so maybe a very basic

1430
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
examples you see so maybe a very basic
 

1431
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,870
examples you see so maybe a very basic
ai system could say you could have that

1432
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
ai system could say you could have that
 

1433
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,630
ai system could say you could have that
so you show it millions of pictures of

1434
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:10,640
so you show it millions of pictures of
 

1435
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,789
so you show it millions of pictures of
cats and then you say give me an average

1436
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:12,799
cats and then you say give me an average
 

1437
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,549
cats and then you say give me an average
looking cat right generate me an average

1438
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
looking cat right generate me an average
 

1439
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,990
looking cat right generate me an average
looking cat i would call that

1440
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
looking cat i would call that
 

1441
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,549
looking cat i would call that
interpolation then there's extrapolation

1442
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
interpolation then there's extrapolation
 

1443
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,549
interpolation then there's extrapolation
which something like alphago showed so

1444
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
which something like alphago showed so
 

1445
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,390
which something like alphago showed so
alphago played you know millions of

1446
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
alphago played you know millions of
 

1447
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,390
alphago played you know millions of
games of go against itself

1448
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400
games of go against itself
 

1449
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,990
games of go against itself
and then it came up with brilliant new

1450
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
and then it came up with brilliant new
 

1451
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,630
and then it came up with brilliant new
ideas like move 37 in game two bringing

1452
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
ideas like move 37 in game two bringing
 

1453
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,510
ideas like move 37 in game two bringing
a motif strategies and go that that no

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
a motif strategies and go that that no
 

1455
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,190

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
we've played it for thousands of years
 

1459
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,470
we've played it for thousands of years
and professionally for hundreds of years

1460
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
and professionally for hundreds of years
 

1461
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,710

so that that i call that extrapolation

1462
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
so that that i call that extrapolation
 

1463
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,149
so that that i call that extrapolation
but then that's still there's still a

1464
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
but then that's still there's still a
 

1465
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,909
but then that's still there's still a
level above that which is you know you

1466
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
level above that which is you know you
 

1467
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,390
level above that which is you know you
could call out the box thinking or true

1468
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
could call out the box thinking or true

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
innovation which is could you invent go
 

1471
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,630

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:48,640
right could you invent chess and not
 

1473
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,149
right could you invent chess and not
just come up with a brilliant chess move

1474
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
just come up with a brilliant chess move
 

1475
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,310
just come up with a brilliant chess move
or brilliant go move but can you can you

1476
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,320
or brilliant go move but can you can you
 

1477
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,230
or brilliant go move but can you can you
actually invent chess or something as

1478
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
actually invent chess or something as
 

1479
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,510
actually invent chess or something as
good as chess or go and i think one day

00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
good as chess or go and i think one day
 

1481
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,390

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
uh ai could but what's missing is how
 

1483
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,190
uh ai could but what's missing is how
would you even specify that task to a a

1484
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
would you even specify that task to a a
 

1485
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,190
would you even specify that task to a a
program right now and the way i would do

1486
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
program right now and the way i would do
 

1487
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,350
program right now and the way i would do
it if i was best telling a human to do

1488
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
it if i was best telling a human to do
 

1489

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:10,720
designer to do it is i would say
 

1493
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,190
designer to do it is i would say
something like go i would say um

1494
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
something like go i would say um
 

1495
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,789
something like go i would say um
come up with a game that only takes five

1496
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:14,799
come up with a game that only takes five
 

1497
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,789
come up with a game that only takes five
minutes to learn which go does because

00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
minutes to learn which go does because
 

1499
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,950
minutes to learn which go does because
it's got simple rules but many lifetimes

1500
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
it's got simple rules but many lifetimes
 

1501
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,190
it's got simple rules but many lifetimes
to master right or impossible to master

to master right or impossible to master
 

1503
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,110
to master right or impossible to master
in one lifetime because so deep and so

1504
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
in one lifetime because so deep and so
 

1505
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,070
in one lifetime because so deep and so
complex um and then it's aesthetically

1506
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
complex um and then it's aesthetically
 

1507
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,950
complex um and then it's aesthetically
beautiful uh and also uh it can be

1508
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
beautiful uh and also uh it can be
 

1509
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,789
beautiful uh and also uh it can be
completed in three or four hours of

1510
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:30,799
completed in three or four hours of
 

1511
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,789
completed in three or four hours of
gameplay time which is you know useful

1512
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:32,799
gameplay time which is you know useful
 

1513
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,830
gameplay time which is you know useful
for our us you know in in a human day

1514
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
for our us you know in in a human day
 

1515
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,070
for our us you know in in a human day
and so um you might specify these side

1516
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
and so um you might specify these side
 

1517
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,230
and so um you might specify these side
of high level concepts like that and

1518
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,240
of high level concepts like that and
 

1519
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,909
of high level concepts like that and
then you know with that and maybe a few

1520
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
then you know with that and maybe a few
 

1521
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,549
then you know with that and maybe a few
other things uh one could imagine that

1522
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
other things uh one could imagine that
 

1523
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,830
other things uh one could imagine that
go satisfies uh those those constraints

1524
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
go satisfies uh those those constraints
 

1525
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,430
go satisfies uh those those constraints
um but the problem is is that we we're

1526
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,440
um but the problem is is that we we're
 

1527
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,950
um but the problem is is that we we're
not able to specify abstract notions

1528
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:52,960
not able to specify abstract notions
 

1529
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,710
not able to specify abstract notions
like that high-level abstract notions

1530
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
like that high-level abstract notions
 

1531
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,909
like that high-level abstract notions
like that yet to our ai systems um and i

1532
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
like that yet to our ai systems um and i
 

1533
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,110
like that yet to our ai systems um and i
think there's still something missing

1534
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,120
think there's still something missing
 

1535
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,430
think there's still something missing
there in terms of um high-level concepts

1536
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
there in terms of um high-level concepts
 

1537
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,029
there in terms of um high-level concepts
or abstractions that they truly

1538
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,039
or abstractions that they truly
 

1539
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,350
or abstractions that they truly
understand and that you know combinable

1540
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:05,360
understand and that you know combinable
 

1541
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,029
understand and that you know combinable
and compositional um so for the moment

1542
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:09,039
and compositional um so for the moment
 

1543
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,470
and compositional um so for the moment
i think ai is capable of doing

1544
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
i think ai is capable of doing
 

1545
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,110
i think ai is capable of doing
interpolation extrapolation but not true

00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
rule sets we can't currently do
 

1555
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,909
rule sets we can't currently do
but you could take a specific rule set

1556
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
but you could take a specific rule set
 

1557
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,149
but you could take a specific rule set
and then run a kind of self-play

1558
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
and then run a kind of self-play
 

1559
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,630
and then run a kind of self-play
experiment to see how long

scratch learns how long is that journey
 

1565
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,430

things you mentioned in terms of
 

1571
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,549
things you mentioned in terms of
quickness to learn and so on and you

1572
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
quickness to learn and so on and you
 

1573
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,950
quickness to learn and so on and you
could see a long journey to master for

1574
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
could see a long journey to master for
 

1575
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,350
could see a long journey to master for
even an ai system then you could say

1576
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:47,360
even an ai system then you could say
 

1577
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,269
even an ai system then you could say
that this is a promising game

1578
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:49,279
that this is a promising game
 

1579
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,269
that this is a promising game
um but it would be nice to do almost

1580
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279
um but it would be nice to do almost
 

1581
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,070
um but it would be nice to do almost
like alpha codes or programming rules so

1582
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
like alpha codes or programming rules so
 

1583
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,230
like alpha codes or programming rules so
generating rules that kind of

1584
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,240
generating rules that kind of
 

1585
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,110
generating rules that kind of

uh
 

1587
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,190
uh
that automate even that part of the

00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,200
that automate even that part of the
 

1589
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,950
that automate even that part of the
generation of rules so i have thought

1590
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
generation of rules so i have thought
 

1591
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,110
generation of rules so i have thought
about systems actually um that i think

1592
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,120
about systems actually um that i think
 

1593
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,110
about systems actually um that i think
would be amazing in in for a games

1594
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,120
would be amazing in in for a games
 

1595
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,510
would be amazing in in for a games
designer if you could have a system that

1596
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,520
designer if you could have a system that
 

1597
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,830
designer if you could have a system that
um takes your game plays it tens of

1598
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
um takes your game plays it tens of
 

1599
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,909
um takes your game plays it tens of
millions of times maybe overnight and

1600
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:11,919
millions of times maybe overnight and
 

1601
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,990
millions of times maybe overnight and
then self balances the rules better so

1602
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,000
then self balances the rules better so
 

1603
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,950
then self balances the rules better so
it tweaks the the rules and the maybe

1604
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
it tweaks the the rules and the maybe
 

1605
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,269
it tweaks the the rules and the maybe
the equations and the and the and the

1606
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
the equations and the and the and the
 

1607
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,149
the equations and the and the and the
parameters so that the game uh is more

1608
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
parameters so that the game uh is more
 

1609
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,549
parameters so that the game uh is more
balanced the units in the game or

1610
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
balanced the units in the game or
 

1611
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,230
balanced the units in the game or
some of the rules could be tweaked so

1612
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:26,240
some of the rules could be tweaked so
 

1613
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,230
some of the rules could be tweaked so
it's a bit of like a giving a base set

1614
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,240
it's a bit of like a giving a base set
 

1615
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,389
it's a bit of like a giving a base set
and then allowing a monte carlo tree

1616
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:30,399
and then allowing a monte carlo tree
 

1617
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,909
and then allowing a monte carlo tree
search or something like that to sort of

1618
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:31,919
search or something like that to sort of
 

1619
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,149
search or something like that to sort of
explore it right and i think that would

1620
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:34,159
explore it right and i think that would
 

1621
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,029
explore it right and i think that would
be super super a powerful tool actually

1622
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
be super super a powerful tool actually
 

1623
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,510
be super super a powerful tool actually
for for balancing auto balancing a game

1624
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:39,520
for for balancing auto balancing a game
 

1625
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,029
for for balancing auto balancing a game
which usually takes

1626
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,039
which usually takes
 

1627
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,710
which usually takes
thousands of hours from hundreds of

thousands of hours from hundreds of
 

1629

games human games testers normally to to
 

1631
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,310

balance some one you know game like

1632
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
balance some one you know game like
 

1633
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,110
balance some one you know game like
starcraft which is you know blizzard are

1634
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
starcraft which is you know blizzard are
 

1635
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,710
starcraft which is you know blizzard are
amazing at balancing their games but it

1636
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
amazing at balancing their games but it
 

1637
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,630
amazing at balancing their games but it
takes them years and years and years so

1638
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
takes them years and years and years so
 

1639
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,149
takes them years and years and years so
one could imagine at some point when

1640
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159
one could imagine at some point when
 

1641
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,630
one could imagine at some point when
this uh this stuff becomes uh efficient

1642
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
this uh this stuff becomes uh efficient
 

1643
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,909
this uh this stuff becomes uh efficient
enough to you know you might be able to

1644
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:57,919
enough to you know you might be able to
 

1645
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,430
enough to you know you might be able to
do that like overnight

1646
00:28:59,430 --> 00:28:59,440
do that like overnight
 

1647
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,630
do that like overnight
do you think a game that is optimal

1648
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
do you think a game that is optimal
 

1649
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,870
do you think a game that is optimal
designed by an ai system

1650
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
designed by an ai system
 

1651
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,669

would look very much like uh planet

1652
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
would look very much like uh planet
 

1653
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,590
would look very much like uh planet
earth

1654
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:09,600
earth
 

1655
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,590
earth
maybe maybe it's only the sort of game i

1656
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:11,600
maybe maybe it's only the sort of game i
 

1657
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,909
maybe maybe it's only the sort of game i
would love to make is is and i've tried

1658
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:13,919
would love to make is is and i've tried
 

1659
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,990
would love to make is is and i've tried
you know my in my game's career the

1660
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,000
you know my in my game's career the
 

1661
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,990
you know my in my game's career the
games design career you know my first

1662
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
games design career you know my first
 

1663
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,230
games design career you know my first
big game was designing a theme park an

1664
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,240
big game was designing a theme park an
 

1665
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,029
big game was designing a theme park an
amusement park then uh with games like

1666
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:23,039
amusement park then uh with games like
 

1667
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,029
amusement park then uh with games like
republic i tried to you know have games

1668
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
republic i tried to you know have games
 

1669
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,110
republic i tried to you know have games
where we designed whole cities and and

1670
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
where we designed whole cities and and
 

1671
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,350
where we designed whole cities and and
allowed you to play in so and of course

1672
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,360
allowed you to play in so and of course
 

1673
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,870
allowed you to play in so and of course
people like will wright have written

1674
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:30,880
people like will wright have written
 

1675
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,870
people like will wright have written
games like sim earth uh trying to

1676
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
games like sim earth uh trying to
 

1677
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,389
games like sim earth uh trying to
simulate the whole of earth pretty

1678
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
simulate the whole of earth pretty
 

1679
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,710
simulate the whole of earth pretty
tricky but um i see earth i haven't

1680
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:36,720
tricky but um i see earth i haven't
 

1681
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,310
tricky but um i see earth i haven't
actually played that one so what is it

1682
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,320
actually played that one so what is it
 

1683
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,470
actually played that one so what is it
does it incorporative evolution or yeah

1684
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,480
does it incorporative evolution or yeah
 

1685
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,710
does it incorporative evolution or yeah
it has evolution and it's sort of um it

1686
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:42,720
it has evolution and it's sort of um it
 

1687
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,310
it has evolution and it's sort of um it
tries to it sort of treats it as an

1688
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320
tries to it sort of treats it as an
 

1689
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,990
tries to it sort of treats it as an
entire biosphere but from quite a high

1690
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,000
entire biosphere but from quite a high
 

1691
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,190
entire biosphere but from quite a high
level

1692
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,200
level
 

1693
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,149
level
so

1694
00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:48,159
so
 

1695
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,389
so
nice to be able to sort of zoom in zoom

1696
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
nice to be able to sort of zoom in zoom
 

1697
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,230
nice to be able to sort of zoom in zoom
out zoom in exactly so obviously he

1698
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
out zoom in exactly so obviously he
 

1699
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,430
out zoom in exactly so obviously he
couldn't do that was in the night i

1700
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
couldn't do that was in the night i
 

1701
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,029
couldn't do that was in the night i
think he wrote that in the 90s so it

1702
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:55,039
think he wrote that in the 90s so it
 

1703
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,389
think he wrote that in the 90s so it
couldn't you know it wasn't it wasn't

1704
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
couldn't you know it wasn't it wasn't
 

1705
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,389
couldn't you know it wasn't it wasn't
able to do that but that that would be

1706
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:58,399
able to do that but that that would be
 

1707
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,470
able to do that but that that would be
uh obviously the ultimate sandbox game

1708
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
uh obviously the ultimate sandbox game
 

1709
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,350
uh obviously the ultimate sandbox game
of course

1710
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:01,360
of course
 

1711
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,870
of course
on that topic do you think we're living

1712
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:02,880
on that topic do you think we're living
 

1713
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,710
on that topic do you think we're living
in a simulation

1714
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
in a simulation
 

1715
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,950
in a simulation
yes well so okay so i'm gonna jump

1716
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
yes well so okay so i'm gonna jump
 

1717
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,190
yes well so okay so i'm gonna jump
around from the absurdly philosophical

1718
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
around from the absurdly philosophical
 

1719
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,590
around from the absurdly philosophical
to the short term sure very very happy

1720
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:11,600
to the short term sure very very happy
 

1721
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,430
to the short term sure very very happy
to so i think uh my answer to that

1722
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,440
to so i think uh my answer to that
 

1723
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,750
to so i think uh my answer to that
question is a little bit complex because

1724
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
question is a little bit complex because
 

1725
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,750
question is a little bit complex because
uh there is simulation theory which

1726
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
uh there is simulation theory which
 

1727
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,430
uh there is simulation theory which
obviously nick bostrom i think famously

1728
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,440
obviously nick bostrom i think famously
 

1729
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,590
obviously nick bostrom i think famously
first proposed um

1730
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
first proposed um
 

1731
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,070
first proposed um
and uh i don't quite believe it in in

1732
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,080
and uh i don't quite believe it in in
 

1733
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,870
and uh i don't quite believe it in in
that sense so um in the in the sense

1734
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:26,880
that sense so um in the in the sense
 

1735
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,870
that sense so um in the in the sense
that uh are we in some sort of computer

1736
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
that uh are we in some sort of computer
 

1737
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,669
that uh are we in some sort of computer
game or have our descendants somehow

1738
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679
game or have our descendants somehow
 

1739
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,470
game or have our descendants somehow
recreated uh uh earth in the you know

1740
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,480
recreated uh uh earth in the you know
 

1741
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,950
recreated uh uh earth in the you know
21st century and and some for some kind

1742
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
21st century and and some for some kind
 

1743
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,750
21st century and and some for some kind
of experimental reason i think that um

1744
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760
of experimental reason i think that um
 

1745
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,630
of experimental reason i think that um
but i do think that we that that we

1746
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:42,640
but i do think that we that that we
 

1747
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,549
but i do think that we that that we
might be that the best way to understand

1748
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559
might be that the best way to understand
 

1749
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,510
might be that the best way to understand
physics and the universe is from a

1750
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
physics and the universe is from a
 

1751
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,590
physics and the universe is from a
computational perspective so

1752
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:49,600
computational perspective so
 

1753
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,350
computational perspective so
understanding it as an information

1754
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,360
understanding it as an information
 

1755
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,990
understanding it as an information
universe and actually information being

1756
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,000
universe and actually information being
 

1757
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,230
universe and actually information being
the most fundamental unit of uh reality

1758
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
the most fundamental unit of uh reality
 

1759
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,990
the most fundamental unit of uh reality
rather than matter or energy so a

1760
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,000
rather than matter or energy so a
 

1761
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,830
rather than matter or energy so a
physicist would say you know matter or

1762
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,840
physicist would say you know matter or
 

1763
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,590
physicist would say you know matter or
energy you know e equals m c squared

1764
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:03,600
energy you know e equals m c squared
 

1765
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,590
energy you know e equals m c squared
these are the things that are are the

1766
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:05,600
these are the things that are are the
 

1767
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,509
these are the things that are are the
fundamentals of the universe i'd

1768
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:07,519
fundamentals of the universe i'd
 

1769
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,990
fundamentals of the universe i'd
actually say information um which of

1770
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:10,000
actually say information um which of
 

1771
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,710
actually say information um which of
course itself can be can specify energy

1772
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720
course itself can be can specify energy
 

1773
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,549
course itself can be can specify energy
or matter right matter is actually just

1774
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
or matter right matter is actually just
 

1775
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,230
or matter right matter is actually just
you know we're we're just out the way

1776
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,240
you know we're we're just out the way
 

1777
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,990
you know we're we're just out the way
our bodies and all the molecules in our

1778
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
our bodies and all the molecules in our
 

1779
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,310
our bodies and all the molecules in our
body arrange is information so i think

1780
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:20,320
body arrange is information so i think
 

1781
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,789
body arrange is information so i think
information may be the most fundamental

1782
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
information may be the most fundamental
 

1783
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,950
information may be the most fundamental
way to describe the universe and

1784
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
way to describe the universe and
 

1785
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,190
way to describe the universe and
therefore you could say we're in some

1786
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,200
therefore you could say we're in some
 

1787
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,669
therefore you could say we're in some
sort of simulation because of that um

1788
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:29,679
sort of simulation because of that um
 

1789
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,350
sort of simulation because of that um
but i don't i do i'm not i'm not really

1790
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
but i don't i do i'm not i'm not really
 

1791
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,909
but i don't i do i'm not i'm not really
a subscriber to the idea that um you

1792
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
a subscriber to the idea that um you
 

1793
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,430
a subscriber to the idea that um you
know these are sort of throw away

1794
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:35,440
know these are sort of throw away
 

1795
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,029
know these are sort of throw away
billions of simulations around i think

1796
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:37,039
billions of simulations around i think
 

1797
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,590
billions of simulations around i think
this is actually very critical and

1798
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:39,600
this is actually very critical and
 

1799
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,909
this is actually very critical and
possibly unique this simulation

1800
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
possibly unique this simulation
 

1801
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,909
possibly unique this simulation
particular one yes so but and you just

1802
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
particular one yes so but and you just
 

1803
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,190
particular one yes so but and you just
mean

1804
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,200
mean
 

1805
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,950
mean
treating the universe

1806
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:46,960
treating the universe
 

1807
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,710
treating the universe
as a computer

1808
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
as a computer
 

1809
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,669
as a computer
that's

1810
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:49,679
that's
 

1811
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,149
that's
processing and modifying information

1812
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:52,159
processing and modifying information
 

1813
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,830
processing and modifying information
is is a good way to solve the problems

1814
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:53,840
is is a good way to solve the problems
 

1815
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,190
is is a good way to solve the problems
of physics of chemistry of biology

1816
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,200
of physics of chemistry of biology
 

1817
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,070
of physics of chemistry of biology
and perhaps of humanity and so on yes i

1818
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
and perhaps of humanity and so on yes i
 

1819
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,870
and perhaps of humanity and so on yes i
think understanding physics in terms of

1820
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
think understanding physics in terms of
 

1821
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,590
think understanding physics in terms of
information theory uh might be the best

1822
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:05,600
information theory uh might be the best
 

1823
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,990
information theory uh might be the best
way to to really uh understand what's

1824
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,000
way to to really uh understand what's
 

1825
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,269

a computer do you think there's
 

1833
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,310
a computer do you think there's
something outside of the capabilities of

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,310
roger penrose
the nature of consciousness he he thinks

1842
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
the nature of consciousness he he thinks
 

1843
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,990
the nature of consciousness he he thinks
that consciousness is more than just a

1844
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
that consciousness is more than just a
 

1845
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,590
that consciousness is more than just a

computation
 

1847
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,590

uh do you think all of it the whole

1848
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:31,600
uh do you think all of it the whole
 

1849
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,909
uh do you think all of it the whole
shebang is can be can be a competition

yeah i've had many fascinating debates

1852
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
yeah i've had many fascinating debates
 

1853
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,070
yeah i've had many fascinating debates
with uh sir roger penrose and obviously

1854
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,080
with uh sir roger penrose and obviously
 

1855
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,310
with uh sir roger penrose and obviously
he's he's famously and i read you know

1856
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:40,320
he's he's famously and i read you know
 

1857
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,710
he's he's famously and i read you know
emperors of new mind and and um

1858
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
emperors of new mind and and um
 

1859
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,110
emperors of new mind and and um
and his books uh his classical books uh

1860
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120
and his books uh his classical books uh
 

1861
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,549
and his books uh his classical books uh
and they they were pretty influential

1862
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:46,559
and they they were pretty influential
 

1863
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,870
and they they were pretty influential
and you know in the 90s and um he

1864
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
and you know in the 90s and um he
 

1865
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,549
and you know in the 90s and um he
believes that there's something more you

1866
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:50,559
believes that there's something more you
 

1867
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,029
believes that there's something more you
know something quantum that is needed to

1868
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,039
know something quantum that is needed to
 

1869
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,909
know something quantum that is needed to
explain consciousness in the brain um i

1870
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
explain consciousness in the brain um i
 

1871
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,669
explain consciousness in the brain um i
think about what we're doing actually at

1872
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
think about what we're doing actually at
 

1873
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,669
think about what we're doing actually at
deepmind and what my career is being

1874
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
deepmind and what my career is being
 

1875
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,909
deepmind and what my career is being
we're almost like true rings champion so

1876
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
we're almost like true rings champion so
 

1877
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,590
we're almost like true rings champion so
we are pushing turing machines or

1878
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600
we are pushing turing machines or
 

1879
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,070
we are pushing turing machines or
classical computation to the limits what

1880
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,080
classical computation to the limits what
 

1881
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,990
classical computation to the limits what
are the limits of what classical

1882
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
are the limits of what classical
 

1883
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,029
are the limits of what classical
computing can do now um and at the same

1884
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039
computing can do now um and at the same
 

1885
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,669
computing can do now um and at the same
time i've also studied neuroscience to

1886
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
time i've also studied neuroscience to
 

1887
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,509
time i've also studied neuroscience to
see and that's why i did my phd in was

1888
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:15,519
see and that's why i did my phd in was
 

1889
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,830
see and that's why i did my phd in was
to see also to look at you know is there

1890
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,840
to see also to look at you know is there
 

1891
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,269
to see also to look at you know is there
anything quantum in the brain from a

1892
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:19,279
anything quantum in the brain from a
 

1893
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,110
anything quantum in the brain from a
neuroscience or biological perspective

1894
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,120
neuroscience or biological perspective
 

1895
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,590
neuroscience or biological perspective
and um and so far i think most

1896
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,600
and um and so far i think most
 

1897
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,029
and um and so far i think most
neuroscientists and most mainstream

1898
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:25,039
neuroscientists and most mainstream
 

1899
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,549
neuroscientists and most mainstream
biologists and neuroscientists would say

1900
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:26,559
biologists and neuroscientists would say
 

1901
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,789
biologists and neuroscientists would say
there's no evidence of any quantum uh

1902
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:28,799
there's no evidence of any quantum uh
 

1903
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,870
there's no evidence of any quantum uh
systems or effects in the brain as far

1904
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:30,880
systems or effects in the brain as far
 

1905
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,470
systems or effects in the brain as far
as we can see it's it can be mostly

1906
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:32,480
as we can see it's it can be mostly
 

1907
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,950
as we can see it's it can be mostly
explained by classical uh classical

1908
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:34,960
explained by classical uh classical
 

1909
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,029

theories so

1910
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
theories so
 

1911
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,870
theories so
and then so there's sort of the the

1912
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880
and then so there's sort of the the
 

1913
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,110
and then so there's sort of the the
search from the biology side and then at

1914
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,120
search from the biology side and then at
 

1915
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,190
search from the biology side and then at
the same time there's the raising of the

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
the same time there's the raising of the
 

1917
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,909
the same time there's the raising of the

1921
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,710
turing machines can do uh uh and
and you know including our new ai

protein folding and so on and so i think

1938
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:11,520
protein folding and so on and so i think
 

1939
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,470
protein folding and so on and so i think
um

1940
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:12,480
um
 

1941
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,069
um
i would be very hesitant to bet against

and classical computation paradigm can
 

1947
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,270
and classical computation paradigm can
go and and my betting would be

1948
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
go and and my betting would be
 

1949
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,750
go and and my betting would be
that all of certainly what's going on in

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,069
single cell recording all of this stuff
but we also have the ability computers

2062
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,079
but we also have the ability computers
 

2063
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,510
but we also have the ability computers
and ai to build uh intelligent systems

2064
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
and ai to build uh intelligent systems
 

2065
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,349
and ai to build uh intelligent systems
so i think that um

2066
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:33,359
so i think that um
 

2067
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,230
so i think that um
uh

2068
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,240
uh
 

2069
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,910
uh
you know i think it is amazing what the

2070
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:35,920
you know i think it is amazing what the
 

2071
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,910
you know i think it is amazing what the
human mind does and um and and i'm kind

2072
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:39,920
human mind does and um and and i'm kind
 

2073
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,990
human mind does and um and and i'm kind
of in awe of it really and uh and i

2074
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000
of in awe of it really and uh and i
 

2075
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,990
of in awe of it really and uh and i
think it's amazing that without human

2076
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,000
think it's amazing that without human
 

2077
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,589
think it's amazing that without human
minds we're able to build things like

2078
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:45,599
minds we're able to build things like
 

2079
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,150
minds we're able to build things like
computers and and actually even you know

2080
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,160
computers and and actually even you know
 

2081
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,430
computers and and actually even you know
think and investigate about these

2082
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:49,440
think and investigate about these
 

2083
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,470
think and investigate about these
questions i think that's also a

2084
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:50,480
questions i think that's also a
 

2085
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,349
questions i think that's also a
testament to the human mind yeah the

2086
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,359
testament to the human mind yeah the
 

2087
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,550
testament to the human mind yeah the
universe built the human mind that now

2088
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:56,560
universe built the human mind that now
 

2089
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,630
universe built the human mind that now
is building computers that help

2090
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:58,640
is building computers that help
 

2091
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,630
is building computers that help
us understand both the universe and our

2092
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:00,640
us understand both the universe and our
 

2093
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,630
us understand both the universe and our
own human mind right that's exactly it i

2094
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:02,640
own human mind right that's exactly it i
 

2095
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,990
own human mind right that's exactly it i
mean i think that's one you know one

2096
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
mean i think that's one you know one
 

2097
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,670
mean i think that's one you know one
could say we we are

2098
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
could say we we are
 

2099
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,589
could say we we are
maybe we're the mechanism by which the

2100
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
maybe we're the mechanism by which the
 

2101
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,109
maybe we're the mechanism by which the
universe is going to try and understand

2102
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:09,119
universe is going to try and understand
 

2103
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,310
universe is going to try and understand
itself yeah

2104
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,320

 

2105
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,950

it's beautiful so let's let's go to the

2106
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:14,960
it's beautiful so let's let's go to the
 

2107
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,190
it's beautiful so let's let's go to the
basic building blocks of biology that i

2108
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:17,200
basic building blocks of biology that i
 

2109
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,150
basic building blocks of biology that i
think

2110
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
think
 

2111
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,990
think
is another angle at which you can start

2112
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,000
is another angle at which you can start
 

2113
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,670
is another angle at which you can start
to understand the human mind the human

2114
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,680
to understand the human mind the human
 

2115
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,470
to understand the human mind the human
body which is quite fascinating which is

2116
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,480
body which is quite fascinating which is
 

2117
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,950
body which is quite fascinating which is
from the basic building blocks start to

2118
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:26,960
from the basic building blocks start to
 

2119
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,950
from the basic building blocks start to
simulate start to model

2120
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:28,960
simulate start to model
 

2121
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,630
simulate start to model
how from those building blocks you can

2122
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:30,640
how from those building blocks you can
 

2123
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,390
how from those building blocks you can
construct bigger and bigger more complex

2124
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:32,400
construct bigger and bigger more complex
 

2125
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,310
construct bigger and bigger more complex
systems maybe one day the entirety of

2126
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:34,320
systems maybe one day the entirety of
 

2127
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,109
systems maybe one day the entirety of
the human biology so

2128
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:37,119
the human biology so
 

2129
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,750
the human biology so
here's another problem that thought to

2130
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
here's another problem that thought to
 

2131
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,750
here's another problem that thought to
be impossible to solve which is protein

2132
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:41,760
be impossible to solve which is protein
 

2133
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,190
be impossible to solve which is protein
folding and alpha fold or

2134
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:45,200
folding and alpha fold or
 

2135
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,589
folding and alpha fold or
specific alpha fold 2

2136
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:47,599
specific alpha fold 2
 

2137
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,150
specific alpha fold 2
did just that it solved protein folding

2138
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,160
did just that it solved protein folding
 

2139
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,190
did just that it solved protein folding
i think it's one of the biggest

2140
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,200
i think it's one of the biggest
 

2141
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,030
i think it's one of the biggest
breakthroughs

2142
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,040
breakthroughs
 

2143
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,069
breakthroughs
uh certainly in the history of

2144
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:54,079
uh certainly in the history of
 

2145
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,870
uh certainly in the history of
structural biology but uh in general in

2146
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:56,880
structural biology but uh in general in
 

2147
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,790
structural biology but uh in general in
in science

2148
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
in science
 

2149
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,069
in science
um

2150
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:00,079
um
 

2151
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,150
um
maybe from a high level

2152
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:02,160
maybe from a high level
 

2153
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,710
maybe from a high level
what is it and how does it work

2154
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:04,720
what is it and how does it work
 

2155
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,109
what is it and how does it work
and then we can ask some fascinating

2156
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:07,119
and then we can ask some fascinating
 

2157
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,390
and then we can ask some fascinating
sure questions after sure um so maybe

2158
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,400
sure questions after sure um so maybe
 

2159
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,390
sure questions after sure um so maybe
like to explain it uh to people not

2160
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
like to explain it uh to people not
 

2161
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,910
like to explain it uh to people not
familiar with protein folding is you

2162
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:13,920
familiar with protein folding is you
 

2163
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,670
familiar with protein folding is you
know i first of all explain proteins

2164
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:15,680
know i first of all explain proteins
 

2165
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,750
know i first of all explain proteins
which is you know proteins are essential

2166
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:17,760
which is you know proteins are essential
 

2167
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,150
which is you know proteins are essential
to all life every function in your body

2168
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
to all life every function in your body
 

2169
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,990
to all life every function in your body
depends on proteins sometimes they're

2170
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,000
depends on proteins sometimes they're
 

2171
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,069
depends on proteins sometimes they're
called the workhorses of biology and if

2172
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,079
called the workhorses of biology and if
 

2173
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,190
called the workhorses of biology and if
you look into them and i've you know

2174
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,200
you look into them and i've you know
 

2175
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,710
you look into them and i've you know
obviously as part of alpha fold i've

2176
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:26,720
obviously as part of alpha fold i've
 

2177
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,270
obviously as part of alpha fold i've
been researching proteins and and

2178
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:29,280
been researching proteins and and
 

2179
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,710
been researching proteins and and
structural biology for the last few

2180
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
structural biology for the last few
 

2181
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,109
structural biology for the last few
years you know they're amazing little

2182
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,119
years you know they're amazing little
 

2183
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,710
years you know they're amazing little
bio nano machines proteins they're

2184
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:34,720
bio nano machines proteins they're
 

2185
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,990
bio nano machines proteins they're
incredible if you actually watch little

2186
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,000
incredible if you actually watch little
 

2187
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,670
incredible if you actually watch little
videos of how they work animations of

2188
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
videos of how they work animations of
 

2189
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,870
videos of how they work animations of
how they work

2190
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,880
how they work
 

2191
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,349
how they work
and um proteins are specified by their

2192
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:41,359
and um proteins are specified by their
 

2193
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,430
and um proteins are specified by their
genetic sequence called the amino acid

2194
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:43,440
genetic sequence called the amino acid
 

2195
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,349
genetic sequence called the amino acid
sequence so you can think of those their

2196
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359
sequence so you can think of those their
 

2197
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,950
sequence so you can think of those their
genetic makeup and then in the body uh

2198
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960
genetic makeup and then in the body uh
 

2199
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,349
genetic makeup and then in the body uh
in in nature they when they when they

2200
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:51,359
in in nature they when they when they
 

2201
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,510
in in nature they when they when they
fold up into a 3d structure so you can

2202
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,520
fold up into a 3d structure so you can
 

2203
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,270
fold up into a 3d structure so you can
think of it as a string of beads and

2204
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,280
think of it as a string of beads and
 

2205
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,349
think of it as a string of beads and
then they fold up into a ball now the

2206
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359
then they fold up into a ball now the
 

2207
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,270
then they fold up into a ball now the
key thing is you want to know what that

2208
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,280
key thing is you want to know what that
 

2209
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,950
key thing is you want to know what that
3d structure is

2210
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:00,960
3d structure is
 

2211
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,109
3d structure is
because the structure the 3d structure

2212
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
because the structure the 3d structure
 

2213
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,390
because the structure the 3d structure
of a protein

2214
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,400
of a protein
 

2215
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,310
of a protein
is what helps to determine what does it

2216
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:06,320
is what helps to determine what does it
 

2217
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,550
is what helps to determine what does it
do the function it does in your body

2218
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:08,560
do the function it does in your body
 

2219
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,230
do the function it does in your body
and also if you're interested in drug

2220
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:10,240
and also if you're interested in drug
 

2221
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,870
and also if you're interested in drug
drugs or disease you need to understand

2222
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880
drugs or disease you need to understand
 

2223
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,790
drugs or disease you need to understand
that 3d structure because if you want to

2224
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:14,800
that 3d structure because if you want to
 

2225
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,109
that 3d structure because if you want to
target something with a drug compound or

2226
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:17,119
target something with a drug compound or
 

2227
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,630
target something with a drug compound or
about to block that something the

2228
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:18,640
about to block that something the
 

2229
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,550
about to block that something the
protein is doing uh you need to

2230
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:20,560
protein is doing uh you need to
 

2231
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,990
protein is doing uh you need to
understand where it's going to bind on

2232
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:22,000
understand where it's going to bind on
 

2233
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,990
understand where it's going to bind on
the surface of the protein so obviously

2234
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:24,000
the surface of the protein so obviously
 

2235
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,349
the surface of the protein so obviously
in order to do that you need to

2236
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:25,359
in order to do that you need to
 

2237
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,790
in order to do that you need to
understand the 3d structure so the

2238
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:26,800
understand the 3d structure so the
 

2239
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,470
understand the 3d structure so the
structure is mapped to the function the

2240
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
structure is mapped to the function the
 

2241
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,750
structure is mapped to the function the
structure is mapped to the function and

2242
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:29,760
structure is mapped to the function and
 

2243
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,670
structure is mapped to the function and
the structure is obviously somehow

2244
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:31,680
the structure is obviously somehow
 

2245
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,990
the structure is obviously somehow
specified by the by the amino acid

2246
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:34,000
specified by the by the amino acid
 

2247
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,750
specified by the by the amino acid
sequence and that's the in essence the

2248
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:35,760
sequence and that's the in essence the
 

2249
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,990
sequence and that's the in essence the
protein folding problem is can you just

2250
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,000
protein folding problem is can you just
 

2251
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,589
protein folding problem is can you just
from the amino acid sequence the

2252
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:39,599
from the amino acid sequence the
 

2253
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,030
from the amino acid sequence the
one-dimensional

2254
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,040
one-dimensional
 

2255
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,589
one-dimensional
string of letters can you

2256
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:43,599
string of letters can you
 

2257
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,589
string of letters can you
immediately computationally predict the

2258
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:45,599
immediately computationally predict the
 

2259
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,710
immediately computationally predict the
3d structure right and this has been a

2260
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:48,720
3d structure right and this has been a
 

2261
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,710
3d structure right and this has been a
grand challenge in biology for over 50

2262
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:50,720
grand challenge in biology for over 50
 

2263
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,310
grand challenge in biology for over 50
years so i think it was first

2264
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:52,320
years so i think it was first

i you know it's been described to me as
equivalent to fermat's last theorem but

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,349
for biology right you should as somebody
that uh very well might win the nobel

2284
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:15,359
that uh very well might win the nobel
 

2285
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,390
that uh very well might win the nobel
prize in the future but outside of that

2286
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,400
prize in the future but outside of that
 

2287
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,829
prize in the future but outside of that
you should do more of that kind of thing

2288
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:19,839
you should do more of that kind of thing
 

2289
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,990
you should do more of that kind of thing
in the margins just put random things

00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,000
in the margins just put random things

set people off for 200 years it should

2294
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,240
set people off for 200 years it should
 

2295
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,309
set people off for 200 years it should
be possible exactly and just don't give

2296
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:28,319
be possible exactly and just don't give
 

2297
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,990
be possible exactly and just don't give

any interest exactly i think everyone's
 

2299
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,230

that for future so yeah so he set off

2302
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:34,480
that for future so yeah so he set off
 

2303
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,150
that for future so yeah so he set off
you know with this one throwaway remark

2304
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,160
you know with this one throwaway remark
 

2305
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,309
you know with this one throwaway remark
just like fermat you know he he set off

2306
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:38,319
just like fermat you know he he set off
 

2307
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,470
just like fermat you know he he set off
this whole 50-year uh

2308
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:40,480
this whole 50-year uh
 

2309
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,349
this whole 50-year uh
uh uh field really of computational

2310
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:43,359
uh uh field really of computational
 

2311
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,430
uh uh field really of computational
biology and and they had you know they

2312
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
biology and and they had you know they
 

2313
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,270
biology and and they had you know they
got stuck they hadn't really got very

2314
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,280
got stuck they hadn't really got very
 

2315
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,790
got stuck they hadn't really got very
far with doing this and and um until now

2316
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:50,800
far with doing this and and um until now
 

2317
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,870
far with doing this and and um until now
until alpha fold came along this is done

2318
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:52,880
until alpha fold came along this is done
 

2319
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,430
until alpha fold came along this is done
experimentally right very painstakingly

2320
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:55,440
experimentally right very painstakingly
 

2321
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,950
experimentally right very painstakingly
so the rule of thumb is and you have to

2322
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:56,960
so the rule of thumb is and you have to
 

2323
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,870
so the rule of thumb is and you have to
like crystallize the protein which is

2324
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:58,880
like crystallize the protein which is
 

2325
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,870
like crystallize the protein which is
really difficult some proteins can't be

2326
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
really difficult some proteins can't be
 

2327
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,030
really difficult some proteins can't be
crystallized like membrane proteins and

2328
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,040
crystallized like membrane proteins and
 

2329
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,630
crystallized like membrane proteins and
then you have to use very expensive

2330
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
then you have to use very expensive
 

2331
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,550
then you have to use very expensive
electron microscopes or x-ray

2332
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
electron microscopes or x-ray
 

2333
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,470
electron microscopes or x-ray
crystallography machines really

2334
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,480
crystallography machines really
 

2335
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,550
crystallography machines really
painstaking work to get the 3d structure

2336
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
painstaking work to get the 3d structure
 

2337
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,550
painstaking work to get the 3d structure
and visualize the 3d structure so the

2338
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
and visualize the 3d structure so the
 

2339
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,710
and visualize the 3d structure so the
rule of thumb in in experimental biology

2340
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:14,720
rule of thumb in in experimental biology
 

2341
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,950
rule of thumb in in experimental biology
is that it takes one phd student their

2342
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:16,960
is that it takes one phd student their
 

2343
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,630
is that it takes one phd student their
entire phd to do one protein uh and with

2344
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:20,640
entire phd to do one protein uh and with
 

2345
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,270
entire phd to do one protein uh and with
alpha fold two we were able to predict

2346
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
alpha fold two we were able to predict
 

2347
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,910
alpha fold two we were able to predict
the 3d structure in a matter of seconds

2348
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
the 3d structure in a matter of seconds
 

2349
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,910
the 3d structure in a matter of seconds
um and so we were you know over

2350
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
um and so we were you know over
 

2351
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,510
um and so we were you know over
christmas we did the whole human

2352
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,520
christmas we did the whole human
 

2353
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,270
christmas we did the whole human
proteome or every protein in the human

2354
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,280
proteome or every protein in the human
 

2355
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,589
proteome or every protein in the human
body all 20 000 proteins so the human

2356
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:33,599
body all 20 000 proteins so the human
 

2357
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,790
body all 20 000 proteins so the human
proteins like the equivalent of the

2358
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
proteins like the equivalent of the
 

2359
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,390
proteins like the equivalent of the
human genome but on protein space and uh

2360
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,400
human genome but on protein space and uh
 

2361
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,790
human genome but on protein space and uh
and sort of revolutionize really what uh

2362
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:40,800
and sort of revolutionize really what uh
 

2363
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,510
and sort of revolutionize really what uh
a structural biologist can do because

2364
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:43,520
a structural biologist can do because
 

2365
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,910
a structural biologist can do because
now um they don't have to worry about

2366
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
now um they don't have to worry about
 

2367
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,829
now um they don't have to worry about
these painstaking experimentals you know

2368
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:47,839
these painstaking experimentals you know
 

2369
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,270
these painstaking experimentals you know
should they put all of that effort in or

2370
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
should they put all of that effort in or
 

2371
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,630
should they put all of that effort in or
not they can almost just look up the

2372
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
not they can almost just look up the
 

2373
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,750
not they can almost just look up the

google search
 

2377
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,069

and so there's a data set on which it's

2378
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
and so there's a data set on which it's
 

2379
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,390
and so there's a data set on which it's
trained and how to map this amino acids

2380
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,400
trained and how to map this amino acids
 

2381
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,589
trained and how to map this amino acids
because first of all it's incredible

2382
00:41:59,589 --> 00:41:59,599
because first of all it's incredible
 

2383
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,430
because first of all it's incredible
that a protein this little chemical

that a protein this little chemical
computer is able to do that computation

2386
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
computer is able to do that computation

and do it very quickly

2390
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:07,680
and do it very quickly

that's a weird thing and they evolved

2392
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440
that's a weird thing and they evolved
 

2393
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,470
that's a weird thing and they evolved
that way because you know in the

2394
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480
that way because you know in the
 

2395
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,510
that way because you know in the
beginning

2396
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:11,520
beginning
 

2397
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,349

i mean that's a great invention just the

2398
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:13,359
i mean that's a great invention just the
 

2399
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,910
i mean that's a great invention just the
protein itself yes i mean and then they

2400
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:15,920
protein itself yes i mean and then they
 

2401
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,790
protein itself yes i mean and then they
there's i think probably a history of

00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:18,800
there's i think probably a history of
 

2403
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,030
there's i think probably a history of
like uh they evolved

2404
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,040
like uh they evolved
 

2405
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,950
like uh they evolved
to have many of these proteins and those

2406
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:22,960
to have many of these proteins and those
 

2407
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,270
to have many of these proteins and those
proteins figure out how to be computers

2408
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
proteins figure out how to be computers

complexes with each other in order to
 

2417
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,950
complexes with each other in order to
form high level functions i mean it's a

2418
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
form high level functions i mean it's a
 

2419
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,349
form high level functions i mean it's a
weird system that they figured it out

2420
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:35,359
weird system that they figured it out
 

2421
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,030
weird system that they figured it out
well for sure i mean we you know maybe

2422
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,040
well for sure i mean we you know maybe
 

2423
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,630
well for sure i mean we you know maybe
we should talk about the origins of life

2424
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:38,640
we should talk about the origins of life
 

2425
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,309
we should talk about the origins of life
too but proteins themselves i think are

2426
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:40,319
too but proteins themselves i think are
 

2427
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,750

2475
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,069
wrong there's often a unique way
for that sequence to form itself yes so

00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:38,079
for that sequence to form itself yes so

uh

2484
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
uh
 

2485
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,390
uh
in some cases there might be a

2486
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:46,400
in some cases there might be a
 

2487
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,710
in some cases there might be a
misfunction so on which leads to a lot

2488
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:48,720
misfunction so on which leads to a lot
 

2489
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,069
misfunction so on which leads to a lot
of the disorders and stuff like that but

2490
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:50,079
of the disorders and stuff like that but
 

2491
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,910
of the disorders and stuff like that but
yes most of the time it's a unique

2492
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
yes most of the time it's a unique
 

2493
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,910
yes most of the time it's a unique
mapping and that unique mapping is not

2494
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:53,920
mapping and that unique mapping is not
 

2495
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,309
mapping and that unique mapping is not
obvious no exactly that's just what the

2496
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:56,319
obvious no exactly that's just what the
 

2497
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,309
obvious no exactly that's just what the
problem is exactly so there's a unique

2498
00:43:58,309 --> 00:43:58,319
problem is exactly so there's a unique
 

2499
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,109
problem is exactly so there's a unique
mapping usually in a healthy in if it's

2500
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
mapping usually in a healthy in if it's
 

2501
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,910
mapping usually in a healthy in if it's
healthy and as you say in disease

2502
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
healthy and as you say in disease
 

2503
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,150
healthy and as you say in disease
so for example alzheimer's one one one

2504
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,160
so for example alzheimer's one one one
 

2505
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,670
so for example alzheimer's one one one
conjecture is that it's because of a

2506
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:07,680
conjecture is that it's because of a
 

2507
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,750
conjecture is that it's because of a
misfolded protein a protein that folds

2508
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:09,760
misfolded protein a protein that folds
 

2509
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,630
misfolded protein a protein that folds
in the wrong way amyloid beta protein so

2510
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:12,640
in the wrong way amyloid beta protein so
 

2511
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,069
in the wrong way amyloid beta protein so
um and then because it falls in the

2512
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:14,079
um and then because it falls in the
 

2513
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,910
um and then because it falls in the
wrong way it gets tangled up right in

2514
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920
wrong way it gets tangled up right in
 

2515
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,230
wrong way it gets tangled up right in
your in your neurons so

2516
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:18,240
your in your neurons so
 

2517
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,470
your in your neurons so
um it's super important to understand

2518
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:20,480
um it's super important to understand
 

2519
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,030
um it's super important to understand
both healthy functioning and also

2520
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
both healthy functioning and also
 

2521
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,109
both healthy functioning and also
disease is to understand uh you know

2522
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:25,119
disease is to understand uh you know
 

2523
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,550
disease is to understand uh you know
what what these things are doing and how

2524
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:26,560
what what these things are doing and how
 

2525
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,150
what what these things are doing and how
they're structuring of course the next

2526
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:28,160
they're structuring of course the next
 

2527
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,390
they're structuring of course the next
step is sometimes proteins change shape

2528
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,400
step is sometimes proteins change shape
 

2529
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,790
step is sometimes proteins change shape
when they interact with something so um

2530
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800

2531
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,950
when they interact with something so um
they're not just static necessarily in

00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:45,520
early days of alpha fold of of solving
 

2541
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,950
early days of alpha fold of of solving
this problem because

2542
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:46,960
this problem because
 

2543
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,870
this problem because
unlike games this is

2544
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
unlike games this is
 

2545
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,390
unlike games this is
real physical systems that are less

00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:58,319
the the size of the data set is smaller
 

2553
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,750
the the size of the data set is smaller
that you might otherwise like so you

2554
00:44:59,750 --> 00:44:59,760
that you might otherwise like so you
 

2555
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,270
that you might otherwise like so you
have to be very clever about certain

2556
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,280
have to be very clever about certain
 

2557
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,390
have to be very clever about certain
things is there something you could

2558
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:02,400
things is there something you could
 

2559
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,710
things is there something you could
speak to um

2560
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
speak to um
 

2561
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,109
speak to um
what was very hard to solve and what are

2562
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:07,119
what was very hard to solve and what are
 

2563
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,030
what was very hard to solve and what are
some beautiful aspects about the the

00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,040
some beautiful aspects about the the
 

2565
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,750
some beautiful aspects about the the
solution yeah i would say alpha fold is

2566
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:11,760
solution yeah i would say alpha fold is
 

2567
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,670
solution yeah i would say alpha fold is
the most complex and also probably most

2568
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:13,680
the most complex and also probably most
 

2569
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,990
the most complex and also probably most

2571
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,670

00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:17,680
it's been an amazing time actually in
 

2573
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,589

2575
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,069
the last you know two three years to see
that come through because um as we

2576
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:22,079
that come through because um as we
 

2577
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,510
that come through because um as we
talked about earlier you know games is

2578
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
talked about earlier you know games is
 

2579
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,910
talked about earlier you know games is
what we started on uh building things

2580
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:25,920
what we started on uh building things
 

2581
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,309
what we started on uh building things
like alphago and alpha zero but really

2582
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:28,319
like alphago and alpha zero but really
 

2583
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,710
like alphago and alpha zero but really
the ultimate goal was to um not just to

00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,720
the ultimate goal was to um not just to
 

2585
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,030
the ultimate goal was to um not just to
crack games it was just to to to build

2586
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,040
crack games it was just to to to build
 

2587
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,790

00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:39,040
world challenges specifically my passion
 

2593
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,190

is scientific challenges like protein

2594
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:41,200
is scientific challenges like protein
 

2595
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,270
is scientific challenges like protein
folding and then alpha fold of course is

2596
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:43,280
folding and then alpha fold of course is
 

2597
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,230

our first big proof point of that and so

2598
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:46,240
our first big proof point of that and so
 

2599
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,030
our first big proof point of that and so
um you know in terms of the data uh and

2600
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
um you know in terms of the data uh and
 

2601
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,390
um you know in terms of the data uh and
the amount of innovations that had to go

2602
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,400
the amount of innovations that had to go
 

2603
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,390
the amount of innovations that had to go
into it we you know it was like more

2604
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:52,400
into it we you know it was like more
 

2605
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,309
into it we you know it was like more
than 30 different component algorithms

2606
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:54,319
than 30 different component algorithms
 

2607
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,150
than 30 different component algorithms
needed to be put together to crack the

2608
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
needed to be put together to crack the
 

2609
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,390
needed to be put together to crack the
protein folding um i think some of the

2610
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:58,400
protein folding um i think some of the
 

2611
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,710
protein folding um i think some of the
big innovations were that um

2612
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
big innovations were that um
 

2613
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,190
big innovations were that um
kind of building in some hard coded

00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,560
evolutionary biology um to constrain
 

2619
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,190
evolutionary biology um to constrain
sort of things like the bond angles uh

2620
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:11,200
sort of things like the bond angles uh
 

2621
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,270
sort of things like the bond angles uh
uh in the in the in the protein and

2622
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,280
uh in the in the in the protein and
 

2623
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,270
uh in the in the in the protein and
things like that um

2624
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,280
things like that um
 

2625
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,270
things like that um
a lot but not to impact the learning

2626
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:17,280
a lot but not to impact the learning
 

2627
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,829
a lot but not to impact the learning
system so still allowing uh the system

2628
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:19,839
system so still allowing uh the system
 

2629
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,470
system so still allowing uh the system
to be able to learn the physics uh

2630
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
to be able to learn the physics uh
 

2631
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,349
to be able to learn the physics uh
itself um from the examples that we had

2632
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
itself um from the examples that we had
 

2633
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:26,710
itself um from the examples that we had
and the examples as you say there are

2634
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,720
and the examples as you say there are
 

2635
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,190
and the examples as you say there are
only about 150 000 proteins even after

2636
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
only about 150 000 proteins even after
 

2637
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,270
only about 150 000 proteins even after
40 years of experimental biology only

2638
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:31,280
40 years of experimental biology only
 

2639
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:33,829
40 years of experimental biology only
around 150 000 proteins have been the

2640
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:33,839
around 150 000 proteins have been the
 

2641
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,910
around 150 000 proteins have been the
structures have been found out about so

2642
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:35,920
structures have been found out about so
 

2643
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,150
structures have been found out about so
that was our training set which is um

2644
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
that was our training set which is um
 

2645
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,069
that was our training set which is um
much less than normally we would like to

2646
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
much less than normally we would like to
 

2647
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:40,950
much less than normally we would like to
use

2648
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:40,960
use
 

2649
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,630
use
but using various tricks things like

2650
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
but using various tricks things like
 

2651
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,829
but using various tricks things like
self distillation so actually using

2652
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:45,839
self distillation so actually using
 

2653
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,470
self distillation so actually using
alpha folds predictions um some of the

2654
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:48,480
alpha folds predictions um some of the
 

2655
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,990
alpha folds predictions um some of the
best predictions that it thought was

2656
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
best predictions that it thought was
 

2657
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,670
best predictions that it thought was
highly confident in we put them back

2658
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:51,680
highly confident in we put them back
 

2659
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,670
highly confident in we put them back
into the training set right to make the

2660
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:53,680
into the training set right to make the
 

2661
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,270
into the training set right to make the
training set bigger

2662
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
training set bigger
 

2663
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,589
training set bigger
that was critical to to alpha fold

2664
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:57,599
that was critical to to alpha fold
 

2665
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,670
that was critical to to alpha fold
working so there was actually a huge

2666
00:46:59,670 --> 00:46:59,680
working so there was actually a huge
 

2667
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,230
working so there was actually a huge
number of different um uh innovations

2668
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:02,240
number of different um uh innovations
 

2669
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,230
number of different um uh innovations
like that that were required to to

2670
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:04,240
like that that were required to to
 

2671
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,550
like that that were required to to
ultimately crack the problem after fold

2672
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:06,560
ultimately crack the problem after fold
 

2673
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:09,910
ultimately crack the problem after fold
one what it produced was a distagram so

2674
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:09,920
one what it produced was a distagram so
 

2675
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,349
one what it produced was a distagram so
a kind of

2676
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:11,359
a kind of
 

2677
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,510
a kind of
a matrix of the pairwise distances

2678
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:13,520
a matrix of the pairwise distances
 

2679
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,309
a matrix of the pairwise distances
between all of the molecules in the in

00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:16,319
between all of the molecules in the in
 

2681
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,470
between all of the molecules in the in
the in the protein and then there had to

2682
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:18,480
the in the protein and then there had to
 

2683
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,829
the in the protein and then there had to
be a separate optimization process to uh

2684
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:21,839
be a separate optimization process to uh
 

2685
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,670
be a separate optimization process to uh
create the 3d structure

2686
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
create the 3d structure
 

2687
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,349
create the 3d structure
and what we did for alpha volt2 is make

2688
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:25,359
and what we did for alpha volt2 is make
 

2689
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,670
and what we did for alpha volt2 is make
it truly end to end so we went straight

2690
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:27,680
it truly end to end so we went straight
 

2691
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,790
it truly end to end so we went straight
from the amino acid sequence of of of

2692
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:30,800
from the amino acid sequence of of of
 

2693
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,470
from the amino acid sequence of of of
bases to

2694
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:32,480
bases to
 

2695
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,309
bases to
the 3d structure directly without going

2696
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
the 3d structure directly without going
 

2697
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,230
the 3d structure directly without going
through this intermediate step and in

2698
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240
through this intermediate step and in
 

2699
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,230
through this intermediate step and in
machine learning what we've always found

2700
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:38,240
machine learning what we've always found
 

2701
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,390
machine learning what we've always found
is that the more end to end you can make

2702
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:40,400
is that the more end to end you can make
 

2703
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,390
is that the more end to end you can make
it the better the system and it's

2704
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:42,400
it the better the system and it's
 

2705
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,670
it the better the system and it's
probably because um we you know the in

2706
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:45,680
probably because um we you know the in
 

2707
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,349
probably because um we you know the in
the end the system is better at learning

2708
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359
the end the system is better at learning
 

2709
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,349
the end the system is better at learning
what the constraints are than than we

2710
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:49,359
what the constraints are than than we
 

2711
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:51,349
what the constraints are than than we
are as the human designers of specifying

2712
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:51,359
are as the human designers of specifying
 

2713
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,589
are as the human designers of specifying
it so anytime you can let it flow end to

2714
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:53,599
it so anytime you can let it flow end to
 

2715
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,109
it so anytime you can let it flow end to
end and actually just generate what it

2716
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:55,119
end and actually just generate what it
 

2717
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,630
end and actually just generate what it
is you're really looking for in this

2718
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:56,640
is you're really looking for in this
 

2719
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,950
is you're really looking for in this
case the 3d structure you're better off

2720
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:58,960
case the 3d structure you're better off
 

2721
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,549
case the 3d structure you're better off
than having this intermediate step which

2722
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:00,559
than having this intermediate step which
 

2723
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,230
than having this intermediate step which
you then have to hand craft the next

2724
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,240
you then have to hand craft the next
 

2725
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,069
you then have to hand craft the next
step for so

2726
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:04,079
step for so
 

2727
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,430
step for so
so it's better to let the gradients and

2728
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:05,440
so it's better to let the gradients and
 

2729
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,030
so it's better to let the gradients and
the learning flow all the way through

2730
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:07,040
the learning flow all the way through
 

2731
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,109
the learning flow all the way through
the system um from the end point the end

2732
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:09,119
the system um from the end point the end
 

2733
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,950
the system um from the end point the end
output you want to the inputs so that's

2734
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:10,960
output you want to the inputs so that's
 

2735
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,870
output you want to the inputs so that's
a good way to start a new problem

2736
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
a good way to start a new problem
 

2737
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,790
a good way to start a new problem
handcraft a bunch of stuff add a bunch

2738
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:14,800
handcraft a bunch of stuff add a bunch
 

2739
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,109
handcraft a bunch of stuff add a bunch
of manual constraints with a small

2740
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:17,119
of manual constraints with a small
 

2741
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,270
of manual constraints with a small
intent learning piece or a small

2742
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:19,280
intent learning piece or a small
 

2743
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,109
intent learning piece or a small
learning piece and grow that learning

2744
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:21,119
learning piece and grow that learning
 

2745
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,790
learning piece and grow that learning
piece until it consumes the whole thing

2746
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:22,800
piece until it consumes the whole thing
 

2747
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,030
piece until it consumes the whole thing
that's right and so you can also see you

2748
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:25,040
that's right and so you can also see you
 

2749
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,390
that's right and so you can also see you
know this is a bit of a method we've

2750
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:26,400
know this is a bit of a method we've
 

2751
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,390
know this is a bit of a method we've
developed over doing many sort of

2752
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,400
developed over doing many sort of
 

2753
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,549
developed over doing many sort of
successful outfits we call them alpha x

2754
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
successful outfits we call them alpha x
 

2755
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,270
successful outfits we call them alpha x
projects right is and the easiest way to

2756
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:33,280
projects right is and the easiest way to
 

2757
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,510
projects right is and the easiest way to
see that is the evolution of alphago to

2758
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:35,520
see that is the evolution of alphago to
 

2759
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,109
see that is the evolution of alphago to
alpha zero so alphago was um a learning

2760
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:39,119
alpha zero so alphago was um a learning
 

2761
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,630
alpha zero so alphago was um a learning
system but it was specifically trained

2762
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:40,640
system but it was specifically trained
 

2763
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,430
system but it was specifically trained
to only play go right so uh and what we

2764
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:43,440
to only play go right so uh and what we
 

2765
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,430
to only play go right so uh and what we
wanted to do with first version of go is

2766
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:45,440
wanted to do with first version of go is
 

2767
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,349
wanted to do with first version of go is
just get to world champion performance

2768
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:47,359
just get to world champion performance
 

2769
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,430
just get to world champion performance
no matter how we did it right and then

2770
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
no matter how we did it right and then
 

2771
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,150
no matter how we did it right and then
and then of course alphago zero we we we

2772
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,160
and then of course alphago zero we we we
 

2773
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,230
and then of course alphago zero we we we
removed the need to use human games as a

2774
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:54,240
removed the need to use human games as a
 

2775
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,390
removed the need to use human games as a
starting point right so it could just

2776
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
starting point right so it could just
 

2777
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,109
starting point right so it could just
play against itself from random starting

2778
00:48:59,109 --> 00:48:59,119
play against itself from random starting
 

2779
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,710
play against itself from random starting
point from the beginning so that removed

2780
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:00,720
point from the beginning so that removed
 

2781
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,630
point from the beginning so that removed
the the need for human knowledge uh

2782
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:02,640
the the need for human knowledge uh
 

2783
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,950
the the need for human knowledge uh
about go and then finally alpha zero

2784
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:04,960
about go and then finally alpha zero
 

2785
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,190
about go and then finally alpha zero
then generalized it so that any things

2786
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,200
then generalized it so that any things
 

2787
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,190
then generalized it so that any things
we had in there the system including

2788
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:09,200
we had in there the system including
 

2789
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,270
we had in there the system including
things like symmetry of the go board uh

2790
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:11,280
things like symmetry of the go board uh
 

2791
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,190
things like symmetry of the go board uh
were removed so the alpha zero could

2792
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:13,200
were removed so the alpha zero could
 

2793
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,430
were removed so the alpha zero could
play from scratch any two player game

2794
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:15,440
play from scratch any two player game
 

2795
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,510
play from scratch any two player game
and then mu0 which is the final

2796
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:17,520
and then mu0 which is the final
 

2797
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,670
and then mu0 which is the final
latest version of that set of things was

2798
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:19,680
latest version of that set of things was
 

2799
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,270
latest version of that set of things was
then extending it so that you didn't

2800
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,280
then extending it so that you didn't
 

2801
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,549
then extending it so that you didn't
even have to give it the rules of the

2802
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:22,559
even have to give it the rules of the
 

2803
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,870
even have to give it the rules of the
game it would learn that for itself so

2804
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:24,880
game it would learn that for itself so
 

2805
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,470
game it would learn that for itself so
it could also deal with computer games

2806
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:26,480
it could also deal with computer games
 

2807
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,309
it could also deal with computer games
as well as board games so that line of

2808
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:28,319
as well as board games so that line of
 

2809
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,670
as well as board games so that line of
alpha golf goes zero alpha zero mu zero

2810
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:31,680
alpha golf goes zero alpha zero mu zero
 

2811
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,670
alpha golf goes zero alpha zero mu zero
that's the full trajectory of what you

2812
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:33,680
that's the full trajectory of what you
 

2813
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,109
that's the full trajectory of what you
can take from

2814
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:35,119
can take from
 

2815
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,109
can take from
uh imitation learning

2816
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:37,119
uh imitation learning

bootstrapping it uh through self-play uh

2828
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
bootstrapping it uh through self-play uh
 

2829
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,470
bootstrapping it uh through self-play uh
yourself but the thing is it would have

2830
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,480
yourself but the thing is it would have
 

2831
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,470
yourself but the thing is it would have
been impossible i think or very hard for

2832
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
been impossible i think or very hard for
 

2833
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,430
been impossible i think or very hard for
us to build alpha zero or mu0 first out

2834
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:57,440
us to build alpha zero or mu0 first out
 

2835
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,470
us to build alpha zero or mu0 first out
of the box

2836
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:58,480
of the box
 

2837
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,870
of the box
even psychologically because you have to

2838
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
even psychologically because you have to
 

2839
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,109
even psychologically because you have to
believe in yourself for a very long time

2840
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:03,119
believe in yourself for a very long time
 

2841
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,470
believe in yourself for a very long time
you're constantly dealing with doubt

2842
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:04,480
you're constantly dealing with doubt
 

2843
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,910
you're constantly dealing with doubt
because a lot of people say that it's

2844
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:05,920
because a lot of people say that it's
 

2845
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,829
because a lot of people say that it's
impossible exactly so it was hard enough

2846
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:07,839
impossible exactly so it was hard enough
 

2847
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,109
impossible exactly so it was hard enough
just to do go as you were saying

2848
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:09,119
just to do go as you were saying
 

2849
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,950
just to do go as you were saying
everyone thought that was impossible or

2850
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:10,960
everyone thought that was impossible or
 

2851
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,190
everyone thought that was impossible or
at least a decade away um from when we

2852
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:13,200
at least a decade away um from when we
 

2853
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,990
at least a decade away um from when we
when we did it back in 2015 24 you know

2854
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:16,000
when we did it back in 2015 24 you know
 

2855
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,549
when we did it back in 2015 24 you know
2016 and um

2856
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:18,559
2016 and um
 

2857
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,069
2016 and um
and so yes it would have been

2858
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
and so yes it would have been
 

2859
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,910
and so yes it would have been
psychologically probably very difficult

2860
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:21,920
psychologically probably very difficult
 

2861
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,589
psychologically probably very difficult
as well as the fact that of course we

2862
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:23,599
as well as the fact that of course we
 

2863
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,230
as well as the fact that of course we
learnt a lot by building alphago first

2864
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
learnt a lot by building alphago first
 

2865
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,069
learnt a lot by building alphago first
right so it's i think this is why i call

2866
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:28,079
right so it's i think this is why i call
 

2867
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,069
right so it's i think this is why i call
ai in engineering science it's one of

2868
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:30,079
ai in engineering science it's one of
 

2869
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,069
ai in engineering science it's one of
the most fascinating science disciplines

2870
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,079
the most fascinating science disciplines
 

2871
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,670
the most fascinating science disciplines
but it's also an engineering science in

2872
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:33,680
but it's also an engineering science in
 

2873
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,150
but it's also an engineering science in
the sense that unlike natural sciences

2874
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:36,160
the sense that unlike natural sciences
 

2875
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,150
the sense that unlike natural sciences
um the phenomenon you're studying it

2876
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
um the phenomenon you're studying it
 

2877
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,750
um the phenomenon you're studying it
doesn't exist out in nature you have to

2878
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:39,760
doesn't exist out in nature you have to
 

2879
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,430
doesn't exist out in nature you have to
build it first so you have to build the

2880
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:41,440
build it first so you have to build the
 

2881
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,589
build it first so you have to build the
artifact first and then you can study

2882
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:43,599
artifact first and then you can study
 

2883
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,670
artifact first and then you can study
how how and pull it apart and how it

2884
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
how how and pull it apart and how it
 

2885
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,030
how how and pull it apart and how it
works this is tough to uh

2886
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,040
works this is tough to uh
 

2887
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,150
works this is tough to uh
ask you this question because you

2888
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:50,160
ask you this question because you
 

2889
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,910
ask you this question because you
probably will say it's everything but

2890
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:51,920
probably will say it's everything but
 

2891
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,069
probably will say it's everything but
let's let's try let's try to think to

2892
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
let's let's try let's try to think to
 

2893
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,030
let's let's try let's try to think to
this because you're in a very

2894
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:55,040
this because you're in a very
 

2895
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,190
this because you're in a very
interesting position where deepmind is

2896
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:57,200
interesting position where deepmind is
 

2897
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,870
interesting position where deepmind is
the place of some of the most uh

2898
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
the place of some of the most uh
 

2899
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,750
the place of some of the most uh
brilliant ideas in the history of ai but

2900
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:01,760
brilliant ideas in the history of ai but
 

2901
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,510
brilliant ideas in the history of ai but
it's also a place of brilliant

2902
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
it's also a place of brilliant
 

2903
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,750
it's also a place of brilliant
engineering

2904
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:05,760
engineering
 

2905
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,150
engineering
so how much of solving intelligence this

2906
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:08,160
so how much of solving intelligence this
 

2907
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,349
so how much of solving intelligence this
big goal for deepmind how much of it is

2908
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
big goal for deepmind how much of it is
 

2909
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,510
big goal for deepmind how much of it is
science how much is engineering so how

2910
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:13,520
science how much is engineering so how
 

2911
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,190
science how much is engineering so how
much is the algorithms how much is the

2912
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:15,200
much is the algorithms how much is the
 

2913
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,430
much is the algorithms how much is the
data how much is the

2914
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:17,440
data how much is the
 

2915
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,990
data how much is the
hardware compute infrastructure how much

2916
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:20,000
hardware compute infrastructure how much
 

2917
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,670
hardware compute infrastructure how much
is it the software computer

2918
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:21,680
is it the software computer
 

2919
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,309
is it the software computer
infrastructure yeah um what else is

2920
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:24,319
infrastructure yeah um what else is
 

2921
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,670
infrastructure yeah um what else is
there how much is the human

2922
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:25,680
there how much is the human
 

2923
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,109
there how much is the human
infrastructure

2924
00:51:27,109 --> 00:51:27,119
infrastructure
 

2925
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,190
infrastructure
and like just the humans interact in

2926
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:29,200
and like just the humans interact in
 

2927
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,790
and like just the humans interact in
certain kinds of ways in all the space

2928
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:30,800
certain kinds of ways in all the space
 

2929
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,390
certain kinds of ways in all the space
of all those ideas how much does maybe

2930
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
of all those ideas how much does maybe
 

2931
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,030
of all those ideas how much does maybe
like philosophy how much what's the key

2932
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:35,040
like philosophy how much what's the key
 

2933
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,030
like philosophy how much what's the key
if um

2934
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:37,040
if um
 

2935
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,069
if um
uh

2936
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:38,079
uh
 

2937
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,790
uh
if if you were to sort of look back like

2938
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:40,800
if if you were to sort of look back like
 

2939
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,030
if if you were to sort of look back like
if we go forward 200 years look back

2940
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040
if we go forward 200 years look back
 

2941
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,030
if we go forward 200 years look back
what was the key thing that solved

2942
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
what was the key thing that solved
 

2943
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,670
what was the key thing that solved
intelligence is that ideas

2944
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:47,680
intelligence is that ideas
 

2945
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,349
intelligence is that ideas
i think it's a combination first of all

2946
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:49,359
i think it's a combination first of all
 

2947
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,710
i think it's a combination first of all
of course it's a combination of all

2948
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:50,720
of course it's a combination of all
 

2949
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,630
of course it's a combination of all
those things but the the ratios of them

2950
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:52,640
those things but the the ratios of them
 

2951
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,710
those things but the the ratios of them
changed over over time

2952
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:54,720
changed over over time
 

2953
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,270
changed over over time
so yeah so um even in the last 12 years

2954
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:57,280
so yeah so um even in the last 12 years
 

2955
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,589
so yeah so um even in the last 12 years
so we started deep mine in 2010 which is

2956
00:51:59,589 --> 00:51:59,599
so we started deep mine in 2010 which is
 

2957
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,829
so we started deep mine in 2010 which is
hard to imagine now because 2010 it's

2958
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:01,839
hard to imagine now because 2010 it's
 

2959
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,990
hard to imagine now because 2010 it's
only 12 short years ago but nobody was

2960
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,000
only 12 short years ago but nobody was
 

2961
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,750
only 12 short years ago but nobody was
talking about ai uh you know if you

2962
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:05,760
talking about ai uh you know if you
 

2963
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,430
talking about ai uh you know if you
remember back to your mit days you know

2964
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440
remember back to your mit days you know
 

2965
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,870
remember back to your mit days you know
no one was talking about it i did a

2966
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:08,880
no one was talking about it i did a
 

2967
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,430
no one was talking about it i did a
postdoc at mit back around then and it

2968
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:11,440
postdoc at mit back around then and it
 

2969
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,190
postdoc at mit back around then and it
was sort of thought of as a well look we

2970
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,200
was sort of thought of as a well look we
 

2971
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,790
was sort of thought of as a well look we
know ai doesn't work we tried this hard

2972
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:14,800
know ai doesn't work we tried this hard
 

2973
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,430
know ai doesn't work we tried this hard
in the 90s at places like mit mostly

2974
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:17,440
in the 90s at places like mit mostly
 

2975
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,109
in the 90s at places like mit mostly
losing using logic systems and

2976
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:19,119
losing using logic systems and
 

2977
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,710
losing using logic systems and
old-fashioned sort of good old-fashioned

2978
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:20,720
old-fashioned sort of good old-fashioned
 

2979
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,870
old-fashioned sort of good old-fashioned
ai we would call it now um people like

2980
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880
ai we would call it now um people like
 

2981
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,270
ai we would call it now um people like
minsky and and and patrick winston and

2982
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:25,280
minsky and and and patrick winston and
 

2983
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,950
minsky and and and patrick winston and
you know all these characters right and

2984
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:26,960
you know all these characters right and
 

2985
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,390
you know all these characters right and
used to debate a few of them and they

2986
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:28,400
used to debate a few of them and they
 

2987
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,910
used to debate a few of them and they
used to think i was mad thinking about

2988
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:29,920
used to think i was mad thinking about
 

2989
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,430
used to think i was mad thinking about
that some new advance could be done with

2990
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:31,440
that some new advance could be done with
 

2991
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,910
that some new advance could be done with
learning systems and um i was actually

2992
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:33,920
learning systems and um i was actually
 

2993
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,190
learning systems and um i was actually
pleased to hear that because at least

2994
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:35,200
pleased to hear that because at least
 

2995
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,870
pleased to hear that because at least
you know you're on a unique track at

2996
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:36,880
you know you're on a unique track at
 

2997
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,870
you know you're on a unique track at
that point right even if every all of

2998
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:38,880
that point right even if every all of
 

2999
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,549
that point right even if every all of
your you know professors are telling you

3000
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559
your you know professors are telling you
 

3001
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,309
your you know professors are telling you
you're mad that's true and of course in

3002
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:42,319
you're mad that's true and of course in
 

3003
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,470
you're mad that's true and of course in
industry uh you can we couldn't get you

3004
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:44,480
industry uh you can we couldn't get you
 

3005
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,150
industry uh you can we couldn't get you
know as difficult to get two cents

3006
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:46,160
know as difficult to get two cents
 

3007
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,390
know as difficult to get two cents
together uh and which is hard to imagine

3008
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:48,400
together uh and which is hard to imagine
 

3009
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,750
together uh and which is hard to imagine
now as well given it's the biggest sort

3010
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:49,760
now as well given it's the biggest sort
 

3011
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,990
now as well given it's the biggest sort
of buzzword in in vcs and and

3012
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,000
of buzzword in in vcs and and
 

3013
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,589
of buzzword in in vcs and and
fundraising's easy and all these kind of

3014
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:53,599
fundraising's easy and all these kind of
 

3015
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,589
fundraising's easy and all these kind of
things today so

3016
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:55,599
things today so
 

3017
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,670
things today so
back in 2010 it was very difficult and

3018
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:57,680
back in 2010 it was very difficult and
 

3019
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,589
back in 2010 it was very difficult and
what we the reason we started then and

3020
00:52:59,589 --> 00:52:59,599
what we the reason we started then and
 

3021
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,309
what we the reason we started then and
shane and i used to discuss um uh uh

3022
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:02,319
shane and i used to discuss um uh uh
 

3023
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,910
shane and i used to discuss um uh uh
what were the sort of founding tenets of

3024
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:03,920
what were the sort of founding tenets of
 

3025
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,990
what were the sort of founding tenets of
deep mind and it was very various things

3026
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,000
deep mind and it was very various things
 

3027
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,950
deep mind and it was very various things
one was um algorithmic advances so deep

3028
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:08,960
one was um algorithmic advances so deep
 

3029
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,710
one was um algorithmic advances so deep
learning you know jeff hinton and cohen

3030
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:10,720
learning you know jeff hinton and cohen
 

3031
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,390
learning you know jeff hinton and cohen
just had just sort of invented that in

3032
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:12,400
just had just sort of invented that in
 

3033
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,069
just had just sort of invented that in
academia but no one in industry knew

3034
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:14,079
academia but no one in industry knew
 

3035
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,230
academia but no one in industry knew
about it uh we love reinforcement

3036
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:16,240
about it uh we love reinforcement
 

3037
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,670
about it uh we love reinforcement
learning we thought that could be scaled

3038
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:17,680
learning we thought that could be scaled
 

3039
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,349
learning we thought that could be scaled
up but also understanding about the

3040
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:19,359
up but also understanding about the
 

3041
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,829
up but also understanding about the
human brain had advanced um quite a lot

3042
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:21,839
human brain had advanced um quite a lot
 

3043
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,470
human brain had advanced um quite a lot
uh in the decade prior with fmri

3044
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:24,480
uh in the decade prior with fmri
 

3045
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,670
uh in the decade prior with fmri
machines and other things so we could

3046
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:25,680
machines and other things so we could
 

3047
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,710
machines and other things so we could
get some good hints about architectures

3048
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:28,720
get some good hints about architectures
 

3049
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,190
get some good hints about architectures
and algorithms and and sort of um

3050
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,200
and algorithms and and sort of um
 

3051
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,790
and algorithms and and sort of um
representations maybe that the brain

3052
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,800
representations maybe that the brain
 

3053
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,510
representations maybe that the brain
uses so as at a systems level not at a

3054
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:35,520
uses so as at a systems level not at a
 

3055
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,990
uses so as at a systems level not at a
implementation level um and then the

3056
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,000
implementation level um and then the
 

3057
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,630
implementation level um and then the
other big things were compute and gpus

3058
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:40,640
other big things were compute and gpus
 

3059
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,950
other big things were compute and gpus
right so we could see a compute was

3060
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:42,960
right so we could see a compute was
 

3061
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,630
right so we could see a compute was
going to be really useful and it got to

3062
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,640
going to be really useful and it got to
 

3063
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,870
going to be really useful and it got to
a place where it became commoditized

3064
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:46,880
a place where it became commoditized
 

3065
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,710
a place where it became commoditized
mostly through the games industry and

3066
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:48,720
mostly through the games industry and
 

3067
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,710
mostly through the games industry and
and that could be taken advantage of and

3068
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:50,720
and that could be taken advantage of and
 

3069
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,910
and that could be taken advantage of and
then the final thing was also

3070
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:51,920
then the final thing was also
 

3071
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,910
then the final thing was also
mathematical and theoretical definitions

3072
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:53,920
mathematical and theoretical definitions
 

3073
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,430
mathematical and theoretical definitions
of intelligence so things like ai xi aix

3074
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:57,440
of intelligence so things like ai xi aix
 

3075
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,950
of intelligence so things like ai xi aix
which uh shane worked on with his

3076
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:58,960
which uh shane worked on with his
 

3077
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,790
which uh shane worked on with his
supervisor marcus hutter which is a sort

3078
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:00,800
supervisor marcus hutter which is a sort
 

3079
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,430
supervisor marcus hutter which is a sort
of theoretical uh proof really of

3080
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:03,440
of theoretical uh proof really of
 

3081
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,430
of theoretical uh proof really of
universal intelligence um which is

3082
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
universal intelligence um which is
 

3083
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,349
universal intelligence um which is
actually a reinforcement learning system

3084
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:07,359
actually a reinforcement learning system
 

3085
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,109
actually a reinforcement learning system
um in the limit i mean it assumes

3086
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:09,119
um in the limit i mean it assumes
 

3087
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,630
um in the limit i mean it assumes
infinite compute and infinite memory in

3088
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:10,640
infinite compute and infinite memory in
 

3089
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,150
infinite compute and infinite memory in
the way you know like a turing machine

3090
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:12,160
the way you know like a turing machine
 

3091
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,230
the way you know like a turing machine
proof but i was also waiting to see

3092
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240
proof but i was also waiting to see
 

3093
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,549
proof but i was also waiting to see
something like that too to you know like

3094
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:16,559
something like that too to you know like
 

3095
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,030
something like that too to you know like
turing machines uh and and computation

3096
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,040
turing machines uh and and computation
 

3097
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,390
turing machines uh and and computation
theory that people like turing and

3098
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:20,400
theory that people like turing and
 

3099
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,390
theory that people like turing and
shannon came up with underpins modern

3100
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:22,400
shannon came up with underpins modern
 

3101
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,950
shannon came up with underpins modern
computer science um uh you know i was

3102
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:24,960
computer science um uh you know i was
 

3103
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,549
computer science um uh you know i was
waiting for a theory like that to sort

3104
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:26,559
waiting for a theory like that to sort
 

3105
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,349
waiting for a theory like that to sort
of underpin agi research so when i you

3106
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:29,359
of underpin agi research so when i you
 

3107
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,950
of underpin agi research so when i you
know met shane and saw he was working on

3108
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
know met shane and saw he was working on
 

3109
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,470
know met shane and saw he was working on
something like that you know that to me

3110
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:32,480
something like that you know that to me
 

3111
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,470
something like that you know that to me
was a sort of final piece of the jigsaw

3112
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,480
was a sort of final piece of the jigsaw
 

3113
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,430
was a sort of final piece of the jigsaw
so

3114
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:35,440
so
 

3115
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,670
so
in the early days i would say that

3116
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:37,680
in the early days i would say that
 

3117
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,069
in the early days i would say that
ideas were the most important uh you

3118
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,079
ideas were the most important uh you
 

3119
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,030
ideas were the most important uh you
know and for us it was deep

3120
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
know and for us it was deep
 

3121
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,190
know and for us it was deep
reinforcement learning scaling up deep

3122
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:43,200
reinforcement learning scaling up deep
 

3123
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,109
reinforcement learning scaling up deep
learning um of course we've seen

3124
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
learning um of course we've seen
 

3125
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,750
learning um of course we've seen
transformers so huge leaps i would say

3126
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:47,760
transformers so huge leaps i would say
 

3127
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,510
transformers so huge leaps i would say
you know three or four from for if you

3128
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:49,520
you know three or four from for if you
 

3129
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,750
you know three or four from for if you
think from 2010 until now uh huge

3130
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:51,760
think from 2010 until now uh huge
 

3131
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,829
think from 2010 until now uh huge
evolutions things like alphago um and um

3132
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:55,839
evolutions things like alphago um and um
 

3133
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,589
evolutions things like alphago um and um
and and maybe there's a few more still

3134
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:57,599
and and maybe there's a few more still
 

3135
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,390
and and maybe there's a few more still
needed but as we get closer to ai agi um

3136
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
needed but as we get closer to ai agi um
 

3137
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,230
needed but as we get closer to ai agi um
i think engineering becomes more and

3138
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:04,240
i think engineering becomes more and
 

3139
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,870
i think engineering becomes more and
more important and data because scale

3140
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880
more important and data because scale
 

3141
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,549
more important and data because scale
and of course the the recent you know

3142
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:08,559
and of course the the recent you know
 

3143
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,549
and of course the the recent you know
results of gpt3 and all the big language

3144
00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:10,559

3147
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,750

ones uh has shown that scale is a is and

3148
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,760
ones uh has shown that scale is a is and
 

3149
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,589
ones uh has shown that scale is a is and
large models are clearly going to be

3150
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
large models are clearly going to be
 

3151
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,150
large models are clearly going to be
unnecessary but perhaps not sufficient

3152
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:20,160
unnecessary but perhaps not sufficient
 

3153
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,190
unnecessary but perhaps not sufficient

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,750
part of an agi solution and
throughout that like you said and i'd

3156
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:25,760
throughout that like you said and i'd
 

3157
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,270
throughout that like you said and i'd
like to give you a big thank you you're

3158
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:27,280
like to give you a big thank you you're
 

3159

00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:29,920
one of the pioneers in this is
 

3161
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,150
one of the pioneers in this is
sticking by ideas like reinforcement

3162
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,160
sticking by ideas like reinforcement
 

3163
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,950

and talking about solving intelligence

3178
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:49,760
and talking about solving intelligence
 

3179
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,349
and talking about solving intelligence
so talking about whatever you call it

3180
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:51,359
so talking about whatever you call it
 

3181
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,670
so talking about whatever you call it
agi or something like this

3182
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:53,680
agi or something like this
 

3183
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,910
agi or something like this
that speaking of mit that's that's just

3184
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:55,920
that speaking of mit that's that's just
 

3185
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,309
that speaking of mit that's that's just
something not you wouldn't bring up no

3186
00:55:58,309 --> 00:55:58,319
something not you wouldn't bring up no
 

3187
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,470
something not you wouldn't bring up no
uh not not maybe you did in uh like 40

3188
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:02,480
uh not not maybe you did in uh like 40
 

3189
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,990
uh not not maybe you did in uh like 40
50 years ago

3190
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,000
50 years ago
 

3191
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,829
50 years ago
but that was

3192
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:05,839
but that was
 

3193
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,270
but that was
um

3194
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
um
 

3195
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,829
um
ai was a place where you do tinkering

3196
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:09,839
ai was a place where you do tinkering
 

3197
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,390
ai was a place where you do tinkering
very small scale not very ambitious

3198
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:12,400
very small scale not very ambitious
 

3199
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,789
very small scale not very ambitious
projects and

3200
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:14,799
projects and
 

3201
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,549
projects and
maybe the biggest ambitious projects

3202
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:16,559
maybe the biggest ambitious projects
 

3203
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,150
maybe the biggest ambitious projects
were in the space of robotics and doing

3204
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
were in the space of robotics and doing
 

3205
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,829
were in the space of robotics and doing
like the darpa challenge sure but the

3206
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:19,839
like the darpa challenge sure but the
 

3207
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,910
like the darpa challenge sure but the
task of solving intelligence and

3208
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:21,920
task of solving intelligence and
 

3209
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,589
task of solving intelligence and
believing you can

3210
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:23,599
believing you can
 

3211
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,510
believing you can
that's really really powerful so

3212
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:25,520
that's really really powerful so
 

3213
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,829
that's really really powerful so
in order for engineering to do its work

3214
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:27,839
in order for engineering to do its work
 

3215
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,710
in order for engineering to do its work
to have great engineers build great

3216
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:30,720
to have great engineers build great
 

3217
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,549
to have great engineers build great
systems you have to have that belief

3218
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
systems you have to have that belief
 

3219
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,150
systems you have to have that belief
that threats throughout the whole thing

3220
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:34,160
that threats throughout the whole thing
 

3221
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,510
that threats throughout the whole thing
that you can actually solve some of

3222
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:35,520
that you can actually solve some of
 

3223
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,349
that you can actually solve some of
these impossible challenges yeah that's

3224
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:37,359
these impossible challenges yeah that's
 

3225
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,670
these impossible challenges yeah that's
right and and back in 2010 you know our

3226
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:39,680
right and and back in 2010 you know our
 

3227
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,990
right and and back in 2010 you know our
mission statement um and still is today

3228
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:42,000
mission statement um and still is today
 

3229
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,230
mission statement um and still is today
you know it was used to be uh solving

3230
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,240
you know it was used to be uh solving
 

3231
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,470
you know it was used to be uh solving
step one solve intelligence step two use

3232
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,480
step one solve intelligence step two use
 

3233
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,990
step one solve intelligence step two use
it to solve everything else yes so if

3234
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,000
it to solve everything else yes so if
 

3235
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,910
it to solve everything else yes so if
you can imagine pitching that to a vc in

3236
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:49,920
you can imagine pitching that to a vc in
 

3237
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,069
you can imagine pitching that to a vc in
2010 you know the kind of looks we we

3238
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:52,079
2010 you know the kind of looks we we
 

3239
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,390
2010 you know the kind of looks we we
got we managed to you know find a few uh

3240
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
got we managed to you know find a few uh
 

3241
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,870
got we managed to you know find a few uh
kooky people to back us but it was uh it

3242
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:56,880
kooky people to back us but it was uh it
 

3243
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,630
kooky people to back us but it was uh it
was tricky and and i and i got to the

3244
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:58,640
was tricky and and i and i got to the
 

3245
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,230
was tricky and and i and i got to the
point where we we wouldn't mention it to

3246
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,240
point where we we wouldn't mention it to
 

3247
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,150
point where we we wouldn't mention it to
any of our professors because they would

3248
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:02,160
any of our professors because they would
 

3249
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,230
any of our professors because they would
just eye roll and think we you know

3250
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,240
just eye roll and think we you know
 

3251
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,030
just eye roll and think we you know
committed career suicide and and uh and

3252
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,040
committed career suicide and and uh and
 

3253
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,549
committed career suicide and and uh and
and you know so it was there's a lot of

3254
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:08,559
and you know so it was there's a lot of
 

3255
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,710
and you know so it was there's a lot of
things that we had to do but we always

3256
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720
things that we had to do but we always
 

3257
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,789
things that we had to do but we always
believed it and one reason you know by

3258
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:12,799
believed it and one reason you know by
 

3259
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,549
believed it and one reason you know by
the way one reason we i believe i've

3260
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:14,559
the way one reason we i believe i've
 

3261
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,670
the way one reason we i believe i've
always believed in reinforcement

3262
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:15,680
always believed in reinforcement
 

3263
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,349
always believed in reinforcement
learning is that

3264
00:57:17,349 --> 00:57:17,359
learning is that
 

3265
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,430
learning is that
that if you look at neuroscience that is

3266
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:19,440
that if you look at neuroscience that is
 

3267
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,150
that if you look at neuroscience that is
the way that the you know primate brain

3268
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:22,160
the way that the you know primate brain
 

3269
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,910
the way that the you know primate brain
learns one of the main mechanisms is the

3270
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:23,920
learns one of the main mechanisms is the
 

3271
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,670
learns one of the main mechanisms is the
dopamine system implement some form of

00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,589
dopamine system implement some form of
td learning a very famous result in the

3274
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:27,599
td learning a very famous result in the
 

3275
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,390
td learning a very famous result in the
late 90s uh where they saw this in

3276
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:30,400
late 90s uh where they saw this in
 

3277
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,270
late 90s uh where they saw this in
monkeys and uh and as a you know proper

3278
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:33,280
monkeys and uh and as a you know proper
 

3279
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,270
monkeys and uh and as a you know proper
game prediction error so we you know

3280
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
game prediction error so we you know
 

3281
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,349
game prediction error so we you know
again in the limit this is this is what

3282
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
again in the limit this is this is what
 

3283
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,109
again in the limit this is this is what
i think you can use neuroscience for is

3284
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:39,119
i think you can use neuroscience for is
 

3285
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,430
i think you can use neuroscience for is
is you know any at mathematics you when

3286
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
is you know any at mathematics you when
 

3287
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,549
is you know any at mathematics you when
you're when you're doing something as

3288
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:42,559
you're when you're doing something as
 

3289
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,589
you're when you're doing something as
ambitious as trying to solve

3290
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:43,599
ambitious as trying to solve
 

3291
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,270
ambitious as trying to solve
intelligence and you're you're you know

3292
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280
intelligence and you're you're you know
 

3293
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,950
intelligence and you're you're you know
it's blue sky research no one knows how

3294
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:46,960
it's blue sky research no one knows how
 

3295
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,589
it's blue sky research no one knows how
to do it you you you need to use any

3296
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:49,599
to do it you you you need to use any
 

3297
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,270
to do it you you you need to use any
evidence or any source of information

3298
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,280
evidence or any source of information
 

3299
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,670
evidence or any source of information
you can to help guide you in the right

3300
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:53,680
you can to help guide you in the right
 

3301
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,190
you can to help guide you in the right
direction or give you confidence you're

3302
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:55,200
direction or give you confidence you're
 

3303
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,270
direction or give you confidence you're
going in the right direction so so that

3304
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:57,280
going in the right direction so so that
 

3305
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,270
going in the right direction so so that
that was one reason we pushed so hard on

3306
00:57:59,270 --> 00:57:59,280
that was one reason we pushed so hard on
 

3307
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,030
that was one reason we pushed so hard on
that and that's and just going back to

3308
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:01,040
that and that's and just going back to
 

3309
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,030
that and that's and just going back to
your early question about organization

3310
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:03,040
your early question about organization
 

3311
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,630
your early question about organization
the other big thing that i think we

3312
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:04,640
the other big thing that i think we
 

3313
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,190
the other big thing that i think we
innovated with at deepmind to encourage

3314
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,200
innovated with at deepmind to encourage
 

3315
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,390
innovated with at deepmind to encourage
invention and and uh and innovation was

3316
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:10,400
invention and and uh and innovation was
 

3317
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,309
invention and and uh and innovation was
the multi-disciplinary organization we

3318
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:12,319
the multi-disciplinary organization we
 

3319
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,549
the multi-disciplinary organization we
built and we still have today so

3320
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,559
built and we still have today so
 

3321
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,710
built and we still have today so
deepmind originally was a confluence of

3322
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:16,720
deepmind originally was a confluence of
 

3323
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,309
deepmind originally was a confluence of
the of the most cutting-edge knowledge

3324
00:58:18,309 --> 00:58:18,319
the of the most cutting-edge knowledge
 

3325
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,870
the of the most cutting-edge knowledge
in neuroscience with machine learning

3326
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:20,880
in neuroscience with machine learning
 

3327
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,030
in neuroscience with machine learning
engineering and mathematics right and

3328
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:23,040
engineering and mathematics right and
 

3329
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,230
engineering and mathematics right and
and gaming

3330
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
and gaming
 

3331
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,750
and gaming
and then since then we built that out

3332
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:25,760
and then since then we built that out
 

3333
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,589
and then since then we built that out
even further so we have philosophers

3334
00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:27,599
even further so we have philosophers
 

3335
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,069
even further so we have philosophers
here and and uh by you know ethicists

3336
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:30,079
here and and uh by you know ethicists
 

3337
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,589
here and and uh by you know ethicists
but also other types of scientists

3338
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
but also other types of scientists
 

3339
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,069
but also other types of scientists
physicists and so on um and that's what

3340
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:34,079
physicists and so on um and that's what
 

3341
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,990
physicists and so on um and that's what
brings together i tried to build a sort

3342
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
brings together i tried to build a sort
 

3343
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,030
brings together i tried to build a sort
of um new type of bell labs but in this

3344
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:39,040
of um new type of bell labs but in this
 

3345
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,109
of um new type of bell labs but in this
golden era right uh

3346
00:58:41,109 --> 00:58:41,119
golden era right uh
 

3347
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,829
golden era right uh
and and a new expression of that um to

3348
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:43,839
and and a new expression of that um to
 

3349
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,630
and and a new expression of that um to
try and uh foster this incredible sort

3350
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:46,640
try and uh foster this incredible sort
 

3351

if we return to

3364
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:02,240
if we return to

the big ambitious dream of alpha fold

3366
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:04,799
the big ambitious dream of alpha fold
 

3367
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,190
the big ambitious dream of alpha fold
that may be the early steps on a very

3368
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:07,200
that may be the early steps on a very
 

3369
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,510
that may be the early steps on a very
long journey in um

3370
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:09,520
long journey in um
 

3371
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,470
long journey in um
in biology

3372
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:12,480

 

3373
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,069

do you think the same kind of approach

3374
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:14,079
do you think the same kind of approach
 

3375
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,750
do you think the same kind of approach
can use to predict the structure and

3376
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:15,760
can use to predict the structure and
 

3377
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,670
can use to predict the structure and
function of more complex biological

3378
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,680
function of more complex biological
 

3379
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,349
function of more complex biological
systems so multi-protein interaction

3380
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:21,359
systems so multi-protein interaction
 

3381
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:22,549
systems so multi-protein interaction
and then

3382
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:22,559
and then
 

3383
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,549
and then
i mean you can go out from there just

3384
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:24,559
i mean you can go out from there just
 

3385
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,710
i mean you can go out from there just
simulating bigger and bigger systems

3386
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:26,720
simulating bigger and bigger systems
 

3387
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,549
simulating bigger and bigger systems
that eventually simulate something like

3388
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
that eventually simulate something like
 

3389
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:31,349
that eventually simulate something like
the human brain or the human body just

3390
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:31,359
the human brain or the human body just

resilient mesobiology do do you see that

3394
00:59:37,589 --> 00:59:37,599
resilient mesobiology do do you see that
 

3395
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,470
resilient mesobiology do do you see that
as a long-term vision i do and i think

3396
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:40,480
as a long-term vision i do and i think
 

3397
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,270
as a long-term vision i do and i think
um

3398
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:41,280
um
 

3399
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,789
um
you know if you think about what are the

3400
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:42,799
you know if you think about what are the
 

3401
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,870
you know if you think about what are the
things top things i wanted to apply ai

3402
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:44,880
things top things i wanted to apply ai
 

3403
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,510
things top things i wanted to apply ai
ai2 once we had powerful enough systems

3404
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
ai2 once we had powerful enough systems
 

3405
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,910
ai2 once we had powerful enough systems
biology and curing diseases and

biology and curing diseases and
 

3407
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,630
biology and curing diseases and
understanding biology uh was right up

3408
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:52,640
understanding biology uh was right up
 

3409
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,309
understanding biology uh was right up
there you know top of my list that's one

3410
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
there you know top of my list that's one
 

3411
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,990
there you know top of my list that's one
of the reasons i personally pushed that

3412
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:56,000
of the reasons i personally pushed that
 

3413
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,230
of the reasons i personally pushed that
myself and with alpha fold but i think

3414
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,240
myself and with alpha fold but i think
 

3415
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,430
myself and with alpha fold but i think
alpha fold uh amazing as it is is just

3416
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:01,440
alpha fold uh amazing as it is is just
 

3417
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,710
alpha fold uh amazing as it is is just
the beginning um and and and i hope it's

3418
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:04,720
the beginning um and and and i hope it's
 

3419
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,190
the beginning um and and and i hope it's
evidence of uh what could be done with

3420
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:07,200
evidence of uh what could be done with
 

3421
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,150
evidence of uh what could be done with
computational methods so um you know

3422
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
computational methods so um you know
 

3423
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,990
computational methods so um you know
alpha fold solve this this huge problem

3424
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:12,000
alpha fold solve this this huge problem
 

3425
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,230
alpha fold solve this this huge problem
of the structure of proteins but biology

3426
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:14,240
of the structure of proteins but biology
 

3427
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,549
of the structure of proteins but biology
is dynamic so really what i imagine from

3428
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:16,559
is dynamic so really what i imagine from
 

3429
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:17,990
is dynamic so really what i imagine from
here we're working on all these things

3430
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,000
here we're working on all these things
 

3431
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,270
here we're working on all these things
now is protein protein interaction uh

3432
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:21,280
now is protein protein interaction uh
 

3433
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,990
now is protein protein interaction uh
protein ligand binding so reacting with

3434
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:24,000
protein ligand binding so reacting with
 

3435
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,150
protein ligand binding so reacting with
molecules um then you want to get build

3436
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,160
molecules um then you want to get build
 

3437
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,950
molecules um then you want to get build
up to pathways and then eventually a

3438
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:28,960
up to pathways and then eventually a
 

3439
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,510
up to pathways and then eventually a

01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,309
winning biologist we've been discussing
for 20 years now virtual cells could you

3452
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:42,319
for 20 years now virtual cells could you
 

3453
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,710
for 20 years now virtual cells could you
build a virtual simulation of a cell and

3454
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:44,720
build a virtual simulation of a cell and
 

3455
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,150
build a virtual simulation of a cell and
if you could that would be incredible

3456
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,160
if you could that would be incredible
 

3457
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,910
if you could that would be incredible
for biology and disease discovery

3458
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:47,920
for biology and disease discovery
 

3459
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,870
for biology and disease discovery
because you could do loads of

3460
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:48,880
because you could do loads of
 

3461
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,030
because you could do loads of
experiments on the virtual cell and then

3462
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:51,040
experiments on the virtual cell and then
 

3463
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,950
experiments on the virtual cell and then
only at the last stage validate it in

3464
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
only at the last stage validate it in
 

3465
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,190
only at the last stage validate it in
the wet lab so you could you know in

3466
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:55,200
the wet lab so you could you know in
 

3467
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,870
the wet lab so you could you know in

new drugs you know it takes 10 years

3470
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
new drugs you know it takes 10 years
 

3471
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,349
new drugs you know it takes 10 years
roughly to go from uh uh to to go from

01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
roughly to go from uh uh to to go from
 

3473
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,549
roughly to go from uh uh to to go from
uh you know identifying a target to uh

3474
01:01:04,549 --> 01:01:04,559
uh you know identifying a target to uh
 

3475
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,710
uh you know identifying a target to uh
having a drug candidate um maybe that

3476
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:06,720
having a drug candidate um maybe that
 

3477
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,150
having a drug candidate um maybe that
could be shortened to you know by an

3478
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:08,160
could be shortened to you know by an
 

3479
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,230
could be shortened to you know by an
order of magnitude with if you could do

3480
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:10,240
order of magnitude with if you could do
 

3481
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,430
order of magnitude with if you could do
most of that that that work in silico so

3482
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,440
most of that that that work in silico so
 

3483
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,589
most of that that that work in silico so
in order to get to a virtual cell

3484
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:15,599
in order to get to a virtual cell
 

3485
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,230
in order to get to a virtual cell
we have to build up uh uh understanding

3486
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
we have to build up uh uh understanding
 

3487
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,589
we have to build up uh uh understanding
of different parts of biology and the

3488
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:19,599
of different parts of biology and the
 

3489
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:22,150
of different parts of biology and the
interactions and and um so you know

3490
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:22,160
interactions and and um so you know
 

3491
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,990
interactions and and um so you know
every every few years we talk about this

3492
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
every every few years we talk about this
 

3493
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,510
every every few years we talk about this
with i talked about this with paul and

3494
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:25,520
with i talked about this with paul and
 

3495
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,670

then finally last year after alpha fault

3496
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,680
then finally last year after alpha fault
 

3497
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,990
then finally last year after alpha fault
i said now is the time we can finally go

3498
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:30,000
i said now is the time we can finally go
 

3499
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,670
i said now is the time we can finally go
for it and and alpha falls the first

3500
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:31,680
for it and and alpha falls the first
 

3501
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,589
for it and and alpha falls the first
proof point that this might be possible

3502
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
proof point that this might be possible
 

3503
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:34,950
proof point that this might be possible
uh and he's very excited when we have

3504
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:34,960
uh and he's very excited when we have
 

3505
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,630
uh and he's very excited when we have
some collaborations with his with his

3515
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:45,829
quick institute across the road and um
and i think the next steps you know i

3516
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:45,839
and i think the next steps you know i
 

3517
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,270
and i think the next steps you know i
think there's going to be some amazing

3518
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:47,280
think there's going to be some amazing
 

3519
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,109

advances in biology built on top of
 

3521
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,190
advances in biology built on top of
things like alpha fold uh we're already

3522
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,200
things like alpha fold uh we're already
 

3523
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,710
things like alpha fold uh we're already
seeing that with the community doing

3524
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:52,720
seeing that with the community doing
 

3525
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,150
seeing that with the community doing
that after we've open sourced it and

3526
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
that after we've open sourced it and
 

3527
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,589
that after we've open sourced it and
released it um and uh you know i also i

3528
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:57,599
released it um and uh you know i also i
 

3529
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,589
released it um and uh you know i also i
often say that i think

3530
01:01:59,589 --> 01:01:59,599
often say that i think
 

3531
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,390
often say that i think
uh if you think of mathematics is the

3532
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:02,400
uh if you think of mathematics is the
 

3533
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,950
uh if you think of mathematics is the
perfect description language for physics

3534
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:04,960
perfect description language for physics
 

3535
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,710
perfect description language for physics
i think ai might be end up being the

3536
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:06,720
i think ai might be end up being the
 

3537
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,109
i think ai might be end up being the
perfect description language for biology

3538
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:09,119
perfect description language for biology
 

3539
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:10,069
perfect description language for biology
because

3540
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:10,079
because
 

3541
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,109
because
biology is so messy it's so emergent so

3542
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:13,119
biology is so messy it's so emergent so
 

3543
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,829
biology is so messy it's so emergent so
dynamic and complex um i think i find it

3544
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:15,839
dynamic and complex um i think i find it
 

3545
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,510
dynamic and complex um i think i find it
very hard to believe we'll ever get to

3546
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:17,520
very hard to believe we'll ever get to
 

3547
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,270
very hard to believe we'll ever get to
something as elegant as newton's laws of

3548
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,280
something as elegant as newton's laws of
 

3549
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,670
something as elegant as newton's laws of
motions to describe a cell right it's

3550
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:21,680
motions to describe a cell right it's
 

3551
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,470
motions to describe a cell right it's
just too complicated um so i think ai is

3552
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
just too complicated um so i think ai is
 

3553
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,870
just too complicated um so i think ai is
the right tool for this you have to uh

3554
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:26,880
the right tool for this you have to uh
 

3555
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,390
the right tool for this you have to uh
you have to start at the basic building

3556
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:28,400
you have to start at the basic building
 

3557
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,349
you have to start at the basic building
blocks and use ai to run the simulation

3558
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
blocks and use ai to run the simulation
 

3559
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,990
blocks and use ai to run the simulation
for all those building blocks so have a

3560
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:34,000
for all those building blocks so have a
 

3561
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,470
for all those building blocks so have a
very strong way to do prediction of what

3562
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:36,480
very strong way to do prediction of what
 

3563
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,910
very strong way to do prediction of what
given these building blocks what kind of

3564
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:37,920
given these building blocks what kind of
 

3565
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,190
given these building blocks what kind of
biology how the

3566
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:39,200
biology how the
 

3567
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,630
biology how the
the function

3568
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:40,640
the function
 

3569
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,470
the function
and the evolution of that biological

3570
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:42,480
and the evolution of that biological
 

3571
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,430
and the evolution of that biological
system

3572
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:43,440
system
 

3573
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,270
system
it's almost like a cellular automata you

3574
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,280
it's almost like a cellular automata you
 

3575
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,190
it's almost like a cellular automata you
have to run you can't analyze it from a

3576
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:47,200
have to run you can't analyze it from a
 

3577
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,109
have to run you can't analyze it from a
high level you have to take the basic

3578
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
high level you have to take the basic
 

3579
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:51,029
high level you have to take the basic
ingredients figure out the rules yeah

3580
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:51,039
ingredients figure out the rules yeah
 

3581
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:52,710
ingredients figure out the rules yeah
and let it run but in this case the

3582
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:52,720
and let it run but in this case the
 

3583
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,470
and let it run but in this case the
rules are very difficult to figure out

3584
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:54,480
rules are very difficult to figure out
 

3585
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,950
rules are very difficult to figure out
yes yes learn them that's exactly it so

3586
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960
yes yes learn them that's exactly it so
 

3587
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,190
yes yes learn them that's exactly it so
it's the biology is too complicated to

3588
01:02:59,190 --> 01:02:59,200
it's the biology is too complicated to
 

3589
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,750
it's the biology is too complicated to
figure out the rules it's it's it's too

3590
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
figure out the rules it's it's it's too
 

3591
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,230
figure out the rules it's it's it's too
emergent too dynamic say compared to a

3592
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:04,240
emergent too dynamic say compared to a
 

3593
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,829
emergent too dynamic say compared to a
physics system like the motion of a

3594
01:03:05,829 --> 01:03:05,839
physics system like the motion of a
 

3595
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:08,309
physics system like the motion of a
planet yeah right and and so you have to

3596
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:08,319
planet yeah right and and so you have to
 

3597
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:09,829
planet yeah right and and so you have to
learn the rules and that's exactly the

3598
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:09,839
learn the rules and that's exactly the
 

3599
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,910
learn the rules and that's exactly the
type of systems that we're building so

3600
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:11,920
type of systems that we're building so
 

3601
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,349
type of systems that we're building so
you you mentioned you've open sourced

3602
01:03:13,349 --> 01:03:13,359
you you mentioned you've open sourced
 

3603
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:16,390
you you mentioned you've open sourced
alpha fold and even the data involved

3604
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
alpha fold and even the data involved
 

3605
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,190
alpha fold and even the data involved
to me personally also

3606
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,200
to me personally also
 

3607
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,029
to me personally also
really happy and a big thank you for

3608
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
really happy and a big thank you for
 

3609
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,950
really happy and a big thank you for
open sourcing mijoko

3610
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
open sourcing mijoko
 

3611
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,750
open sourcing mijoko
uh the physics simulation engine that's

3612
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:25,760
uh the physics simulation engine that's
 

3613
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,990
uh the physics simulation engine that's
that's often used for robotics research

3614
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:28,000
that's often used for robotics research
 

3615
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,829
that's often used for robotics research
and so on so i think that's a pretty

3616
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:29,839
and so on so i think that's a pretty
 

3617
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,109
and so on so i think that's a pretty
gangster move uh so what what's the

3618
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:33,119
gangster move uh so what what's the
 

3619
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,190
gangster move uh so what what's the
what's i mean this uh

3620
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:35,200
what's i mean this uh
 

3621
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:38,230
what's i mean this uh
very few companies or people would do

3622
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:38,240
very few companies or people would do
 

3623
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,069
very few companies or people would do
that kind of thing what's the philosophy

3624
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
that kind of thing what's the philosophy
 

3625
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,309
that kind of thing what's the philosophy
behind that you know it's a case-by-case

3626
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319
behind that you know it's a case-by-case
 

3627
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,390
behind that you know it's a case-by-case
basis and in both those cases we felt

3628
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:44,400
basis and in both those cases we felt
 

3629
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,630
basis and in both those cases we felt
that was the maximum benefit to humanity

3630
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,640
that was the maximum benefit to humanity
 

3631
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,309
that was the maximum benefit to humanity
to do that and and the scientific

3632
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
to do that and and the scientific
 

3633
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,190
to do that and and the scientific
community in one case the robotics uh

3634
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:51,200
community in one case the robotics uh
 

3635
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,270
community in one case the robotics uh
physics community with mojoco so

3636
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:53,280
physics community with mojoco so
 

3637
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,109
physics community with mojoco so
purchased it we purchased

3638
01:03:55,109 --> 01:03:55,119
purchased it we purchased
 

3639
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,029
purchased it we purchased
to obs we purchased it for the express

3640
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
to obs we purchased it for the express
 

3641
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,270
to obs we purchased it for the express
principle to open source it so

3642
01:03:59,270 --> 01:03:59,280
principle to open source it so
 

3643
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,870
principle to open source it so
um so

3644
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:00,880
um so
 

3645
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,309
um so
you know i hope people appreciate that

3646
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:02,319
you know i hope people appreciate that
 

3647
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,309
you know i hope people appreciate that
it's great to hear that you do and then

3648
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:04,319
it's great to hear that you do and then
 

3649
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,470
it's great to hear that you do and then
the second thing was and mostly we did

3650
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
the second thing was and mostly we did
 

3651
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,789
the second thing was and mostly we did
it because the person building it is uh

3652
01:04:08,789 --> 01:04:08,799
it because the person building it is uh
 

3653
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,710
it because the person building it is uh
uh would not it was not able to cope

3654
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:10,720
uh would not it was not able to cope
 

3655
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:11,990
uh would not it was not able to cope
with supporting it anymore because it

3656
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:12,000
with supporting it anymore because it
 

3657
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,990
with supporting it anymore because it
was it got too big for him his amazing

3658
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,000
was it got too big for him his amazing
 

3659
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,150
was it got too big for him his amazing
professor uh who who built it in the

3660
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:16,160
professor uh who who built it in the
 

3661
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,510
professor uh who who built it in the
first place so we helped him out with

3662
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
first place so we helped him out with
 

3663
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,109
first place so we helped him out with
that and then with alpha folds even

3664
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:19,119
that and then with alpha folds even
 

3665
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,190
that and then with alpha folds even
bigger i would say and i think in that

3666
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,200
bigger i would say and i think in that
 

3667
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,990
bigger i would say and i think in that
case we decided that there were so many

3668
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,000
case we decided that there were so many
 

3669
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,270
case we decided that there were so many
downstream applications of alpha fold um

3670
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:27,280
downstream applications of alpha fold um
 

3671
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,270
downstream applications of alpha fold um
that we couldn't possibly even imagine

3672
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,280
that we couldn't possibly even imagine
 

3673
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,670
that we couldn't possibly even imagine
what they all were so the best way to

3674
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:31,680
what they all were so the best way to
 

3675
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,870
what they all were so the best way to
accelerate uh drug discovery and also

3676
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:34,880
accelerate uh drug discovery and also
 

3677
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,150
accelerate uh drug discovery and also
fundamental research would be to to um

3678
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:38,160
fundamental research would be to to um
 

3679
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,390
fundamental research would be to to um
give all that data away and and and the

3680
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,400
give all that data away and and and the
 

3681
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,190
give all that data away and and and the
and the and the system itself um you

3682
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:43,200
and the and the system itself um you
 

3683
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,270
and the and the system itself um you
know it's been so gratifying to see what

3684
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
know it's been so gratifying to see what
 

3685
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,710
know it's been so gratifying to see what
people have done that within just one

3686
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:46,720
people have done that within just one
 

3687
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,309
people have done that within just one
year which is a short amount of time in

3688
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:48,319
year which is a short amount of time in
 

3689
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,510
year which is a short amount of time in
science and uh it's been used by

3690
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:51,520
science and uh it's been used by
 

3691
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,150
science and uh it's been used by
over 500 000 researchers have used it we

3692
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:54,160
over 500 000 researchers have used it we
 

3693
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,750
over 500 000 researchers have used it we
think that's almost every biologist in

3694
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:55,760
think that's almost every biologist in
 

3695
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,589
think that's almost every biologist in
the world i think there's roughly 500

we've seen amazing fundamental research

3704
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,160
we've seen amazing fundamental research

had the nuclear pore complex on it which
 

3713
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,349
had the nuclear pore complex on it which
is one of the biggest proteins in the

01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:15,359
is one of the biggest proteins in the
 

3715
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,510
is one of the biggest proteins in the
body the nuclear poor complex is a

going in and out of your cell nucleus so

3720
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:22,079
going in and out of your cell nucleus so
 

3721
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,589
going in and out of your cell nucleus so
they're like little hole gateways that

3722

they're like little hole gateways that
 

3723
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,829
they're like little hole gateways that
open and close to let things go in and

3724

open and close to let things go in and
 

3725
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:27,430
open and close to let things go in and
out of your cell nucleus so they're

3726
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440
out of your cell nucleus so they're
 

3727
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,190
out of your cell nucleus so they're
really important but they're huge

to try and figure out that structure for
 

3735
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,069
to try and figure out that structure for
decades and they have lots of you know

decades and they have lots of you know
 

3737
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,750

01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
using alpha fault predictions so that's
 

3757
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,150
using alpha fault predictions so that's
been amazing to see and pretty much

3758

their teams are using alpha fold to
 

3765
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,870
their teams are using alpha fold to
accelerate whatever drugs uh uh they're

3766
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
accelerate whatever drugs uh uh they're
 

3767
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,470
accelerate whatever drugs uh uh they're
trying to discover so i think the

3768
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:08,480
trying to discover so i think the
 

3769
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,510
trying to discover so i think the
knock-on effect has been enormous in

terms of uh the impact that uh
 

3773
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,589
terms of uh the impact that uh
alpha-fold has made and it's probably

3774
01:06:15,589 --> 01:06:15,599
alpha-fold has made and it's probably
 

3775
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,670
alpha-fold has made and it's probably
bringing in it's creating biologists

3777
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,910

it's bringing more people into the field
um

3780
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:20,720
um
 

3781
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,390
um
both on the excitement and both on the

3782
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:22,400
both on the excitement and both on the
 

3783
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,390
both on the excitement and both on the
technical skills involved

3784
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:24,400
technical skills involved
 

3785
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,430
technical skills involved
and um

3786
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:25,440
and um
 

3787
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,910
and um
it's almost like uh a gateway drug to

3788
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:27,920
it's almost like uh a gateway drug to
 

3789
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,990
it's almost like uh a gateway drug to
biology yes it is you get more

3790
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,000
biology yes it is you get more
 

3791
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,589
biology yes it is you get more
computational people involved too

3792
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:31,599
computational people involved too
 

3793
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,910
computational people involved too
hopefully and and i think for us you

3794
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:33,920
hopefully and and i think for us you
 

3795
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,750
hopefully and and i think for us you
know the next stage as i said you know

3796
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
know the next stage as i said you know
 

3797
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,029
know the next stage as i said you know
in future we have to have other

3798
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:37,039
in future we have to have other
 

3799
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,710
in future we have to have other
considerations too we're building on top

3800
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:38,720
considerations too we're building on top
 

3801
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,470
considerations too we're building on top
of alpha fold and these other ideas i

3802
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:40,480
of alpha fold and these other ideas i
 

3803
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,990
of alpha fold and these other ideas i
discussed with you about protein protein

3804
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,000
discussed with you about protein protein
 

3805
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,150
discussed with you about protein protein
interactions and and genomics and other

3806
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:44,160
interactions and and genomics and other
 

3807
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,829
interactions and and genomics and other
things and not everything will be open

3808
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
things and not everything will be open
 

3809
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,270
things and not everything will be open
source some of it will will do

3810
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:47,280
source some of it will will do
 

3811
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,470
source some of it will will do
commercially because that will be the

3812
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,480
commercially because that will be the
 

3813
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,829
commercially because that will be the
best way to actually get the most

3814
01:06:49,829 --> 01:06:49,839
best way to actually get the most
 

3815
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,910
best way to actually get the most
resources and impact behind it in other

3816
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:51,920
resources and impact behind it in other
 

3817
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,750
resources and impact behind it in other
ways some other projects will do

3818
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:53,760
ways some other projects will do
 

3819
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,390
ways some other projects will do
non-profit style um and also we have to

3820
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:56,400
non-profit style um and also we have to
 

3821
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,470
non-profit style um and also we have to
consider for future things as well

3822
01:06:58,470 --> 01:06:58,480
consider for future things as well
 

3823
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,069
consider for future things as well
safety and ethics as well like but you

3824
01:07:00,069 --> 01:07:00,079
safety and ethics as well like but you
 

3825
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,069
safety and ethics as well like but you
know synthetic biology there are you

3826
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:02,079
know synthetic biology there are you
 

3827
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,069
know synthetic biology there are you
know there is dual use and we have to

3828
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
know there is dual use and we have to
 

3829
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,750
know there is dual use and we have to
think about that as well with alpha fold

3830
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:05,760
think about that as well with alpha fold
 

3831
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,430
think about that as well with alpha fold
we you know we consulted with 30

3832
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,440
we you know we consulted with 30
 

3833
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,109
we you know we consulted with 30
different bioethicists and and other

3834
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:09,119
different bioethicists and and other
 

3835
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,549
different bioethicists and and other
people expert in this field to make sure

3836
01:07:10,549 --> 01:07:10,559
people expert in this field to make sure
 

3837
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,589
people expert in this field to make sure
it was safe before um we released it so

3838
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:13,599
it was safe before um we released it so
 

3839
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:14,870
it was safe before um we released it so
there'll be other considerations in

3840
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:14,880
there'll be other considerations in
 

3841
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,230
there'll be other considerations in
future but for right now you know i

3842
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:16,240
future but for right now you know i
 

3843
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,230
future but for right now you know i
think alpha fold is a kind of a gift

3844
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
think alpha fold is a kind of a gift
 

3845
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,069
think alpha fold is a kind of a gift
from us to to to the scientific

3846
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
from us to to to the scientific
 

3847
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,069
from us to to to the scientific
community so i'm pretty sure

3848
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
community so i'm pretty sure
 

3849
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:22,870
community so i'm pretty sure
that

3850
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:22,880
that
 

3851
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,190
that
something like alpha fold

3852
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:25,200
something like alpha fold
 

3853
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,829
something like alpha fold
uh would be part of nobel prizes in the

3854
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:27,839
uh would be part of nobel prizes in the
 

3855
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:29,029
uh would be part of nobel prizes in the
future

3856
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
future
 

3857
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,349
future
but us humans of course are horrible

3858
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:31,359
but us humans of course are horrible
 

3859
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:32,870
but us humans of course are horrible
with credit assignment so we'll of

3860
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:32,880
with credit assignment so we'll of
 

3861
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:35,510
with credit assignment so we'll of
course give it to the humans

3862
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:35,520
course give it to the humans
 

3863
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,510
course give it to the humans
do you think there will be a day

3864
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:37,520
do you think there will be a day
 

3865
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,710
do you think there will be a day
when ai system

3866
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:40,720
when ai system
 

3867
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,470
when ai system
can't be denied

3868
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:42,480
can't be denied
 

3869
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,190
can't be denied
that it earned that nobel prize do you

3870
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:45,200
that it earned that nobel prize do you
 

3871
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,430
that it earned that nobel prize do you
think we'll see that in 21st century it

3872
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,440
think we'll see that in 21st century it
 

3873
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,190
think we'll see that in 21st century it
depends what type of ais we end up

3874
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:49,200
depends what type of ais we end up
 

3875
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,069
depends what type of ais we end up
building right whether they're um

3876
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:52,079
building right whether they're um
 

3877
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:53,670
building right whether they're um
you know goal seeking agents who

3878
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:53,680
you know goal seeking agents who
 

3879
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,390
you know goal seeking agents who
specifies the goals uh who comes up with

3880
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:56,400
specifies the goals uh who comes up with
 

3881
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,750
specifies the goals uh who comes up with
the hypotheses

3882
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:57,760
the hypotheses
 

3883
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,029
the hypotheses
who you know who determines which

3884
01:07:59,029 --> 01:07:59,039
who you know who determines which
 

3885
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,270
who you know who determines which
problems to tackle right so i think it's

3886
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:01,280
problems to tackle right so i think it's
 

3887
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,950
problems to tackle right so i think it's
about an announcement yeah so it's

3888
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:02,960
about an announcement yeah so it's
 

3889
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,870
about an announcement yeah so it's
announcing the results exactly as part

3890
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:04,880
announcing the results exactly as part
 

3891
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,670
announcing the results exactly as part
of it um so i think right now of course

3892
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:07,680
of it um so i think right now of course
 

3893
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,230
of it um so i think right now of course
it's it's it's it's amazing human

3894
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:10,240
it's it's it's it's amazing human
 

3895
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:12,069
it's it's it's it's amazing human
ingenuity that's behind these systems

3896
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:12,079
ingenuity that's behind these systems
 

3897
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,589
ingenuity that's behind these systems
and then the system in my opinion is

3898
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:13,599
and then the system in my opinion is
 

3899
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,670
and then the system in my opinion is
just a tool you know it'd be a bit like

3900
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:15,680
just a tool you know it'd be a bit like
 

3901
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,990
just a tool you know it'd be a bit like
saying with galileo and his telescope

3902
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,000
saying with galileo and his telescope
 

3903
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,669
saying with galileo and his telescope
you know the ingenuity the the the

3904
01:08:19,669 --> 01:08:19,679
you know the ingenuity the the the
 

3905
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,349
you know the ingenuity the the the
credit should go to the telescope i mean

3906
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
credit should go to the telescope i mean
 

3907
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,430
credit should go to the telescope i mean
it's clearly galileo building the tool

3908
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:23,440
it's clearly galileo building the tool
 

3909
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,110
it's clearly galileo building the tool
which he then uses

3910
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:25,120
which he then uses
 

3911
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,870
which he then uses
so i still see that in the same way

3912
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
so i still see that in the same way
 

3913
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,950
so i still see that in the same way
today even though these tools learn for

3914
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:28,960
today even though these tools learn for
 

3915
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,829
today even though these tools learn for
themselves um they're i think i think of

3916
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:31,839
themselves um they're i think i think of
 

3917
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,510
themselves um they're i think i think of
things like alpha fold and that the

3918
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520
things like alpha fold and that the
 

3919
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,110
things like alpha fold and that the
things we're building as the ultimate

3920
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:35,120
things we're building as the ultimate
 

3921
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,149
things we're building as the ultimate
tools for science and for acquiring new

3922
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:38,159
tools for science and for acquiring new
 

3923
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:39,669
tools for science and for acquiring new
knowledge to help us as scientists

3924
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
knowledge to help us as scientists
 

3925
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,070
knowledge to help us as scientists
acquire new knowledge i think one day

3926
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,080
acquire new knowledge i think one day
 

3927
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,309
acquire new knowledge i think one day
there will come a point where

3928
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
there will come a point where
 

3929
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,870
there will come a point where
an ai system may solve or come up with

3930
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:46,880
an ai system may solve or come up with
 

3931
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,030
an ai system may solve or come up with
something like general relativity of its

3932
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:49,040
something like general relativity of its
 

3933
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,110
something like general relativity of its
own bat not just by

3934
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,120
own bat not just by
 

3935
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,630
own bat not just by
averaging everything on the internet or

3936
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
averaging everything on the internet or
 

3937
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,030
averaging everything on the internet or
averaging everything on pubmed

3938
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:55,040
averaging everything on pubmed
 

3939
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,990
averaging everything on pubmed
although that would be interesting to

3940
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:56,000
although that would be interesting to
 

3941
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,470
although that would be interesting to
see what that would come up with um so

3942
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:58,480
see what that would come up with um so
 

3943
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,990
see what that would come up with um so
that to me is a bit like our earlier

3944
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:00,000
that to me is a bit like our earlier
 

3945
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,990
that to me is a bit like our earlier
debate about creativity you know

3946
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:02,000
debate about creativity you know
 

3947
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,630

inventing go rather than just coming up

3948
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:04,640
inventing go rather than just coming up
 

3949
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,229
inventing go rather than just coming up
with a good go move and um so i think uh

3950
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:08,239
with a good go move and um so i think uh
 

3951
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,470
with a good go move and um so i think uh
solving i think to to you know if we

3952
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
solving i think to to you know if we
 

3953
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,309
solving i think to to you know if we
wanted to give it the credit of like a

3954
01:09:12,309 --> 01:09:12,319
wanted to give it the credit of like a
 

3955
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,910
wanted to give it the credit of like a
nobel type of thing then it would need

3956
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
nobel type of thing then it would need
 

3957
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,630
nobel type of thing then it would need
to invent go uh and sort of invent that

3958
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:16,640
to invent go uh and sort of invent that
 

3959
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,590
to invent go uh and sort of invent that
new conjecture out of the blue um rather

3960
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:19,600
new conjecture out of the blue um rather
 

3961
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,070
new conjecture out of the blue um rather
than being specified by the the human

3962
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:22,080
than being specified by the the human
 

3963
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,669
than being specified by the the human
scientists or the human creators so i

3964
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:23,679
scientists or the human creators so i
 

3965
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,430
scientists or the human creators so i
think right now that's it's definitely

3966
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
think right now that's it's definitely
 

3967
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,110
think right now that's it's definitely
just a tool although it is interesting

how far you get by averaging everything

3970
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:28,719
how far you get by averaging everything
 

3971
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,470
how far you get by averaging everything
on the internet like you said because

3972
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:30,480
on the internet like you said because
 

3973
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,510
on the internet like you said because
you know

reaching
 

3985
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,229

think um
this is one of the big mysteries i think

01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:08,880
this is one of the big mysteries i think
 

4015
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,149
this is one of the big mysteries i think
is that uh

is that uh
 

4017
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,390
is that uh
uh i i first of all i believe a lot of

01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:15,520
to come in the next few decades and even
 

4023
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,350
to come in the next few decades and even
in the last decade are going to come at

4024
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:17,360
in the last decade are going to come at
 

4025
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,790
in the last decade are going to come at
the intersection between different

4026
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:18,800
the intersection between different
 

4027
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,510
the intersection between different
subject areas where um there'll be some

4028
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
subject areas where um there'll be some
 

4029
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,310
subject areas where um there'll be some
new connection that's found between what

4030
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
new connection that's found between what
 

4031
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,390
new connection that's found between what
seemingly with disparate areas and and

seemingly with disparate areas and and
 

4033
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,149
seemingly with disparate areas and and
one can even think of deep mind as i

01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
one can even think of deep mind as i

ideas and ai engineering ideas uh

4040
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:34,000
ideas and ai engineering ideas uh
 

4041
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,189
ideas and ai engineering ideas uh
originally and so um so i think there's

4042
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:37,199
originally and so um so i think there's
 

4043
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,270
originally and so um so i think there's
that and then one of the things we can't

4044
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:39,280
that and then one of the things we can't
 

4045
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,030
that and then one of the things we can't
imagine today is and one of the reasons

4046
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:41,040
imagine today is and one of the reasons
 

4047
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,709
imagine today is and one of the reasons
i think people we were so surprised by

4048
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:42,719
i think people we were so surprised by
 

4049
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,950
i think people we were so surprised by
how well large models worked is that

4050
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:44,960
how well large models worked is that
 

4051
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:45,990
how well large models worked is that
actually

4052
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:46,000
actually
 

4053
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,830
actually
it's very hard for our human minds our

4054
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:47,840
it's very hard for our human minds our
 

4055
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,430
it's very hard for our human minds our
limited human minds to understand what

4056
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
limited human minds to understand what
 

4057
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,870
limited human minds to understand what
it would be like to read the whole

4058
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:50,880
it would be like to read the whole
 

4059
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,550
it would be like to read the whole
internet right i think we can do a

4060
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
internet right i think we can do a
 

4061
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,229
internet right i think we can do a
thought experiment and i used to do this

4062
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:54,239
thought experiment and i used to do this
 

4063
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:55,990
thought experiment and i used to do this
of like well what if i read the whole of

4064
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:56,000
of like well what if i read the whole of
 

4065
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,350
of like well what if i read the whole of
wikipedia

4066
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:57,360
wikipedia
 

4067
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,110
wikipedia
what would i know and i think our minds

4068
01:10:59,110 --> 01:10:59,120
what would i know and i think our minds
 

4069
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,790
what would i know and i think our minds
can just about comprehend maybe what

4070
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:00,800
can just about comprehend maybe what
 

4071
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,470
can just about comprehend maybe what
that would be like but the whole

4072
01:11:02,470 --> 01:11:02,480
that would be like but the whole
 

4073
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,709
that would be like but the whole
internet is beyond comprehension so i

4074
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:04,719
internet is beyond comprehension so i
 

4075
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,310
internet is beyond comprehension so i
think we just don't understand what it

4076
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:06,320
think we just don't understand what it
 

4077
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,630
think we just don't understand what it
would be like to be able to hold all of

4078
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:08,640
would be like to be able to hold all of
 

4079
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,189
would be like to be able to hold all of
that in mind potentially right and then

4080
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:11,199
that in mind potentially right and then
 

4081
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,750
that in mind potentially right and then
active at once and then maybe what are

4082
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:13,760
active at once and then maybe what are
 

4083
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,590
active at once and then maybe what are
the connections that are available there

4084
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:15,600
the connections that are available there
 

4085
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,110
the connections that are available there
so i think no doubt there are huge

4086
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:17,120
so i think no doubt there are huge
 

4087
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,110
so i think no doubt there are huge
things to be discovered just like that

4088
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
things to be discovered just like that
 

4089
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,350
things to be discovered just like that
but i do think there is this other type

4090
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:21,360
but i do think there is this other type
 

4091
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,830
but i do think there is this other type
of creativity of true spark of new

4092
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
of creativity of true spark of new
 

4093
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,149
of creativity of true spark of new
knowledge new idea never thought before

4094
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159

some of the greatest scientists in
 

4109
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,990
some of the greatest scientists in
history have displayed that i would say

what kind of intelligence that is that's
 

4139
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,870
what kind of intelligence that is that's
a pretty powerful intelligence if you

4140
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:14,880
a pretty powerful intelligence if you
 

4141
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,790
a pretty powerful intelligence if you
know how to use that and integrate that

4142

information correctly yes i think you
 

4145
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,390
information correctly yes i think you
can go really far you can probably

4146
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:20,400
can go really far you can probably

that
like simulate different ideas so if this

4152
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:26,239
like simulate different ideas so if this
 

4153
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,149
like simulate different ideas so if this
is true let me run this thought

4154
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,159
is true let me run this thought
 

4155
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,149
is true let me run this thought
experiment then maybe this is true it's

4156
01:12:30,149 --> 01:12:30,159
experiment then maybe this is true it's
 

4157
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:32,390
experiment then maybe this is true it's
not really invention it's like just

4158
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
not really invention it's like just
 

4159
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,189
not really invention it's like just
taking literally the knowledge and using

4160
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:35,199
taking literally the knowledge and using
 

4161

taking literally the knowledge and using
it to construct a very basic simulation

4225
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,550
it's been very fun last year or two and
very productive because we've been

think could be very transformative if we
 

4237
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,310
think could be very transformative if we
helped accelerate and uh really

4238

this is energy so energy yes exactly so

4244
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:58,560
this is energy so energy yes exactly so
 

4245
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,550
this is energy so energy yes exactly so
energy and climate so we talked about

4246
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:00,560
energy and climate so we talked about
 

4247
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,229
energy and climate so we talked about
disease and biology as being one of the

4248
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:02,239
disease and biology as being one of the
 

4249
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,390
disease and biology as being one of the
biggest places i think ai can help with

4250
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:04,400
biggest places i think ai can help with
 

4251
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,630
biggest places i think ai can help with
i think energy and climate uh is another

4252
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:06,640
i think energy and climate uh is another
 

4253
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,430
i think energy and climate uh is another
one so maybe they would be my top two um

4254
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:09,440
one so maybe they would be my top two um
 

4255
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,590
one so maybe they would be my top two um
and fusion is one one area i think ai

4256
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:11,600
and fusion is one one area i think ai
 

4257
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,390
and fusion is one one area i think ai
can help with now fusion has many

4258
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
can help with now fusion has many
 

4259
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,550
can help with now fusion has many

in this case in fusion we we

4280
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:34,400
in this case in fusion we we
 

4281
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,149
in this case in fusion we we
collaborated with epfl in switzerland

4282
01:14:36,149 --> 01:14:36,159
collaborated with epfl in switzerland
 

4283
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,430

the swiss technical institute who are

4284
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,440
the swiss technical institute who are
 

4285
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,669
the swiss technical institute who are
amazing they have a test reactor that

4286
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:39,679
amazing they have a test reactor that
 

4287
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:41,430
amazing they have a test reactor that
they were willing to let us use which

4288
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:41,440
they were willing to let us use which
 

4289
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,110
they were willing to let us use which
you know i double checked with the team

4290
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:43,120
you know i double checked with the team
 

4291
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,550
you know i double checked with the team
we were going to use carefully and

4292
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:44,560
we were going to use carefully and
 

4293
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,830
we were going to use carefully and
safely

4294
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
safely
 

4295
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,350
safely
i was impressed they managed to persuade

4296
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:47,360
i was impressed they managed to persuade
 

4297
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:50,550
i was impressed they managed to persuade
them to let us use it and um and it's a

4298
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:50,560
them to let us use it and um and it's a
 

4299
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,630
them to let us use it and um and it's a
it's an amazing test reactor they have

4300
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:52,640
it's an amazing test reactor they have
 

4301
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,110
it's an amazing test reactor they have
there and they try all sorts of pretty

4302
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:55,120
there and they try all sorts of pretty
 

4303
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,149
there and they try all sorts of pretty
crazy experiments on it and um the the

4304
01:14:58,149 --> 01:14:58,159
crazy experiments on it and um the the
 

4305
01:14:58,159 --> 01:14:59,910
crazy experiments on it and um the the
the what we tend to look at is if we go

4306
01:14:59,910 --> 01:14:59,920
the what we tend to look at is if we go
 

4307
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,990
the what we tend to look at is if we go
into a new domain like fusion what are

4308
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:02,000
into a new domain like fusion what are
 

4309
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,229
into a new domain like fusion what are
all the bottleneck problems uh like

4310
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239
all the bottleneck problems uh like
 

4311
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:05,750
all the bottleneck problems uh like
thinking from first principles you know

4312
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:05,760
thinking from first principles you know
 

4313
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,790
thinking from first principles you know
what are all the bottleneck problems

4314
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:06,800
what are all the bottleneck problems
 

4315
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,310
what are all the bottleneck problems
that are still stopping fusion working

4316
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,320
that are still stopping fusion working
 

4317
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,310
that are still stopping fusion working
today and then we look at we you know we

4318
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:10,320
today and then we look at we you know we
 

4319
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,149
today and then we look at we you know we
get a fusion expert to tell us and then

4320
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:12,159
get a fusion expert to tell us and then
 

4321
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:13,910
get a fusion expert to tell us and then
we look at those bottlenecks and we look

4322
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:13,920
we look at those bottlenecks and we look
 

4323
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,229
we look at those bottlenecks and we look
at the ones which ones are amenable to

4324
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:16,239
at the ones which ones are amenable to
 

4325
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,430
at the ones which ones are amenable to
our ai methods today yes right and and

4326
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,440
our ai methods today yes right and and
 

4327
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,110
our ai methods today yes right and and
and then and would be interesting from a

4328
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:21,120
and then and would be interesting from a
 

4329
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:22,709
and then and would be interesting from a
research perspective from our point of

4330
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:22,719
research perspective from our point of
 

4331
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:24,470
research perspective from our point of
view from an ai point of view and that

4332
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:24,480
view from an ai point of view and that
 

4333
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,550
view from an ai point of view and that
would address one of their bottlenecks

4334
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:26,560
would address one of their bottlenecks
 

4335
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,790
would address one of their bottlenecks
and in this case plasma control was was

4336
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:28,800
and in this case plasma control was was
 

4337
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,189
and in this case plasma control was was
perfect so you know the plasma it's a

4338
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
perfect so you know the plasma it's a
 

4339
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,790
perfect so you know the plasma it's a
million degrees celsius something like

4340
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
million degrees celsius something like
 

4341
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,870
million degrees celsius something like
that it's hotter than the sun

4342
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:34,880
that it's hotter than the sun
 

4343
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,470
that it's hotter than the sun
and there's obviously no material that

4344
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
and there's obviously no material that
 

4345
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,070
and there's obviously no material that
can contain it so they have to be

4346
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:38,080
can contain it so they have to be
 

4347
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,149
can contain it so they have to be
containing these magnetic very powerful

4348
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:40,159
containing these magnetic very powerful
 

4349
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,550
containing these magnetic very powerful
superconducting magnetic fields but the

4350
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
superconducting magnetic fields but the
 

4351
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,790
superconducting magnetic fields but the
problem is plasma is pretty unstable as

4352
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:44,800
problem is plasma is pretty unstable as
 

4353
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,310
problem is plasma is pretty unstable as
you imagine you're kind of holding a

4354
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:46,320
you imagine you're kind of holding a
 

4355
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,590
you imagine you're kind of holding a
mini sun mini star in a reactor so you

4356
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:49,600
mini sun mini star in a reactor so you
 

4357
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,350
mini sun mini star in a reactor so you
know you you kind of want to predict

4358
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
know you you kind of want to predict
 

4359
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,390
know you you kind of want to predict
ahead of time

4360
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:52,400
ahead of time
 

4361
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,550
ahead of time
what the plasma's going to do so you can

4362
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:54,560
what the plasma's going to do so you can
 

4363
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,790
what the plasma's going to do so you can
move the magnetic field within a few

4364
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:56,800
move the magnetic field within a few
 

4365
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,030
move the magnetic field within a few
milliseconds you know to to basically

4366
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
milliseconds you know to to basically
 

4367
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,030
milliseconds you know to to basically
contain what it's going to do next so it

4368
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:01,040
contain what it's going to do next so it
 

4369
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,470
contain what it's going to do next so it
seems like a perfect problem if you

4370
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,480
seems like a perfect problem if you
 

4371
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,229
seems like a perfect problem if you
think of it for like a reinforcement

4372
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:04,239
think of it for like a reinforcement
 

4373
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:06,870
think of it for like a reinforcement
learning prediction problem so uh you

4374
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
learning prediction problem so uh you
 

4375
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,390
learning prediction problem so uh you
know your controller you're gonna move

4376
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:08,400
know your controller you're gonna move
 

4377
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,709
know your controller you're gonna move
the magnetic field and until we came

4378
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:10,719
the magnetic field and until we came
 

4379
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:12,070
the magnetic field and until we came
along you know they were they were doing

4380
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:12,080
along you know they were they were doing
 

4381
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,390
along you know they were they were doing
it with with traditional operational uh

4382
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
it with with traditional operational uh
 

4383
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,950
it with with traditional operational uh
research type of uh controllers uh which

4384
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:16,960
research type of uh controllers uh which
 

4385
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,630
research type of uh controllers uh which
are kind of handcrafted and the problem

4386
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:18,640
are kind of handcrafted and the problem
 

4387
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,990
are kind of handcrafted and the problem
is of course they can't react in the

4388
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:20,000
is of course they can't react in the
 

4389
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,430
is of course they can't react in the
moment to something the plasma's doing

4390
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:21,440
moment to something the plasma's doing
 

4391
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,110
moment to something the plasma's doing
that they have to be hard-coded and

4392
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:23,120
that they have to be hard-coded and
 

4393
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,030
that they have to be hard-coded and
again knowing that that's normally our

4394
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,040
again knowing that that's normally our
 

4395
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,870
again knowing that that's normally our
go-to solution is we would like to learn

4396
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:26,880
go-to solution is we would like to learn
 

4397
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,470
go-to solution is we would like to learn
that instead and they also had a

4398
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,480
that instead and they also had a
 

4399
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,470
that instead and they also had a
simulator of these plasma so there were

4400
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
simulator of these plasma so there were
 

4401
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,470
simulator of these plasma so there were
lots of criteria that matched what we we

4402
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:32,480
lots of criteria that matched what we we
 

4403
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:34,709
lots of criteria that matched what we we
like to to to use

4404
01:16:34,709 --> 01:16:34,719
like to to to use
 

4405
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:37,590
like to to to use
so can ai eventually solve nuclear

4406
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:37,600
so can ai eventually solve nuclear
 

4407
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,750
so can ai eventually solve nuclear
fusion well so we with this problem and

4408
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:39,760
fusion well so we with this problem and
 

4409
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,270
fusion well so we with this problem and
we published it in a nature paper last

4410
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:41,280
we published it in a nature paper last
 

4411
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,070
we published it in a nature paper last
year uh we held the fusion that we held

4412
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,080
year uh we held the fusion that we held
 

4413
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,149
year uh we held the fusion that we held
the plasma in specific shapes so

4414
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:46,159
the plasma in specific shapes so
 

4415
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:47,830
the plasma in specific shapes so
actually it's almost like carving the

4416
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:47,840
actually it's almost like carving the
 

4417
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,990
actually it's almost like carving the
plasma into different shapes and control

4418
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:50,000
plasma into different shapes and control
 

4419
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,990
plasma into different shapes and control
and hold it there for the record amount

4420
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,000
and hold it there for the record amount
 

4421
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,470
and hold it there for the record amount
of time so um so that's one of the

4422
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:54,480
of time so um so that's one of the
 

4423
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,430
of time so um so that's one of the
problems of of fusion sort of um solved

4424
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:57,440
problems of of fusion sort of um solved
 

4425
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,830
problems of of fusion sort of um solved
so i have a controller that's able to no

4426
01:16:59,830 --> 01:16:59,840
so i have a controller that's able to no
 

4427
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,310
so i have a controller that's able to no
matter the shape uh contain it continue

4428
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:02,320
matter the shape uh contain it continue
 

4429
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,070
matter the shape uh contain it continue
yeah contain it and hold it in structure

4430
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
yeah contain it and hold it in structure
 

4431
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,350
yeah contain it and hold it in structure
and there's different shapes that are

4432
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:05,360
and there's different shapes that are
 

4433
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,669
and there's different shapes that are
better for for the energy productions

4434
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:07,679
better for for the energy productions
 

4435
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,630
better for for the energy productions
called droplets and and and so on so um

4436
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:10,640
called droplets and and and so on so um
 

4437
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,550
called droplets and and and so on so um
so that was huge and now we're looking

4438
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,560
so that was huge and now we're looking
 

4439
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,310
so that was huge and now we're looking
we're talking to lots of fusion startups

4440
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:14,320
we're talking to lots of fusion startups
 

4441
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,229
we're talking to lots of fusion startups
to see what's the next problem we can

4442
01:17:16,229 --> 01:17:16,239
to see what's the next problem we can
 

4443
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:19,270
to see what's the next problem we can
tackle uh in the fusion area

4444
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,280
tackle uh in the fusion area
 

4445
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,149
tackle uh in the fusion area
so another fascinating place

4446
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:22,159
so another fascinating place
 

4447
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:23,910
so another fascinating place
in a paper title pushing the frontiers

4448
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:23,920
in a paper title pushing the frontiers
 

4449
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,669
in a paper title pushing the frontiers
of density functionals by solving the

01:17:25,669 --> 01:17:25,679
of density functionals by solving the
 

4451
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,750
of density functionals by solving the
fractional electron problem so you're

4452
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:27,760
fractional electron problem so you're
 

4453
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,270
fractional electron problem so you're
taking on

4454
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:29,280
taking on
 

4455
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,430
taking on

um

4460
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:35,920
um
 

4461
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,470
um
can you explain this work and can ai

4462
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:38,480
can you explain this work and can ai
 

4463

this is another problem i've had my eye

4468
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,000
this is another problem i've had my eye
 

4469
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,350
this is another problem i've had my eye
on for you know a decade or more which

4470
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:47,360
on for you know a decade or more which
 

4471
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,470
on for you know a decade or more which
is um

4472
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:48,480
is um
 

4473
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,470
is um
uh sort of simulating the properties of

4474
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:50,480
uh sort of simulating the properties of
 

4475
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,630
uh sort of simulating the properties of
electrons if you can do that you can

4476
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:52,640
electrons if you can do that you can
 

4477
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,350
electrons if you can do that you can
basically describe how elements and

4478
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:55,360
basically describe how elements and
 

4479
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,709
basically describe how elements and
materials and substances work so it's

4480
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
materials and substances work so it's
 

4481
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:00,390
materials and substances work so it's
kind of like fundamental if you want to

4482
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:00,400
kind of like fundamental if you want to
 

4483
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:03,669
kind of like fundamental if you want to
advance material science um and uh you

4484
01:18:03,669 --> 01:18:03,679
advance material science um and uh you
 

4485
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,189
advance material science um and uh you
know we have schrodinger's equation and

4486
01:18:05,189 --> 01:18:05,199
know we have schrodinger's equation and
 

4487
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:06,709
know we have schrodinger's equation and
then we have approximations to that

4488
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:06,719
then we have approximations to that
 

4489
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:08,870
then we have approximations to that
density functional theory these things

4490
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:08,880
density functional theory these things
 

4491
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,430
density functional theory these things
are you know are famous and um people

4492
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:11,440
are you know are famous and um people
 

4493
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,990
are you know are famous and um people
try and write approximations to to these

4494
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,000
try and write approximations to to these
 

4495
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,310
try and write approximations to to these
uh uh to these functionals and and kind

4496
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:16,320
uh uh to these functionals and and kind
 

4497
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,790
uh uh to these functionals and and kind
of come up with descriptions of the

4498
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:18,800
of come up with descriptions of the
 

4499
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,550
of come up with descriptions of the
electron clouds where they're gonna go

4500
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:20,560
electron clouds where they're gonna go
 

4501
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,470
electron clouds where they're gonna go
how they're gonna interact when you put

4502
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:22,480
how they're gonna interact when you put
 

4503
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,950
how they're gonna interact when you put
two elements together uh and what we try

4504
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:24,960
two elements together uh and what we try
 

4505
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,590
two elements together uh and what we try
to do is learn a simulation uh uh

4506
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:27,600
to do is learn a simulation uh uh
 

4507
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,750
to do is learn a simulation uh uh
learner functional that will describe

4508
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:29,760
learner functional that will describe
 

4509
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,870
learner functional that will describe
more chemistry types of chemistry so um

4510
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:32,880
more chemistry types of chemistry so um
 

4511
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,709
more chemistry types of chemistry so um
until now you know you can run expensive

4512
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:34,719
until now you know you can run expensive
 

4513
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,229
until now you know you can run expensive
simulations but then you can only

4514
01:18:36,229 --> 01:18:36,239
simulations but then you can only
 

4515
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,950
simulations but then you can only
simulate very small uh molecules very

4516
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:38,960
simulate very small uh molecules very
 

4517
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,630
simulate very small uh molecules very
simple molecules we would like to

4518
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:40,640
simple molecules we would like to
 

4519
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,910
simple molecules we would like to
simulate large materials um and so uh

4520
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:43,920
simulate large materials um and so uh
 

4521
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,750
simulate large materials um and so uh
today there's no way of doing that and

4522
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
today there's no way of doing that and
 

4523
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,830
today there's no way of doing that and
we're building up towards uh building

4524
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:47,840
we're building up towards uh building
 

4525
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,750
we're building up towards uh building
functionals that approximate

4526
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:49,760
functionals that approximate
 

4527
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,990
functionals that approximate
schrodinger's equation and then allow

4528
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:52,000
schrodinger's equation and then allow
 

4529
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,630
schrodinger's equation and then allow
you to describe uh what the electrons

4530
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:54,640
you to describe uh what the electrons
 

4531
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,669
you to describe uh what the electrons
are doing

4532
01:18:55,669 --> 01:18:55,679
are doing
 

4533
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:57,430
are doing
and all materials sort of science and

4534
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:57,440
and all materials sort of science and
 

4535
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,189
and all materials sort of science and
material properties are governed by the

4536
01:18:59,189 --> 01:18:59,199
material properties are governed by the
 

4537
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:02,310
material properties are governed by the
electrons and and how they interact so

4538
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:02,320
electrons and and how they interact so
 

4539
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,470
electrons and and how they interact so
have a good summarization of the

4540
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:04,480
have a good summarization of the
 

4541
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,350
have a good summarization of the
simulation through the functional

4542
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:07,360
simulation through the functional
 

4543
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,630
simulation through the functional
um

4544
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:08,640
um
 

4545
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,870
um
but one that is still

4546
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:10,880
but one that is still
 

4547
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,390
but one that is still
close to what the actual simulation

4548
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:12,400
close to what the actual simulation
 

4549
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,510
close to what the actual simulation
would come out with so what um

4550
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:15,520
would come out with so what um
 

4551
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,790
would come out with so what um
how difficult is that to ask what's

4552
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:16,800
how difficult is that to ask what's
 

4553
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,229
how difficult is that to ask what's
involved in that task is it running

4554
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:18,239
involved in that task is it running
 

4555
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:18,950
involved in that task is it running
those

4556
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:18,960
those
 

4557
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,189
those
those complicated simulations yeah and

4558
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:21,199
those complicated simulations yeah and
 

4559
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,510
those complicated simulations yeah and
learning the task of mapping from the

4560
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
learning the task of mapping from the
 

4561
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,189
learning the task of mapping from the
initial conditions and the parameters of

4562
01:19:25,189 --> 01:19:25,199
initial conditions and the parameters of
 

4563
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:26,790
initial conditions and the parameters of
the simulation learning what the

4564
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
the simulation learning what the
 

4565
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,790
the simulation learning what the
functional would be yeah so it's pretty

4566
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:28,800
functional would be yeah so it's pretty
 

4567
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,030
functional would be yeah so it's pretty
tricky and we've done it with um you

4568
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:31,040
tricky and we've done it with um you
 

4569
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,870
tricky and we've done it with um you
know the nice thing is we there are we

4570
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:32,880
know the nice thing is we there are we
 

4571
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,189
know the nice thing is we there are we
can run a lot of the simulations that

4572
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:35,199
can run a lot of the simulations that
 

4573
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,430
can run a lot of the simulations that
the molecular dynamics simulations on

4574
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:37,440
the molecular dynamics simulations on
 

4575
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,590
the molecular dynamics simulations on
our compute clusters and so that

4576
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:39,600
our compute clusters and so that
 

4577
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,350
our compute clusters and so that
generates a lot of data so in this case

4578
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:41,360
generates a lot of data so in this case
 

4579
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,990
generates a lot of data so in this case
the data is generated so we like those

4580
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:44,000
the data is generated so we like those
 

4581
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,430
the data is generated so we like those
sort of systems and that's why we use

4582
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:45,440
sort of systems and that's why we use
 

4583
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,310
sort of systems and that's why we use
games simulator generated data

4584
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:48,320
games simulator generated data
 

4585
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,669
games simulator generated data
and we can kind of create as much of it

4586
01:19:49,669 --> 01:19:49,679
and we can kind of create as much of it
 

4587
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:52,070
and we can kind of create as much of it
as we want really um and just let's

4588
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:52,080
as we want really um and just let's
 

4589
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,990
as we want really um and just let's
leave some you know if any computers are

4590
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:54,000
leave some you know if any computers are
 

4591
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,229
leave some you know if any computers are
free in the cloud we just run we run

4592
01:19:56,229 --> 01:19:56,239
free in the cloud we just run we run
 

4593
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,149
free in the cloud we just run we run
some of these calculations right compute

4594
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
some of these calculations right compute
 

4595
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,070
some of these calculations right compute
cluster calculation that's all the the

4605
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,149
other things and so um and so you know
when you're not searching on youtube for

computers usefully and quantum chemistry
 

4611
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,790
computers usefully and quantum chemistry
that's the idea

4612
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:14,800
that's the idea
 

4613
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,030
that's the idea
and and putting them for good use and

4614
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,040
and and putting them for good use and
 

4615
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,470
and and putting them for good use and
then yeah and then all of that

4616
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
then yeah and then all of that
 

4617
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,870
then yeah and then all of that
computational data that's generated we

4618
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:20,880
computational data that's generated we
 

4619
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,629
computational data that's generated we
can then try and learn the functionals

4620
01:20:22,629 --> 01:20:22,639
can then try and learn the functionals
 

4621
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:24,470
can then try and learn the functionals
from that which of course are way more

4622
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,480
from that which of course are way more
 

4623
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,510
from that which of course are way more
efficient

4624
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:25,520
efficient
 

4625
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,070
efficient
once we learn the functional than um

4626
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,080
once we learn the functional than um
 

4627
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,390
once we learn the functional than um
running those simulations would be

4628
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:30,400
running those simulations would be
 

4629
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,110
running those simulations would be
do you think one day ai may allow us to

4630
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:33,120
do you think one day ai may allow us to
 

4631
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,830
do you think one day ai may allow us to
do something like basically crack open

4632
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:35,840
do something like basically crack open
 

4633
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,830
do something like basically crack open
physics so do something like travel

4634
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:37,840
physics so do something like travel
 

4635
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,430
physics so do something like travel
faster than the speed of light

4636
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:39,440
faster than the speed of light
 

4637
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,590
faster than the speed of light
my ultimate aim has always been with ai

4638
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:41,600
my ultimate aim has always been with ai
 

4639
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,390
my ultimate aim has always been with ai
is

4640
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:42,400
is
 

4641
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,110
is
um the reason i am personally working on

4642
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,120
um the reason i am personally working on
 

4643
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,669
um the reason i am personally working on
ai for my whole life it was to build a

4644
01:20:47,669 --> 01:20:47,679
ai for my whole life it was to build a
 

4645
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,750
ai for my whole life it was to build a
tool to help us understand stand the

4646
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:49,760
tool to help us understand stand the
 

4647
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,550
tool to help us understand stand the
universe so i wanted to and that means

4648
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:52,560
universe so i wanted to and that means
 

4649
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,870
universe so i wanted to and that means
physics really and the nature of reality

4650
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:54,880
physics really and the nature of reality
 

4651
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,590
physics really and the nature of reality
so

4652
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:55,600
so
 

4653
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,550
so
um

4654
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:56,560
um
 

4655
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,990
um
uh i don't think we have systems that

4656
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
uh i don't think we have systems that
 

4657
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,750
uh i don't think we have systems that
are capable of doing that yet but when

4658
01:20:59,750 --> 01:20:59,760
are capable of doing that yet but when
 

4659
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,990
are capable of doing that yet but when
we get towards agi i think um that's one

4660
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:02,000
we get towards agi i think um that's one
 

4661
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,430
we get towards agi i think um that's one
of the first things i think we should

4662
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:03,440
of the first things i think we should
 

4663
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,189
of the first things i think we should
apply agi to

4664
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:05,199
apply agi to
 

4665
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,550
apply agi to
i would like to test the limits of

4666
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
i would like to test the limits of
 

4667
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,390
i would like to test the limits of
physics and our knowledge of physics

4668
01:21:08,390 --> 01:21:08,400
physics and our knowledge of physics
 

4669
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,910
physics and our knowledge of physics
there's so many things we don't know

4670
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:09,920
there's so many things we don't know
 

4671
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,510
there's so many things we don't know
there's one thing i find fascinating

4672
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
there's one thing i find fascinating
 

4673
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,350
there's one thing i find fascinating
about science and you know as a huge

4674
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
about science and you know as a huge
 

4675
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,110
about science and you know as a huge
proponent of the scientific method as

4676
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:15,120
proponent of the scientific method as
 

4677
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,390
proponent of the scientific method as
being one of the greatest ideas

4678
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
being one of the greatest ideas
 

4679
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,470
being one of the greatest ideas
humanity's ever had and allowed us to

4680
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:18,480
humanity's ever had and allowed us to
 

4681
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,149
humanity's ever had and allowed us to
progress with our knowledge

4682
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:20,159
progress with our knowledge
 

4683
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,149
progress with our knowledge
but i think as a true scientist i think

4684
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:22,159
but i think as a true scientist i think
 

4685
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:24,470
but i think as a true scientist i think
what you find is the more you find out

4686
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:24,480
what you find is the more you find out
 

4687
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,229
what you find is the more you find out
uh you the more you realize we don't

4688
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:26,239
uh you the more you realize we don't
 

4689
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:26,950
uh you the more you realize we don't
know

4690
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:26,960
know
 

4691
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,030
know
and and i always think that it's

4692
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:29,040
and and i always think that it's
 

4693
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,950
and and i always think that it's
surprising that more people don't aren't

4694
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
surprising that more people don't aren't
 

4695
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,709
surprising that more people don't aren't
troubled you know every night i think

4696
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:32,719
troubled you know every night i think
 

4697
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:34,550
troubled you know every night i think
about all these things we interact with

4698
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:34,560
about all these things we interact with
 

4699
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,070
about all these things we interact with
all the time that we have no idea how

4700
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
all the time that we have no idea how
 

4701
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,830
all the time that we have no idea how
they work time

4702
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:37,840
they work time
 

4703
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,070
they work time

life we can't i mean these are all the

4706
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:42,080
life we can't i mean these are all the
 

4707
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,149
life we can't i mean these are all the
fundamental things of nature i think the

4708
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,159
fundamental things of nature i think the
 

4709
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:47,270
fundamental things of nature i think the
way we don't really know what they are

4710
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:47,280
way we don't really know what they are
 

4711
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,310
way we don't really know what they are
to live life we uh pin certain

4712
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:50,320
to live life we uh pin certain
 

4713
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:52,709
to live life we uh pin certain
assumptions on them and kind of treat

4714
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:52,719
assumptions on them and kind of treat
 

4715
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:54,629
assumptions on them and kind of treat
our assumptions as if they're a fact

4716
01:21:54,629 --> 01:21:54,639
our assumptions as if they're a fact
 

4717
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,950
our assumptions as if they're a fact
yeah that allows us to sort of box them

4718
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:56,960
yeah that allows us to sort of box them
 

4719
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,870
yeah that allows us to sort of box them
off somehow yeah box them off

4720
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
off somehow yeah box them off
 

4721
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,110
off somehow yeah box them off
but the reality is when you think of

4722
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:01,120
but the reality is when you think of
 

4723
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,229
but the reality is when you think of
time

4724
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:02,239
time
 

4725
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,390
time
you should remind yourself you should

4726
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:04,400
you should remind yourself you should
 

4727
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,669
you should remind yourself you should
put it off the sh

put it off the sh
take it off the shelf and realize like

take it off the shelf and realize like
 

4731
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,870
take it off the shelf and realize like
no we have a bunch of assumptions

no we have a bunch of assumptions
 

4733
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,709
no we have a bunch of assumptions
there's still a lot of there's even now

01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:10,719
there's still a lot of there's even now
 

4735
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:11,910
there's still a lot of there's even now
a lot of debate there's a lot of

4736
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920
a lot of debate there's a lot of
 

4737
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,110
a lot of debate there's a lot of
uncertainty about exactly what is time

uncertainty about exactly what is time
 

4739
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,590
uncertainty about exactly what is time
uh is there an error of time you know

4740
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:17,600
uh is there an error of time you know
 

4741
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,030
uh is there an error of time you know
there's there's a lot of fundamental

01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:19,040
there's there's a lot of fundamental
 

4743
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,149
there's there's a lot of fundamental
questions you can't just make

4744
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:20,159
questions you can't just make
 

4745
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,629
questions you can't just make
assumptions about and maybe

how the heck did life originate on earth

4850
01:24:08,629 --> 01:24:08,639
how the heck did life originate on earth
 

4851
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:10,550
how the heck did life originate on earth
yeah well maybe we i'll come to that in

4852
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:10,560
yeah well maybe we i'll come to that in
 

4853
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,870
yeah well maybe we i'll come to that in
a second but i think the ultimate

4854
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:12,880
a second but i think the ultimate
 

4855
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,870
a second but i think the ultimate
use of ai is to

4856
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
use of ai is to
 

4857
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,030
use of ai is to
kind of use it to accelerate science to

4858
01:24:17,030 --> 01:24:17,040
kind of use it to accelerate science to
 

4859
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,430
kind of use it to accelerate science to
the maximum so i

4860
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:19,440
the maximum so i
 

4861
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,270
the maximum so i
um think of it a little bit like the

4862
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:21,280
um think of it a little bit like the
 

4863
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,950
um think of it a little bit like the
tree of all knowledge if you imagine

4864
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:22,960
tree of all knowledge if you imagine
 

4865
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,229
tree of all knowledge if you imagine
that's all the knowledge there is in the

4866
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:24,239
that's all the knowledge there is in the
 

4867
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:25,750
that's all the knowledge there is in the
universe to attain

4868
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:25,760
universe to attain
 

4869
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,669
universe to attain
and we sort of barely scratched the

4870
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
and we sort of barely scratched the
 

4871
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,070
and we sort of barely scratched the
surface of that so far in even though

4872
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:30,080
surface of that so far in even though
 

4873
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,830
surface of that so far in even though
you know we've we've done pretty well

4874
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:31,840
you know we've we've done pretty well
 

4875
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,189
you know we've we've done pretty well
since the enlightenment right as

4876
01:24:33,189 --> 01:24:33,199
since the enlightenment right as
 

4877
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,910
since the enlightenment right as
humanity and i think ai will turbo

4878
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:35,920
humanity and i think ai will turbo
 

4879
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,430
humanity and i think ai will turbo
charge all of that like we've seen with

4880
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:37,440
charge all of that like we've seen with
 

4881
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,149
charge all of that like we've seen with
alpha fold and i want to explore as much

4882
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:40,159
alpha fold and i want to explore as much
 

4883
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,590
alpha fold and i want to explore as much
of that tree of knowledge as it's

4884
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:41,600
of that tree of knowledge as it's
 

4885
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,790
of that tree of knowledge as it's
possible to do and um and i think that

4886
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:44,800
possible to do and um and i think that
 

4887
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,189
possible to do and um and i think that
involves ai helping us with with with

4888
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:47,199
involves ai helping us with with with
 

4889
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:49,669
involves ai helping us with with with
understanding or finding patterns um but

4890
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:49,679
understanding or finding patterns um but
 

4891
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,590
understanding or finding patterns um but
also potentially designing and building

4892
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,600
also potentially designing and building
 

4893
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,830
also potentially designing and building
new tools experimental tools so i think

4894
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:53,840
new tools experimental tools so i think
 

4895
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,910
new tools experimental tools so i think
that's all uh

4896
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:55,920
that's all uh
 

4897
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,510
that's all uh
and also running simulations and

4898
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:57,520
and also running simulations and
 

4899
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,510
and also running simulations and
learning simulations all of that we're

4900
01:24:59,510 --> 01:24:59,520
learning simulations all of that we're
 

4901
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,390
learning simulations all of that we're
already we're sort of doing it at a at a

4902
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:02,400
already we're sort of doing it at a at a
 

4903
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,030
already we're sort of doing it at a at a
at a you know baby steps level here but

4904
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:05,040
at a you know baby steps level here but
 

4905
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,669
at a you know baby steps level here but
i can imagine that in in in the decades

4906
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:07,679
i can imagine that in in in the decades
 

4907
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,310
i can imagine that in in in the decades
to come as uh you know what's the full

4908
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:10,320
to come as uh you know what's the full
 

4909
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,790
to come as uh you know what's the full
flourishing of of that line of thinking

4910
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:12,800
flourishing of of that line of thinking
 

4911
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,390
flourishing of of that line of thinking
it's going to be truly incredible i

4912
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:14,400
it's going to be truly incredible i
 

4913
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,310
it's going to be truly incredible i
would say if i visualize this tree of

4914
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,320
would say if i visualize this tree of
 

4915
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,629
would say if i visualize this tree of
knowledge something tells me that that

4916
01:25:18,629 --> 01:25:18,639
knowledge something tells me that that
 

4917
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,310
knowledge something tells me that that
knowledge for tree of knowledge for

4918
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:20,320
knowledge for tree of knowledge for
 

4919
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,790
knowledge for tree of knowledge for
humans is much smaller

4920
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:22,800
humans is much smaller
 

4921
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,470
humans is much smaller
in the set of all possible trees of

4922
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:24,480
in the set of all possible trees of
 

4923
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,110
in the set of all possible trees of
knowledge is actually quite small giving

4924
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:27,120
knowledge is actually quite small giving
 

4925
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,870
knowledge is actually quite small giving
our cognitive

4926
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:28,880
our cognitive
 

4927
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,590
our cognitive
limitations

4928
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:31,600
limitations
 

4929
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,070
limitations
limited cognitive capabilities that even

4930
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,080
limited cognitive capabilities that even
 

4931
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,910
limited cognitive capabilities that even
with with the tools we build we still

4932
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:35,920
with with the tools we build we still
 

4933
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,270
with with the tools we build we still
won't be able to understand a lot of

4934
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,280
won't be able to understand a lot of
 

4935
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,550
won't be able to understand a lot of
things and that's perhaps what non-human

4936
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
things and that's perhaps what non-human
 

4937
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,709
things and that's perhaps what non-human
systems might be able to reach farther

4938
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
systems might be able to reach farther
 

4939
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,790
systems might be able to reach farther
not just as tools

4940
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:44,800
not just as tools
 

4941
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,629
not just as tools
but in themselves understanding

4942
01:25:46,629 --> 01:25:46,639
but in themselves understanding
 

4943
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:48,870
but in themselves understanding
something that they can bring back yeah

4944
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:48,880
something that they can bring back yeah
 

4945
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,030
something that they can bring back yeah
it could well be so i mean there's so

4946
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:51,040
it could well be so i mean there's so
 

4947
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,270
it could well be so i mean there's so
many things that that are sort of

4948
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:53,280
many things that that are sort of
 

4949
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,870
many things that that are sort of
encapsulated in what you just said there

4950
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:54,880
encapsulated in what you just said there
 

4951
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,189
encapsulated in what you just said there
i think first of all um

4952
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:57,199
i think first of all um
 

4953
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,149
i think first of all um
there's there's two different things

4954
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
there's there's two different things
 

4955
01:25:58,159 --> 01:25:59,910
there's there's two different things
there's like what do we understand today

4956
01:25:59,910 --> 01:25:59,920
there's like what do we understand today
 

4957
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,669
there's like what do we understand today
yeah what could the human mind

4958
01:26:01,669 --> 01:26:01,679
yeah what could the human mind
 

4959
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:03,910
yeah what could the human mind
understand and what is the totality of

4960
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:03,920
understand and what is the totality of
 

4961
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,750
understand and what is the totality of
what is there to be understood yeah

4962
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:05,760
what is there to be understood yeah
 

4963
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,390
what is there to be understood yeah
right and so there's three consensus you

4964
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:08,400
right and so there's three consensus you
 

4965
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,590
right and so there's three consensus you
know you can think of them as three

4966
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
know you can think of them as three
 

4967
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,110
know you can think of them as three
larger and larger trees or exploring

4968
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
larger and larger trees or exploring
 

4969
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,430
larger and larger trees or exploring
more branches of that tree and i i think

4970
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:13,440
more branches of that tree and i i think
 

4971
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:14,950
more branches of that tree and i i think
with ai we're going to explore that

4972
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:14,960
with ai we're going to explore that
 

4973
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,830
with ai we're going to explore that
whole lot now the question is is uh you

4974
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:17,840
whole lot now the question is is uh you
 

4975
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,750
whole lot now the question is is uh you
know if you think about what is the

4976
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:19,760
know if you think about what is the
 

4977
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,550
know if you think about what is the
totality of what could be understood um

4978
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:22,560
totality of what could be understood um
 

4979
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,310
totality of what could be understood um
there may be some fundamental physics

4980
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:24,320
there may be some fundamental physics
 

4981
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,750
there may be some fundamental physics
reasons why certain things can't be

4982
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,760
reasons why certain things can't be
 

4983
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,110
reasons why certain things can't be
understood like what's outside the

4984
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:27,120
understood like what's outside the
 

4985
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:29,430
understood like what's outside the
simulation or outside the universe maybe

4986
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:29,440
simulation or outside the universe maybe
 

4987
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,110
simulation or outside the universe maybe
it's not understandable from within the

4988
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:31,120
it's not understandable from within the
 

4989
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,149
it's not understandable from within the
universe

4990
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:32,159
universe
 

4991
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:33,510
universe
so that's there may be some hard

4992
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:33,520
so that's there may be some hard
 

4993
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:34,950
so that's there may be some hard
constraints like that you know it could

4994
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:34,960
constraints like that you know it could
 

4995
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,870
constraints like that you know it could
be smaller constraints like

4996
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:36,880
be smaller constraints like
 

4997
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:40,149
be smaller constraints like
um we think of space time as fundamental

4998
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:40,159
um we think of space time as fundamental
 

4999
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,229
um we think of space time as fundamental
us our human brains are really used to

5000
01:26:42,229 --> 01:26:42,239
us our human brains are really used to
 

5001
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,910
us our human brains are really used to
this idea of a three-dimensional world

5002
01:26:43,910 --> 01:26:43,920
this idea of a three-dimensional world
 

5003
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,270
this idea of a three-dimensional world
with time right

5004
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:45,280
with time right
 

5005
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,669
with time right
maybe but our tools could go beyond that

5006
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:47,679
maybe but our tools could go beyond that
 

5007
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:49,189
maybe but our tools could go beyond that
they wouldn't have that limitation

5008
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:49,199
they wouldn't have that limitation
 

5009
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:50,629
they wouldn't have that limitation
necessary they could think in 11

5010
01:26:50,629 --> 01:26:50,639
necessary they could think in 11
 

5011
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:52,149
necessary they could think in 11
dimensions 12 dimensions whatever is

5012
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:52,159
dimensions 12 dimensions whatever is
 

5013
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:54,550
dimensions 12 dimensions whatever is
needed but um we could still maybe

5014
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:54,560
needed but um we could still maybe
 

5015
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,310
needed but um we could still maybe
understand that in several different

5016
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:56,320
understand that in several different
 

5017
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,870
understand that in several different
ways the example i always give is um

5018
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:58,880
ways the example i always give is um
 

5019
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,790
ways the example i always give is um
when i you know play gary kasparov at

5020
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
when i you know play gary kasparov at
 

5021
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,550
when i you know play gary kasparov at
speed chess or we've talked about chess

5022
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:02,560
speed chess or we've talked about chess
 

5023
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,790
speed chess or we've talked about chess
and these kind of things um you know he

5024
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800
and these kind of things um you know he
 

5025
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,550
and these kind of things um you know he
if you if you if you're reasonably good

5026
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:06,560
if you if you if you're reasonably good
 

5027
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,510
if you if you if you're reasonably good
at chess you can um you can't come up

5028
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:09,520
at chess you can um you can't come up
 

5029
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,430
at chess you can um you can't come up
with the move gary comes up with in his

5030
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:11,440
with the move gary comes up with in his
 

5031
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,350
with the move gary comes up with in his
move but he can explain it to you and

5032
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:13,360
move but he can explain it to you and
 

5033
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,310
move but he can explain it to you and
you can understand and you can

5034
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:14,320
you can understand and you can
 

5035
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,709
you can understand and you can
understand post hoc the reasoning yeah

5036
01:27:16,709 --> 01:27:16,719
understand post hoc the reasoning yeah
 

5037
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,470
understand post hoc the reasoning yeah
so so i think there's a there's an even

5038
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:18,480
so so i think there's a there's an even
 

5039
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:19,910
so so i think there's a there's an even
further level of like well maybe you

5040
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:19,920
further level of like well maybe you
 

5041
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,750
further level of like well maybe you
couldn't have invented that thing but

5042
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:21,760
couldn't have invented that thing but
 

5043
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:23,270
couldn't have invented that thing but
but using like going back to using

5044
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:23,280
but using like going back to using
 

5045
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,950
but using like going back to using
language again perhaps you can

5046
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:24,960
language again perhaps you can
 

5047
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,350
language again perhaps you can
understand and appreciate that same way

5048
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:27,360
understand and appreciate that same way
 

5049
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,430
understand and appreciate that same way
like you can appreciate you know vivaldi

5050
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:29,440
like you can appreciate you know vivaldi
 

5051
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,350
like you can appreciate you know vivaldi
or mozart or something without you can

5052
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:31,360
or mozart or something without you can
 

5053
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,510
or mozart or something without you can
appreciate the beauty of that without um

5054
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:33,520
appreciate the beauty of that without um
 

5055
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,510
appreciate the beauty of that without um
being able to to construct it yourself

5056
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:35,520
being able to to construct it yourself
 

5057
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,510
being able to to construct it yourself
right invent the music yourself so i

5058
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,520
right invent the music yourself so i
 

5059
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,189
right invent the music yourself so i
think we see this in all forms of life

5060
01:27:39,189 --> 01:27:39,199
think we see this in all forms of life
 

5061
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:41,510
think we see this in all forms of life
so it'll be that times you know

5062
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:41,520
so it'll be that times you know
 

5063
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:43,750
so it'll be that times you know
a million but it would you can imagine

5064
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:43,760
a million but it would you can imagine
 

5065
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,070
a million but it would you can imagine
also one sign of intelligence is the

5066
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,080
also one sign of intelligence is the
 

5067
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,070
also one sign of intelligence is the
ability to explain things clearly and

5068
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:48,080
ability to explain things clearly and
 

5069
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,750
ability to explain things clearly and
simply right you know people like

5070
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:49,760
simply right you know people like
 

5071
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,870
simply right you know people like
richard feynman another one of my

5072
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:50,880
richard feynman another one of my
 

5073
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,310
richard feynman another one of my
all-time heroes used to say that right

5074
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:52,320
all-time heroes used to say that right
 

5075
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,070
all-time heroes used to say that right
if you can't you know if you can explain

5076
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:54,080
if you can't you know if you can explain
 

5077
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,149
if you can't you know if you can explain
it something simply then you that's a

5078
01:27:56,149 --> 01:27:56,159
it something simply then you that's a
 

5079
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,149
it something simply then you that's a
that's the best sign a complex topic

5080
01:27:58,149 --> 01:27:58,159
that's the best sign a complex topic
 

5081
01:27:58,159 --> 01:27:59,430
that's the best sign a complex topic
simply then that's one of the best signs

5082
01:27:59,430 --> 01:27:59,440
simply then that's one of the best signs
 

5083
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,590
simply then that's one of the best signs
of you understanding it yeah so i can

5084
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:01,600
of you understanding it yeah so i can
 

5085
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,270
of you understanding it yeah so i can
see myself talking trash in the ai

5086
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:03,280
see myself talking trash in the ai
 

5087
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,590
see myself talking trash in the ai
system in that way yes uh

5088
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:05,600
system in that way yes uh
 

5089
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,229
system in that way yes uh
it gets frustrated how dumb i am and

5090
01:28:08,229 --> 01:28:08,239
it gets frustrated how dumb i am and
 

5091
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:09,910
it gets frustrated how dumb i am and
trying to explain something to me i was

5092
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:09,920
trying to explain something to me i was
 

5093
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:10,950
trying to explain something to me i was
like well that means you're not

5094
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:10,960
like well that means you're not
 

5095
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,070
like well that means you're not
intelligent because if you were

5096
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:12,080
intelligent because if you were
 

5097
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,590
intelligent because if you were
intelligent you'd be able to explain it

5098
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:13,600
intelligent you'd be able to explain it
 

5099
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,750
intelligent you'd be able to explain it
simply yeah of course you know there's

5100
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:15,760
simply yeah of course you know there's
 

5101
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,189
simply yeah of course you know there's
also the other option of course we could

5102
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:17,199
also the other option of course we could
 

5103
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,950
also the other option of course we could
enhance ourselves and and without

5104
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:18,960
enhance ourselves and and without
 

5105
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,030
enhance ourselves and and without
devices we we are already sort of

5106
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:21,040
devices we we are already sort of
 

5107
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,189
devices we we are already sort of
symbiotic with our compute devices right

5108
01:28:23,189 --> 01:28:23,199
symbiotic with our compute devices right
 

5109
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:25,030
symbiotic with our compute devices right
with our phones and other things and you

5110
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:25,040
with our phones and other things and you
 

5111
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,030
with our phones and other things and you
know this stuff like neural link and etc

5112
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,040
know this stuff like neural link and etc
 

5113
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,709
know this stuff like neural link and etc
that could be could could advance that

5114
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:28,719
that could be could could advance that
 

5115
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:31,270
that could be could could advance that
further um so i think there's lots of

5116
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:31,280
further um so i think there's lots of
 

5117
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,510
further um so i think there's lots of
lots of really amazing possibilities uh

5118
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:33,520
lots of really amazing possibilities uh
 

5119
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,510
lots of really amazing possibilities uh
that i could foresee from here well let

5120
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:35,520
that i could foresee from here well let
 

5121
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,270
that i could foresee from here well let
me ask you some wild questions so out

5122
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:37,280
me ask you some wild questions so out
 

5123
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,070
me ask you some wild questions so out
there

5124
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:38,080
there
 

5125
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,830
there
looking for friends

5126
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:39,840
looking for friends
 

5127
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,189
looking for friends
do you think there's a lot of alien

5128
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:41,199
do you think there's a lot of alien
 

5129
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,030
do you think there's a lot of alien
civilizations out there

5130
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:43,040
civilizations out there
 

5131
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,110
civilizations out there
so i guess this also goes back to your

5132
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
so i guess this also goes back to your
 

5133
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,870
so i guess this also goes back to your
origin of life question too because i

5134
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:46,880
origin of life question too because i
 

5135
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,310
origin of life question too because i
think that that's key

5136
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:48,320
think that that's key
 

5137
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:49,270
think that that's key
um

5138
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:49,280
um
 

5139
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,350
um
my personal opinion looking at all this

5140
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,360
my personal opinion looking at all this
 

5141
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,790
my personal opinion looking at all this
and and you know it's one of my hobbies

5142
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
and and you know it's one of my hobbies
 

5143
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:55,750
and and you know it's one of my hobbies
physics i guess so so i i you know it's

5144
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:55,760
physics i guess so so i i you know it's
 

5145
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,110
physics i guess so so i i you know it's
something i think about a lot and talk

5146
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:57,120
something i think about a lot and talk
 

5147
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,590
something i think about a lot and talk
to a lot of experts on and and and read

5148
01:28:59,590 --> 01:28:59,600
to a lot of experts on and and and read
 

5149
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,070
to a lot of experts on and and and read
a lot of books on and i think

5150
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,080
a lot of books on and i think
 

5151
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,310
a lot of books on and i think
my feeling currently is that that we are

5152
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:04,320
my feeling currently is that that we are
 

5153
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,629
my feeling currently is that that we are
alone i think that's the most likely

5154
01:29:06,629 --> 01:29:06,639
alone i think that's the most likely
 

5155
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,470
alone i think that's the most likely
scenario given what what evidence we

5156
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:08,480
scenario given what what evidence we
 

5157
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,510
scenario given what what evidence we
have so um and the reasoning is i think

5158
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:11,520
have so um and the reasoning is i think
 

5159
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,870
have so um and the reasoning is i think
that

5160
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:12,880
that
 

5161
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,950
that
you know we've tried since uh things

5162
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:14,960
you know we've tried since uh things
 

5163
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,110
you know we've tried since uh things
like seti program and i guess since the

5164
01:29:17,110 --> 01:29:17,120
like seti program and i guess since the
 

5165
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:20,070
like seti program and i guess since the
dawning of the the space age uh we've

5166
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:20,080
dawning of the the space age uh we've
 

5167
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,750
dawning of the the space age uh we've
you know had telescopes open radio

5168
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:21,760
you know had telescopes open radio
 

5169
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,070
you know had telescopes open radio
telescopes and other things and if you

5170
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:24,080
telescopes and other things and if you
 

5171
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,189
telescopes and other things and if you
think about um and try to detect signals

5172
01:29:27,189 --> 01:29:27,199
think about um and try to detect signals
 

5173
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,870
think about um and try to detect signals
now if you think about the evolution of

5174
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:28,880
now if you think about the evolution of
 

5175
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,189
now if you think about the evolution of
humans on earth we could have easily

5176
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:31,199
humans on earth we could have easily
 

5177
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,390
humans on earth we could have easily
been um a million years ahead of our

5178
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:34,400
been um a million years ahead of our
 

5179
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,470
been um a million years ahead of our
time now or million years behind quite

5180
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:36,480
time now or million years behind quite
 

5181
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,709
time now or million years behind quite
easily with just some slightly different

5182
01:29:38,709 --> 01:29:38,719
easily with just some slightly different
 

5183
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:40,629
easily with just some slightly different
quirk thing happening hundreds of

5184
01:29:40,629 --> 01:29:40,639
quirk thing happening hundreds of
 

5185
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,550
quirk thing happening hundreds of
thousands years ago uh you know things

5186
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:42,560
thousands years ago uh you know things
 

5187
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:43,669
thousands years ago uh you know things
could have been slightly different if

5188
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:43,679
could have been slightly different if
 

5189
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,590
could have been slightly different if
the bto had hit the dinosaurs a million

5190
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:45,600
the bto had hit the dinosaurs a million
 

5191
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,790
the bto had hit the dinosaurs a million
years earlier maybe things would have

5192
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:46,800
years earlier maybe things would have
 

5193
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,590
years earlier maybe things would have
evolved uh we'd be a million years

5194
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:49,600
evolved uh we'd be a million years
 

5195
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,270
evolved uh we'd be a million years
ahead of where we are now so what that

5196
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:51,280
ahead of where we are now so what that
 

5197
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,350
ahead of where we are now so what that
means is if you imagine where humanity

5198
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:53,360
means is if you imagine where humanity
 

5199
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,830
means is if you imagine where humanity
will be in a few hundred years let alone

5200
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:55,840
will be in a few hundred years let alone
 

5201
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,910
will be in a few hundred years let alone
a million years especially if we

5202
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:57,920
a million years especially if we
 

5203
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,510
a million years especially if we
hopefully um

5204
01:29:59,510 --> 01:29:59,520
hopefully um
 

5205
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,790
hopefully um
you know solve things like climate

5206
01:30:00,790 --> 01:30:00,800
you know solve things like climate
 

5207
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,790
you know solve things like climate
change and other things and we continue

5208
01:30:02,790 --> 01:30:02,800
change and other things and we continue
 

5209
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,070
change and other things and we continue
to flourish

5210
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:04,080
to flourish
 

5211
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,990
to flourish
and we build things like ai and we do

5212
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,000
and we build things like ai and we do
 

5213
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,830
and we build things like ai and we do
space traveling and all of the stuff

5214
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:07,840
space traveling and all of the stuff
 

5215
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,990
space traveling and all of the stuff
that that humans have dreamed of for

5216
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,000
that that humans have dreamed of for
 

5217
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,750
that that humans have dreamed of for
forever right and sci-fi has talked

5218
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:11,760
forever right and sci-fi has talked
 

5219
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,310
forever right and sci-fi has talked
about forever um

5220
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,320
about forever um
 

5221
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,390
about forever um
we will be spreading across the stars

5222
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:16,400
we will be spreading across the stars
 

5223
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,149
we will be spreading across the stars
right and void neumann famously

5224
01:30:18,149 --> 01:30:18,159
right and void neumann famously
 

5225
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:19,830
right and void neumann famously
calculated you know it would only take

5226
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:19,840
calculated you know it would only take
 

5227
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,270
calculated you know it would only take
about a million years if you send out

5228
01:30:21,270 --> 01:30:21,280
about a million years if you send out
 

5229
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:23,270
about a million years if you send out
von neumann probes to the nearest you

5230
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:23,280
von neumann probes to the nearest you
 

5231
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,270
von neumann probes to the nearest you
know the nearest uh uh other solar

5232
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:25,280
know the nearest uh uh other solar
 

5233
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,510
know the nearest uh uh other solar
systems and and then they built all they

5234
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:27,520
systems and and then they built all they
 

5235
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,030
systems and and then they built all they
did was build two more versions of

5236
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:29,040
did was build two more versions of
 

5237
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,550
did was build two more versions of
themselves and set those two out to the

5238
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:30,560
themselves and set those two out to the
 

5239
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,550
themselves and set those two out to the
next nearest systems uh you you know

5240
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:32,560
next nearest systems uh you you know
 

5241
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,910
next nearest systems uh you you know
within a million years i think you would

5242
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:33,920
within a million years i think you would
 

5243
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,750
within a million years i think you would
have one of these probes in every system

5244
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:35,760
have one of these probes in every system
 

5245
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,310
have one of these probes in every system
in the galaxy so it's not actually in

5246
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:38,320
in the galaxy so it's not actually in
 

5247
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,310
in the galaxy so it's not actually in
cosmo cosmological time that's actually

5248
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:40,320
cosmo cosmological time that's actually
 

5249
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,990
cosmo cosmological time that's actually
a very short amount of time

5250
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,000
a very short amount of time
 

5251
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,750
a very short amount of time
so and and you know we've people like

5252
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:43,760
so and and you know we've people like
 

5253
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,510
so and and you know we've people like
dyson have thought about constructing

5254
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:45,520
dyson have thought about constructing
 

5255
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,669
dyson have thought about constructing
dyson spheres around stars to collect

5256
01:30:47,669 --> 01:30:47,679
dyson spheres around stars to collect
 

5257
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:49,669
dyson spheres around stars to collect
all the energy coming out of the star

5258
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:49,679
all the energy coming out of the star
 

5259
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:50,790
all the energy coming out of the star
you know that there would be

5260
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:50,800
you know that there would be
 

5261
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,390
you know that there would be
constructions like that would be visible

5262
01:30:52,390 --> 01:30:52,400
constructions like that would be visible
 

5263
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,030
constructions like that would be visible
across base um probably even across a

5264
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:55,040
across base um probably even across a
 

5265
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,590
across base um probably even across a
galaxy so and then you know if you think

5266
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:57,600
galaxy so and then you know if you think
 

5267
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,149
galaxy so and then you know if you think
about all of our radio television uh

5268
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:00,159
about all of our radio television uh
 

5269
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,149
about all of our radio television uh
emissions that have gone out since since

5270
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:02,159
emissions that have gone out since since
 

5271
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:05,510
emissions that have gone out since since
the you know 30s and 40s um imagine a

5272
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:05,520
the you know 30s and 40s um imagine a
 

5273
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,310
the you know 30s and 40s um imagine a
million years of that and now hundreds

5274
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:08,320
million years of that and now hundreds
 

5275
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,229
million years of that and now hundreds
of civilizations doing that when we

5276
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:10,239
of civilizations doing that when we
 

5277
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,629
of civilizations doing that when we
opened our ears at the point we got

5278
01:31:12,629 --> 01:31:12,639
opened our ears at the point we got
 

5279
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,790
opened our ears at the point we got
technologically sophisticated enough in

5280
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:14,800
technologically sophisticated enough in
 

5281
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,110
technologically sophisticated enough in
the space age we should have

5282
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:17,120
the space age we should have
 

5283
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,189
the space age we should have
heard a cacophony of voices we should

5284
01:31:19,189 --> 01:31:19,199
heard a cacophony of voices we should
 

5285
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,870
heard a cacophony of voices we should
have joined that cacophony of voices and

5286
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:20,880
have joined that cacophony of voices and
 

5287
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,950
have joined that cacophony of voices and
what we did we opened our ears and we

5288
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:22,960
what we did we opened our ears and we
 

5289
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,390
what we did we opened our ears and we
heard nothing

5290
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:24,400
heard nothing
 

5291
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,550
heard nothing
and many people who argue that there are

5292
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:26,560
and many people who argue that there are
 

5293
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,229
and many people who argue that there are
aliens would say well we haven't really

5294
01:31:28,229 --> 01:31:28,239
aliens would say well we haven't really
 

5295
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:30,390
aliens would say well we haven't really
done exhaustive search yet and maybe

5296
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,400
done exhaustive search yet and maybe
 

5297
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,390
done exhaustive search yet and maybe
we're looking in the wrong bands and and

5298
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:32,400
we're looking in the wrong bands and and
 

5299
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,830
we're looking in the wrong bands and and
we've got the wrong devices and we

5300
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:33,840
we've got the wrong devices and we
 

5301
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,750
we've got the wrong devices and we
wouldn't notice what an alien form was

5302
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:35,760
wouldn't notice what an alien form was
 

5303
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,270
wouldn't notice what an alien form was
like to be so different to what we're

5304
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280
like to be so different to what we're
 

5305
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,430
like to be so different to what we're
used to but you know i'm not i don't

5306
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:39,440
used to but you know i'm not i don't
 

5307
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,510
used to but you know i'm not i don't
really buy that that it shouldn't be as

5308
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:41,520
really buy that that it shouldn't be as
 

5309
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,350
really buy that that it shouldn't be as
difficult as that like we i think we've

5310
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:43,360
difficult as that like we i think we've
 

5311
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,950
difficult as that like we i think we've
searched enough there should be if it

5312
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:44,960
searched enough there should be if it
 

5313
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,470
searched enough there should be if it
were everywhere if it was it should be

5314
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:46,480
were everywhere if it was it should be
 

5315
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,550
were everywhere if it was it should be
everywhere we should see dyson's fears

5316
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:48,560
everywhere we should see dyson's fears
 

5317
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,470
everywhere we should see dyson's fears
being put up sun's blinking in and out

5318
01:31:50,470 --> 01:31:50,480
being put up sun's blinking in and out
 

5319
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,510
being put up sun's blinking in and out
you know there should be a lot of

5320
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:51,520
you know there should be a lot of
 

5321
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,110
you know there should be a lot of
evidence for those things and then there

5322
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:53,120
evidence for those things and then there
 

5323
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,790
evidence for those things and then there
are other people argue well the sort of

5324
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:54,800
are other people argue well the sort of
 

5325
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,550
are other people argue well the sort of
safari view of like well we're a

5326
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:56,560
safari view of like well we're a
 

5327
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:57,830
safari view of like well we're a
primitive species still because we're

5328
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:57,840
primitive species still because we're
 

5329
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,990
primitive species still because we're
not space faring yet and and and we're

5330
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,000
not space faring yet and and and we're
 

5331
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,510
not space faring yet and and and we're
you know there's some kind of globe like

5332
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:01,520
you know there's some kind of globe like
 

5333
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,669
you know there's some kind of globe like
universal rule not to interfere star

5334
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:03,679
universal rule not to interfere star
 

5335
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,750
universal rule not to interfere star
trek rule but like look look we can't

5336
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:05,760
trek rule but like look look we can't
 

5337
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,669
trek rule but like look look we can't
even coordinate humans to deal with

5338
01:32:07,669 --> 01:32:07,679
even coordinate humans to deal with
 

5339
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:10,229
even coordinate humans to deal with
climate change and we're one species

5340
01:32:10,229 --> 01:32:10,239
climate change and we're one species
 

5341
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:11,990
climate change and we're one species
what is the chance that of all of these

5342
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:12,000
what is the chance that of all of these
 

5343
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,669
what is the chance that of all of these
different human civilization you know

5344
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
different human civilization you know
 

5345
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,270
different human civilization you know
alien civilizations they would have the

5346
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:15,280
alien civilizations they would have the
 

5347
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,070
alien civilizations they would have the
same priorities and and and and agree

5348
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:18,080
same priorities and and and and agree
 

5349
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,070
same priorities and and and and agree
across you know these kind of matters

5350
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:20,080
across you know these kind of matters
 

5351
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,310
across you know these kind of matters
and even if that was true and we were in

5352
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:22,320
and even if that was true and we were in
 

5353
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:25,110
and even if that was true and we were in
some sort of safari for our own good to

5354
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:25,120
some sort of safari for our own good to
 

5355
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,390
some sort of safari for our own good to
me that's not much different from the

5356
01:32:26,390 --> 01:32:26,400
me that's not much different from the
 

5357
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:27,990
me that's not much different from the
simulation hypothesis because what does

5358
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:28,000
simulation hypothesis because what does
 

5359
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,750
simulation hypothesis because what does
it mean the simulation hypothesis i

5360
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:29,760
it mean the simulation hypothesis i
 

5361
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,350
it mean the simulation hypothesis i
think in its most fundamental level it

5362
01:32:31,350 --> 01:32:31,360
think in its most fundamental level it
 

5363
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,750
think in its most fundamental level it
means what we're seeing is not quite

5364
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:33,760
means what we're seeing is not quite
 

5365
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,590
means what we're seeing is not quite
reality right it's something there's

5366
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:35,600
reality right it's something there's
 

5367
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:37,590
reality right it's something there's
something more deeper underlying it

5368
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:37,600
something more deeper underlying it
 

5369
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,149
something more deeper underlying it
maybe computational now if we were in a

5370
01:32:40,149 --> 01:32:40,159
maybe computational now if we were in a
 

5371
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:42,629
maybe computational now if we were in a
if we were in a sort of safari park and

5372
01:32:42,629 --> 01:32:42,639
if we were in a sort of safari park and
 

5373
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,229
if we were in a sort of safari park and
everything we were seeing was a hologram

5374
01:32:44,229 --> 01:32:44,239
everything we were seeing was a hologram
 

5375
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,910
everything we were seeing was a hologram
and it was projected by the aliens or

5376
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:45,920
and it was projected by the aliens or
 

5377
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,270
and it was projected by the aliens or
whatever that to me is not much

5378
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:47,280
whatever that to me is not much
 

5379
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,110
whatever that to me is not much
different than thinking we're inside of

5380
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:49,120
different than thinking we're inside of
 

5381
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,870
different than thinking we're inside of
another universe because we still can't

5382
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:50,880
another universe because we still can't
 

5383
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:53,430
another universe because we still can't
see true reality right i mean there's

5384
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:53,440
see true reality right i mean there's
 

5385
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,510
see true reality right i mean there's
there's other explanations it could be

5386
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:55,520
there's other explanations it could be
 

5387
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,709
there's other explanations it could be
that

5388
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:56,719
that
 

5389
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:58,070
that
the way they're communicating is just

5390
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:58,080
the way they're communicating is just
 

5391
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,750
the way they're communicating is just
fundamentally different that we're too

5392
01:32:59,750 --> 01:32:59,760
fundamentally different that we're too
 

5393
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,910
fundamentally different that we're too
dumb to understand the much better

5394
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,920
dumb to understand the much better
 

5395
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,910
dumb to understand the much better
methods of communication they have it

5396
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:03,920
methods of communication they have it
 

5397
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,470
methods of communication they have it
could be i mean i mean it's silly to say

5398
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:06,480
could be i mean i mean it's silly to say
 

5399
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,350
could be i mean i mean it's silly to say
but

5400
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:07,360
but
 

5401
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:09,990
but
our own thoughts could be the methods by

5402
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
our own thoughts could be the methods by
 

5403
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,910
our own thoughts could be the methods by
which they're communicating like the

5404
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:11,920
which they're communicating like the
 

5405
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,669
which they're communicating like the
place from which our ideas writers talk

5406
01:33:13,669 --> 01:33:13,679
place from which our ideas writers talk
 

5407
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:17,189
place from which our ideas writers talk
about this like the muse yeah

5408
01:33:17,189 --> 01:33:17,199
about this like the muse yeah
 

5409
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:20,229
about this like the muse yeah
it sounds like very kind of uh

5410
01:33:20,229 --> 01:33:20,239
it sounds like very kind of uh
 

5411
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,229
it sounds like very kind of uh
wild but it could be thoughts it could

5412
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:22,239
wild but it could be thoughts it could
 

5413
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:22,950
wild but it could be thoughts it could
be

5414
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:22,960
be
 

5415
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,430
be
some interactions with our mind that we

5416
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:25,440
some interactions with our mind that we
 

5417
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,430
some interactions with our mind that we
think are originating from

5418
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:27,440
think are originating from
 

5419
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,709
think are originating from
us is actually something that uh

5420
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:30,719
us is actually something that uh
 

5421
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,470
us is actually something that uh
is coming from other life forms

5422
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:32,480
is coming from other life forms
 

5423
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,390
is coming from other life forms
elsewhere consciousness itself might be

5424
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:34,400
elsewhere consciousness itself might be
 

5425
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,390
elsewhere consciousness itself might be
that it could be but i don't see any

5426
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
that it could be but i don't see any
 

5427
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,390
that it could be but i don't see any
sensible argument to the why why would

5428
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:38,400
sensible argument to the why why would
 

5429
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,189
sensible argument to the why why would
all of the alien species be using this

5430
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:41,199
all of the alien species be using this
 

5431
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,550
all of the alien species be using this
way yes some of them will be more

5432
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:42,560
way yes some of them will be more
 

5433
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:43,910
way yes some of them will be more
primitive they would be close to our

5434
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:43,920
primitive they would be close to our
 

5435
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,750
primitive they would be close to our
level you know there would there should

5436
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:45,760
level you know there would there should
 

5437
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,590
level you know there would there should
be a whole sort of normal distribution

5438
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:47,600
be a whole sort of normal distribution
 

5439
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,030
be a whole sort of normal distribution
of these things right some would be

5440
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:49,040
of these things right some would be
 

5441
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,430
of these things right some would be
aggressive some would be you know

5442
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:51,440
aggressive some would be you know
 

5443
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,229
aggressive some would be you know
curious others would be very stoical and

5444
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:54,239
curious others would be very stoical and
 

5445
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,070
curious others would be very stoical and
philosophical because you know maybe

5446
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:56,080
philosophical because you know maybe
 

5447
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,910
philosophical because you know maybe
they're a million years older than us

5448
01:33:57,910 --> 01:33:57,920
they're a million years older than us
 

5449
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,149
they're a million years older than us
but it's not it shouldn't be like what i

5450
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,159
but it's not it shouldn't be like what i
 

5451
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:02,390
but it's not it shouldn't be like what i
mean one one alien civilization might be

5452
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:02,400
mean one one alien civilization might be
 

5453
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,830
mean one one alien civilization might be
like that communicating thoughts and

5454
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:03,840
like that communicating thoughts and
 

5455
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,669
like that communicating thoughts and
others but i don't see why you know

5456
01:34:05,669 --> 01:34:05,679
others but i don't see why you know
 

5457
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:07,669
others but i don't see why you know
potentially the hundreds there should be

5458
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:07,679
potentially the hundreds there should be
 

5459
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:09,990
potentially the hundreds there should be
would be uniform in this way right it

5460
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:10,000
would be uniform in this way right it
 

5461
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,070
would be uniform in this way right it
could be a violent dictatorship that the

5462
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:12,080
could be a violent dictatorship that the
 

5463
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,189
could be a violent dictatorship that the
the people the alien civilizations that

5464
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:15,199
the people the alien civilizations that
 

5465
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:17,669
the people the alien civilizations that
uh become successful

5466
01:34:17,669 --> 01:34:17,679
uh become successful
 

5467
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:18,760
uh become successful
become um

5468
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:18,770
become um
 

5469
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:20,550
become um
[Music]

5470
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:20,560
[Music]
 

5471
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:23,189
[Music]
gain the ability to be destructive an

5472
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:23,199
gain the ability to be destructive an
 

5473
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,910
gain the ability to be destructive an
order of magnitude more destructive

5474
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
order of magnitude more destructive
 

5475
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:29,830
order of magnitude more destructive
but of course the the sad thought

5476
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:29,840
but of course the the sad thought
 

5477
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:30,629
but of course the the sad thought
well

5478
01:34:30,629 --> 01:34:30,639
well
 

5479
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:33,189
well
either humans are very special we took a

5480
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:33,199
either humans are very special we took a
 

5481
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:35,669
either humans are very special we took a
lot of leaps that arrived at what it

5482
01:34:35,669 --> 01:34:35,679
lot of leaps that arrived at what it
 

5483
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:37,750
lot of leaps that arrived at what it
means to be human yeah

5484
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:37,760
means to be human yeah
 

5485
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:38,629
means to be human yeah
um

5486
01:34:38,629 --> 01:34:38,639
um
 

5487
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,470
um
there's a question there which was the

5488
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:40,480
there's a question there which was the
 

5489
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,790
there's a question there which was the
hardest which was the most special but

5490
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:42,800
hardest which was the most special but
 

5491
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,109
hardest which was the most special but
also if others have reached this level

5492
01:34:45,109 --> 01:34:45,119
also if others have reached this level
 

5493
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:46,629
also if others have reached this level
and maybe many others have reached this

5494
01:34:46,629 --> 01:34:46,639
and maybe many others have reached this
 

5495
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:47,750
and maybe many others have reached this
level

5496
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:47,760
level
 

5497
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,310
level
the great filter

5498
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:50,320
the great filter
 

5499
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,790
the great filter
that prevented them from going farther

5500
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:52,800
that prevented them from going farther
 

5501
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,109
that prevented them from going farther
to becoming a multi-planetary species or

5502
01:34:55,109 --> 01:34:55,119
to becoming a multi-planetary species or
 

5503
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:57,669
to becoming a multi-planetary species or
reaching out into the stars

5504
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
reaching out into the stars
 

5505
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,590
reaching out into the stars
and those are really important questions

5506
01:34:59,590 --> 01:34:59,600
and those are really important questions
 

5507
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,350
and those are really important questions
for us whether

5508
01:35:01,350 --> 01:35:01,360
for us whether
 

5509
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:02,310
for us whether
um

5510
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,320
um
 

5511
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,430
um
whether there's other alien

5512
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:03,440
whether there's other alien
 

5513
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,109
whether there's other alien
civilizations out there or not this is

5514
01:35:05,109 --> 01:35:05,119
civilizations out there or not this is
 

5515
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:07,430
civilizations out there or not this is
very useful for us to think about if we

5516
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:07,440
very useful for us to think about if we
 

5517
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,109
very useful for us to think about if we
destroy ourselves

5518
01:35:09,109 --> 01:35:09,119
destroy ourselves
 

5519
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:11,590
destroy ourselves
how will we do it and how easy is it to

5520
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:11,600
how will we do it and how easy is it to
 

5521
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,910
how will we do it and how easy is it to
do yeah well you know these are big

5522
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
do yeah well you know these are big
 

5523
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,270
do yeah well you know these are big
questions and i've thought about these a

5524
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:15,280
questions and i've thought about these a
 

5525
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,109
questions and i've thought about these a
lot but the the the interesting thing is

5526
01:35:17,109 --> 01:35:17,119
lot but the the the interesting thing is
 

5527
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:19,669
lot but the the the interesting thing is
that if we're if we're alone

5528
01:35:19,669 --> 01:35:19,679
that if we're if we're alone
 

5529
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:21,030
that if we're if we're alone
that's somewhat comforting from the

5530
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:21,040
that's somewhat comforting from the
 

5531
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:22,629
that's somewhat comforting from the
great filter perspective because it

5532
01:35:22,629 --> 01:35:22,639
great filter perspective because it
 

5533
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,310
great filter perspective because it
probably means the great filters were

5534
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,320
probably means the great filters were
 

5535
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,390
probably means the great filters were
are past us and i'm pretty sure they are

5536
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:26,400
are past us and i'm pretty sure they are
 

5537
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,070
are past us and i'm pretty sure they are
so that by in going back to your origin

01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,080
so that by in going back to your origin
 

5539
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,830
so that by in going back to your origin
of life question there are some

5540
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:29,840
of life question there are some
 

5541
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,590
of life question there are some
incredible things that no one knows how

5542
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:31,600
incredible things that no one knows how
 

5543
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,430
incredible things that no one knows how
happened like obviously the first

life form from chemical soup that seems
 

5547
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,990

pretty hard but i would guess the

5548
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:38,000
pretty hard but i would guess the
 

5549
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,590
pretty hard but i would guess the
multicellular i wouldn't be that

multicellular i wouldn't be that
 

5551
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,750

surprised if we saw single

is it that we somehow figured out that
 

5625
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,350
is it that we somehow figured out that
we could be very powerful when we start

think all of those things you suggest
 

5653
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,470
think all of those things you suggest
for good candidates fire and and and

5654
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:30,480
for good candidates fire and and and

cooking right so that's clearly

5656
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:32,320
cooking right so that's clearly
 

5657
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,149
cooking right so that's clearly
important

5658
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:34,159
important
 

5659
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,390
important
you know energy efficiency yeah cooking

5660
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:36,400
you know energy efficiency yeah cooking
 

5661
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,870
you know energy efficiency yeah cooking
our meat and then and then being able to

5662
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880
our meat and then and then being able to
 

5663
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,870
our meat and then and then being able to
to to be more efficient about eating it

5664
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:40,880
to to be more efficient about eating it
 

5665
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:43,350
to to be more efficient about eating it
and getting it consuming the energy um i

5666
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
and getting it consuming the energy um i
 

5667
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:45,109
and getting it consuming the energy um i
think that's huge and then utilizing

5668
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,119
think that's huge and then utilizing
 

5669
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:46,870
think that's huge and then utilizing
fire and tools i think you're right

5670
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:46,880
fire and tools i think you're right
 

5671
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,030
fire and tools i think you're right
about the the tribal cooperation aspects

and probably language as part of that

5674
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:50,639
and probably language as part of that
 

5675
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,390
and probably language as part of that
yes um because probably that's what

5676
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:52,400
yes um because probably that's what
 

5677
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,070
yes um because probably that's what
allowed us to outcompete neanderthals

5678
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:54,080
allowed us to outcompete neanderthals
 

5679
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,629
allowed us to outcompete neanderthals
and and perhaps less cooperative species

5680
01:37:56,629 --> 01:37:56,639
and and perhaps less cooperative species
 

5681
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:59,430
and and perhaps less cooperative species
so um so that may be the case tool

5682
01:37:59,430 --> 01:37:59,440
so um so that may be the case tool
 

5683
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,870
so um so that may be the case tool
making spears axes i think that let us i

5684
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:02,880
making spears axes i think that let us i
 

5685
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,470
making spears axes i think that let us i
mean i think it's pretty clear now that

5686
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:04,480
mean i think it's pretty clear now that
 

5687
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,990
mean i think it's pretty clear now that
humans were responsible for a lot of the

5688
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:06,000
humans were responsible for a lot of the
 

5689
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,629
humans were responsible for a lot of the
extinctions of megafauna um especially

5690
01:38:08,629 --> 01:38:08,639
extinctions of megafauna um especially
 

5691
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,270
extinctions of megafauna um especially
in in the americas when humans arrived

5692
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:11,280
in in the americas when humans arrived
 

5693
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,070
in in the americas when humans arrived
so uh you can imagine once you discover

5694
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:14,080
so uh you can imagine once you discover
 

5695
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,830
so uh you can imagine once you discover
tool usage how powerful that would have

5696
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:15,840
tool usage how powerful that would have
 

5697
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,070
tool usage how powerful that would have
been and how scary for animals so i

5698
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:18,080
been and how scary for animals so i
 

5699
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,510
been and how scary for animals so i
think all of those could have been

5700
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:19,520
think all of those could have been
 

5701
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,270
think all of those could have been
explanations for it you know the

5702
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:21,280
explanations for it you know the
 

5703
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,109
explanations for it you know the
interesting thing is that it's a bit

5704
01:38:23,109 --> 01:38:23,119
interesting thing is that it's a bit
 

5705
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:25,030
interesting thing is that it's a bit
like general intelligence too is it's

5706
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:25,040
like general intelligence too is it's
 

5707
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,430
like general intelligence too is it's
very costly to begin with to have a

5708
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:27,440
very costly to begin with to have a
 

5709
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,390
very costly to begin with to have a
brain

5710
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:28,400
brain
 

5711
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,830
brain
and especially a general purpose brain

5712
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:29,840
and especially a general purpose brain
 

5713
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:31,189
and especially a general purpose brain
rather than a special purpose one

5714
01:38:31,189 --> 01:38:31,199
rather than a special purpose one
 

5715
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:32,470
rather than a special purpose one
because the amount of energy our brains

5716
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:32,480
because the amount of energy our brains
 

5717
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,070
because the amount of energy our brains
use i think it's like 20 of the body's

5718
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:34,080
use i think it's like 20 of the body's
 

5719
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,310
use i think it's like 20 of the body's
energy and it's it's massive and when

5720
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:36,320
energy and it's it's massive and when
 

5721
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,830
energy and it's it's massive and when
you're thinking chest one of the funny

5722
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:37,840
you're thinking chest one of the funny
 

5723
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:39,830
you're thinking chest one of the funny
things that that we used to say is as

5724
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:39,840
things that that we used to say is as
 

5725
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,470
things that that we used to say is as
much as a racing driver uses for a whole

5726
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:42,480
much as a racing driver uses for a whole
 

5727
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,070
much as a racing driver uses for a whole
you know formula one race if just

5728
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,080
you know formula one race if just
 

5729
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,669
you know formula one race if just
playing a game of you know serious high

5730
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:45,679
playing a game of you know serious high
 

5731
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:46,870
playing a game of you know serious high
level chess which you you know you

5732
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:46,880
level chess which you you know you
 

5733
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,109
level chess which you you know you
wouldn't think just sitting there um

5734
01:38:49,109 --> 01:38:49,119
wouldn't think just sitting there um
 

5735
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:51,189
wouldn't think just sitting there um
because the brain's using so much uh

5736
01:38:51,189 --> 01:38:51,199
because the brain's using so much uh
 

5737
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,189
because the brain's using so much uh
energy so in order for an animal an

5738
01:38:53,189 --> 01:38:53,199
energy so in order for an animal an
 

5739
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:55,750
energy so in order for an animal an
organism to justify that there has to be

5740
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:55,760
organism to justify that there has to be
 

5741
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:59,109
organism to justify that there has to be
a huge payoff and the problem with with

5742
01:38:59,109 --> 01:38:59,119
a huge payoff and the problem with with
 

5743
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:01,910
a huge payoff and the problem with with
half a brain or half you know

5744
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:01,920
half a brain or half you know
 

5745
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,189
half a brain or half you know
intelligence saying iqs of you know

5746
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:05,199
intelligence saying iqs of you know
 

5747
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:07,510
intelligence saying iqs of you know
of like a monkey brain it's

5748
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:07,520
of like a monkey brain it's
 

5749
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,510
of like a monkey brain it's
it's not clear you can justify that

5750
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:09,520
it's not clear you can justify that
 

5751
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,270
it's not clear you can justify that
evolutionary until you get to the human

5752
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:11,280
evolutionary until you get to the human
 

5753
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,510
evolutionary until you get to the human
level brain and so but how do you how do

5754
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:13,520
level brain and so but how do you how do
 

5755
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,270
level brain and so but how do you how do
you do that jump it's very difficult

5756
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,280
you do that jump it's very difficult
 

5757
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,709
you do that jump it's very difficult
which is why i think it's only been done

5758
01:39:16,709 --> 01:39:16,719
which is why i think it's only been done
 

5759
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:18,470
which is why i think it's only been done
once from the sort of specialized brains

5760
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:18,480
once from the sort of specialized brains
 

5761
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,629
once from the sort of specialized brains
that you see in animals to this sort of

5762
01:39:20,629 --> 01:39:20,639
that you see in animals to this sort of
 

5763
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,750
that you see in animals to this sort of
general purpose chewing powerful brains

5764
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:23,760
general purpose chewing powerful brains
 

5765
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,189
general purpose chewing powerful brains
that humans have um and which allows us

5766
01:39:27,189 --> 01:39:27,199
that humans have um and which allows us
 

5767
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:30,149
that humans have um and which allows us
to invent the modern modern world um and

5768
01:39:30,149 --> 01:39:30,159
to invent the modern modern world um and
 

5769
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:32,709
to invent the modern modern world um and
uh you know it takes a lot to to cross

5770
01:39:32,709 --> 01:39:32,719
uh you know it takes a lot to to cross
 

5771
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,310
uh you know it takes a lot to to cross
that barrier and i think we've seen the

5772
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,320
that barrier and i think we've seen the
 

5773
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,550
that barrier and i think we've seen the
same with ai systems which is that uh

5774
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:36,560
same with ai systems which is that uh
 

5775
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,629
same with ai systems which is that uh
maybe until very recently it's always

5776
01:39:38,629 --> 01:39:38,639
maybe until very recently it's always
 

5777
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,790
maybe until very recently it's always
been easier to craft a specific solution

5778
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:40,800
been easier to craft a specific solution
 

5779
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,870
been easier to craft a specific solution
to a problem like chess than it has been

5780
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:42,880
to a problem like chess than it has been
 

5781
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,470
to a problem like chess than it has been
to build a general learning system that

5782
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:44,480
to build a general learning system that
 

5783
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,310
to build a general learning system that
could potentially do many things because

5784
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:46,320
could potentially do many things because
 

5785
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,629
could potentially do many things because
initially uh that system will be way

5786
01:39:48,629 --> 01:39:48,639
initially uh that system will be way
 

5787
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:51,030
initially uh that system will be way
worse than uh less efficient than the

5788
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:51,040
worse than uh less efficient than the
 

5789
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,629
worse than uh less efficient than the
specialized system so one of the

5790
01:39:52,629 --> 01:39:52,639
specialized system so one of the
 

5791
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:53,750
specialized system so one of the
interesting

5792
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:53,760
interesting
 

5793
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,590
interesting
quirks of the human mind of this evolved

5794
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:57,600
quirks of the human mind of this evolved
 

5795
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,830
quirks of the human mind of this evolved
system is that it appears to be

5796
01:39:59,830 --> 01:39:59,840
system is that it appears to be
 

5797
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:01,189
system is that it appears to be

5798
01:40:01,189 --> 01:40:01,199
conscious
 

5799
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:02,310
conscious
this thing that we don't quite

5800
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:02,320
this thing that we don't quite
 

5801
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:05,430
this thing that we don't quite
understand but it seems very

5802
01:40:05,430 --> 01:40:05,440
understand but it seems very
 

5803
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,590
understand but it seems very
very special its ability to have a

5804
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:07,600
very special its ability to have a
 

5805
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,510
very special its ability to have a
subjective experience that it feels like

5806
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:09,520
subjective experience that it feels like
 

5807
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,950
subjective experience that it feels like
something

5808
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:10,960
something
 

5809
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,350
something
to eat a cookie the deliciousness of it

5810
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:13,360
to eat a cookie the deliciousness of it
 

5811
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,510
to eat a cookie the deliciousness of it
or see a color and that kind of stuff do

5812
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:15,520
or see a color and that kind of stuff do
 

5813
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,830
or see a color and that kind of stuff do
you think in order to solve intelligence

5814
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:17,840
you think in order to solve intelligence
 

5815
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,590
you think in order to solve intelligence
we also need to solve consciousness

5816
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:19,600
we also need to solve consciousness
 

5817
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,229
we also need to solve consciousness
along the way do you think agi systems

5818
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
along the way do you think agi systems
 

5819
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:25,270
along the way do you think agi systems
need to have consciousness in order to

5820
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,280
need to have consciousness in order to
 

5821
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:26,310
need to have consciousness in order to
be

5822
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:26,320
be
 

5823
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,629
be
truly intelligent yeah we thought about

5824
01:40:28,629 --> 01:40:28,639
truly intelligent yeah we thought about
 

5825
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,750
truly intelligent yeah we thought about
this a lot actually and um i think that

5826
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:31,760
this a lot actually and um i think that
 

5827
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,430
this a lot actually and um i think that
my guess is that consciousness and

5828
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:33,440
my guess is that consciousness and
 

5829
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:35,830
my guess is that consciousness and
intelligence are double dissociable so

5830
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:35,840
intelligence are double dissociable so
 

5831
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:37,430
intelligence are double dissociable so
you can have one without the other both

5832
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:37,440
you can have one without the other both
 

5833
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,149
you can have one without the other both
ways and i think you can see that with

5834
01:40:40,149 --> 01:40:40,159
ways and i think you can see that with
 

5835
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,070
ways and i think you can see that with
consciousness in that i think some

5836
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:42,080
consciousness in that i think some
 

5837
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,950
consciousness in that i think some
animals and pets if you have a pet dog

5838
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:44,960
animals and pets if you have a pet dog
 

5839
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,870
animals and pets if you have a pet dog
or something like that you can see some

5840
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:46,880
or something like that you can see some
 

5841
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,390
or something like that you can see some
of the higher animals and dolphins

5842
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:48,400
of the higher animals and dolphins
 

5843
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,310
of the higher animals and dolphins
things like that are uh have

5844
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,320
things like that are uh have
 

5845
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:54,550
things like that are uh have
self-awareness and uh very sociable um

5846
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:54,560
self-awareness and uh very sociable um
 

5847
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:57,189
self-awareness and uh very sociable um
seem to dream um you know those kinds of

5848
01:40:57,189 --> 01:40:57,199
seem to dream um you know those kinds of
 

5849
01:40:57,199 --> 01:40:59,030
seem to dream um you know those kinds of
a lot of the traits one would regard as

5850
01:40:59,030 --> 01:40:59,040
a lot of the traits one would regard as
 

5851
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:01,669
a lot of the traits one would regard as
being kind of conscious and self-aware

5852
01:41:01,669 --> 01:41:01,679
being kind of conscious and self-aware
 

5853
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:04,229
being kind of conscious and self-aware
um and but yet they're not that smart

5854
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:04,239
um and but yet they're not that smart
 

5855
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,229
um and but yet they're not that smart
right uh so they're not that intelligent

5856
01:41:06,229 --> 01:41:06,239
right uh so they're not that intelligent
 

5857
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,550
right uh so they're not that intelligent
by by say iq standards or something like

5858
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:08,560
by by say iq standards or something like
 

5859
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,470
by by say iq standards or something like
that yeah it's also possible that our

5860
01:41:10,470 --> 01:41:10,480
that yeah it's also possible that our
 

5861
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,790
that yeah it's also possible that our
understanding of intelligence is flawed

5862
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:12,800
understanding of intelligence is flawed
 

5863
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,270
understanding of intelligence is flawed
like putting an iq to it sure maybe the

5864
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:15,280
like putting an iq to it sure maybe the
 

5865
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,270
like putting an iq to it sure maybe the
thing that a dog can do

5866
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,280
thing that a dog can do
 

5867
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,830
thing that a dog can do
is actually gone very far along the path

5868
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
is actually gone very far along the path
 

5869
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,430
is actually gone very far along the path
of intelligence and we humans are just

5870
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:21,440
of intelligence and we humans are just
 

5871
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:22,390
of intelligence and we humans are just
able to

5872
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:22,400
able to
 

5873
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,950
able to
play chess and maybe write poems right

5874
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:24,960
play chess and maybe write poems right
 

5875
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,950
play chess and maybe write poems right
but if we go back to the idea of agi and

5876
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:26,960
but if we go back to the idea of agi and
 

5877
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,390
but if we go back to the idea of agi and
general intelligence you know dogs are

5878
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:28,400
general intelligence you know dogs are
 

5879
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,990
general intelligence you know dogs are
very specialized right most animals are

5880
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:30,000
very specialized right most animals are
 

5881
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,430
very specialized right most animals are
pretty specialized they can be amazing

5882
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,440
pretty specialized they can be amazing
 

5883
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,189
pretty specialized they can be amazing
at what they do but they're like kind of

5884
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:33,199
at what they do but they're like kind of
 

5885
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:35,510
at what they do but they're like kind of
elite sports sports people or something

5886
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:35,520
elite sports sports people or something
 

5887
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,669
elite sports sports people or something
right so they do one thing extremely

5888
01:41:37,669 --> 01:41:37,679
right so they do one thing extremely
 

5889
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:39,430
right so they do one thing extremely
well because their entire brain is is

5890
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:39,440
well because their entire brain is is
 

5891
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,189
well because their entire brain is is
optimized they have somehow convinced

5892
01:41:41,189 --> 01:41:41,199
optimized they have somehow convinced
 

5893
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:43,030
optimized they have somehow convinced
the entirety of the human population to

5894
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:43,040
the entirety of the human population to
 

5895
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,950
the entirety of the human population to
feed them and service them so in some

5896
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:44,960
feed them and service them so in some
 

5897
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,109
feed them and service them so in some
way they're controlling yes exactly well

5898
01:41:47,109 --> 01:41:47,119
way they're controlling yes exactly well
 

5899
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,590
way they're controlling yes exactly well
we co-evolved to some crazy degree right

5900
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:49,600
we co-evolved to some crazy degree right
 

5901
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,590
we co-evolved to some crazy degree right
uh including the the way the dogs you

5902
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:51,600
uh including the the way the dogs you
 

5903
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,830
uh including the the way the dogs you
know even even wag their tails and

5904
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:53,840
know even even wag their tails and
 

5905
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,590
know even even wag their tails and
twitch their noses right we find we're

5906
01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:55,600
twitch their noses right we find we're
 

5907
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,790
twitch their noses right we find we're
finding inexorably cute yeah um but i

5908
01:41:58,790 --> 01:41:58,800
finding inexorably cute yeah um but i
 

5909
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,030
finding inexorably cute yeah um but i
think um you can also see intelligence

5910
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:01,040
think um you can also see intelligence
 

5911
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,629
think um you can also see intelligence
on the other side so systems like

5912
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
on the other side so systems like
 

5913
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,350
on the other side so systems like
artificial systems that are amazingly

5914
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:05,360
artificial systems that are amazingly
 

5915
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:07,510
artificial systems that are amazingly
smart at certain things like maybe

5916
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:07,520
smart at certain things like maybe
 

5917
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,590
smart at certain things like maybe
playing go and chess and other things

5918
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600
playing go and chess and other things
 

5919
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,310
playing go and chess and other things
but they don't feel at all in any shape

5920
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:12,320
but they don't feel at all in any shape
 

5921
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,550
but they don't feel at all in any shape
or form conscious in the way that you

5922
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:14,560
or form conscious in the way that you
 

5923
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:18,550
or form conscious in the way that you
know you do to me or i do to you and um

5924
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:18,560
know you do to me or i do to you and um
 

5925
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:19,990
know you do to me or i do to you and um
and i think actually

5926
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:20,000
and i think actually
 

5927
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,350
and i think actually
building ai

5928
01:42:21,350 --> 01:42:21,360
building ai
 

5929
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:24,229
building ai
is uh these intelligent constructs uh is

5930
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:24,239
is uh these intelligent constructs uh is
 

5931
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:25,830
is uh these intelligent constructs uh is
one of the best ways to explore the

5932
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:25,840
one of the best ways to explore the
 

5933
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:27,270
one of the best ways to explore the
mystery of consciousness to break it

5934
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:27,280
mystery of consciousness to break it
 

5935
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,149
mystery of consciousness to break it
down because um we're going to have

5936
01:42:30,149 --> 01:42:30,159
down because um we're going to have
 

5937
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:32,229
down because um we're going to have
devices that are

5938
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:32,239
devices that are
 

5939
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:34,470
devices that are
pretty smart at certain things or

5940
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:34,480
pretty smart at certain things or
 

5941
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,629
pretty smart at certain things or
capable of certain things but

5942
01:42:36,629 --> 01:42:36,639
capable of certain things but
 

5943
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:39,109
capable of certain things but
potentially won't have any semblance of

5944
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:39,119
potentially won't have any semblance of
 

5945
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:40,950
potentially won't have any semblance of
self-awareness or other things and in

5946
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:40,960
self-awareness or other things and in
 

5947
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,550
self-awareness or other things and in
fact i would advocate

5948
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:42,560
fact i would advocate
 

5949
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,790
fact i would advocate
if there's a choice building systems in

5950
01:42:44,790 --> 01:42:44,800
if there's a choice building systems in
 

5951
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,950
if there's a choice building systems in
the first place ai systems that are not

5952
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:46,960
the first place ai systems that are not
 

5953
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:49,270
the first place ai systems that are not
conscious to begin with uh are just

5954
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:49,280
conscious to begin with uh are just
 

5955
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,310
conscious to begin with uh are just
tools um until we understand them better

5956
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:52,320
tools um until we understand them better
 

5957
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,310
tools um until we understand them better
and the capabilities better so on that

5958
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:54,320
and the capabilities better so on that
 

5959
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,470
and the capabilities better so on that
topic just not

just as a human being let me ask you

5964
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:00,800
just as a human being let me ask you
 

5965
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,870
just as a human being let me ask you
about this one particular anecdotal

5966
01:43:02,870 --> 01:43:02,880
about this one particular anecdotal
 

5967
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,189
about this one particular anecdotal
evidence of the google engineer

5968
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:05,199
evidence of the google engineer
 

5969
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:07,109
evidence of the google engineer
who made a comment

5970
01:43:07,109 --> 01:43:07,119
who made a comment
 

5971
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:07,990
who made a comment
or

5972
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:08,000
or
 

5973
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,149
or
believed that there's some aspect of a

5974
01:43:10,149 --> 01:43:10,159
believed that there's some aspect of a
 

5975
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,669
believed that there's some aspect of a
language model

5976
01:43:11,669 --> 01:43:11,679
language model
 

5977
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:14,390
language model
the lambda language model that exhibited

5978
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:14,400
the lambda language model that exhibited
 

5979
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:15,830
the lambda language model that exhibited
sentience

5980
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:15,840
sentience
 

5981
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,590
sentience
so you said you believe there might be a

5982
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:17,600
so you said you believe there might be a
 

5983
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,430
so you said you believe there might be a
responsibility to build systems that are

5984
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440
responsibility to build systems that are
 

5985
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,390
responsibility to build systems that are
not essential and this experience of a

5986
01:43:22,390 --> 01:43:22,400
not essential and this experience of a
 

5987
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,709
not essential and this experience of a
particular engineer i think i'd love to

5988
01:43:24,709 --> 01:43:24,719
particular engineer i think i'd love to
 

5989
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:26,149
particular engineer i think i'd love to
get your general opinion on this kind of

5990
01:43:26,149 --> 01:43:26,159
get your general opinion on this kind of
 

5991
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:28,070
get your general opinion on this kind of
thing but i think it will happen more

5992
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:28,080
thing but i think it will happen more
 

5993
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,430
thing but i think it will happen more
and more and more

5994
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:29,440
and more and more
 

5995
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:31,910
and more and more
which uh not when engineers but when

5996
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:31,920
which uh not when engineers but when
 

5997
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,030
which uh not when engineers but when
people out there that don't have an

5998
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:33,040
people out there that don't have an
 

5999
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,629
people out there that don't have an
engineering background start interacting

6000
01:43:34,629 --> 01:43:34,639
engineering background start interacting
 

6001
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,030
engineering background start interacting
with increasingly intelligent systems

6002
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:37,040
with increasingly intelligent systems
 

6003
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,910
with increasingly intelligent systems
we anthropomorphize them they they start

6004
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:39,920
we anthropomorphize them they they start
 

6005
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,030
we anthropomorphize them they they start
to have deep impactful

6006
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:43,040
to have deep impactful
 

6007
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,430
to have deep impactful
um interactions with us in a way that we

6008
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:45,440
um interactions with us in a way that we
 

6009
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,910
um interactions with us in a way that we
miss them yeah when they're gone

6010
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:47,920
miss them yeah when they're gone
 

6011
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:48,629
miss them yeah when they're gone
and

6012
01:43:48,629 --> 01:43:48,639
and
 

6013
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,790
and
we sure feel like they're

6014
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:50,800
we sure feel like they're
 

6015
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:53,270
we sure feel like they're
living entities self-aware entities and

6016
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:53,280
living entities self-aware entities and
 

6017
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:55,430
living entities self-aware entities and
maybe even we project sentience onto

6018
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:55,440
maybe even we project sentience onto
 

6019
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,430
maybe even we project sentience onto
them so what what's your thought about

6020
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:57,440
them so what what's your thought about
 

6021
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,870
them so what what's your thought about
this particular

6022
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
this particular
 

6023
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,189
this particular
uh system was is uh

6024
01:44:01,189 --> 01:44:01,199
uh system was is uh
 

6025
01:44:01,199 --> 01:44:02,950
uh system was is uh
have you ever met a language model

6026
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:02,960
have you ever met a language model
 

6027
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,470
have you ever met a language model
that's sentient

6028
01:44:04,470 --> 01:44:04,480
that's sentient
 

6029
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:07,510
that's sentient
no i no no what do you make of the case

6030
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:07,520
no i no no what do you make of the case
 

6031
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,950
no i no no what do you make of the case
of when you kind of

6032
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:08,960
of when you kind of
 

6033
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,990
of when you kind of
feel

6034
01:44:09,990 --> 01:44:10,000
feel
 

6035
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,669
feel
that there's some elements of sentience

6036
01:44:11,669 --> 01:44:11,679
that there's some elements of sentience
 

6037
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13,830
that there's some elements of sentience
to this system yeah so this is you know

6038
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:13,840
to this system yeah so this is you know
 

6039
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,750
to this system yeah so this is you know
an interesting question and uh uh

6040
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:15,760
an interesting question and uh uh
 

6041
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,830
an interesting question and uh uh
obviously a very fundamental one so

6042
01:44:17,830 --> 01:44:17,840
obviously a very fundamental one so
 

6043
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,910
obviously a very fundamental one so
first thing to say is i think that

6044
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:19,920
first thing to say is i think that
 

6045
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:21,590
first thing to say is i think that
none of the systems we have today i i

6046
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:21,600
none of the systems we have today i i
 

6047
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:24,310
none of the systems we have today i i
would say even have one iota of uh

6048
01:44:24,310 --> 01:44:24,320
would say even have one iota of uh
 

6049
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,149
would say even have one iota of uh
semblance of consciousness or sentience

6050
01:44:26,149 --> 01:44:26,159
semblance of consciousness or sentience
 

6051
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:28,310
semblance of consciousness or sentience
that's my personal feeling interacting

6052
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:28,320
that's my personal feeling interacting
 

6053
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,229
that's my personal feeling interacting
with them every day so i think that's

6054
01:44:30,229 --> 01:44:30,239
with them every day so i think that's
 

6055
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,629
with them every day so i think that's
way premature to be discussing what that

6056
01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:32,639
way premature to be discussing what that
 

6057
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:34,550
way premature to be discussing what that
engineer talked about i appreciate i

6058
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:34,560
engineer talked about i appreciate i
 

6059
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,830
engineer talked about i appreciate i
think at the moment it's more of a

6060
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:35,840
think at the moment it's more of a
 

6061
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,750
think at the moment it's more of a
projection of the way our own minds work

6062
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:37,760
projection of the way our own minds work
 

6063
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,189
projection of the way our own minds work
which is to see

6064
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:39,199
which is to see
 

6065
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:42,950
which is to see
uh uh uh sort of purpose and direction

6066
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:42,960
uh uh uh sort of purpose and direction
 

6067
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,629
uh uh uh sort of purpose and direction
in almost anything that we you know our

6068
01:44:44,629 --> 01:44:44,639
in almost anything that we you know our
 

6069
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:47,350
in almost anything that we you know our

6070
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:47,360
brains are trained to interpret uh
 

6071
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:50,070
brains are trained to interpret uh
agency basically in things uh even the

6072
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:50,080
agency basically in things uh even the
 

6073
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,470

language is so fundamental to

01:44:56,390 --> 01:44:56,400
language is so fundamental to

01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:57,760
intelligence that's going to be easy for
 

6081
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,229
intelligence that's going to be easy for
us to anthropomorphize that

us to anthropomorphize that
 

6083
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:03,430
us to anthropomorphize that
i mean back in the day even the first uh

6084
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:03,440
i mean back in the day even the first uh

a psychologist so just basically rabbit

6096
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:15,440
a psychologist so just basically rabbit
 

6097
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:17,030

back to you the same question you asked

6098
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:17,040
back to you the same question you asked
 

6099
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,109
back to you the same question you asked
it back to you um

6100
01:45:19,109 --> 01:45:19,119
it back to you um
 

6101
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:21,350
it back to you um
and uh some people believe that so i

6102
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:21,360
and uh some people believe that so i
 

6103
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,109
and uh some people believe that so i
don't think we can this is why i think

6104
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:23,119
don't think we can this is why i think
 

6105
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:24,470
don't think we can this is why i think
the turing test is a little bit flawed

6106
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
the turing test is a little bit flawed
 

6107
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,229
the turing test is a little bit flawed
as a formal test because it depends on

6108
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:26,239
as a formal test because it depends on
 

6109
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:28,629
as a formal test because it depends on
the sophistication of the of the judge

6110
01:45:28,629 --> 01:45:28,639
the sophistication of the of the judge
 

6111
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:31,590
the sophistication of the of the judge
um whether or not they are qualified to

6112
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:31,600
um whether or not they are qualified to
 

6113
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:34,149
um whether or not they are qualified to
make that distinction so

6114
01:45:34,149 --> 01:45:34,159
make that distinction so
 

6115
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:36,629
make that distinction so
i think we should uh talk to you know

6116
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:36,639
i think we should uh talk to you know
 

6117
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:38,149
i think we should uh talk to you know
the the top philosophers about this

6118
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:38,159
the the top philosophers about this
 

6119
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:40,229
the the top philosophers about this
people like daniel dennett and uh david

6120
01:45:40,229 --> 01:45:40,239
people like daniel dennett and uh david
 

6121
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:41,750
people like daniel dennett and uh david
chalmers and others who've obviously

6122
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:41,760
chalmers and others who've obviously
 

6123
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,590
chalmers and others who've obviously
thought deeply about consciousness of

6124
01:45:43,590 --> 01:45:43,600
thought deeply about consciousness of
 

6125
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,270
thought deeply about consciousness of
course consciousness itself hasn't been

6126
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:45,280
course consciousness itself hasn't been
 

6127
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,830
course consciousness itself hasn't been
well there's no agreed definition if i

6128
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:47,840
well there's no agreed definition if i
 

6129
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,109
well there's no agreed definition if i
was to you know uh speculate about that

6130
01:45:51,109 --> 01:45:51,119
was to you know uh speculate about that
 

6131
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:53,189
was to you know uh speculate about that
uh you know i kind of the definite the

6132
01:45:53,189 --> 01:45:53,199
uh you know i kind of the definite the
 

6133
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:55,189
uh you know i kind of the definite the
working definition i like is it's the

6134
01:45:55,189 --> 01:45:55,199
working definition i like is it's the
 

6135
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:57,109
working definition i like is it's the
way information feels when you know it

6136
01:45:57,109 --> 01:45:57,119
way information feels when you know it
 

6137
01:45:57,119 --> 01:45:59,109
way information feels when you know it
gets processed i think maybe max tegmark

6138
01:45:59,109 --> 01:45:59,119
gets processed i think maybe max tegmark
 

6139
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:00,870
gets processed i think maybe max tegmark
came up with that i like that idea i

6140
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:00,880
came up with that i like that idea i
 

6141
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:02,070
came up with that i like that idea i
don't know if it helps us get towards

6142
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:02,080
don't know if it helps us get towards
 

6143
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:04,470
don't know if it helps us get towards
any more operational thing but but it's

6144
01:46:04,470 --> 01:46:04,480
any more operational thing but but it's
 

6145
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,149
any more operational thing but but it's
it's it's i think it's a nice way of

it's it's i think it's a nice way of
viewing it um i think we can obviously

6148
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:08,800
viewing it um i think we can obviously
 

6149
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,149
viewing it um i think we can obviously

see from neuroscience certain
 

6151
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:11,750
see from neuroscience certain
prerequisites that are required like

6152
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:11,760
prerequisites that are required like
 

6153
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:14,470
prerequisites that are required like
self-awareness i think is necessary but

6154
01:46:14,470 --> 01:46:14,480
self-awareness i think is necessary but
 

6155
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,709
self-awareness i think is necessary but
not sufficient component this idea of a

you know these things are maybe memory

6162
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:24,320
you know these things are maybe memory
 

6163
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,550
you know these things are maybe memory
um these things are probably needed for

6164
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:26,560
um these things are probably needed for
 

6165
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,590
um these things are probably needed for
a sentient or conscious being um but but

6166
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:29,600
a sentient or conscious being um but but
 

6167
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,109
a sentient or conscious being um but but
the reason that the difficult thing i

6168
01:46:31,109 --> 01:46:31,119
the reason that the difficult thing i
 

6169
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:32,390
the reason that the difficult thing i
think for us when we get and i think

6170
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:32,400
think for us when we get and i think
 

6171
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,270
think for us when we get and i think
this is a really interesting

6172
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:33,280
this is a really interesting
 

6173
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,669
this is a really interesting
philosophical debate is when we get

6174
01:46:35,669 --> 01:46:35,679
philosophical debate is when we get
 

6175
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:38,870
philosophical debate is when we get
closer to agi and and and you know

6176
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:38,880
closer to agi and and and you know
 

6177
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:40,629
closer to agi and and and you know
and and much more powerful systems than

6178
01:46:40,629 --> 01:46:40,639
and and much more powerful systems than
 

6179
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:41,830
and and much more powerful systems than
we have today

6180
01:46:41,830 --> 01:46:41,840
we have today
 

6181
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,430
we have today
um how are we going to make this

6182
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:43,440
um how are we going to make this
 

6183
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:46,550
um how are we going to make this
judgment and one way which is the turing

6184
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:46,560
judgment and one way which is the turing
 

6185
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,030
judgment and one way which is the turing
test is sort of a behavioral judgment is

6186
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:49,040
test is sort of a behavioral judgment is
 

6187
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,629
test is sort of a behavioral judgment is
is the system exhibiting all the

6188
01:46:50,629 --> 01:46:50,639
is the system exhibiting all the
 

6189
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,070
is the system exhibiting all the
behaviors um that a human sentient uh or

6190
01:46:54,070 --> 01:46:54,080
behaviors um that a human sentient uh or
 

6191
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,590
behaviors um that a human sentient uh or
a sentient being would would would

6192
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:55,600
a sentient being would would would
 

6193
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,590
a sentient being would would would
exhibit um is it answering the right

6194
01:46:57,590 --> 01:46:57,600
exhibit um is it answering the right
 

6195
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:59,030
exhibit um is it answering the right
questions is it saying the right things

6196
01:46:59,030 --> 01:46:59,040
questions is it saying the right things
 

6197
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,830
questions is it saying the right things
is it indistinguishable from a human um

6198
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:01,840
is it indistinguishable from a human um
 

6199
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,270
is it indistinguishable from a human um
and so on

6200
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:03,280
and so on
 

6201
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,910
and so on
but i think there's a second thing that

6202
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:05,920
but i think there's a second thing that
 

6203
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,470
but i think there's a second thing that
makes us as humans regard each other as

6204
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:08,480
makes us as humans regard each other as
 

6205
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,629
makes us as humans regard each other as
sentient right why do we why do we think

6206
01:47:10,629 --> 01:47:10,639
sentient right why do we why do we think
 

6207
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:11,990
sentient right why do we why do we think
this and i debated this with daniel

6208
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:12,000
this and i debated this with daniel
 

6209
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,430
this and i debated this with daniel
dennett and i think there's a second

6210
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:13,440
dennett and i think there's a second
 

6211
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,750
dennett and i think there's a second
reason that's often overlooked which is

6212
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:15,760
reason that's often overlooked which is
 

6213
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,910
reason that's often overlooked which is
that we're running on the same substrate

6214
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:17,920
that we're running on the same substrate
 

6215
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,750
that we're running on the same substrate
right so if we're exhibiting the same

6216
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:19,760
right so if we're exhibiting the same
 

6217
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,790
right so if we're exhibiting the same
behavior uh more or less as humans and

6218
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:22,800
behavior uh more or less as humans and
 

6219
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,310
behavior uh more or less as humans and
we're running on the same you know

6220
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:24,320
we're running on the same you know
 

6221
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,149
we're running on the same you know
carbon-based biological substrate the

6222
01:47:26,149 --> 01:47:26,159
carbon-based biological substrate the
 

6223
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:28,310
carbon-based biological substrate the
squishy you know few pounds of of flesh

6224
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:28,320
squishy you know few pounds of of flesh
 

6225
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,030
squishy you know few pounds of of flesh
in our skulls then the most parsimonious

6226
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:31,040
in our skulls then the most parsimonious
 

6227
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,350
in our skulls then the most parsimonious
i think explanation is that you're

6228
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:33,360
i think explanation is that you're
 

6229
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,870
i think explanation is that you're
feeling the same thing as i'm feeling

6230
01:47:34,870 --> 01:47:34,880
feeling the same thing as i'm feeling
 

6231
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:37,270
feeling the same thing as i'm feeling
right but we will never have that second

6232
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:37,280
right but we will never have that second
 

6233
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,669
right but we will never have that second
part the substrate equivalence with a

6234
01:47:39,669 --> 01:47:39,679
part the substrate equivalence with a
 

6235
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:40,629
part the substrate equivalence with a
machine

6236
01:47:40,629 --> 01:47:40,639
machine
 

6237
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:42,629
machine
right so we will have to only judge

6238
01:47:42,629 --> 01:47:42,639
right so we will have to only judge
 

6239
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:44,470
right so we will have to only judge
based on the behavior and i think the

6240
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:44,480
based on the behavior and i think the
 

6241
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,709
based on the behavior and i think the
substrate equivalence is a critical part

6242
01:47:46,709 --> 01:47:46,719
substrate equivalence is a critical part
 

6243
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:48,470
substrate equivalence is a critical part
of why we make assumptions that we're

6244
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:48,480
of why we make assumptions that we're
 

6245
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:50,229
of why we make assumptions that we're
conscious and in fact even with with

6246
01:47:50,229 --> 01:47:50,239
conscious and in fact even with with
 

6247
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:51,990
conscious and in fact even with with
animals high-level animals why we think

6248
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:52,000
animals high-level animals why we think
 

6249
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,270
animals high-level animals why we think
they might be because they're exhibiting

6250
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:53,280
they might be because they're exhibiting
 

6251
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,550
they might be because they're exhibiting
some of the behaviors we would expect

6252
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:54,560
some of the behaviors we would expect
 

6253
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,310
some of the behaviors we would expect
from a sentient animal and we know

6254
01:47:56,310 --> 01:47:56,320
from a sentient animal and we know
 

6255
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:57,430
from a sentient animal and we know
they're made of the same things

6256
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:57,440
they're made of the same things
 

6257
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,030
they're made of the same things
biological neurons so we're gonna have

6258
01:47:59,030 --> 01:47:59,040
biological neurons so we're gonna have
 

6259
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,109
biological neurons so we're gonna have
to come up with

6260
01:48:01,109 --> 01:48:01,119
to come up with
 

6261
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:03,910
to come up with
explanations uh or models of the gap

6262
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:03,920
explanations uh or models of the gap
 

6263
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:06,550
explanations uh or models of the gap
between substrate differences between

6264
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:06,560
between substrate differences between
 

6265
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,270
between substrate differences between
machines and humans did to get anywhere

6266
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:09,280
machines and humans did to get anywhere
 

6267
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:11,750
machines and humans did to get anywhere
beyond the behavioral but to me sort of

6268
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:11,760
beyond the behavioral but to me sort of
 

6269
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,830
beyond the behavioral but to me sort of
the practical question is

6270
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:13,840
the practical question is
 

6271
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,070
the practical question is
very interesting and very important when

6272
01:48:16,070 --> 01:48:16,080
very interesting and very important when
 

6273
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:18,229
very interesting and very important when
you have millions perhaps billions of

you have millions perhaps billions of
 

6275
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:19,990
you have millions perhaps billions of
people believing that you have ascension

how does that change the world

6288
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:33,040
how does that change the world

how does that change the world
what's the responsibility of the ai

questions and and also critical ones and
 

6325
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:16,550

we've been thinking about this uh since

6326
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:16,560
we've been thinking about this uh since
 

6327
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,390
we've been thinking about this uh since
the start of d minor before that because

6328
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:18,400
the start of d minor before that because
 

6329
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,790
the start of d minor before that because
we planned for success and you know how

6330
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:20,800
we planned for success and you know how
 

6331
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,629

that looked like back in 2010 and we've
always had sort of these ethical

01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:32,800
the language models is and and large

and guard rails what they can and can't
 

6351
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,830
and guard rails what they can and can't
do and so on to deploy them at scale

6352
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:43,840
do and so on to deploy them at scale
 

6353
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,070
do and so on to deploy them at scale
because i think you know there are big

it what what do you do about answering

01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:54,400
it what what do you do about answering
 

6363
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,310
it what what do you do about answering
those philosophical questions about the

so i think there's a whole bunch of

naive actors or crazy actors right so
 

6437
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:14,070

garden misuse of existing dual use
 

6441
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,109
garden misuse of existing dual use
technology and then of course there's an

01:51:19,109 --> 01:51:19,119
technology and then of course there's an
 

6443
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:21,109

additional uh uh thing that has to be

additional uh uh thing that has to be
 

6445
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,030
additional uh uh thing that has to be
overcome with ai that eventually it may

uh good or bad in in in of itself so i
 

6451
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,550
uh good or bad in in in of itself so i
think these questions have to be

think these questions have to be
 

6453
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,669

technologies like ai

6464
01:51:44,229 --> 01:51:44,239
technologies like ai
 

6465
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:46,390
technologies like ai
if something goes wrong it may cause you

6466
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:46,400
if something goes wrong it may cause you
 

6467
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,709
if something goes wrong it may cause you
know a lot of harm before you can fix it

6468
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:48,719
know a lot of harm before you can fix it
 

6469
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,470
know a lot of harm before you can fix it
um it's not like a you know an imaging

6470
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:50,480
um it's not like a you know an imaging
 

6471
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:53,189
um it's not like a you know an imaging
app or game app where you know that if

6472
01:51:53,189 --> 01:51:53,199
app or game app where you know that if
 

6473
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:55,189
app or game app where you know that if
if something goes wrong it's relatively

6474
01:51:55,189 --> 01:51:55,199
if something goes wrong it's relatively
 

6475
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:56,709
if something goes wrong it's relatively
easy to fix and and the harm's

6476
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:56,719
easy to fix and and the harm's
 

6477
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:58,790
easy to fix and and the harm's
relatively small so i think

6478
01:51:58,790 --> 01:51:58,800
relatively small so i think
 

6479
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:01,350
relatively small so i think
it comes with you know the the the usual

6480
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:01,360
it comes with you know the the the usual
 

6481
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:03,910
it comes with you know the the the usual
uh cliche of like with a lot of power

6482
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:03,920
uh cliche of like with a lot of power
 

6483
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,270
uh cliche of like with a lot of power
comes a lot of responsibility and i

6484
01:52:05,270 --> 01:52:05,280
comes a lot of responsibility and i
 

6485
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,030
comes a lot of responsibility and i
think that's the case here with things

6486
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:07,040
think that's the case here with things
 

6487
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:09,030
think that's the case here with things
like ai given the the enormous

6488
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:09,040
like ai given the the enormous
 

6489
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,830
like ai given the the enormous
opportunity in front of us and i think

6490
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:11,840
opportunity in front of us and i think
 

6491
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,629
opportunity in front of us and i think
we need a lot of voices uh and as many

6492
01:52:14,629 --> 01:52:14,639
we need a lot of voices uh and as many
 

6493
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:17,109
we need a lot of voices uh and as many
inputs into things like the design of

6494
01:52:17,109 --> 01:52:17,119
inputs into things like the design of
 

6495
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:19,109
inputs into things like the design of
the systems and the values

6496
01:52:19,109 --> 01:52:19,119
the systems and the values
 

6497
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:20,550
the systems and the values
they should have and what goals should

6498
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:20,560
they should have and what goals should
 

6499
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:23,109
they should have and what goals should
they be put to um i think as wide a

6500
01:52:23,109 --> 01:52:23,119
they be put to um i think as wide a
 

6501
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:24,950
they be put to um i think as wide a
group of voices as possible beyond just

6502
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:24,960
group of voices as possible beyond just
 

6503
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:27,109
group of voices as possible beyond just
the technologies is needed uh to input

6504
01:52:27,109 --> 01:52:27,119
the technologies is needed uh to input
 

6505
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:28,950
the technologies is needed uh to input
into that and to have a say in that

6506
01:52:28,950 --> 01:52:28,960
into that and to have a say in that
 

6507
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:30,550
into that and to have a say in that
especially when it comes to deployment

6508
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:30,560
especially when it comes to deployment
 

6509
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,229
especially when it comes to deployment
of these systems which is when the

6510
01:52:32,229 --> 01:52:32,239
of these systems which is when the
 

6511
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:33,589
of these systems which is when the
rubber really hits the road it really

6512
01:52:33,589 --> 01:52:33,599
rubber really hits the road it really
 

6513
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,270
rubber really hits the road it really

6514
01:52:35,270 --> 01:52:35,280

rather than fundamental research and

6516
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:37,360
rather than fundamental research and
 

6517
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,030
rather than fundamental research and
that's why i say

6518
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:39,040
that's why i say
 

6519
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,550
that's why i say
i think as a first step it would be

6520
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:40,560
i think as a first step it would be
 

6521
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:42,870
i think as a first step it would be
better if we have the choice to build

6522
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:42,880
better if we have the choice to build
 

6523
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:45,510
better if we have the choice to build
these systems as tools to give and i'm

6524
01:52:45,510 --> 01:52:45,520
these systems as tools to give and i'm
 

6525
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:46,709
these systems as tools to give and i'm
not saying that it should never they

6526
01:52:46,709 --> 01:52:46,719
not saying that it should never they
 

6527
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:47,990
not saying that it should never they
should never go beyond tools because of

6528
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:48,000
should never go beyond tools because of
 

6529
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,390
should never go beyond tools because of
course the potential is there um for it

6530
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:50,400
course the potential is there um for it
 

6531
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:53,830
course the potential is there um for it
to go way beyond just tools uh but um i

6532
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:53,840
to go way beyond just tools uh but um i
 

6533
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,830
to go way beyond just tools uh but um i
think that would be a good first step

6534
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:55,840
think that would be a good first step
 

6535
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,830
think that would be a good first step
in order for us to you know allow us to

6536
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:57,840
in order for us to you know allow us to
 

6537
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,510
in order for us to you know allow us to
carefully experiment understand what

6538
01:52:59,510 --> 01:52:59,520
carefully experiment understand what
 

6539
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,070
carefully experiment understand what
these things can do so the leap between

01:53:08,070 --> 01:53:08,080
should take very careful yes

let me ask a dark personal question

6546
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:10,960
let me ask a dark personal question
 

6547
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,030
let me ask a dark personal question
so you're one of the most brilliant

6548
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:13,040
so you're one of the most brilliant
 

6549
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,629
so you're one of the most brilliant
people in the ag community also one of

01:53:29,589 --> 01:53:29,599
would be one of the most

01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:30,950
would be one of the most

to be one of the people
 

6583
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,750
to be one of the people
i would say probably the most likely

01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:49,760
i would say probably the most likely

01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,830
i would say probably the most likely

01:53:55,030 --> 01:53:55,040
do you think about
 

6591
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:57,270
do you think about
the corrupting nature of power when you

6592
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:57,280
the corrupting nature of power when you
 

6593
01:53:57,280 --> 01:54:00,310
the corrupting nature of power when you
talk about these kinds of systems that

6594
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:00,320
talk about these kinds of systems that
 

6595
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,950
talk about these kinds of systems that
um as all dictators

6596
01:54:02,950 --> 01:54:02,960
um as all dictators
 

6597
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:05,030
um as all dictators
and people have caused atrocities in the

but they don't do good because the
 

6603
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:12,149
but they don't do good because the

6605
01:54:12,159 --> 01:54:14,229
powers polluted their mind about what is
good and what is evil do you think about

6606
01:54:14,229 --> 01:54:14,239
good and what is evil do you think about
 

6607
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:15,589
good and what is evil do you think about
this stuff or are we just focused on

6608
01:54:15,589 --> 01:54:15,599
this stuff or are we just focused on
 

6609
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:17,669
this stuff or are we just focused on
language modeling no i think about them

6610
01:54:17,669 --> 01:54:17,679
language modeling no i think about them
 

6611
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:20,470
language modeling no i think about them
all the time and you know i think

6612
01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:20,480
all the time and you know i think
 

6613
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,470
all the time and you know i think
what are the defenses against that i

6614
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:22,480
what are the defenses against that i
 

6615
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:24,229
what are the defenses against that i
think one thing is to remain very

6616
01:54:24,229 --> 01:54:24,239
think one thing is to remain very

scratch is or new field is very humbling
 

6647
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:54,950
scratch is or new field is very humbling
right so for me that's been biology over

6648
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:54,960
right so for me that's been biology over
 

6649
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:57,270
right so for me that's been biology over
the last five years you know huge area

6650
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:57,280
the last five years you know huge area
 

6651
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:59,430
the last five years you know huge area
topic and and and it's been and i just

6652
01:54:59,430 --> 01:54:59,440
topic and and and it's been and i just
 

6653

and
and then the other important thing is to

6660
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:06,480
and then the other important thing is to
 

6661
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:09,109
and then the other important thing is to
have a really good amazing set of uh

6662
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:09,119
have a really good amazing set of uh

to keep you that way
and then ultimately just to answer your

6672
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:18,400
and then ultimately just to answer your
 

6673
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,990
and then ultimately just to answer your
question i hope we're going to be a big

6674
01:55:19,990 --> 01:55:20,000
question i hope we're going to be a big
 

6675
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,709
question i hope we're going to be a big
part of of birthing ai and that being

6676
01:55:22,709 --> 01:55:22,719
part of of birthing ai and that being
 

6677
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:24,629
part of of birthing ai and that being
the greatest benefit to humanity of any

6678
01:55:24,629 --> 01:55:24,639
the greatest benefit to humanity of any
 

6679
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:27,430
the greatest benefit to humanity of any
tool or technology ever and and getting

6680
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:27,440
tool or technology ever and and getting
 

6681
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:29,910
tool or technology ever and and getting
us into a world of radical abundance and

6682
01:55:29,910 --> 01:55:29,920
us into a world of radical abundance and
 

6683
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,669
us into a world of radical abundance and
curing diseases and

6684
01:55:31,669 --> 01:55:31,679
curing diseases and
 

6685
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:33,350
curing diseases and
and and solving many of the big

6686
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:33,360
and and solving many of the big
 

6687
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:34,790
and and solving many of the big
challenges we have in front of us and

6688
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:34,800
challenges we have in front of us and
 

6689
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,629
challenges we have in front of us and
then ultimately you know help the

6690
01:55:36,629 --> 01:55:36,639
then ultimately you know help the
 

6691
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:38,310
then ultimately you know help the
ultimate flourishing of humanity to

ultimate flourishing of humanity to
 

6693
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,310
ultimate flourishing of humanity to
travel the stars and find those aliens

6694
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:40,320
travel the stars and find those aliens
 

6695
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,589
travel the stars and find those aliens
if they are there and if they're not

6696
01:55:41,589 --> 01:55:41,599
if they are there and if they're not
 

6697
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:43,350
if they are there and if they're not
there find out why they're not there

6698
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:43,360
there find out why they're not there
 

6699
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,830
there find out why they're not there
what what is going on here in the

6700
01:55:44,830 --> 01:55:44,840
what what is going on here in the
 

6701
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:47,669
what what is going on here in the
universe um this is all to come and and

6702
01:55:47,669 --> 01:55:47,679
universe um this is all to come and and
 

6703
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:50,550
universe um this is all to come and and
that's what i've always dreamed about um

6704
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:50,560
that's what i've always dreamed about um
 

6705
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,310
that's what i've always dreamed about um
but i don't think i think ai is too big

6706
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:52,320
but i don't think i think ai is too big
 

6707
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,790
but i don't think i think ai is too big
an idea it's not going to be uh there'll

6708
01:55:54,790 --> 01:55:54,800
an idea it's not going to be uh there'll
 

6709
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:56,310
an idea it's not going to be uh there'll
be a certain set of pioneers who get

6710
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:56,320
be a certain set of pioneers who get
 

6711
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:57,669
be a certain set of pioneers who get
there first i hope

6712
01:55:57,669 --> 01:55:57,679
there first i hope
 

6713
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:58,870
there first i hope
we're in the vanguard so we can

6714
01:55:58,870 --> 01:55:58,880
we're in the vanguard so we can
 

6715
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,790
we're in the vanguard so we can
influence how that goes and i think it

6716
01:56:00,790 --> 01:56:00,800
influence how that goes and i think it
 

6717
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:03,430
influence how that goes and i think it
matters who builds who which which

6718
01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:03,440
matters who builds who which which
 

6719
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:05,189
matters who builds who which which
cultures they come from and what values

6720
01:56:05,189 --> 01:56:05,199
cultures they come from and what values
 

6721
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:07,669
cultures they come from and what values
they have uh the builders of ai systems

6722
01:56:07,669 --> 01:56:07,679
they have uh the builders of ai systems
 

6723
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:08,870
they have uh the builders of ai systems
because i think even though the ai

6724
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:08,880
because i think even though the ai
 

6725
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,390
because i think even though the ai
system is going to learn for itself most

6726
01:56:10,390 --> 01:56:10,400
system is going to learn for itself most
 

6727
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,790
system is going to learn for itself most
of its knowledge there'll be a residue

6728
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:12,800
of its knowledge there'll be a residue
 

6729
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,790
of its knowledge there'll be a residue
in the system of the culture and the

6730
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:14,800
in the system of the culture and the
 

6731
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,510
in the system of the culture and the
values of the creators of the system um

6732
01:56:17,510 --> 01:56:17,520
values of the creators of the system um
 

6733
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:19,109
values of the creators of the system um
and there's interesting questions to to

6734
01:56:19,109 --> 01:56:19,119
and there's interesting questions to to
 

6735
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:21,270
and there's interesting questions to to
discuss about that geopolitically you

6736
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:21,280
discuss about that geopolitically you
 

6737
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,709
discuss about that geopolitically you
know different cultures as we're in a

6738
01:56:22,709 --> 01:56:22,719
know different cultures as we're in a
 

6739
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:24,070
know different cultures as we're in a
more fragmented world than ever

6740
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:24,080
more fragmented world than ever
 

6741
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,910
more fragmented world than ever
unfortunately i think in terms of global

6742
01:56:25,910 --> 01:56:25,920
unfortunately i think in terms of global
 

6743
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:27,350
unfortunately i think in terms of global
cooperation

6744
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:27,360
cooperation
 

6745
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:29,270
cooperation
we see that in things like climate where

6746
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:29,280
we see that in things like climate where
 

6747
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,350
we see that in things like climate where
we can't seem to get our act together uh

6748
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:31,360
we can't seem to get our act together uh
 

6749
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,270
we can't seem to get our act together uh
globally to cooperate on these pressing

6750
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:33,280
globally to cooperate on these pressing
 

6751
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,189
globally to cooperate on these pressing
matters i hope that will change over

6752
01:56:35,189 --> 01:56:35,199
matters i hope that will change over
 

6753
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:37,189
matters i hope that will change over
time perhaps you know if we get to an

6754
01:56:37,189 --> 01:56:37,199
time perhaps you know if we get to an
 

6755
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:38,950
time perhaps you know if we get to an
era of radical abundance we don't have

6756
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:38,960
era of radical abundance we don't have
 

6757
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:40,629
era of radical abundance we don't have
to be so competitive anymore maybe we

6758
01:56:40,629 --> 01:56:40,639
to be so competitive anymore maybe we
 

6759
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:42,550
to be so competitive anymore maybe we
can be more cooperative

6760
01:56:42,550 --> 01:56:42,560
can be more cooperative
 

6761
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:44,629
can be more cooperative
if resources aren't so scarce it's true

6762
01:56:44,629 --> 01:56:44,639
if resources aren't so scarce it's true
 

6763
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:45,830
if resources aren't so scarce it's true
that

6764
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:45,840
that
 

6765
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:46,790
that
in terms of

6766
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:46,800
in terms of
 

6767
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:48,870
in terms of
power corrupting and leading to

6768
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:48,880
power corrupting and leading to
 

6769
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,350
power corrupting and leading to
destructive things it seems that some of

6770
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:51,360
destructive things it seems that some of
 

6771
01:56:51,360 --> 01:56:53,189
destructive things it seems that some of
the atrocities of the past happen when

6772
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:53,199
the atrocities of the past happen when
 

6773
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:55,109
the atrocities of the past happen when
there's a significant

6774
01:56:55,109 --> 01:56:55,119
there's a significant
 

6775
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:56,950
there's a significant
constraint on resources i think that's

6776
01:56:56,950 --> 01:56:56,960
constraint on resources i think that's
 

6777
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,910
constraint on resources i think that's

from say 10 20 years ago back 10 20

6956
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:03,280
from say 10 20 years ago back 10 20
 

6957
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,430
from say 10 20 years ago back 10 20
years ago it would have been you know a

6958
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:05,440
years ago it would have been you know a
 

6959
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:08,149
years ago it would have been you know a
whole day of

6960
02:00:08,149 --> 02:00:08,159
whole day of
 

6961
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:10,070
whole day of
research individual research or

6962
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:10,080
research individual research or
 

6963
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,830
research individual research or
programming doing some experiment

6964
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:11,840

neuroscience computer science experiment

6966
02:00:13,910 --> 02:00:13,920
neuroscience computer science experiment
 

6967
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,550
neuroscience computer science experiment
reading lots of research papers uh and

6968
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:16,560
reading lots of research papers uh and
 

6969
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:19,589
reading lots of research papers uh and
then perhaps at night time you know um

6970
02:00:19,589 --> 02:00:19,599
then perhaps at night time you know um
 

6971
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:23,189
then perhaps at night time you know um
reading science fiction books or or uh

6972
02:00:23,189 --> 02:00:23,199
reading science fiction books or or uh
 

6973
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:26,310

playing uh some games but lots of focus

6974
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:26,320
playing uh some games but lots of focus
 

6975
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,629
playing uh some games but lots of focus
so like deep focused work on whether

6976
02:00:28,629 --> 02:00:28,639
so like deep focused work on whether
 

6977
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:29,830
so like deep focused work on whether
it's uh

6978
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:29,840
it's uh
 

6979
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,669
it's uh
programming or reading research paper

6980
02:00:31,669 --> 02:00:31,679
programming or reading research paper
 

6981
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:33,270
programming or reading research paper
yes yes so that would be a lot of

6982
02:00:33,270 --> 02:00:33,280
yes yes so that would be a lot of
 

6983
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,430
yes yes so that would be a lot of
debrief you know uh focused work these

6984
02:00:35,430 --> 02:00:35,440
debrief you know uh focused work these
 

6985
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,750
debrief you know uh focused work these
days for the last sort of i guess you

6986
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:37,760
days for the last sort of i guess you
 

6987
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:40,070
days for the last sort of i guess you
know five to ten years i've actually got

6988
02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:40,080
know five to ten years i've actually got
 

6989
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,589
know five to ten years i've actually got
quite a structure that works very well

6990
02:00:41,589 --> 02:00:41,599
quite a structure that works very well
 

6991
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:44,149
quite a structure that works very well
for me now which is that um i'm a night

complete night out always have been so i
 

6995
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,870
complete night out always have been so i
optimized for that so you know i get you

6996
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:48,880
optimized for that so you know i get you
 

6997
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,550
optimized for that so you know i get you
know i basically do a normal day's work

6998
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:50,560
know i basically do a normal day's work
 

6999

where i will do my thinking and reading

7028
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:25,760
where i will do my thinking and reading
 

7029
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:28,870
where i will do my thinking and reading
a research writing research papers um

7030
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:28,880
a research writing research papers um
 

7031
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:30,790
a research writing research papers um
sadly don't have time to code anymore

7032
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:30,800
sadly don't have time to code anymore
 

7033
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,709
sadly don't have time to code anymore
but it's it's not efficient to to do

7034
02:01:32,709 --> 02:01:32,719
but it's it's not efficient to to do
 

7035
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:35,189
but it's it's not efficient to to do
that uh these days uh given the amount

7036
02:01:35,189 --> 02:01:35,199
that uh these days uh given the amount
 

7037
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:37,910
that uh these days uh given the amount
of time i have um but that's when i do

7038
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:37,920
of time i have um but that's when i do
 

7039
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,990
of time i have um but that's when i do
you know maybe do the long kind of

7040
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:40,000
you know maybe do the long kind of
 

7041
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,310
you know maybe do the long kind of
stretches of of thinking and planning

7042
02:01:42,310 --> 02:01:42,320
stretches of of thinking and planning
 

7043
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:44,070
stretches of of thinking and planning
and then probably you know using using

7044
02:01:44,070 --> 02:01:44,080
and then probably you know using using
 

7045
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:45,830
and then probably you know using using
email or other things i would set i

7046
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:45,840
email or other things i would set i
 

7047
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,270
email or other things i would set i
would fire off a lot of things to my

7048
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:47,280
would fire off a lot of things to my
 

7049
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,430
would fire off a lot of things to my
team to deal with the next morning for

7050
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:49,440
team to deal with the next morning for
 

7051
02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:51,510
team to deal with the next morning for
actually thinking about this overnight

7052
02:01:51,510 --> 02:01:51,520
actually thinking about this overnight
 

7053
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,430
actually thinking about this overnight
we should go for this project or arrange

7054
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:53,440
we should go for this project or arrange

this meeting the next day when you're
 

7057
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:56,070
this meeting the next day when you're
thinking through a problem are you

7058
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:56,080
thinking through a problem are you
 

7059
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:57,430
thinking through a problem are you
talking about a sheet of paper or the

7060
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:57,440
talking about a sheet of paper or the
 

7061
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:59,189
talking about a sheet of paper or the
patent pen is there some independent

7062
02:01:59,189 --> 02:01:59,199
patent pen is there some independent
 

7063
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:01,430

structure yeah i like processes i still

7064
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:01,440
structure yeah i like processes i still
 

7065
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,669

like pencil and paper best for working

7066
02:02:03,669 --> 02:02:03,679
like pencil and paper best for working
 

7067
02:02:03,679 --> 02:02:05,990
like pencil and paper best for working
out things but um these days it's just

7068
02:02:05,990 --> 02:02:06,000
out things but um these days it's just
 

7069
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,669
out things but um these days it's just
so efficient to read research papers

7070
02:02:07,669 --> 02:02:07,679
so efficient to read research papers
 

7071
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:09,430
so efficient to read research papers
just on the screen i still often print

7072
02:02:09,430 --> 02:02:09,440
just on the screen i still often print
 

7073
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:11,430
just on the screen i still often print
them out actually i still prefer to

7074
02:02:11,430 --> 02:02:11,440
them out actually i still prefer to
 

7075
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:13,430
them out actually i still prefer to
mark out things and i find it goes into

7076
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:13,440
mark out things and i find it goes into
 

7077
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:15,270
mark out things and i find it goes into
the brain quick better and sticks in the

these most challenging next steps for
example stuff

decide looking at my schedule the next
 

7193
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,149
decide looking at my schedule the next
day that and given where i'm at with

7194
02:04:18,149 --> 02:04:18,159
day that and given where i'm at with
 

7195
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:20,629
day that and given where i'm at with
this particular thought or creative idea

7196
02:04:20,629 --> 02:04:20,639
this particular thought or creative idea
 

7197
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:22,149
this particular thought or creative idea
that i'm going to pay that cost the next

7198
02:04:22,149 --> 02:04:22,159
that i'm going to pay that cost the next

you're too passionate about you that
 

7227
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:46,629
you're too passionate about you that
this is where some of the greatest ideas

7228
02:04:46,629 --> 02:04:46,639
this is where some of the greatest ideas
 

7229
02:04:46,639 --> 02:04:48,470
this is where some of the greatest ideas
could potentially come is when you just

7230
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:48,480
could potentially come is when you just
 

7231
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:51,270
could potentially come is when you just
lose yourself late into yeah

7232

loading in really hard problems in a
 

7237
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:56,790
loading in really hard problems in a
very short amount of time so you have to

7238
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:56,800
very short amount of time so you have to
 

7239
02:04:56,800 --> 02:04:58,310
very short amount of time so you have to
do some kind of first principles

7240
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:58,320
do some kind of first principles
 

7241
02:04:58,320 --> 02:04:59,589
do some kind of first principles
thinking here it's like what's the

7242
02:04:59,589 --> 02:04:59,599
thinking here it's like what's the
 

7243
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:01,189
thinking here it's like what's the
problem what's the state of things

7244
02:05:01,189 --> 02:05:01,199
problem what's the state of things
 

7245
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:03,270
problem what's the state of things
what's the right next step yes you have

7246
02:05:03,270 --> 02:05:03,280
what's the right next step yes you have
 

7247
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:05,030
what's the right next step yes you have
to get really good at context switching

7248
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:05,040
to get really good at context switching
 

7249
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,950
to get really good at context switching
which is one of the hardest things

7250
02:05:06,950 --> 02:05:06,960
which is one of the hardest things
 

7251
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,550
which is one of the hardest things
because especially as we do so many

7252
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:08,560
because especially as we do so many
 

7253
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,149
because especially as we do so many
things if you include all the scientific

7254
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:10,159
things if you include all the scientific
 

7255
02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:11,589
things if you include all the scientific
things we do scientific fields we're

7256
02:05:11,589 --> 02:05:11,599
things we do scientific fields we're
 

7257
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:13,750
things we do scientific fields we're
working in these are entire you know

7258
02:05:13,750 --> 02:05:13,760
working in these are entire you know
 

7259
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,990
working in these are entire you know
complex fields in themselves and you you

7260
02:05:15,990 --> 02:05:16,000
complex fields in themselves and you you
 

7261
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,229
complex fields in themselves and you you
have to sort of keep up to abreast of

7262
02:05:18,229 --> 02:05:18,239
have to sort of keep up to abreast of
 

7263
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:21,750
have to sort of keep up to abreast of
that but i enjoy it i've always been uh

7264
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:21,760
that but i enjoy it i've always been uh
 

7265
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:23,990
that but i enjoy it i've always been uh
a sort of generalist in a way and that's

7266
02:05:23,990 --> 02:05:24,000
a sort of generalist in a way and that's
 

7267
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,109
a sort of generalist in a way and that's
actually what happened with my games

7268
02:05:25,109 --> 02:05:25,119
actually what happened with my games
 

7269
02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:28,069
actually what happened with my games
career after chess i i i one of the

7270
02:05:28,069 --> 02:05:28,079
career after chess i i i one of the
 

7271
02:05:28,079 --> 02:05:29,350
career after chess i i i one of the
reasons i stopped playing chess was that

7272
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:29,360
reasons i stopped playing chess was that
 

7273
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:31,030
reasons i stopped playing chess was that
i got into computers but also i started

7274
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:31,040
i got into computers but also i started
 

7275
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:32,470
i got into computers but also i started
realizing there were many other great

7276
02:05:32,470 --> 02:05:32,480
realizing there were many other great
 

7277
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:34,470
realizing there were many other great
games out there to play too so

7278
02:05:34,470 --> 02:05:34,480
games out there to play too so
 

7279
02:05:34,480 --> 02:05:35,830
games out there to play too so
i've always been that way inclined

7280
02:05:35,830 --> 02:05:35,840
i've always been that way inclined
 

7281
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:37,510
i've always been that way inclined
multidisciplinary and there's too many

7282
02:05:37,510 --> 02:05:37,520
multidisciplinary and there's too many
 

7283
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:39,109
multidisciplinary and there's too many
interesting things in in the world to

7284
02:05:39,109 --> 02:05:39,119
interesting things in in the world to
 

7285
02:05:39,119 --> 02:05:41,589
interesting things in in the world to
spend all your time just on one thing

7286
02:05:41,589 --> 02:05:41,599
spend all your time just on one thing
 

7287
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:43,750
spend all your time just on one thing
so you mentioned spinoza gotta ask the

7288
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:43,760
so you mentioned spinoza gotta ask the
 

7289
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:44,790
so you mentioned spinoza gotta ask the
big

7290
02:05:44,790 --> 02:05:44,800
big
 

7291
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:47,510
big
ridiculously big question about life

7292
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:47,520
ridiculously big question about life
 

7293
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:48,950
ridiculously big question about life
what do you think is the meaning of this

7294
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:48,960
what do you think is the meaning of this
 

7295
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,069
what do you think is the meaning of this
whole thing

7296
02:05:50,069 --> 02:05:50,079
whole thing
 

7297
02:05:50,079 --> 02:05:53,030
whole thing
uh why are we humans here you've already

7298
02:05:53,030 --> 02:05:53,040
uh why are we humans here you've already
 

7299
02:05:53,040 --> 02:05:55,030
uh why are we humans here you've already
mentioned that perhaps the universe

7300
02:05:55,030 --> 02:05:55,040
mentioned that perhaps the universe
 

7301
02:05:55,040 --> 02:05:56,550
mentioned that perhaps the universe
created us

7302
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:56,560
created us
 

7303
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,550
created us
is that why you think we're here

7304
02:05:58,550 --> 02:05:58,560
is that why you think we're here
 

7305
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:00,390
is that why you think we're here
to understand how the universe yeah i

7306
02:06:00,390 --> 02:06:00,400
to understand how the universe yeah i
 

7307
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:02,149
to understand how the universe yeah i
think my answer to that would be and at

7308
02:06:02,149 --> 02:06:02,159
think my answer to that would be and at
 

7309
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:04,470
think my answer to that would be and at
least the the life i'm living is to gain

7310
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:04,480
least the the life i'm living is to gain
 

7311
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:07,189
least the the life i'm living is to gain
and uh to gain and understand the

7312
02:06:07,189 --> 02:06:07,199
and uh to gain and understand the
 

7313
02:06:07,199 --> 02:06:09,189
and uh to gain and understand the
knowledge you know to gain knowledge and

7314
02:06:09,189 --> 02:06:09,199
knowledge you know to gain knowledge and
 

7315
02:06:09,199 --> 02:06:11,030
knowledge you know to gain knowledge and
understand the universe that's what i

7316
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:11,040
understand the universe that's what i
 

7317
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:13,350
understand the universe that's what i
think uh i can't see any higher purpose

7318
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:13,360
think uh i can't see any higher purpose
 

7319
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:14,550
think uh i can't see any higher purpose
than that if you think back to the

7320
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:14,560
than that if you think back to the
 

7321
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:16,229
than that if you think back to the
classical greeks you know the virtue of

7322
02:06:16,229 --> 02:06:16,239
classical greeks you know the virtue of
 

7323
02:06:16,239 --> 02:06:18,390
classical greeks you know the virtue of
gaining knowledge it's uh i think it's

7324
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:18,400
gaining knowledge it's uh i think it's
 

7325
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,470
gaining knowledge it's uh i think it's
that it's one of the few true virtues is

7326
02:06:20,470 --> 02:06:20,480
that it's one of the few true virtues is
 

7327
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:23,510
that it's one of the few true virtues is
to understand um the world around us and

7328
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:23,520
to understand um the world around us and
 

7329
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:26,629
to understand um the world around us and
the context and humanity better and um

7330
02:06:26,629 --> 02:06:26,639
the context and humanity better and um
 

7331
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:28,149
the context and humanity better and um
and i think if you do that you become

7332
02:06:28,149 --> 02:06:28,159
and i think if you do that you become
 

7333
02:06:28,159 --> 02:06:29,830
and i think if you do that you become
more compassionate and more

7334
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:29,840
more compassionate and more
 

7335
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:31,510
more compassionate and more
understanding yourself and and more

7336
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:31,520
understanding yourself and and more
 

7337
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:33,030
understanding yourself and and more
tolerant and all these i think all these

7338
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:33,040
tolerant and all these i think all these
 

7339
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:34,870
tolerant and all these i think all these
other things may flow from that and to

7340
02:06:34,870 --> 02:06:34,880
other things may flow from that and to
 

7341
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:35,669
other things may flow from that and to
me

7342
02:06:35,669 --> 02:06:35,679
me
 

7343
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,030
me
you know understanding the nature of

7344
02:06:37,030 --> 02:06:37,040
you know understanding the nature of
 

7345
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:38,629
you know understanding the nature of
reality that is the biggest question

7346
02:06:38,629 --> 02:06:38,639
reality that is the biggest question
 

7347
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:40,229
reality that is the biggest question
what is going on here is sometimes the

7348
02:06:40,229 --> 02:06:40,239
what is going on here is sometimes the
 

7349
02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:41,910
what is going on here is sometimes the
colloquial way i say what is really

7350
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:41,920
colloquial way i say what is really
 

7351
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,189
colloquial way i say what is really
going on here

7352
02:06:43,189 --> 02:06:43,199
going on here
 

7353
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:45,430
going on here
uh it's so mysterious i feel like we're

7354
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:45,440
uh it's so mysterious i feel like we're
 

7355
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:48,390
uh it's so mysterious i feel like we're
in some huge puzzle and and it's but the

7356
02:06:48,390 --> 02:06:48,400
in some huge puzzle and and it's but the
 

7357
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,790
in some huge puzzle and and it's but the
world is also seems to be the universe

7358
02:06:50,790 --> 02:06:50,800
world is also seems to be the universe
 

7359
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,950
world is also seems to be the universe
seems to be structured in a way you know

7360
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:52,960
seems to be structured in a way you know
 

7361
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:54,310
seems to be structured in a way you know
why is it structured in a way that

7362
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:54,320
why is it structured in a way that
 

7363
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,229
why is it structured in a way that
science is even possible that you know

7364
02:06:56,229 --> 02:06:56,239
science is even possible that you know
 

7365
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:57,990
science is even possible that you know
methods the scientific method works

7366
02:06:57,990 --> 02:06:58,000
methods the scientific method works
 

7367
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,430
methods the scientific method works
things are repeatable

7368
02:06:59,430 --> 02:06:59,440
things are repeatable
 

7369
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:01,910
things are repeatable
um it feels like it's almost structured

7370
02:07:01,910 --> 02:07:01,920
um it feels like it's almost structured
 

7371
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:04,069
um it feels like it's almost structured
in a way to be conducive to gaining

7372
02:07:04,069 --> 02:07:04,079
in a way to be conducive to gaining
 

7373
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:06,390
in a way to be conducive to gaining
knowledge so i feel like and you know

7374
02:07:06,390 --> 02:07:06,400
knowledge so i feel like and you know
 

7375
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,830
knowledge so i feel like and you know
why should computers be even possible

7376
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:07,840
why should computers be even possible
 

7377
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:10,629
why should computers be even possible
isn't that amazing that uh computational

7378
02:07:10,629 --> 02:07:10,639
isn't that amazing that uh computational
 

7379
02:07:10,639 --> 02:07:13,109
isn't that amazing that uh computational
electronic devices can can can can be

7380
02:07:13,109 --> 02:07:13,119
electronic devices can can can can be
 

7381
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:15,189
electronic devices can can can can be
possible and they're made of sand our

7382
02:07:15,189 --> 02:07:15,199
possible and they're made of sand our
 

7383
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:16,870
possible and they're made of sand our
most you know common element that we

7384
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:16,880
most you know common element that we
 

7385
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,790
most you know common element that we
have you know silicon that on the on the

7386
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:18,800
have you know silicon that on the on the
 

7387
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:20,390
have you know silicon that on the on the
earth's crust they could be made of

7388
02:07:20,390 --> 02:07:20,400
earth's crust they could be made of
 

7389
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:21,669
earth's crust they could be made of
diamond or something then we would have

7390
02:07:21,669 --> 02:07:21,679
diamond or something then we would have
 

7391
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:24,229
diamond or something then we would have
only had one computer yeah right so it's

7392
02:07:24,229 --> 02:07:24,239
only had one computer yeah right so it's
 

7393
02:07:24,239 --> 02:07:25,510
only had one computer yeah right so it's
a lot of things are kind of slightly

7394
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:25,520
a lot of things are kind of slightly
 

7395
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:27,589
a lot of things are kind of slightly
suspicious to me it sure as heck sounds

7396
02:07:27,589 --> 02:07:27,599
suspicious to me it sure as heck sounds
 

7397
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:29,510
suspicious to me it sure as heck sounds
this puzzle sure sounds like something

7398
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:29,520
this puzzle sure sounds like something
 

7399
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:31,589
this puzzle sure sounds like something
we talked about earlier what it takes to

7400
02:07:31,589 --> 02:07:31,599
we talked about earlier what it takes to
 

7401
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:33,750
we talked about earlier what it takes to
to design a game

7402
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:33,760
to design a game
 

7403
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:35,510
to design a game
that's really fun to play for prolonged

7404
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:35,520
that's really fun to play for prolonged
 

7405
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:37,589
that's really fun to play for prolonged
periods of time

7406
02:07:37,589 --> 02:07:37,599
periods of time
 

7407
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:39,510
periods of time
and it does seem like this puzzle like

7408
02:07:39,510 --> 02:07:39,520
and it does seem like this puzzle like
 

7409
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,669
and it does seem like this puzzle like
you mentioned the more you learn about

7410
02:07:41,669 --> 02:07:41,679
you mentioned the more you learn about
 

7411
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:43,830
you mentioned the more you learn about
it the more you realize how little you

7412
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:43,840
it the more you realize how little you
 

7413
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:44,790
it the more you realize how little you
know

7414
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:44,800
know
 

7415
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:47,030
know
so it humbles you but excites you by the

7416
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:47,040
so it humbles you but excites you by the
 

7417
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:49,430
so it humbles you but excites you by the
possibility of learning more it's one

7418
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:49,440
possibility of learning more it's one
 

7419
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:51,830
possibility of learning more it's one
heck of a one heck of a puzzle we got

7420
02:07:51,830 --> 02:07:51,840
heck of a one heck of a puzzle we got
 

7421
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:54,950
heck of a one heck of a puzzle we got
going on here um so like i mentioned of

7422
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:54,960
going on here um so like i mentioned of
 

7423
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:57,030
going on here um so like i mentioned of
all the people in the world you're very

7424
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:57,040
all the people in the world you're very
 

7425
02:07:57,040 --> 02:08:00,550
all the people in the world you're very
likely to be the one who creates the agi

7426
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:00,560
likely to be the one who creates the agi
 

7427
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:01,910
likely to be the one who creates the agi
system

7428
02:08:01,910 --> 02:08:01,920
system
 

7429
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,229
system
um that achieves human level

7430
02:08:04,229 --> 02:08:04,239
um that achieves human level
 

7431
02:08:04,239 --> 02:08:06,390
um that achieves human level
intelligence and goes beyond it so if

7432
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:06,400
intelligence and goes beyond it so if
 

7433
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,629
intelligence and goes beyond it so if
you got a chance and very well you could

7434
02:08:08,629 --> 02:08:08,639
you got a chance and very well you could
 

7435
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:10,149
you got a chance and very well you could
be the person that goes into the room

7436
02:08:10,149 --> 02:08:10,159
be the person that goes into the room
 

7437
02:08:10,159 --> 02:08:12,950
be the person that goes into the room
with the system and have a conversation

7438
02:08:12,950 --> 02:08:12,960
with the system and have a conversation
 

7439
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:15,189
with the system and have a conversation
maybe you only get to ask one question

7440
02:08:15,189 --> 02:08:15,199
maybe you only get to ask one question
 

7441
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:16,470
maybe you only get to ask one question
if you do

7442
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:16,480
if you do
 

7443
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:19,270
if you do
what question would you ask her

7444
02:08:19,270 --> 02:08:19,280
what question would you ask her
 

7445
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:22,069
what question would you ask her
i would probably ask um what is the true

7446
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:22,079
i would probably ask um what is the true
 

7447
02:08:22,079 --> 02:08:23,510
i would probably ask um what is the true
nature of reality

7448
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:23,520
nature of reality
 

7449
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:24,629
nature of reality
i think that's the question i don't know

7450
02:08:24,629 --> 02:08:24,639
i think that's the question i don't know
 

7451
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:25,990
i think that's the question i don't know
if i'd understand the answer because

7452
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:26,000
if i'd understand the answer because
 

7453
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,750
if i'd understand the answer because
maybe it would be 42 or something like

7454
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:27,760
maybe it would be 42 or something like
 

7455
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:30,470
maybe it would be 42 or something like
that but um that's the question i would

7456
02:08:30,470 --> 02:08:30,480
that but um that's the question i would
 

7457
02:08:30,480 --> 02:08:32,310
that but um that's the question i would
ask

7458
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:32,320
ask
 

7459
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:34,069
ask
and then there'll be a deep sigh from

7460
02:08:34,069 --> 02:08:34,079
and then there'll be a deep sigh from
 

7461
02:08:34,079 --> 02:08:35,510
and then there'll be a deep sigh from
the systems like all right how do i

7462
02:08:35,510 --> 02:08:35,520
the systems like all right how do i
 

7463
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:37,430
the systems like all right how do i
explain to the excuse me exactly all

7464
02:08:37,430 --> 02:08:37,440
explain to the excuse me exactly all
 

7465
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:40,390
explain to the excuse me exactly all
right let me i don't have time

7466
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:40,400
right let me i don't have time
 

7467
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:42,629
right let me i don't have time
to explain uh maybe i'll draw you a

7468
02:08:42,629 --> 02:08:42,639
to explain uh maybe i'll draw you a
 

7469
02:08:42,639 --> 02:08:44,550
to explain uh maybe i'll draw you a
picture that it is

7470
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:44,560
picture that it is
 

7471
02:08:44,560 --> 02:08:47,109
picture that it is
i mean how do you even begin

7472
02:08:47,109 --> 02:08:47,119
i mean how do you even begin
 

7473
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:48,229
i mean how do you even begin
um

7474
02:08:48,229 --> 02:08:48,239
um
 

7475
02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:51,109
um
to answer that question

7476
02:08:51,109 --> 02:08:51,119
to answer that question
 

7477
02:08:51,119 --> 02:08:53,109
to answer that question
well i think it would um what would you

7478
02:08:53,109 --> 02:08:53,119
well i think it would um what would you
 

7479
02:08:53,119 --> 02:08:54,310
well i think it would um what would you
what would you think the answer could

7480
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:54,320
what would you think the answer could
 

7481
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:56,709
what would you think the answer could
possibly look like i think it could it

7482
02:08:56,709 --> 02:08:56,719
possibly look like i think it could it
 

7483
02:08:56,719 --> 02:08:58,550
possibly look like i think it could it
could start looking like

7484
02:08:58,550 --> 02:08:58,560
could start looking like
 

7485
02:08:58,560 --> 02:08:59,350
could start looking like
uh

7486
02:08:59,350 --> 02:08:59,360
uh
 

7487
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:01,510
uh
uh more fundamental explanations of

7488
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:01,520
uh more fundamental explanations of
 

7489
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:03,830
uh more fundamental explanations of
physics would be the beginning you know

7490
02:09:03,830 --> 02:09:03,840
physics would be the beginning you know
 

7491
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,669
physics would be the beginning you know
more careful specification of that

7492
02:09:05,669 --> 02:09:05,679
more careful specification of that
 

7493
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:07,270
more careful specification of that
taking you walking us through by the

7494
02:09:07,270 --> 02:09:07,280
taking you walking us through by the
 

7495
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:09,430
taking you walking us through by the
hand as to what one would do to maybe

7496
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:09,440
hand as to what one would do to maybe
 

7497
02:09:09,440 --> 02:09:11,350
hand as to what one would do to maybe
prove those things out maybe giving you

7498
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:11,360
prove those things out maybe giving you
 

7499
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,030
prove those things out maybe giving you
glimpses of

7500
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:13,040
glimpses of
 

7501
02:09:13,040 --> 02:09:14,790
glimpses of
what things you totally missed in the

7502
02:09:14,790 --> 02:09:14,800
what things you totally missed in the
 

7503
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:16,149
what things you totally missed in the
physics of today

7504
02:09:16,149 --> 02:09:16,159
physics of today
 

7505
02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:19,109
physics of today
exactly just here here's glimpses of no

7506
02:09:19,109 --> 02:09:19,119
exactly just here here's glimpses of no
 

7507
02:09:19,119 --> 02:09:20,950
exactly just here here's glimpses of no
like there's a much

7508
02:09:20,950 --> 02:09:20,960
like there's a much
 

7509
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,069
like there's a much
uh

7510
02:09:22,069 --> 02:09:22,079
uh
 

7511
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:23,910
uh
a much more elaborate world or a much

7512
02:09:23,910 --> 02:09:23,920
a much more elaborate world or a much
 

7513
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:26,629
a much more elaborate world or a much
simpler world or something

7514
02:09:26,629 --> 02:09:26,639
simpler world or something
 

7515
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:29,109
simpler world or something
a much deeper maybe simpler explanation

7516
02:09:29,109 --> 02:09:29,119
a much deeper maybe simpler explanation
 

7517
02:09:29,119 --> 02:09:31,030
a much deeper maybe simpler explanation
yes of things right than the standard

7518
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:31,040
yes of things right than the standard
 

7519
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:32,709
yes of things right than the standard
model of physics which we know doesn't

7520
02:09:32,709 --> 02:09:32,719
model of physics which we know doesn't
 

7521
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:36,149
model of physics which we know doesn't
work but we still keep adding to so um

7522
02:09:36,149 --> 02:09:36,159
work but we still keep adding to so um
 

7523
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:37,750
work but we still keep adding to so um
and and that's how i think the beginning

7524
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:37,760
and and that's how i think the beginning
 

7525
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:39,030
and and that's how i think the beginning
of an explanation would look and it

7526
02:09:39,030 --> 02:09:39,040
of an explanation would look and it
 

7527
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:40,629
of an explanation would look and it
would start encompassing many of the

7528
02:09:40,629 --> 02:09:40,639
would start encompassing many of the
 

7529
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:42,229
would start encompassing many of the
mysteries that we have wondered about

7530
02:09:42,229 --> 02:09:42,239
mysteries that we have wondered about
 

7531
02:09:42,239 --> 02:09:44,229
mysteries that we have wondered about
for thousands of years like you know

7532
02:09:44,229 --> 02:09:44,239
for thousands of years like you know
