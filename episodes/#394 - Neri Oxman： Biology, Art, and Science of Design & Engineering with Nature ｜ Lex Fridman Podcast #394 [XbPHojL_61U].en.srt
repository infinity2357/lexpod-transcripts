tap into through technology if you think
 

171
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,930
tap into through technology if you think
about humans versus nature at least in

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:43,560
um when I realized that that imbalance
 

225
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,810
um when I realized that that imbalance
now we've superseded the biomass on the

now we've superseded the biomass on the
 

227
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,150
now we've superseded the biomass on the
planet where do we go from here

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
planet where do we go from here

and you've heard the expression more

230
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
and you've heard the expression more

00:04:58,969 --> 00:04:58,979
um and and the technosphere sort of
 

237
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,430
um and and the technosphere sort of
outweighing the biosphere

238

outweighing the biosphere
 

239
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,249
outweighing the biosphere
um but now we are really trying to look

240
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:04,259
um but now we are really trying to look
 

241
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,650
um but now we are really trying to look
at is is there a way

242
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:06,660
at is is there a way
 

243
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,490
at is is there a way
in which all things technosphere are

244
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:10,500
in which all things technosphere are

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,990
grow instead of build everything and
anything if you could grow an iPhone if

252
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,000
anything if you could grow an iPhone if
 

253
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,550
anything if you could grow an iPhone if
you could grow a car

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,230
of the slogan let's grow everything
and if we grow everything is there a

00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:57,240
and if we grow everything is there a
 

283
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,830
and if we grow everything is there a

world in which driving a car is better
 

285
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,129
world in which driving a car is better
for nature than a world in which there

for nature than a world in which there
 

287
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,550
for nature than a world in which there
are no cars is there is it possible that

288
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:07,560
are no cars is there is it possible that
 

289
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,909
are no cars is there is it possible that
a world in which you build buildings in

00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:10,919
a world in which you build buildings in

00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,550
a world in which you build buildings in
cities that those buildings and cities

cities that those buildings and cities
 

293
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,370
cities that those buildings and cities
actually augment and heal nature as

294
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:16,380
actually augment and heal nature as
 

295
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,469
actually augment and heal nature as
opposed to their absence is there a

296
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
opposed to their absence is there a
 

297
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,529
opposed to their absence is there a
world in which we now go back to that

kind of synergy between nature and

300
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
kind of synergy between nature and
 

301
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,050
kind of synergy between nature and
humans where you cannot separate between

humans where you cannot separate between
 

303

00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,160
grown and made and it doesn't even
 

305
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,050

matter
 

307
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,909
matter
is there a good term for the

308
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
is there a good term for the
 

309
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,189
is there a good term for the
intersection between biomass and

310
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:34,199
intersection between biomass and
 

311
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,170
intersection between biomass and
entropyl mass like things that are grown

yeah so in 2005 I I called this material

314
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:39,539
yeah so in 2005 I I called this material
 

315
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,749
yeah so in 2005 I I called this material
ecology I thought what if all material

316
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
ecology I thought what if all material
 

317
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,570
ecology I thought what if all material
all things materials would be considered

318
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:44,580
all things materials would be considered
 

319
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,790
all things materials would be considered
part of the ecology and would have an

320
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
part of the ecology and would have an
 

321
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,850
part of the ecology and would have an
impact a positive impact on the ecology

322
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:49,860
impact a positive impact on the ecology
 

323
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,070
impact a positive impact on the ecology

um where we work together to help each
 

325
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,890
um where we work together to help each

but decrease entropy right so find order
but constantly increase the information

490
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:29,700
but constantly increase the information
 

491
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,290
but constantly increase the information
scale and and this is true for what our

492
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,300
scale and and this is true for what our
 

493
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,389
scale and and this is true for what our
work also tries to do because we're

494
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:35,399
work also tries to do because we're
 

495
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:37,070
work also tries to do because we're
constantly trying to

496
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,080
constantly trying to
 

497
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,290
constantly trying to
fight against the dimensional mismatch

498
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:39,300
fight against the dimensional mismatch
 

499
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,090
fight against the dimensional mismatch
between things made and things grown

500
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,100
between things made and things grown
 

501
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,790
between things made and things grown
right and and as designers we are

502
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:43,800
right and and as designers we are
 

503
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,470
right and and as designers we are
educated to think in X Y and Z and

504
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:45,480
educated to think in X Y and Z and
 

505
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,269
educated to think in X Y and Z and
that's pretty much where architectural

506
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
that's pretty much where architectural
 

507
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,030
that's pretty much where architectural
education ends and biological education

508
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,040
education ends and biological education
 

509
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,490
education ends and biological education
begins so in reducing that dimensional

510
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:52,500
begins so in reducing that dimensional
 

511
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,050
begins so in reducing that dimensional
mismatch we're missing out on

512
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,060
mismatch we're missing out on
 

513
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,730
mismatch we're missing out on
opportunities to create things made as

514
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:55,740
opportunities to create things made as
 

515
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,889
opportunities to create things made as
if grown but in the natural environment

516
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:57,899
if grown but in the natural environment
 

517
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,610
if grown but in the natural environment
we're asking can we provide nature with

518
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:01,620
we're asking can we provide nature with
 

519
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,090
we're asking can we provide nature with
these extra dimensions and again I I'm

520
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,100
these extra dimensions and again I I'm
 

521
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,569
these extra dimensions and again I I'm
not sure what nature wants but I'm

522
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:08,579
not sure what nature wants but I'm
 

523
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,790
not sure what nature wants but I'm
curious as to what happens when you

524
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
curious as to what happens when you
 

525
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,230
curious as to what happens when you
provide these tools to the Natural

526
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
provide these tools to the Natural
 

527
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,670
provide these tools to the Natural
environments obviously with

528
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
environments obviously with
 

529
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,170
environments obviously with
responsibility obviously with control

530
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,180
responsibility obviously with control
 

531
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,090
responsibility obviously with control
obviously with ethics and and moral code

532
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,100
obviously with ethics and and moral code
 

533
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,130
obviously with ethics and and moral code
um but is there a world in which nature

534
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,140
um but is there a world in which nature
 

535
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,970
um but is there a world in which nature
can help fix itself uh using those tools

536
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:25,980
can help fix itself uh using those tools
 

537
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,850
can help fix itself uh using those tools
and by the way we're talking about a

538
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:28,860
and by the way we're talking about a
 

539
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,670
and by the way we're talking about a
company called oxman yeah I'll just just

540
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
company called oxman yeah I'll just just
 

541
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,470
company called oxman yeah I'll just just
a few words about the team yeah what

542
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,480
a few words about the team yeah what
 

543
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,210
a few words about the team yeah what
kind of humans work at a place like this

544
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,220
kind of humans work at a place like this
 

545
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,190
kind of humans work at a place like this
they're trying to figure out what nature

546
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
they're trying to figure out what nature
 

547
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,569
they're trying to figure out what nature
wants you know I think they're first

548
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:38,579
wants you know I think they're first
 

549
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:41,810
wants you know I think they're first
like you they're they're humanists first

550
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:41,820
like you they're they're humanists first
 

551
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,449
like you they're they're humanists first
um they come from different disciplines

552
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:44,459
um they come from different disciplines
 

553
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,009
um they come from different disciplines
and different disciplinary backgrounds

554
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:46,019
and different disciplinary backgrounds
 

555
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,310
and different disciplinary backgrounds
and just as an example we have a

556
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,320
and just as an example we have a
 

557
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,050
and just as an example we have a
brilliant designer who is just a

558
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:51,060
brilliant designer who is just a
 

559
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,370
brilliant designer who is just a
mathematical genius and a computer

560
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:52,380
mathematical genius and a computer
 

561
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,430
mathematical genius and a computer
scientist and a mechanical engineer who

562
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
scientist and a mechanical engineer who
 

563
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,990
scientist and a mechanical engineer who
has trained

564
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,000
has trained
 

565
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,769
has trained
um as a synthetic biologist and

566
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:00,779
um as a synthetic biologist and
 

567
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,829
um as a synthetic biologist and
um and now we're hiring a microbiologist

568
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:02,839
um and now we're hiring a microbiologist
 

569
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:05,110
um and now we're hiring a microbiologist
and a chemist

570
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,120
and a chemist
 

571
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,030
and a chemist
architects of course and designers uh

572
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
architects of course and designers uh
 

573
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,870
architects of course and designers uh
roboticist so it's really it's Noah's

574
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:11,880
roboticist so it's really it's Noah's
 

575
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,449
roboticist so it's really it's Noah's
Ark right two of each and always dancing

576
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:14,459
Ark right two of each and always dancing
 

577
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,030
Ark right two of each and always dancing
between this line of the artificial the

578
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
between this line of the artificial the
 

579
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,130
between this line of the artificial the
synthetic and the and the real what's

580
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,140
synthetic and the and the real what's
 

581
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,530
synthetic and the and the real what's
the term for in the natural yeah the

582
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:21,540
the term for in the natural yeah the
 

583
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,470
the term for in the natural yeah the
built in the grown nature and culture

584
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,480
built in the grown nature and culture
 

585
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,290
built in the grown nature and culture
technology and biology but we're we're

586
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,300
technology and biology but we're we're
 

587
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,810
technology and biology but we're we're
constantly seeking to to ask how can we

588
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:29,820
constantly seeking to to ask how can we
 

589
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,769
constantly seeking to to ask how can we
build design and deploy products in

590
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:33,779
build design and deploy products in
 

591
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,410
build design and deploy products in
three scales the molecular scale which

592
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:36,420
three scales the molecular scale which
 

593
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,569
three scales the molecular scale which
I've briefly hinted to

594
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:38,579
I've briefly hinted to
 

595
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:40,910
I've briefly hinted to
um and their and the molecular scale

596
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:40,920
um and their and the molecular scale
 

597
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,490
um and their and the molecular scale
we're really looking to understand

598
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:43,500
we're really looking to understand
 

599
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,129
we're really looking to understand
whether there is a universal language to

600
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:46,139
whether there is a universal language to
 

601
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,949
whether there is a universal language to
Nature and what that language is and

602
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
Nature and what that language is and
 

603
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,769
Nature and what that language is and
then build build a tool that

604
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:51,779
then build build a tool that
 

605
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,810
then build build a tool that
um I think and dream of it is the iPhone

606
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:53,820
um I think and dream of it is the iPhone
 

607
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,530
um I think and dream of it is the iPhone
for nature if nature had an iPhone

608
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:57,540
for nature if nature had an iPhone
 

609
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,290
for nature if nature had an iPhone
um what would that iPhone look like does

610
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:00,300
um what would that iPhone look like does
 

611
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,710
um what would that iPhone look like does
that mean creating an interface

612
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:03,720
that mean creating an interface
 

613
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,050
that mean creating an interface
between nature and the computational

614
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,060
between nature and the computational
 

615
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,210
between nature and the computational
tools we have exactly it goes back to

616
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:08,220
tools we have exactly it goes back to
 

617
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,970
tools we have exactly it goes back to
that 11.5 quintillion times the

618
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:10,980
that 11.5 quintillion times the
 

619
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,490
that 11.5 quintillion times the
bandwidth that that humans have have now

620
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:13,500
bandwidth that that humans have have now
 

621
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,490
bandwidth that that humans have have now
arrived at and and giving that to Nature

622
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:16,500
arrived at and and giving that to Nature
 

623
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,110
arrived at and and giving that to Nature
and seeing what you know what what

624
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,120
and seeing what you know what what
 

625
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,150
and seeing what you know what what
happens there can animals actually use

626
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
happens there can animals actually use
 

627
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,930
happens there can animals actually use
this interface to know that they need to

628
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:23,940
this interface to know that they need to
 

629
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,569
this interface to know that they need to
run away from fire can plants use this

630
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:26,579
run away from fire can plants use this
 

631
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:28,310
run away from fire can plants use this
interface to increase the rate of

632
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
interface to increase the rate of
 

633
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,530
interface to increase the rate of
photosynthesis in the presence of a

634
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:30,540
photosynthesis in the presence of a
 

635
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,389
photosynthesis in the presence of a
smoke cloud can they do this

636
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
smoke cloud can they do this
 

637
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,670
smoke cloud can they do this
quote-unquote automatically without a

638
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:34,680
quote-unquote automatically without a
 

639
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,210
quote-unquote automatically without a
kind of a top-down Brute Force policy

640
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:38,220
kind of a top-down Brute Force policy
 

641
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,910
kind of a top-down Brute Force policy
based method that's authored and

642
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:40,920
based method that's authored and
 

643
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,009
based method that's authored and
deployed by humans and so this work

644
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:43,019
deployed by humans and so this work
 

645
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,750
deployed by humans and so this work
really relates to that interface with

646
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:44,760
really relates to that interface with
 

647
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,090
really relates to that interface with
the natural world and then there's a

648
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,100
the natural world and then there's a
 

649
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,490
the natural world and then there's a
second area in the company which focuses

650

second area in the company which focuses
on growing products

652
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
on growing products
 

653
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,930
on growing products
and here we're focusing on a single

654
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:53,940
and here we're focusing on a single
 

655
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,069
and here we're focusing on a single
product that starts from CO2

656
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
product that starts from CO2
 

657
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,410
product that starts from CO2
um it becomes a product it's consumed

658
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:00,420
um it becomes a product it's consumed
 

659
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,650
um it becomes a product it's consumed
it's used it's worn by a human and then

660
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:03,660
it's used it's worn by a human and then
 

661
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,150
it's used it's worn by a human and then
it

662
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:05,160
it
 

663
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,750
it
um goes back to the soil and it grows an

664
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:08,760
um goes back to the soil and it grows an
 

665
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,970
um goes back to the soil and it grows an
edible fruit plant so we're talking

666
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:10,980
edible fruit plant so we're talking
 

667
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,970
edible fruit plant so we're talking
about from CO2 to fruit yeah it starts

668
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:13,980
about from CO2 to fruit yeah it starts
 

669
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,710
about from CO2 to fruit yeah it starts
from CO2 and it ends with something that

670
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:15,720
from CO2 and it ends with something that
 

671
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,250
from CO2 and it ends with something that
you can like literally eat so so the

672
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:19,260
you can like literally eat so so the
 

673
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,829
you can like literally eat so so the

00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:27,420
that's grown yes either using plant
 

679
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,930
that's grown yes either using plant
matter or using bacteria but we are

680
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:29,940
matter or using bacteria but we are
 

681
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,150
matter or using bacteria but we are
really looking at um carbon recycling

682
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
really looking at um carbon recycling
 

683
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,430
really looking at um carbon recycling

Reincarnation of a an a thing that

690
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
Reincarnation of a an a thing that
 

691
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,449
Reincarnation of a an a thing that
doesn't need to end up in a composting

692
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:44,459
doesn't need to end up in a composting
 

693
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,790
doesn't need to end up in a composting
site but can just be thrown into the

694
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
site but can just be thrown into the
 

695
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,790
site but can just be thrown into the
ground and grow Olive and find peace and

696
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:49,800
ground and grow Olive and find peace and
 

697
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,710
ground and grow Olive and find peace and
there's a lot of textile based work out

698
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:51,720
there's a lot of textile based work out
 

699
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,930
there's a lot of textile based work out
there that is focused on one single

700
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:53,940
there that is focused on one single
 

701
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,750
there that is focused on one single
element in this long chain like oh let's

702
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:56,760
element in this long chain like oh let's
 

703
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,310
element in this long chain like oh let's
create

704
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
create
 

705
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,590
create
um you know leather out of mycelium or

706
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:00,600
um you know leather out of mycelium or
 

707
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,290
um you know leather out of mycelium or
or less create textile out of cellulose

708
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:03,300
or less create textile out of cellulose
 

709
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,110
or less create textile out of cellulose
but then it stops there and you get to

710
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,120
but then it stops there and you get to
 

711
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,030
but then it stops there and you get to
assembling the shoe or the wearable and

712
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,040
assembling the shoe or the wearable and
 

713
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,769
assembling the shoe or the wearable and
you and you you need a little bit of

714
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:09,779
you and you you need a little bit of
 

715
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:11,509
you and you you need a little bit of
glue and you need a little bit of this

716
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
glue and you need a little bit of this
 

717
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,069
glue and you need a little bit of this
material a little bit of that material

718
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:13,079
material a little bit of that material
 

719
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,410
material a little bit of that material
to to make it water resistant and then

720
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:15,420
to to make it water resistant and then
 

721
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,930
to to make it water resistant and then
it's over so that's one thing that we're

722
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:17,940
it's over so that's one thing that we're
 

723
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,210
it's over so that's one thing that we're
trying to solve for is how to create a

724
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:20,220
trying to solve for is how to create a
 

725
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,310
trying to solve for is how to create a
product that is materially

726
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
product that is materially
 

727
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,910
product that is materially
computationally robotically novel

728
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:25,920
computationally robotically novel
 

729
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,829
computationally robotically novel
um and goes through all of these phases

730
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
um and goes through all of these phases
 

731
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,990
um and goes through all of these phases
from the creation from this carbon

732
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
from the creation from this carbon
 

733

recycling technology to
um to the product to literally how do

736
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:35,220
um to the product to literally how do
 

737
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,730
um to the product to literally how do
you think about you know Reinventing an

738
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:37,740
you think about you know Reinventing an
 

739
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,090
you think about you know Reinventing an
industry that is focused on assembly and

740
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,100
industry that is focused on assembly and
 

741
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,730
industry that is focused on assembly and
putting things together and using humans

742
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:43,740
putting things together and using humans
 

743
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,490
putting things together and using humans
to do that can that you know can that

744
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:46,500
to do that can that you know can that
 

745
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,290
to do that can that you know can that
happen just using robots and microbes

746
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:48,300
happen just using robots and microbes
 

747
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,389
happen just using robots and microbes
and that's it and doing it end to end I

748
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
and that's it and doing it end to end I
 

749
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,550
and that's it and doing it end to end I
would love to see what this Factory

750
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
would love to see what this Factory
 

751
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,430
would love to see what this Factory
looks like and the factories is great

don't understand okay uh I mean it's
 

767
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,449
don't understand okay uh I mean it's
just before we get to number three it'd

768
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:14,459
just before we get to number three it'd
 

769
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:16,730
just before we get to number three it'd
be amazing to just talk about what it

770
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:16,740
be amazing to just talk about what it
 

771
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,670
be amazing to just talk about what it
takes with robotic arms or in general

772
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
takes with robotic arms or in general

life form stuff you've done in the past
 

777
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,189
life form stuff you've done in the past
maybe stuff you're doing now how to use

778
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
maybe stuff you're doing now how to use
 

779
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,410
maybe stuff you're doing now how to use
bacteria it's kind of synthetic biology

780
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:27,420
bacteria it's kind of synthetic biology
 

781
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,590

how to grow stuff by leveraging bacteria

782
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:30,600
how to grow stuff by leveraging bacteria
 

783
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,449
how to grow stuff by leveraging bacteria
is there examples from the past and yes

784
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:32,459
is there examples from the past and yes
 

785
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,030
is there examples from the past and yes
and just take a step back over the 10

786
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
and just take a step back over the 10
 

787
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,889
and just take a step back over the 10
years of the mediated matter group which

788
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:36,899
years of the mediated matter group which
 

789
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,470
years of the mediated matter group which
was my group at MIT

790
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:39,480
was my group at MIT
 

791
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,090
was my group at MIT
um has sort of dedicated itself to

792
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,100
um has sort of dedicated itself to
 

793
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,170
um has sort of dedicated itself to
biobased design would be a suitcase word

794
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,180
biobased design would be a suitcase word
 

795
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,569
biobased design would be a suitcase word
but sort of thinking about that Synergy

796
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:47,579
but sort of thinking about that Synergy
 

797
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,910
but sort of thinking about that Synergy
between nature and culture biology and

798
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
between nature and culture biology and
 

799
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,790
between nature and culture biology and
technology and we attempted to build a

800
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
technology and we attempted to build a
 

801
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,910
technology and we attempted to build a
suite of embodiments let's say that they

802
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
suite of embodiments let's say that they
 

803
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,069
suite of embodiments let's say that they
ended up in amazing museums and amazing

804
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
ended up in amazing museums and amazing
 

805
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,710
ended up in amazing museums and amazing
shows and and we wrote patents and

806
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
shows and and we wrote patents and
 

807
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,530
shows and and we wrote patents and

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,090
sometimes we used fibers sometimes we
used silk with silkworms and honey with

used silk with silkworms and honey with
 

823

were different and the hero organisms
 

833
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,270
were different and the hero organisms
were different the philosophy was always

the same the approach was really an
approach of computational templating

838
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:37,500
approach of computational templating
 

839
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,770
approach of computational templating
that templating allowed us to create

840
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:39,780
that templating allowed us to create
 

841
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,690
that templating allowed us to create
templates for the natural environment

templates for the natural environment
 

843
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,409

and and there we had
 

865
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,950
and and there we had
um different types of templates there

um different types of templates there
 

867
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,810
um different types of templates there
were physical templates that were

were physical templates that were
 

869
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,490
were physical templates that were
basically just these water-soluble

spinning and then there were
 

875
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,310

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,090
silkworm you're saying so many amazing
things and I'm trying not to interrupt

886
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,100
things and I'm trying not to interrupt
 

887
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,770
things and I'm trying not to interrupt
you but like one of the things you've

888
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:33,780
you but like one of the things you've
 

889
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,070
you but like one of the things you've
learned by observing by doing science on

890
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,080
learned by observing by doing science on
 

891
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,669
learned by observing by doing science on
these is that the environment defines

892
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:40,679
these is that the environment defines
 

893
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,710
these is that the environment defines
the shape that they create or

894
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:42,720
the shape that they create or
 

895
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,390
the shape that they create or
contributes or intricately plays with

896
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,400
contributes or intricately plays with
 

897
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,130
contributes or intricately plays with
the shape to create and so so like and

898
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,140
the shape to create and so so like and
 

899
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,690
the shape to create and so so like and
you get to that's one of the ways you

900
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:47,700
you get to that's one of the ways you
 

901
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,870
you get to that's one of the ways you
can get to guide their work is by

902
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
can get to guide their work is by
 

903
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,549
can get to guide their work is by
defining that environment by the way you

904
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
defining that environment by the way you
 

905
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,890
defining that environment by the way you
said hero organism which is an epic term

906
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:54,900
said hero organism which is an epic term
 

907
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,049
said hero organism which is an epic term
so that means like because whatever is

908
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:57,059
so that means like because whatever is
 

909
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,810
so that means like because whatever is

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,990
the coconut through fibers and glue and
that's true for so many systems in

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,000
that's true for so many systems in
 

1031
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,049
that's true for so many systems in
nature lots of fiber and glue and that

architecture allows them to
 

1035
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,029
architecture allows them to
metamorphosize and in the process they

1036
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
metamorphosize and in the process they
 

1037
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,490
metamorphosize and in the process they
vary the properties of that silk thread

1038
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:31,500
vary the properties of that silk thread
 

1039
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,830
vary the properties of that silk thread
so it's stiffer or softer depending on

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
so it's stiffer or softer depending on
 

1041
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,430
so it's stiffer or softer depending on
where it is in the section of the Cocoon

connection and communication so what
 

1219
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,710
connection and communication so what
happens when you add 17 000 of them

1220
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:15,720
happens when you add 17 000 of them

happens when you add 17 000 of them
communicating effects that's a really

00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:17,640
communicating effects that's a really
 

1223
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,750
communicating effects that's a really
great question what happens is that at

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:20,760
great question what happens is that at
 

1225
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,830
great question what happens is that at

00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,350
the templating strategies and as you
said correctly there were geometrical

1230
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360
said correctly there were geometrical

um but whenever you have these

1244
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:40,980
um but whenever you have these
 

1245
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,190
um but whenever you have these
templating strategies you have sort of

1246
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
templating strategies you have sort of
 

1247
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,890
templating strategies you have sort of
control over nature right but the

1248
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:45,900
control over nature right but the
 

1249
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,630

designed to work as swarms so how do you

1354
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:54,779
designed to work as swarms so how do you
 

1355
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,529
designed to work as swarms so how do you
construct a computational template from

1356
00:27:57,529 --> 00:27:57,539
construct a computational template from
 

1357
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,210
construct a computational template from

uh a certain kind of thing emerges so

1360
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:02,220
uh a certain kind of thing emerges so
 

1361
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,610
uh a certain kind of thing emerges so
how can you predict what emerges I

1362
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:04,620
how can you predict what emerges I
 

1363
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,090
how can you predict what emerges I
suppose so if you can predict it it

1364
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:08,100
suppose so if you can predict it it
 

1365
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,409
suppose so if you can predict it it
doesn't count as emergence actually

1366
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:11,419
doesn't count as emergence actually
 

1367
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:14,269
doesn't count as emergence actually
that's a deeply poetic line we can talk

1368
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:14,279
that's a deeply poetic line we can talk
 

1369
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:16,669
that's a deeply poetic line we can talk
about it I mean it's a bit like this

1370
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:16,679
about it I mean it's a bit like this
 

1371
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:18,590
about it I mean it's a bit like this
concentrated it doesn't count that's

1372
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:18,600
concentrated it doesn't count that's
 

1373
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,470
concentrated it doesn't count that's
right right speaking of emergence

1374
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:21,480
right right speaking of emergence
 

1375
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,049
right right speaking of emergence

mean to empower nature and what is

1388
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:37,500
mean to empower nature and what is
 

1389
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,669
mean to empower nature and what is
empowerment in nature look like

1390
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:40,679
empowerment in nature look like
 

1391
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,570
empowerment in nature look like
um

1392
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:41,580
um
 

1393
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,669
um
and that relates to emergence and we can

1394
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:43,679
and that relates to emergence and we can
 

1395
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,110
and that relates to emergence and we can
go back to emergence in a few moments

1396
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,120
go back to emergence in a few moments
 

1397
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,990
go back to emergence in a few moments
but I want to I want to say it so that I

1398
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:48,000
but I want to I want to say it so that I
 

1399
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,590
but I want to I want to say it so that I
know that I've learned it

1400
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:50,600
know that I've learned it
 

1401
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,210
know that I've learned it
and if I've learned it I can use it

1402
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:53,220
and if I've learned it I can use it
 

1403
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,370
and if I've learned it I can use it
later yeah and maybe you'll figure

1404
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:55,380
later yeah and maybe you'll figure
 

1405
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,529
later yeah and maybe you'll figure
something out as you said of course

1406
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:57,539
something out as you said of course
 

1407
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,750
something out as you said of course
Kristoff is the master here but but

1408
00:28:59,750 --> 00:28:59,760

um what do we want we kind of want the
 

1421
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:17,210
um what do we want we kind of want the
same thing we want more but

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:17,220
same thing we want more but
 

1423
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,850
same thing we want more but
um we want order right and this goes

1424
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:19,860
um we want order right and this goes

00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,909
state given a choice given an action is
low meaning it's that kind of uh

1446
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:52,919
low meaning it's that kind of uh
 

1447
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:53,750
low meaning it's that kind of uh
um

1448
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:53,760
um
 

1449
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,330
um
yeah Duality between opportunity like

1450
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:56,340
yeah Duality between opportunity like
 

1451
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,610
yeah Duality between opportunity like
starting like this and going like this

1452
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:58,620
starting like this and going like this
 

1453
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,430
starting like this and going like this
opening and closing and and this really

1454
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,440
opening and closing and and this really
 

1455
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,590
opening and closing and and this really
I think is analogous to to human

1456
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
I think is analogous to to human
 

1457
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,909
I think is analogous to to human
empowerment given uh infinite wide array

1458
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:07,919
empowerment given uh infinite wide array
 

1459
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,889
empowerment given uh infinite wide array
of choices what is the choice that you

1460
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:09,899
of choices what is the choice that you
 

1461
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,649
of choices what is the choice that you
make uh to

1462
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:12,659
make uh to
 

1463
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:16,549
make uh to
you know to to enable to empower uh to

1464
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
you know to to enable to empower uh to
 

1465
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,409
you know to to enable to empower uh to
provide you with with the agency that

1466
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:18,419
provide you with with the agency that
 

1467
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,389
provide you with with the agency that
you need and how much is that making

1468
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:20,399
you need and how much is that making
 

1469
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,549
you need and how much is that making
that choice actually control the

1470
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
that choice actually control the
 

1471
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,350
that choice actually control the
trajectory of the system that's really

1472
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,360
trajectory of the system that's really
 

1473
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,269
trajectory of the system that's really
nice so this this applies to all the

1474
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:26,279
nice so this this applies to all the
 

1475
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,649
nice so this this applies to all the
kinds of systems you're talking about

1476
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:27,659
kinds of systems you're talking about
 

1477
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,490
kinds of systems you're talking about
yeah and

1478
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:31,500

 

1479
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,370

to a human on an individual basis but or

1480
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:34,380
to a human on an individual basis but or
 

1481
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,110
to a human on an individual basis but or
a silk or more a b

1482
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,120
a silk or more a b
 

1483
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,570
a silk or more a b
um or a microbe a microbe that has

1484
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:38,580
um or a microbe a microbe that has
 

1485
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,990
um or a microbe a microbe that has
agency or by virtue of of of a template

1486
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,000
agency or by virtue of of of a template
 

1487
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,810
agency or by virtue of of of a template
but it also applies to a community of of

1488
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:44,820
but it also applies to a community of of
 

1489
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,909
but it also applies to a community of of
organisms like the bees

1490
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:46,919
organisms like the bees
 

1491
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,590
organisms like the bees
um and so we've done a lot of work sort

1492
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:48,600
um and so we've done a lot of work sort
 

1493
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,630
um and so we've done a lot of work sort
of moving from you've asked how to grow

1494
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
of moving from you've asked how to grow
 

1495
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,889
of moving from you've asked how to grow
things so we've grown things uh using

1496
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:54,899
things so we've grown things uh using
 

1497
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,950
things so we've grown things uh using
um co-fabrication where we're digitally

1498
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:57,960
um co-fabrication where we're digitally
 

1499
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,250
um co-fabrication where we're digitally
fabricating with other organisms that

1500
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,260
fabricating with other organisms that
 

1501
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,409
fabricating with other organisms that
live across the various Kingdoms of Life

1502
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:03,419
live across the various Kingdoms of Life
 

1503
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:07,370
live across the various Kingdoms of Life
and and those were silkworms and bees

1504
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:07,380
and and those were silkworms and bees
 

1505
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,490
and and those were silkworms and bees
and uh and with bees

1506
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:10,500
and uh and with bees
 

1507
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,169
and uh and with bees
um which we've sent to outer space and

1508
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:12,179
um which we've sent to outer space and
 

1509
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:13,570
um which we've sent to outer space and
we turned healthily and they were

1510
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:13,580
we turned healthily and they were
 

1511
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,529
we turned healthily and they were
reproductive okay you're gonna have to

1512
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:15,539
reproductive okay you're gonna have to
 

1513
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:16,789
reproductive okay you're gonna have to
tell that story you're gonna have to

1514
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:16,799
tell that story you're gonna have to
 

1515
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,470
tell that story you're gonna have to
talk about the robotic queen and the

1516
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:18,480
talk about the robotic queen and the
 

1517
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,570
talk about the robotic queen and the
pheromones come on like

1518
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:20,580
pheromones come on like
 

1519
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,310
pheromones come on like
um so we've built what we called a

1520
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
um so we've built what we called a
 

1521
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,169
um so we've built what we called a
synthetic apiary and the synthetic

1522
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:24,179
synthetic apiary and the synthetic
 

1523
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,169
synthetic apiary and the synthetic
apiary was designed uh as an environment

1524
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:27,179
apiary was designed uh as an environment
 

1525
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,350
apiary was designed uh as an environment
that was a Perpetual spring environment

1526
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:30,360
that was a Perpetual spring environment
 

1527
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,769
that was a Perpetual spring environment
for the bees of Massachusetts they go on

1528
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:33,779
for the bees of Massachusetts they go on
 

1529
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:35,149
for the bees of Massachusetts they go on
hibernation of course during the winter

1530
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:35,159
hibernation of course during the winter
 

1531
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,169
hibernation of course during the winter
season

1532
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:36,179
season
 

1533
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:37,909
season
um and then we lose 80 percent of them

1534
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
um and then we lose 80 percent of them
 

1535
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,190
um and then we lose 80 percent of them
or more uh during that period we're

1536
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:40,200
or more uh during that period we're
 

1537
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,930
or more uh during that period we're
thinking okay what if we created this

1538
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:41,940
thinking okay what if we created this
 

1539
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,389
thinking okay what if we created this
environment where

1540
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:44,399
environment where
 

1541
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,090
environment where
um before you template right before you

1542
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:47,100
um before you template right before you
 

1543
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,490
um before you template right before you
can design with you have to design four

1544
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:49,500
can design with you have to design four
 

1545
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,450
can design with you have to design four
right you have to create this space of

1546
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:52,460
right you have to create this space of
 

1547
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,310
right you have to create this space of
mutualism space of sort of shared

1548
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:55,320
mutualism space of sort of shared
 

1549
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,889
mutualism space of sort of shared
connection between you and the organism

1550
00:31:57,889 --> 00:31:57,899
connection between you and the organism
 

1551
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,450
connection between you and the organism
and with bees it started as the

1552
00:31:59,450 --> 00:31:59,460
and with bees it started as the
 

1553
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,450
and with bees it started as the
synthetic apiary and we have proven that

1554
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:02,460
synthetic apiary and we have proven that
 

1555
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,570
synthetic apiary and we have proven that
that curated environment where we

1556
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:05,580
that curated environment where we
 

1557
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,029
that curated environment where we
designed the space with high levels of

1558
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:08,039
designed the space with high levels of
 

1559
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,789
designed the space with high levels of
control of temperature humidity and

1560
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:10,799
control of temperature humidity and
 

1561
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,750
control of temperature humidity and
light and we've proven that they were

1562
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:13,760
light and we've proven that they were
 

1563
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,830
light and we've proven that they were
reproductive and alive and we realized

1564
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
reproductive and alive and we realized
 

1565
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,950
reproductive and alive and we realized
wow this environment that we created can

1566
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:18,960
wow this environment that we created can
 

1567
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,710
wow this environment that we created can
help augment bees in the winter season

1568
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:21,720
help augment bees in the winter season
 

1569
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,669
help augment bees in the winter season
in any City around the world where where

1570
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:25,679
in any City around the world where where
 

1571
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,250
in any City around the world where where
bees survive and thrive in the summer

1572
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:28,260
bees survive and thrive in the summer
 

1573
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,230
bees survive and thrive in the summer
and spring seasons and could this be a

1574
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:30,240
and spring seasons and could this be a
 

1575
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,330
and spring seasons and could this be a
kind of a new Urban typology an

1576
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:32,340
kind of a new Urban typology an
 

1577
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,610
kind of a new Urban typology an
architectural typology of symbiosis of

1578
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:34,620
architectural typology of symbiosis of
 

1579
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,649
architectural typology of symbiosis of
mutualism between organisms and humans

1580
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:36,659
mutualism between organisms and humans
 

1581
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:38,870
mutualism between organisms and humans
where these are by the way the synthetic

1582
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:38,880
where these are by the way the synthetic
 

1583
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,690
where these are by the way the synthetic
apiary was in a co-op in you know nearby

1584
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:41,700
apiary was in a co-op in you know nearby
 

1585
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,630

Somerville we had you know we had robots

1586
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,640
Somerville we had you know we had robots
 

1587
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,389
Somerville we had you know we had robots
our team you know slept there every day

1588
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:47,399
our team you know slept there every day
 

1589
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,789
our team you know slept there every day
with our with our tools and machines and

1590
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:49,799
with our with our tools and machines and
 

1591
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,649
with our with our tools and machines and
we made it happen and the neighbors were

1592
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:51,659
we made it happen and the neighbors were
 

1593
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:53,750
we made it happen and the neighbors were
very happy and and they got to get a ton

1594
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
very happy and and they got to get a ton
 

1595
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,730
very happy and and they got to get a ton
of Honey at the end of the winter and

1596
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:55,740
of Honey at the end of the winter and
 

1597
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,470
of Honey at the end of the winter and
and those bees of course were released

1598
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:57,480
and those bees of course were released
 

1599
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,690
and those bees of course were released
into the wild at the end of the winter

1600
00:32:59,690 --> 00:32:59,700
into the wild at the end of the winter
 

1601
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,870
into the wild at the end of the winter

an idea or concept we had to prove

1608
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,080
an idea or concept we had to prove
 

1609
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,110
an idea or concept we had to prove
obviously that we can create this space

1610
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,120
obviously that we can create this space
 

1611
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,769
obviously that we can create this space
for uh for bees and then after that we

1612
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:15,779
for uh for bees and then after that we
 

1613
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,509
for uh for bees and then after that we
had this amazing opportunity to send the

1614
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
had this amazing opportunity to send the
 

1615
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,789
had this amazing opportunity to send the
bees to space on Blue Shepherd mission

1616
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:19,799
bees to space on Blue Shepherd mission
 

1617
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,909
bees to space on Blue Shepherd mission
that is part of blue origin and we of

1618
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:22,919
that is part of blue origin and we of
 

1619
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,070
that is part of blue origin and we of
course said yes we'll take a slot we

1620
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,080
course said yes we'll take a slot we
 

1621
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,289
course said yes we'll take a slot we
said okay can we outdo NASA so NASA in

1622
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:27,299
said okay can we outdo NASA so NASA in
 

1623
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,750
said okay can we outdo NASA so NASA in
1982 had an experiment where they sent b

1624
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:29,760
1982 had an experiment where they sent b
 

1625
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,710
1982 had an experiment where they sent b
b's to to outer space the bees returned

1626
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:33,720
b's to to outer space the bees returned
 

1627
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,130
b's to to outer space the bees returned
they were not reproductive and um

1628
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:37,140
they were not reproductive and um
 

1629
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,649
they were not reproductive and um
and some of them died and and we thought

1630
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:39,659
and some of them died and and we thought
 

1631
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:42,110
and some of them died and and we thought
well is there a way in which we can

1632
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,120
well is there a way in which we can
 

1633
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,690
well is there a way in which we can
create a life support system almost like

1634
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:44,700
create a life support system almost like
 

1635
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,450
create a life support system almost like
a small mini bio lab of a queen and her

1636
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:47,460
a small mini bio lab of a queen and her
 

1637
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,070
a small mini bio lab of a queen and her
retinue

1639
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,710
retinue
um that would be sent in this blue

1640
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:51,720
um that would be sent in this blue
 

1641
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,350
um that would be sent in this blue
origin new Shepherd Mission uh in this

1642
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,360
origin new Shepherd Mission uh in this
 

1643
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,330
origin new Shepherd Mission uh in this
one cell and and so that's if the

1644
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:56,340
one cell and and so that's if the
 

1645
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,710
one cell and and so that's if the
synthetic APO is an architectural

1646
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:57,720
synthetic APO is an architectural
 

1647
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,289
synthetic APO is an architectural
project in this case this second

00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:00,299
project in this case this second
 

1649
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,690

synthetic apiary was a product it was

1650
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:02,700
synthetic apiary was a product it was
 

1651
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,669
synthetic apiary was a product it was
right so from an from an architectural

00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:04,679
right so from an from an architectural
 

1653
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:07,310
right so from an from an architectural

lab this life support system for bees

1658
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:12,659
lab this life support system for bees
 

1659
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,710
lab this life support system for bees
was designed to provide the bees with

1660
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:15,720
was designed to provide the bees with
 

1661
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,230
was designed to provide the bees with
all the conditions that they needed and

1662
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,240
all the conditions that they needed and
 

1663
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,109
all the conditions that they needed and
and we looked at that time at the

1664
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
and we looked at that time at the
 

1665
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,690
and we looked at that time at the
national pheromone that the queen uses

1666
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:23,700
national pheromone that the queen uses
 

1667
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,589
national pheromone that the queen uses
to guide the other bees and we looked at

1668
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:26,599
to guide the other bees and we looked at
 

1669
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:29,030
to guide the other bees and we looked at
pheromones that are associated with a b

1670
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,040
pheromones that are associated with a b
 

1671
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,490
pheromones that are associated with a b
and thinking of those pheromones being

1672
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:31,500
and thinking of those pheromones being
 

1673
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,649
and thinking of those pheromones being
released inside the capsules that go the

1674
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:33,659
released inside the capsules that go the
 

1675
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,869
released inside the capsules that go the
capsule that goes to outer space they

00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:35,879
capsule that goes to outer space they
 

1677
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:39,470
capsule that goes to outer space they
returned um back to our the media lab

1678
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:39,480
returned um back to our the media lab
 

1679
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,349
returned um back to our the media lab
roof and those bees were alive and

1680
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:42,359
roof and those bees were alive and
 

1681
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,710
roof and those bees were alive and
kicking and reproductive and you know

1682
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:45,720
kicking and reproductive and you know
 

1683
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,409
kicking and reproductive and you know
and they continue to create comb and and

1684
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:48,419
and they continue to create comb and and
 

1685
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,050
and they continue to create comb and and
it ended with a beautiful nature paper

1686
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,060
it ended with a beautiful nature paper
 

1687
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,889
it ended with a beautiful nature paper
that the team and I published together

1688
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:53,899
that the team and I published together
 

1689
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,050
that the team and I published together
we gave them gold nanoparticles and

1690
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,060
we gave them gold nanoparticles and
 

1691
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,790
we gave them gold nanoparticles and
silver nanoparticles because we were

1692
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
silver nanoparticles because we were
 

1693
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,670
silver nanoparticles because we were
interested if if bees recycle wax it was

1694
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
interested if if bees recycle wax it was
 

1695
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,510
interested if if bees recycle wax it was
known

1696
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:02,520
known
 

1697
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,990
known
forever that bees do not recycle the wax

1698
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
forever that bees do not recycle the wax
 

1699
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,030
forever that bees do not recycle the wax
and by feeding them these gold

1700
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,040
and by feeding them these gold
 

1701
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,630
and by feeding them these gold
nanoparticles we were able to prove that

1702
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:11,640
nanoparticles we were able to prove that
 

1703
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,210
nanoparticles we were able to prove that
um that the bees actually do recycle the

1704
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:14,220
um that the bees actually do recycle the
 

1705
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,790
um that the bees actually do recycle the
wax the reason I'm bringing this forward

1706
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
wax the reason I'm bringing this forward
 

1707
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,470
wax the reason I'm bringing this forward
is because

1708
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,480
is because
 

1709
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,950
is because
we don't view ourselves as designers of

we don't view ourselves as designers of
 

1711
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,810
we don't view ourselves as designers of
consumable products and and

these projects that we created
 

1721
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,150
these projects that we created
involve the creation of a new technology

1722

involve the creation of a new technology
 

1723
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,490
involve the creation of a new technology
whether it be a glass printer or the

Colony they all involved a technology

1732
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
Colony they all involved a technology
 

1733
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,690
Colony they all involved a technology
that was associated with the the project

1734

that was associated with the the project
 

1735
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,790
that was associated with the the project
and I never ever ever want to let that

1736
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:49,800
and I never ever ever want to let that
 

1737
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,130
and I never ever ever want to let that
part go because I love love technology

1738
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,140
part go because I love love technology
 

1739

nature are science at the same time we
 

1761
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,950
nature are science at the same time we
don't separate between the art and the

1762
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:18,960
don't separate between the art and the
 

1763
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,690
don't separate between the art and the
science it's it's it's it's one of the

1764
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:20,700
science it's it's it's it's one of the
 

1765
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,390
science it's it's it's it's one of the
same so as you're creating the uh the

1766
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:23,400
same so as you're creating the uh the
 

1767
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,349
same so as you're creating the uh the
art you're going to learn something

1768
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:24,359
art you're going to learn something
 

1769
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:25,970
art you're going to learn something
about these organisms or something about

1770
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:25,980
about these organisms or something about
 

1771
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,530
about these organisms or something about
these materials I mean is there

1772
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:27,540
these materials I mean is there
 

1773
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,910
these materials I mean is there
something that stands out to you about

1774
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:28,920
something that stands out to you about
 

1775
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,089
something that stands out to you about
these hero organisms like bees silkworms

1776
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:32,099
these hero organisms like bees silkworms
 

1777
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:34,010
these hero organisms like bees silkworms
you mentioned E coli has its pros and

1778
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:34,020
you mentioned E coli has its pros and
 

1779
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,030
you mentioned E coli has its pros and
cons this bacteria what have you learned

1780
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,040
cons this bacteria what have you learned
 

1781
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,190
cons this bacteria what have you learned
that small or big that's interesting

1782
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:40,200
that small or big that's interesting
 

1783
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,010
that small or big that's interesting
about these organisms yeah it's a

1784
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:43,020
about these organisms yeah it's a
 

1785
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,290
about these organisms yeah it's a
beautiful question what have I learned

1786
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:45,300
beautiful question what have I learned
 

1787
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,089
beautiful question what have I learned
I've learned that

1788
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:47,099
I've learned that
 

1789
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:47,750
I've learned that
um

1790
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:47,760
um
 

1791
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,810
um
you know uh we did we also worked with

1792
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:50,820
you know uh we did we also worked with
 

1793
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,550
you know uh we did we also worked with
shrimp shells with ago how we built this

1794
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
shrimp shells with ago how we built this
 

1795
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,030
shrimp shells with ago how we built this
tower on the roof of SF Momo which by

1796
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,040
tower on the roof of SF Momo which by
 

1797
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,950
tower on the roof of SF Momo which by
um a couple of months ago and until it

1798
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:57,960
um a couple of months ago and until it
 

1799
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,470
um a couple of months ago and until it
was on the roof we we've shown the

1800
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
was on the roof we we've shown the
 

1801
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,210
was on the roof we we've shown the
structure completely biodegraded into

1802
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:02,220
structure completely biodegraded into
 

1803
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,130
structure completely biodegraded into
then well not completely but almost

1804
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,140
then well not completely but almost
 

1805
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,910
then well not completely but almost
completely biodegrade to the soil and

1806
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:07,920
completely biodegrade to the soil and
 

1807
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,390
completely biodegrade to the soil and
um and this notion that a product or

1808
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:11,400
um and this notion that a product or
 

1809
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,510
um and this notion that a product or
part an organism or part of that

1810
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:14,520
part an organism or part of that
 

1811
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,089
part an organism or part of that
organism can reincarnate is very very

1812
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:17,099
organism can reincarnate is very very
 

1813
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:20,930
organism can reincarnate is very very
moving thought to me because I

1814
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:20,940
moving thought to me because I
 

1815
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,609
moving thought to me because I
want to believe that I believe in

1816
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:22,619
want to believe that I believe in
 

1817
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:25,609
want to believe that I believe in
reincarnation I want to believe that I

1818
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:25,619
reincarnation I want to believe that I
 

1819
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,349
reincarnation I want to believe that I
believe yeah that's my relationship with

1820
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
believe yeah that's my relationship with
 

1821
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,230
believe yeah that's my relationship with
God I want to I want I I like to believe

1822
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240
God I want to I want I I like to believe
 

1823
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,870
God I want to I want I I like to believe
in believing most great things in life

1824
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:32,880
in believing most great things in life
 

1825
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,710
in believing most great things in life
are second derivatives of things but

1826
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
are second derivatives of things but
 

1827
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,170
are second derivatives of things but
that's part of another conversation I

1828
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:39,180
that's part of another conversation I
 

1829
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,550
that's part of another conversation I
feel like that's a quote that's gonna

1830
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,560
feel like that's a quote that's gonna
 

1831
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,670
feel like that's a quote that's gonna
take weeks to really internalize that

1832
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:43,680
take weeks to really internalize that
 

1833
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,310
take weeks to really internalize that
that notion of I want you to want or I

1834
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:46,320
that notion of I want you to want or I
 

1835
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,290
that notion of I want you to want or I
need you to need or

1836
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:48,300
need you to need or
 

1837
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,630
need you to need or
um that that that it there's always

1838
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
um that that that it there's always
 

1839
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,210
um that that that it there's always
something a deeper truth behind what is

1840
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,220
something a deeper truth behind what is
 

1841
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,490
something a deeper truth behind what is
on the surface and so I like to go to

1842
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:55,500
on the surface and so I like to go to
 

1843
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,630
on the surface and so I like to go to
the second and

1844
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:56,640
the second and
 

1845
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,930
the second and
tertiary derivative of things and and

1846
00:37:59,930 --> 00:37:59,940
tertiary derivative of things and and
 

1847
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,849
tertiary derivative of things and and
discover new truths about them through

1848
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:01,859
discover new truths about them through
 

1849
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:03,829
discover new truths about them through
that but what have I learned about

1850
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:03,839
that but what have I learned about
 

1851
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,890
that but what have I learned about
organisms and why don't you like E coli

1852
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:06,900
organisms and why don't you like E coli
 

1853
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,950
organisms and why don't you like E coli
I like E coli and and a lot of the work

1854
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:09,960
I like E coli and and a lot of the work
 

1855
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,650
I like E coli and and a lot of the work
that we've done uh was

1856
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:12,660
that we've done uh was
 

1857
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,230
that we've done uh was
possible without are working on E coli

1858
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,240
possible without are working on E coli
 

1859
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,470
possible without are working on E coli
or other Workhorse organisms like

1860
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480
or other Workhorse organisms like
 

1861
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,510
or other Workhorse organisms like
cyanobacteria how are bacteria used

1862
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:20,520
cyanobacteria how are bacteria used
 

1863
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,750
cyanobacteria how are bacteria used
Death Masks the Death Masks so what are

1864
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760
Death Masks the Death Masks so what are
 

1865
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,910
Death Masks the Death Masks so what are
Death Masks so we did this project

1866
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:25,920
Death Masks so we did this project
 

1867
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,670
Death Masks so we did this project
called Vespers and those were basically

1868
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:28,680
called Vespers and those were basically
 

1869
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,310
called Vespers and those were basically
death masks that was said as a process

1870
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:31,320
death masks that was said as a process
 

1871
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,270
death masks that was said as a process
for designing a living product what

1872
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:35,280
for designing a living product what
 

1873
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,490
for designing a living product what
happens and we looked at bit I looked at

1874
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:37,500
happens and we looked at bit I looked at
 

1875
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,650
happens and we looked at bit I looked at
the remember looking at Beethoven's

1876
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:39,660
the remember looking at Beethoven's
 

1877
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,270
the remember looking at Beethoven's
death mask and agamemnon's death mask

1878
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,280
death mask and agamemnon's death mask
 

1879
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,270
death mask and agamemnon's death mask
and just studying how they were created

1880
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:44,280
and just studying how they were created
 

1881
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,089
and just studying how they were created
and really they were sort of

1882
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:46,099
and really they were sort of
 

1883
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:48,950
and really they were sort of
geometrically attuned to the face of the

1884
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960
geometrically attuned to the face of the
 

1885
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,470
geometrically attuned to the face of the
dead and what we wanted to do is create

1886
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,480
dead and what we wanted to do is create
 

1887
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,990
dead and what we wanted to do is create
a death mask that not was not based in

1888
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,000
a death mask that not was not based in
 

1889
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,750
a death mask that not was not based in
the sh in was not based on the shape of

1890
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:56,760
the sh in was not based on the shape of
 

1891
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,690
the sh in was not based on the shape of
of the of the wear but rather it was

1892
00:38:59,690 --> 00:38:59,700
of the of the wear but rather it was
 

1893
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,450
of the of the wear but rather it was
based on their legacy and their biology

1894
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:02,460
based on their legacy and their biology
 

1895
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,030
based on their legacy and their biology
and maybe we could

1896
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,040
and maybe we could
 

1897
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,310
and maybe we could
um harness a few stem cells there for

1898
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:07,320
um harness a few stem cells there for
 

1899
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,250
um harness a few stem cells there for
future Generations or contain the last

1900
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:10,260
future Generations or contain the last
 

1901
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,950
future Generations or contain the last
breath Lazarus which preceded Vespers

1902
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:12,960
breath Lazarus which preceded Vespers
 

1903
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,069
breath Lazarus which preceded Vespers
was project where we designed a mask to

1904
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:16,079
was project where we designed a mask to
 

1905
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,530
was project where we designed a mask to
contain a single breath The Last Breath

1906
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:18,540
contain a single breath The Last Breath
 

1907
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,290
contain a single breath The Last Breath
of the wearer and again if I had access

1908
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:21,300
of the wearer and again if I had access
 

1909
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,210
of the wearer and again if I had access
to these Technologies today I would

1910
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:23,220
to these Technologies today I would
 

1911
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,670
to these Technologies today I would
totally

1912
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:24,680
totally
 

1913
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,870
totally
re-incorporate my grandmother's last

1914
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,880
re-incorporate my grandmother's last
 

1915
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,870
re-incorporate my grandmother's last
breath in in in in in a in a product so

1916
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:29,880
breath in in in in in a in a product so
 

1917
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,790
breath in in in in in a in a product so
it was like an air Memento so with

1918
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:31,800
it was like an air Memento so with
 

1919
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,310
it was like an air Memento so with
Vespers we um

1920
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
Vespers we um
 

1921
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,329
Vespers we um
we actually used E coli to

1922
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:38,339
we actually used E coli to
 

1923
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,390
we actually used E coli to
um to to create pigmented masks masks

1924
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:41,400
um to to create pigmented masks masks
 

1925
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,990
um to to create pigmented masks masks
whose pigments uh would be recreated at

1926
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,000
whose pigments uh would be recreated at
 

1927
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,109
whose pigments uh would be recreated at
the surface of the mask and

1928
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:48,119
the surface of the mask and
 

1929
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,569
the surface of the mask and
I'm skipping over a lot of content but

1930
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:50,579
I'm skipping over a lot of content but
 

1931
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:53,390
I'm skipping over a lot of content but
basically there were 15 masks and they

1932
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:53,400
basically there were 15 masks and they
 

1933
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,270
basically there were 15 masks and they
were created as three sets The Masks of

1934
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:56,280
were created as three sets The Masks of
 

1935
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,010
were created as three sets The Masks of
the past the mask of the present and the

1936
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,020
the past the mask of the present and the
 

1937
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,050
the past the mask of the present and the
mask of the future

1938
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:00,060
mask of the future
 

1939
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,970
mask of the future
um The Masks there were five five and

1940
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:01,980
um The Masks there were five five and
 

1941
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,010
um The Masks there were five five and
five and the mass of the past were based

1942
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:04,020
five and the mass of the past were based
 

1943
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,270
five and the mass of the past were based
on

1944
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
on
 

1945
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,810
on
um ornaments and they were

1946
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:08,820
um ornaments and they were
 

1947
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,410
um ornaments and they were
um

1948
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:09,420
um
 

1949
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,410

fractal patterns that are symmetrical

1958
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,359
fractal patterns that are symmetrical
 

1959
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,609
fractal patterns that are symmetrical
they look symmetrical but they're not

1960
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:25,619
they look symmetrical but they're not
 

1961
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,910
they look symmetrical but they're not
this is intense this is we intended for

this is intense this is we intended for
 

1963
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,190
this is intense this is we intended for
you to be tricked and think that they're

distribution of matter that you're
 

1979
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:46,430
distribution of matter that you're
looking at was was entirely designed

1980
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:46,440
looking at was was entirely designed
 

1981
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,710
looking at was was entirely designed
using a computational program so none of

1982
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:48,720
using a computational program so none of
 

1983
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,230
using a computational program so none of
it is manual

1984
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:51,240
it is manual
 

1985
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,109
it is manual
um but long story short the first

1986
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:54,119
um but long story short the first
 

1987
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,150
um but long story short the first
collection is about the surface of the

1988
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,160
collection is about the surface of the
 

1989
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,589
collection is about the surface of the
mask and the second collection which

1990
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
mask and the second collection which
 

1991
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,810
mask and the second collection which
you're looking at is about the volume of

1992
00:40:59,810 --> 00:40:59,820
you're looking at is about the volume of
 

1993
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,270
you're looking at is about the volume of
the mask and and and what happens to the

1994
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:02,280
the mask and and and what happens to the
 

1995
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,069
the mask and and and what happens to the
mask when all the colors from the

1996
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
mask when all the colors from the
 

1997
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,370
mask when all the colors from the
surface yes enter the volume of the mask

guide life through them
 

2003
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,270
guide life through them
um they were Incorporated with pigment

2004
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:14,280
um they were Incorporated with pigment
 

2005
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,430
um they were Incorporated with pigment
producing living organisms and then

2006
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:16,440
producing living organisms and then
 

2007
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,370
producing living organisms and then
those organisms were templated to

2008
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:19,380
those organisms were templated to
 

2009
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,650
those organisms were templated to
recreate the patterns of the original

2010
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:21,660
recreate the patterns of the original
 

2011
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,829
recreate the patterns of the original
death masks and so life recycles and

2012
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:24,839
death masks and so life recycles and
 

2013
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:27,109
death masks and so life recycles and
re-biggins and so on and so forth the

2014
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:27,119
re-biggins and so on and so forth the
 

2015
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,970

past meets the future the future meets

2016
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:28,980
past meets the future the future meets
 

2017
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,030
past meets the future the future meets
the past from the surface to the volume

2018
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:32,040
the past from the surface to the volume
 

2019
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,370
the past from the surface to the volume
from Death to life to death to life to

2020
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:34,380
from Death to life to death to life to
 

2021
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,589
from Death to life to death to life to
death to life and that again is a

2022
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:36,599
death to life and that again is a
 

2023
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,630
death to life and that again is a
recurring theme in in the projects that

2024
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:38,640
recurring theme in in the projects that
 

2025
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,329
recurring theme in in the projects that
that we take on but there from a

2026
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:41,339
that we take on but there from a
 

2027
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,190
that we take on but there from a
technological perspective what was

2028
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,200
technological perspective what was
 

2029
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,530
technological perspective what was
interesting is that we embedded chemical

2030
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:45,540
interesting is that we embedded chemical
 

2031
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,650
interesting is that we embedded chemical
signals in the jet in the printer and

2032
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:48,660
signals in the jet in the printer and
 

2033
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,630
signals in the jet in the printer and
those chemical signals

2034
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:50,640
those chemical signals
 

2035
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,250
those chemical signals
um basically interacted with the

2036
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:55,260
um basically interacted with the
 

2037
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,250
um basically interacted with the
um pigment producing bacteria uh in in

2038
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:58,260
um pigment producing bacteria uh in in
 

2039
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,370
um pigment producing bacteria uh in in
this case E coli that were introduced on

2040
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:01,380
this case E coli that were introduced on
 

2041
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,870
this case E coli that were introduced on
the surface of the mask and those

2042
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:02,880
the surface of the mask and those
 

2043
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,030
the surface of the mask and those
interactions between the chemical

2044
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,040
interactions between the chemical
 

2045
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,450
interactions between the chemical
signals inside the resins and the

2046
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:08,460
signals inside the resins and the
 

2047
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,450
signals inside the resins and the
bacteria at the surface of the mask at

2048
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:11,460
bacteria at the surface of the mask at
 

2049
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,069
bacteria at the surface of the mask at
the resolution that is native to the

2050
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:13,079
the resolution that is native to the
 

2051
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,650
the resolution that is native to the
printer in this case 20 microns per

2052
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:15,660
printer in this case 20 microns per
 

2053
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,430
printer in this case 20 microns per
voxel allowed us to compute the exact

2054
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:19,440
voxel allowed us to compute the exact
 

2055
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,290
voxel allowed us to compute the exact
patterns that we wanted to achieve and

2056
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:21,300
patterns that we wanted to achieve and
 

2057
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,690
patterns that we wanted to achieve and
we thought well if we can do this with

2058
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:23,700
we thought well if we can do this with
 

2059
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,609
we thought well if we can do this with
pigments can we do this with antibiotics

2060
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:25,619
pigments can we do this with antibiotics
 

2061
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,170
pigments can we do this with antibiotics
if we can do this with antibiotics could

2062
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:27,180
if we can do this with antibiotics could
 

2063
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,210
if we can do this with antibiotics could
we do it with with melanin and what are

2064
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:29,220
we do it with with melanin and what are
 

2065
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,010
we do it with with melanin and what are
the implications again this is a

2066
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,020
the implications again this is a
 

2067
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,710
the implications again this is a
platform technology now that we have it

2068
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:33,720
platform technology now that we have it
 

2069
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,990
platform technology now that we have it
what are the actual real world

2070
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
what are the actual real world
 

2071
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,530
what are the actual real world
implications and potential applications

2072
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:38,540
implications and potential applications
 

2073
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,829
implications and potential applications
for this technology and we started a new

2074
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:42,839
for this technology and we started a new
 

2075
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,310
for this technology and we started a new

templating bacteria at a much much

2106
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,280
templating bacteria at a much much
 

2107
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,770
templating bacteria at a much much
um much a more finer resolution and now

2108
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:27,780
um much a more finer resolution and now
 

2109
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,349
um much a more finer resolution and now
instead of templating using using a

2110
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:30,359
instead of templating using using a
 

2111
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:33,170
instead of templating using using a
robot or templating using a printer but

2112
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:33,180
robot or templating using a printer but
 

2113
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,450
robot or templating using a printer but
compute is very very much part of it and

the what's nice about bacteria of course

2116
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:38,099
the what's nice about bacteria of course
 

2117
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:39,710
the what's nice about bacteria of course
is that

2118
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:39,720
is that
 

2119
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,470
is that
um from an ethical perspective I think

2120
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:42,480
um from an ethical perspective I think
 

2121
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,450
um from an ethical perspective I think
there's a range right so at the end of

um uh genes that are taken from a spider

2144
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:10,500
um uh genes that are taken from a spider
 

2145
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,250
um uh genes that are taken from a spider
to a silkworm and this is what is known

2146
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:13,260
to a silkworm and this is what is known
 

2147
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,309
to a silkworm and this is what is known
as a transgenic operation and we said no

2148
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:16,319
as a transgenic operation and we said no
 

2149
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,950
as a transgenic operation and we said no
and that was for us a clear decision

2150
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
and that was for us a clear decision
 

2151
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,250
and that was for us a clear decision
that no we will work with these

2152
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:22,260
that no we will work with these
 

2153
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,430
that no we will work with these
organisms as long as we know that what

2154
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
organisms as long as we know that what
 

2155
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,250
organisms as long as we know that what
we are doing with them is not only

2156
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:28,260
we are doing with them is not only
 

2157
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,589
we are doing with them is not only
better for humans but it's also better

2158
00:44:30,589 --> 00:44:30,599
better for humans but it's also better
 

2159
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,750
better for humans but it's also better
for them and and again just to remind

where some of us like to live and and
 

2233
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,010
where some of us like to live and and
like to thrive and and that's okay and

2234
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:13,020
like to thrive and and that's okay and
 

2235
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,809
like to thrive and and that's okay and
and thank goodness that there's so many

2236
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:14,819
and thank goodness that there's so many
 

2237
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:17,329
and thank goodness that there's so many
of us that that like the black and white

2238
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:17,339
of us that that like the black and white
 

2239
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,190
of us that that like the black and white
and that thrive in the black and white

2240
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,200
and that thrive in the black and white
 

2241
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,470
and that thrive in the black and white
my husband is a good example for that

2242
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:21,480
my husband is a good example for that
 

2243
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,870
my husband is a good example for that
well but just to clarify in this case

2244
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:23,880
well but just to clarify in this case
 

2245
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,730
well but just to clarify in this case
you're also trying to thrive in the

2246
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:25,740
you're also trying to thrive in the
 

2247
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,309
you're also trying to thrive in the
black and white in that you're saying

2248
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
black and white in that you're saying
 

2249
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,849
black and white in that you're saying
like the silkworm is a beautiful

2250
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:30,859
like the silkworm is a beautiful
 

2251
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:33,589
like the silkworm is a beautiful
wonderful creature let us not modify it

2252
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:33,599
wonderful creature let us not modify it
 

2253
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,050
wonderful creature let us not modify it
is that the idea or is it okay to modify

2254
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:36,060
is that the idea or is it okay to modify
 

2255
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,630
is that the idea or is it okay to modify
a little bit as long as we can see that

2256
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:38,640
a little bit as long as we can see that
 

2257
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,849
a little bit as long as we can see that
it benefits the organism as well as the

2258
00:46:40,849 --> 00:46:40,859
it benefits the organism as well as the
 

2259
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:43,130
it benefits the organism as well as the
final creation uh so with silkworms

2260
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:43,140
final creation uh so with silkworms
 

2261
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,930
final creation uh so with silkworms
absolutely let's not modify it

2262
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:44,940
absolutely let's not modify it
 

2263
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,589
absolutely let's not modify it
genetically let's not modify genetically

2264
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:48,599
genetically let's not modify genetically
 

2265
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:49,309
genetically let's not modify genetically
um

2266
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:49,319
um
 

2267
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:52,190
um
and then some because why did we why did

2268
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:52,200
and then some because why did we why did
 

2269
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,930
and then some because why did we why did
we get there to begin with four thousand

2270
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:53,940
we get there to begin with four thousand
 

2271
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,109
we get there to begin with four thousand
years ago in the Silk Road and and

2272
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:57,119
years ago in the Silk Road and and
 

2273
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,210
years ago in the Silk Road and and
we should never get to a point where we

2274
00:46:59,210 --> 00:46:59,220
we should never get to a point where we
 

2275
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,569
we should never get to a point where we
evolve life for the service of mankind

2276
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:02,579
evolve life for the service of mankind
 

2277
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:06,710
evolve life for the service of mankind
at the risk of these wonderful creatures

2278
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:06,720
at the risk of these wonderful creatures
 

2279
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,210
at the risk of these wonderful creatures
um across the kingdoms across the

2280
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:08,220
um across the kingdoms across the
 

2281
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,970
um across the kingdoms across the
kingdom of life I don't think about the

2282
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:10,980
kingdom of life I don't think about the
 

2283
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,089
kingdom of life I don't think about the
same kind of ethical range

2284
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:14,099
same kind of ethical range
 

2285
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,710
same kind of ethical range
um when I think about bacteria

2286
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:15,720
um when I think about bacteria
 

2287
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,690
um when I think about bacteria
nevertheless bacteria are pretty

2288
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:17,700
nevertheless bacteria are pretty
 

2289
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,490
nevertheless bacteria are pretty
wonderful organisms I'm moving to my

2290
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:19,500
wonderful organisms I'm moving to my
 

2291
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,370
wonderful organisms I'm moving to my
second cup here

2292
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:21,380
second cup here
 

2293
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,510
second cup here
as things are getting serious now

2294
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:23,520
as things are getting serious now
 

2295
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,390
as things are getting serious now
bacteria are yeah for sure let's give

2296
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
bacteria are yeah for sure let's give
 

2297
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,890
bacteria are yeah for sure let's give
bacteria all the love they deserve we

2298
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:27,900
bacteria all the love they deserve we
 

2299
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,390
bacteria all the love they deserve we
wouldn't be here without them they were

2300
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:29,400
wouldn't be here without them they were
 

2301
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,309
wouldn't be here without them they were
here for I don't know what it is like a

2302
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:31,319
here for I don't know what it is like a
 

2303
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:32,870
here for I don't know what it is like a
billion years before anything else but

2304
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:32,880
billion years before anything else but
 

2305
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,730
billion years before anything else but
in a way if you think about it they

2306
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:34,740
in a way if you think about it they
 

2307
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,370
in a way if you think about it they
create the matter that we consume and

2308
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:37,380
create the matter that we consume and
 

2309
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,450
create the matter that we consume and
then

2310
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:38,460
then
 

2311
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,170
then
and then we reincarnate or dissolved

2312
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:42,180
and then we reincarnate or dissolved
 

2313
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,930
and then we reincarnate or dissolved
into the soil and then creates an a tree

2314
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:44,940
into the soil and then creates an a tree
 

2315
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,849
into the soil and then creates an a tree
and then that tree creates more bacteria

2316
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:46,859
and then that tree creates more bacteria
 

2317
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,530
and then that tree creates more bacteria
and then that bacteria could I mean

2318
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:48,540
and then that bacteria could I mean
 

2319
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,109
and then that bacteria could I mean
again again that's why I like to think

2320
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,119
again again that's why I like to think
 

2321
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,650
again again that's why I like to think
about not recycling but reincarnating

2322
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:53,660
about not recycling but reincarnating
 

2323
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:57,349
about not recycling but reincarnating
because that assumes a kind of imparting

2324
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
because that assumes a kind of imparting
 

2325
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,550
because that assumes a kind of imparting
upon nature that dimension of agency and

2326
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:01,560
upon nature that dimension of agency and
 

2327
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,089
upon nature that dimension of agency and
and maybe awareness but yeah lots of

2328
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:05,099
and maybe awareness but yeah lots of
 

2329
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:06,470
and maybe awareness but yeah lots of
really interesting work happening with

2330
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,480
really interesting work happening with
 

2331
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,050
really interesting work happening with
bacteria

2332
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:09,060

 

2333
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,670

um directed evolution is one of them

2334
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:10,680
um directed evolution is one of them
 

2335
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,010
um directed evolution is one of them
we're looking we're looking at directed

2336
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:13,020
we're looking we're looking at directed
 

2337
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,750
we're looking we're looking at directed
Evolution so high throughput directed

2338
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:14,760
Evolution so high throughput directed
 

2339
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,730
Evolution so high throughput directed
evolution of

2340
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:16,740
evolution of
 

2341
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:18,950
evolution of
um of bacteria for the production of

2342
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
um of bacteria for the production of
 

2343
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,230
um of bacteria for the production of
products and again those products can be

2344
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:21,240

wonderful time to be a designer I can
 

2371
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:50,510
wonderful time to be a designer I can
think of a better time to be a designer

00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:50,520
think of a better time to be a designer
 

2373
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,130
think of a better time to be a designer
in this world

2392
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,160
um and in those Grow rooms we can
 

2393
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,130
um and in those Grow rooms we can
basically

2394
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:16,140
basically
 

2395
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,730
basically
um

2396
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:16,740
um
 

2397
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,470
um
program

2398
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
program
 

2399
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,329
program
um top-down environmental templating

2400
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:20,339
um top-down environmental templating
 

2401
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,069
um top-down environmental templating
right top-down environmental control of

2402
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:22,079
right top-down environmental control of
 

2403
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,470
right top-down environmental control of
Lights humidity light Etc so light

2404
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:24,480
Lights humidity light Etc so light
 

2405
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,390
Lights humidity light Etc so light
humidity and temperature

2406
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:26,400
humidity and temperature
 

2407
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,309
humidity and temperature
um while doing a bottom-up genetic

2408
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:28,319
um while doing a bottom-up genetic
 

2409
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,530
um while doing a bottom-up genetic
regulation so it is a wet lab but in

2410
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:30,540
regulation so it is a wet lab but in
 

2411
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,690
regulation so it is a wet lab but in
that wet lab you could do at the same

2412
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:32,700
that wet lab you could do at the same
 

2413
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,410
that wet lab you could do at the same
time you know genetic genetic modulation

2414
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:35,420
time you know genetic genetic modulation
 

2415
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,790
time you know genetic genetic modulation
regulation and and environmental

2416
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:37,800
regulation and and environmental
 

2417
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,490
regulation and and environmental
templating and then again the idea is

2418
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:40,500
templating and then again the idea is
 

2419
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,349
templating and then again the idea is
that in one of those capsules maybe we

2420
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:42,359
that in one of those capsules maybe we
 

2421
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:43,970
that in one of those capsules maybe we
grow transparent wood and in another

2422
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:43,980
grow transparent wood and in another
 

2423
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:46,250
grow transparent wood and in another
capsule we you know we transparent wood

2424
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:46,260
capsule we you know we transparent wood
 

2425
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:47,510
capsule we you know we transparent wood
for architectural application another

2426
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520
for architectural application another
 

2427
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,150
for architectural application another
capsule we grow a shoe and in another

2428
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
capsule we grow a shoe and in another
 

2429
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,150
capsule we grow a shoe and in another
capsule we look at that language you

2430
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:53,160
capsule we look at that language you
 

2431
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,950
capsule we look at that language you
know large language model that we talked

2432
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
know large language model that we talked
 

2433
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,630
know large language model that we talked
about and there's a particular

2434
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
about and there's a particular
 

2435
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,250
about and there's a particular
technology associated with that which

2436
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:58,260
technology associated with that which
 

2437
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,470
technology associated with that which
we're hoping to reveal to the world in

2438
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,480
we're hoping to reveal to the world in
 

2439
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,730
we're hoping to reveal to the world in
February

2440
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:01,740
February
 

2441
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,710
February
um and in each of those capsules is

2442
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:03,720
um and in each of those capsules is
 

2443
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,109
um and in each of those capsules is
basically a high throughput

2444
00:50:06,109 --> 00:50:06,119
basically a high throughput
 

2445
00:50:06,119 --> 00:50:09,349
basically a high throughput
computational environment like a

2446
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
computational environment like a
 

2447
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,569
computational environment like a
breadboard that has think of sort of a

2448
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:11,579
breadboard that has think of sort of a
 

2449
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,609
breadboard that has think of sort of a
physical breadboard environment that has

2450
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:13,619
physical breadboard environment that has
 

2451
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:16,870
physical breadboard environment that has
access to oxygen and nitrogen and CO2

2452
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:16,880
access to oxygen and nitrogen and CO2
 

2453
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,630
access to oxygen and nitrogen and CO2
and nutritional dispensing and these

2454
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:20,640
and nutritional dispensing and these
 

2455
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,510
and nutritional dispensing and these
little capsules could be stressed

2456
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,520
little capsules could be stressed
 

2457
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,050
little capsules could be stressed
they're sort of a an ecology in a box

2458
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:26,060
they're sort of a an ecology in a box
 

2459
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,490
they're sort of a an ecology in a box
and they could be stressed to produce

2460
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:28,500
and they could be stressed to produce
 

2461
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,710
and they could be stressed to produce
the food of the future or the products

2462
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:30,720
the food of the future or the products
 

2463
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,970
the food of the future or the products
of the future or the construction

2464
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:31,980
of the future or the construction
 

2465
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,430
of the future or the construction
materials of the future

materials of the future
 

2467
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,410
materials of the future
um food food is a very interesting one

2468
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:36,420
um food food is a very interesting one
 

2469
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,390
um food food is a very interesting one
obviously because of food insecurity and

2470
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:38,400
obviously because of food insecurity and
 

2471
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,309
obviously because of food insecurity and
and and the issues that we have around

2472
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:40,319
and and the issues that we have around
 

2473
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,470
and and the issues that we have around
both in terms of

2474
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:42,480
both in terms of
 

2475
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,750
both in terms of
food insecurity but also in terms of the

2476
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:44,760
food insecurity but also in terms of the
 

2477
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,030
food insecurity but also in terms of the
future of food and what what will remain

2478
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:47,040
future of food and what what will remain
 

2479
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,950
future of food and what what will remain
after we can't eat plants and animals

2480
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:48,960
after we can't eat plants and animals
 

2481
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,750
after we can't eat plants and animals
anymore and all we can eat is these

2482
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:50,760
anymore and all we can eat is these
 

2483
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,809
anymore and all we can eat is these
false bananas and and and and and

2484
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:53,819
false bananas and and and and and
 

2485
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:55,970
false bananas and and and and and
um you know and insects as our protein

2486
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:55,980
um you know and insects as our protein
 

2487
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,130
um you know and insects as our protein
source so there we're thinking you know

2488
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:58,140
source so there we're thinking you know
 

2489
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,650
source so there we're thinking you know
can we design these capsules to stress

2490
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:00,660
can we design these capsules to stress
 

2491
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,049
can we design these capsules to stress
an environment and see how that

2492
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:03,059
an environment and see how that
 

2493
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:05,270
an environment and see how that
environment behaves think about a kind

2494
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,280
environment behaves think about a kind
 

2495
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,290
environment behaves think about a kind
of a an ecological a a biodiversity

2496
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:09,300
of a an ecological a a biodiversity
 

2497
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,630
of a an ecological a a biodiversity
chamber right a kind of a time capsule

did tomatoes taste like uh to all the
 

2515
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,730
did tomatoes taste like uh to all the
way in the future 200 years ago these

00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:34,740
way in the future 200 years ago these
 

2517
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,530
way in the future 200 years ago these
are the the input the environmental

2518
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:36,540
are the the input the environmental
 

2519
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,089
are the the input the environmental
inputs these are some genetic

inputs these are some genetic
 

2521
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,910
inputs these are some genetic
regulations that I'm testing and what

2522
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:40,920
regulations that I'm testing and what
 

2523
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,530
regulations that I'm testing and what
might the food of the future or the

um
 

2531
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:49,190
um
feel like tests like behave like Etc and

2532
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:49,200
feel like tests like behave like Etc and
 

2533
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,750
feel like tests like behave like Etc and
so these capsules are designed as part

2534
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:50,760
so these capsules are designed as part
 

2535
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,549
so these capsules are designed as part
of a lab that's why it's been taking us

2536
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:52,559
of a lab that's why it's been taking us
 

2537
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,430
of a lab that's why it's been taking us
such a long time to get to this point

2538
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:55,440
such a long time to get to this point
 

2539
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,930
such a long time to get to this point
um because we started designing them in

2540
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:56,940
um because we started designing them in
 

2541
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,109
um because we started designing them in
2019 and they're currently literally as

2542
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:00,119
2019 and they're currently literally as
 

2543

00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,030
I speak to you under construction how
well is it understood how to do this

2546
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,040
well is it understood how to do this
 

2547
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,470
well is it understood how to do this

been done before and these capsules have

2554
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:13,079
been done before and these capsules have
 

2555
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,049
been done before and these capsules have
never been designed before so I you know

2556
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:15,059
never been designed before so I you know
 

2557
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:17,150
never been designed before so I you know
when when when we first decided these

2558
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:17,160
when when when we first decided these
 

2559
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,349
when when when we first decided these
are going to be environmental capsules

2560
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:18,359
are going to be environmental capsules
 

2561
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:19,849
are going to be environmental capsules
people thought were crazy what are you

2562
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:19,859
people thought were crazy what are you
 

2563
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:21,890
people thought were crazy what are you
building what are you making so the

2564
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:21,900
building what are you making so the
 

2565
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,870
building what are you making so the
answer is that we don't know but we know

2566
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:23,880
answer is that we don't know but we know
 

2567
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,790
answer is that we don't know but we know
that there has never been a space like

2568
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:25,800
that there has never been a space like
 

2569
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,670
that there has never been a space like
this where you have basically a wet lab

2570
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:28,680
this where you have basically a wet lab
 

2571
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,390
this where you have basically a wet lab
and a grow room at that resolution

2572
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:32,400
and a grow room at that resolution
 

2573
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,650
and a grow room at that resolution
um that granularity uh of of of of of of

2574
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:36,660
um that granularity uh of of of of of of
 

2575
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,010
um that granularity uh of of of of of of
control over organisms

2576
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:40,020
control over organisms
 

2577
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,530
control over organisms
there's a reason why there is this

2578
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:42,540
there's a reason why there is this
 

2579
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,890
there's a reason why there is this
incredible evolution of products in the

2580
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:45,900
incredible evolution of products in the
 

2581
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,990
incredible evolution of products in the
software space

2582
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000
software space
 

2583
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,569
software space
um the hardware space that's a more

2584
00:52:50,569 --> 00:52:50,579
um the hardware space that's a more
 

2585
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:52,549
um the hardware space that's a more
limiting space that because of the

2586
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
limiting space that because of the
 

2587
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,829
limiting space that because of the
physical infrastructure that we have to

2588
00:52:54,829 --> 00:52:54,839
physical infrastructure that we have to
 

2589
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,690
physical infrastructure that we have to
test and experiment with things so we

2590
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:56,700
test and experiment with things so we
 

2591
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,849
test and experiment with things so we
really wanted to push on

2592
00:52:58,849 --> 00:52:58,859
really wanted to push on
 

2593
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:01,609
really wanted to push on

2710
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:28,260
don't want to happen online and software
 

2711
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,710
don't want to happen online and software
with language we want for it to happen

2712
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
with language we want for it to happen
 

2713
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,750
with language we want for it to happen
with with bio-based materials because

2714
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:32,760
with with bio-based materials because
 

2715
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,910
with with bio-based materials because
that will get us closer to growing

2716
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:34,920
that will get us closer to growing
 

2717
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,549
that will get us closer to growing
things as opposed to assembly and and

2718
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:37,559
things as opposed to assembly and and
 

2719
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:39,710
things as opposed to assembly and and
mechanically yeah putting them together

2720
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:39,720
mechanically yeah putting them together
 

2721
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,430
mechanically yeah putting them together
with toxic materials and compounds if I

2722
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:43,440
with toxic materials and compounds if I
 

2723
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,109
with toxic materials and compounds if I
can ask a pothead question for a second

2724
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:45,119
can ask a pothead question for a second
 

2725
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,329
can ask a pothead question for a second
so you mentioned just like the silkworms

2726
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:47,339
so you mentioned just like the silkworms
 

2727
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:51,710
so you mentioned just like the silkworms
the individualists silkworms got uh to

2728
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:51,720
the individualists silkworms got uh to
 

2729
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,089
the individualists silkworms got uh to
actually learn how to collaborate or

2730
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:53,099
actually learn how to collaborate or
 

2731
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,010
actually learn how to collaborate or
actually to collaborate like in a swarm

2732
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:55,020
actually to collaborate like in a swarm
 

2733
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,750
actually to collaborate like in a swarm
like way you're talking about getting

2734
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:56,760
like way you're talking about getting
 

2735
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,790
like way you're talking about getting
plants to communicate in some

2736
00:55:58,790 --> 00:55:58,800
plants to communicate in some
 

2737
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,890
plants to communicate in some
interesting way based on an objective

2738
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:00,900
interesting way based on an objective
 

2739
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,170
interesting way based on an objective
function is it possible

2740
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:03,180
function is it possible
 

2741
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,230
function is it possible
to have some kind of interface between

2742
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,240
to have some kind of interface between
 

2743
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,250
to have some kind of interface between
another kind of organisms humans and

2744
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:10,260
another kind of organisms humans and
 

2745
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,950
another kind of organisms humans and
nature so like a human to have a

2746
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
nature so like a human to have a
 

2747
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,230
nature so like a human to have a
conversation with with a plant there

2748
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:15,240
conversation with with a plant there
 

2749
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,690
conversation with with a plant there
already is you know that when we cut

2750
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:17,700
already is you know that when we cut
 

2751
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,750
already is you know that when we cut
freshly cut grass I love the smell

2752
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:20,760
freshly cut grass I love the smell
 

2753
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,030
freshly cut grass I love the smell
but it's a smell of actually it's a

2754
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,040
but it's a smell of actually it's a
 

2755
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,190
but it's a smell of actually it's a
smell of distress that the Leaves of

2756
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:25,200
smell of distress that the Leaves of
 

2757
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,470
smell of distress that the Leaves of
Grass are communicating to each other so

2758
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:27,480
Grass are communicating to each other so
 

2759
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,849
Grass are communicating to each other so
the grass when it's cut emits green leaf

2760
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:30,859
the grass when it's cut emits green leaf
 

2761
00:56:30,859 --> 00:56:34,370
the grass when it's cut emits green leaf
volatiles glvs and those glvs are

2762
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:34,380
volatiles glvs and those glvs are
 

2763
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,930
volatiles glvs and those glvs are
basically one leaf of grass

2764
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:35,940
basically one leaf of grass
 

2765
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,790
basically one leaf of grass
communicating to another Leaf of grass

2766
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:37,800
communicating to another Leaf of grass
 

2767
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,250
communicating to another Leaf of grass

than ours we use language models they

2776
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,280
than ours we use language models they
 

2777
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,329
than ours we use language models they
use molecular models at the moment where

00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:58,140
having a conversation with plants now of
 

2785
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,530
having a conversation with plants now of
course there is a lot of work around

2786
00:56:59,530 --> 00:56:59,540
course there is a lot of work around

Plant neurobiology it's a real thing
 

2789
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,410
Plant neurobiology it's a real thing
plants do not have a nervous system but

2790
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:06,420
plants do not have a nervous system but
 

2791
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,990
plants do not have a nervous system but
they have something akin to a nervous

2792

they have something akin to a nervous
 

2793
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,630
they have something akin to a nervous
system it has a kind of a ecological

is very very slow slow slow time scale
so it is when we can melt these time

2802
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:23,220
so it is when we can melt these time

the language in this case molecules the
 

2809
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,290
the language in this case molecules the
duration of the language and we can

00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:18,180
that it operates on different scales we
 

2903
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,170

recently discovered that uh you know

2904
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:21,180
recently discovered that uh you know
 

2905
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,450
recently discovered that uh you know
that the molecular footprint of a rose

2906
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:23,460
that the molecular footprint of a rose
 

2907
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,609
that the molecular footprint of a rose
or of a plant in general during night

2908
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:25,619
or of a plant in general during night
 

2909
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:27,589
or of a plant in general during night
time is different than its molecular

2910
00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:27,599
time is different than its molecular
 

2911
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,450
time is different than its molecular
footprint during daytime so these are

2912
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:29,460
footprint during daytime so these are
 

2913
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,430
footprint during daytime so these are
circadian rhythms that are associated

2914
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
circadian rhythms that are associated
 

2915
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,910
circadian rhythms that are associated
with what kind of molecules these plants

2916
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:34,920
with what kind of molecules these plants
 

2917
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,470
with what kind of molecules these plants
emit

um you know there's a reason why

2922
00:59:43,089 --> 00:59:43,099
um you know there's a reason why
 

2923
00:59:43,099 --> 00:59:47,329
um you know there's a reason why
why the Jasmine Jasmine field smells so

2924
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:47,339
why the Jasmine Jasmine field smells so
 

2925
00:59:47,339 --> 00:59:50,030

and rest amongst you know amongst the
 

2931
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,109
and rest amongst you know amongst the
plants and you have to sort of tune into

2932
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,119
plants and you have to sort of tune into
 

2933
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,849
plants and you have to sort of tune into
that

2934

time dimension of of the plant kingdom
 

2937
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,109
time dimension of of the plant kingdom
and that of course requires all this

2938
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:03,119
and that of course requires all this
 

2939
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,809

night of the year
and then we let them go and think about

2964
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:35,640
and then we let them go and think about
 

2965
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,510
and then we let them go and think about
in nature to design a quote-unquote

2966
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:38,520
in nature to design a quote-unquote

in the scale of thousands of years no
 

2989
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,970
in the scale of thousands of years no
I'm not and the way of being in the

I'm not and the way of being in the
 

2991
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,710
I'm not and the way of being in the

tune with the time dimension of the
 

2995
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,530
tune with the time dimension of the
natural world at all and um and and that

2996
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:21,540
natural world at all and um and and that
 

2997
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,990
natural world at all and um and and that
needs to change and that's obviously

2998
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:24,000
needs to change and that's obviously
 

2999
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,250
needs to change and that's obviously
very very hard to do in a community in

3000
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:28,260
very very hard to do in a community in
 

3001
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,910
very very hard to do in a community in
of of human beings that is at least in

of of human beings that is at least in
 

3003
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,650
of of human beings that is at least in
the western world that is based on

01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:33,660
the western world that is based on
 

3005
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:36,470
the western world that is based on
capitalism and so here the wonderful

3006
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:36,480
capitalism and so here the wonderful
 

3007
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,630
capitalism and so here the wonderful
challenge that we have ahead of us is

3008
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:38,640
challenge that we have ahead of us is
 

3009
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,510
challenge that we have ahead of us is
how do we impart upon the capitalist

3010
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
how do we impart upon the capitalist
 

3011
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,670
how do we impart upon the capitalist
Movement we know that we need to produce

01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:43,680
Movement we know that we need to produce
 

3013
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,890
Movement we know that we need to produce
Now Products that will enter the real

3014
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:45,900
Now Products that will enter the real
 

3015
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,670
Now Products that will enter the real
world and be you know shared and used by

3016
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:49,680
world and be you know shared and used by
 

3017
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,490
world and be you know shared and used by
others and still benefit the natural

3018
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:52,500
others and still benefit the natural
 

3019
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,470
others and still benefit the natural
world while benefiting humans and that's

3020
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,480
world while benefiting humans and that's
 

3021
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,150
world while benefiting humans and that's
a wonderful challenge to have so

3022
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,160
a wonderful challenge to have so
 

3023
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,730
a wonderful challenge to have so
integrate technology with nature and

3024
01:01:58,730 --> 01:01:58,740
integrate technology with nature and
 

3025
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:00,950
integrate technology with nature and
that's a really difficult problem I see

3026
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:00,960
that's a really difficult problem I see
 

3027
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,170
that's a really difficult problem I see

parallels here with another company of
 

3029
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,210
parallels here with another company of
newer link which is

3030
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:05,220
newer link which is
 

3031
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,130
newer link which is
uh is basically like you I think you

3032
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:07,140
uh is basically like you I think you
 

3033
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:11,510
uh is basically like you I think you
mentioned neuralink for nature that

3034
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,520

 

3035
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,430

their short-term products you can come

3036
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
their short-term products you can come
 

3037
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,670
their short-term products you can come
up with but it's ultimately a long-term

3038
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:16,680
up with but it's ultimately a long-term
 

3039
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,829
up with but it's ultimately a long-term
challenge of how do you integrate the

3040
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:18,839
challenge of how do you integrate the
 

3041
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:19,910
challenge of how do you integrate the

with this creation of nature this

3044
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:22,859
with this creation of nature this
 

3045
01:02:22,859 --> 01:02:25,010
with this creation of nature this
intricate complex creation of nature

3046
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:25,020
intricate complex creation of nature
 

3047
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,049
intricate complex creation of nature
which is the human brain and then you're

3048
01:02:27,049 --> 01:02:27,059
which is the human brain and then you're
 

3049
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:30,710
which is the human brain and then you're
speaking more generally nature

3050
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:30,720
speaking more generally nature
 

3051
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,849

how every company has an image like this

3052
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:34,859
how every company has an image like this
 

3053
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:38,210
how every company has an image like this
one single image that embodies the

3054
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:38,220
one single image that embodies the
 

3055
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,010
one single image that embodies the
spirit of the company

spirit of the company
 

3057
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:43,089
spirit of the company
and I think for neurolink it was to me

3058
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:43,099
and I think for neurolink it was to me
 

3059
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:47,270
and I think for neurolink it was to me
that chimpanzee playing a video game

3060
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:47,280
that chimpanzee playing a video game
 

3061
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,329
that chimpanzee playing a video game
it was just unbelievable but with plants

3062
01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:50,339
it was just unbelievable but with plants
 

3063
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:53,089
it was just unbelievable but with plants

um and smelling good and we were asking
 

3111
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,750
um and smelling good and we were asking
ourselves is there a world in which

ourselves is there a world in which
 

3113
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,630
ourselves is there a world in which
um in which a fragrance can be not a

um in which a fragrance can be not a
 

3115
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,010
um in which a fragrance can be not a
functional fragrance because you could

3116
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:55,020
functional fragrance because you could
 

3117
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,630
functional fragrance because you could
claim that all fragrances are functional

3118
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
claim that all fragrances are functional
 

3119
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,250
claim that all fragrances are functional
but is there a world in which the

fragrance and it's bio-based and but
 

3145
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,349
fragrance and it's bio-based and but
when you look into the fragrance and you

3146
01:04:30,349 --> 01:04:30,359
when you look into the fragrance and you
 

3147
01:04:30,359 --> 01:04:31,970
when you look into the fragrance and you
understand it in order to get to this

3148

Pavilion on the roof of SF Moma we
 

3171
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,609
Pavilion on the roof of SF Moma we
calculated that for that Pavilion we had

3172

calculated that for that Pavilion we had
 

3173
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:06,829
calculated that for that Pavilion we had
40 000 calories embedded into this

calories interesting way to think about
a structure right from the from the

3188
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:21,720
a structure right from the from the
 

3189
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,609
a structure right from the from the
point of view of of calories but as you

3190
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:25,619
point of view of of calories but as you
 

3191
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:27,410
point of view of of calories but as you
left the gallery you saw these three

3192
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:27,420
left the gallery you saw these three
 

3193
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,150
left the gallery you saw these three
clocks that were so beautifully designed

3194
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:29,160
clocks that were so beautifully designed
 

3195
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,069
clocks that were so beautifully designed
by Felix on our team and these clocks

3196
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:31,079
by Felix on our team and these clocks
 

3197
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:33,530
by Felix on our team and these clocks
measured temperature and humidity and we

3198
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:33,540
measured temperature and humidity and we
 

3199
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:34,970
measured temperature and humidity and we
were connected them to Weather Channels

3200
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:34,980
were connected them to Weather Channels
 

3201
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,190
were connected them to Weather Channels
so that we could directly

3202
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,200
so that we could directly
 

3203
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,170
so that we could directly
um look at how the Pavilion was

3204
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:39,180
um look at how the Pavilion was
 

3205
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:42,589
um look at how the Pavilion was
biodegrading in real time and and and in

3206
01:05:42,589 --> 01:05:42,599
biodegrading in real time and and and in
 

3207
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:45,109
biodegrading in real time and and and in
our calculations I say this long-winded

3208
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
our calculations I say this long-winded
 

3209
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,750
our calculations I say this long-winded
uh description of the Pavilion to say

3210
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:47,760
uh description of the Pavilion to say
 

3211
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,589
uh description of the Pavilion to say
that in the calculation we incorporated

3212
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:51,599
that in the calculation we incorporated
 

3213
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,410
that in the calculation we incorporated
um you know how much electricity we used

3214
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:54,420
um you know how much electricity we used
 

3215
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,569
um you know how much electricity we used
for our computers for the 3D printers

3216
01:05:56,569 --> 01:05:56,579
for our computers for the 3D printers
 

3217
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:58,970
for our computers for the 3D printers
that printed the Pavilion and you know

3218
01:05:58,970 --> 01:05:58,980
that printed the Pavilion and you know
 

3219
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:00,470
that printed the Pavilion and you know
and these were called emergy

3220
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:00,480
and these were called emergy
 

3221
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,510
and these were called emergy
calculations right energy and materials

3222
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:02,520
calculations right energy and materials
 

3223
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:04,309
calculations right energy and materials
and when you think about a product when

3224
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:04,319
and when you think about a product when
 

3225
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:06,710
and when you think about a product when
you think about you know a shoe or a

3226
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:06,720
you think about you know a shoe or a
 

3227
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,910
you think about you know a shoe or a
chair or a perfume or a building you

3228
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:10,920
chair or a perfume or a building you
 

3229
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,190
chair or a perfume or a building you
don't stop at the object you want to go

3230
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:13,200
don't stop at the object you want to go
 

3231
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,069
don't stop at the object you want to go
all the way to the system again instead

3232
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
all the way to the system again instead
 

3233
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,190
all the way to the system again instead

embodiments of a the will of the
 

3237
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,230
embodiments of a the will of the
designer you're really tapping into an

3238
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240
designer you're really tapping into an
 

3239
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,109
designer you're really tapping into an
entire system that is interconnected and

3240
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:27,119
entire system that is interconnected and
 

3241
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,329
entire system that is interconnected and
if you look at the energy budget that

3242
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:29,339
if you look at the energy budget that
 

3243
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:30,849
if you look at the energy budget that
characterized the project

3244
01:06:30,849 --> 01:06:30,859
characterized the project
 

3245
01:06:30,859 --> 01:06:33,770
characterized the project
it traverses the entire planet right

3246
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:33,780
it traverses the entire planet right
 

3247
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,510
it traverses the entire planet right
some of these shrimp shells were brought

3248
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
some of these shrimp shells were brought
 

3249
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,270
some of these shrimp shells were brought
from places in the world we haven't

3250
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:38,280
from places in the world we haven't
 

3251
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,190
from places in the world we haven't
thought of in terms of the apples and

3252
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:40,200
thought of in terms of the apples and
 

3253
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,650
thought of in terms of the apples and
the shrimp shells and the tree pop and

3254
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:42,660
the shrimp shells and the tree pop and
 

3255
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,370
the shrimp shells and the tree pop and
so going back to you know going back to

3256
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:46,380
so going back to you know going back to
 

3257
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,589
so going back to you know going back to
to fragrances

3258
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:48,599
to fragrances
 

3259
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,150
to fragrances
um it's really really important to

3260
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160
um it's really really important to
 

3261
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,029
um it's really really important to
understand the product in the context of

3262
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039
understand the product in the context of
 

3263
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,829
understand the product in the context of
the ecological system from which it's

3264
01:06:54,829 --> 01:06:54,839
the ecological system from which it's
 

3265
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:56,750
the ecological system from which it's
sourced and and how it's designed and

3266
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:56,760
sourced and and how it's designed and
 

3267
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,150
sourced and and how it's designed and
that is the kind of thinking

3268
01:06:59,150 --> 01:06:59,160
that is the kind of thinking
 

3269
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,690
that is the kind of thinking
um that is not only desired but is

3270
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:01,700
um that is not only desired but is
 

3271
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:04,970
um that is not only desired but is
required if we are to achieve Synergy

3272
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:04,980
required if we are to achieve Synergy
 

3273
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,829
required if we are to achieve Synergy
between humanity and nature it's

3274
01:07:06,829 --> 01:07:06,839
between humanity and nature it's
 

3275
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:08,029
between humanity and nature it's
interesting because the system level

3276
01:07:08,029 --> 01:07:08,039
interesting because the system level
 

3277
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:09,589
interesting because the system level
thinking is almost always going to take

3278
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:09,599
thinking is almost always going to take
 

3279
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,510
thinking is almost always going to take
you to the entire Earth to considering

3280
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
you to the entire Earth to considering
 

3281
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:13,609
you to the entire Earth to considering
the entire Earth ecosystem which is why

3282
01:07:13,609 --> 01:07:13,619
the entire Earth ecosystem which is why
 

3283
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:14,930
the entire Earth ecosystem which is why
it's important to have a left brain and

3284
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:14,940
it's important to have a left brain and
 

3285
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:21,549
it's important to have a left brain and
a right brain competing for attention

3286
01:07:21,549 --> 01:07:21,559

 

3287
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:25,250

you mentioned a fragrance that kind of

3288
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:25,260
you mentioned a fragrance that kind of
 

3289
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:26,990
you mentioned a fragrance that kind of
sends out a message to the environment

3290
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:27,000
sends out a message to the environment
 

3291
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,450
sends out a message to the environment
essentially a message in a bottle yeah a

3292
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:29,460
essentially a message in a bottle yeah a
 

3293
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,730
essentially a message in a bottle yeah a
message in a bottle so like so you can

3294
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:31,740
message in a bottle so like so you can
 

3295
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,650
message in a bottle so like so you can
go to a rose garden and trick the Rose

3296
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:33,660
go to a rose garden and trick the Rose
 

3297
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,390
go to a rose garden and trick the Rose
Garden to think it's 4 AM

3298
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:35,400
Garden to think it's 4 AM
 

3299
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,190
Garden to think it's 4 AM
essentially you could if you wanted to

3300
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,200
essentially you could if you wanted to
 

3301
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,010
essentially you could if you wanted to
but maybe that is not trick trick is a

3302
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:40,020
but maybe that is not trick trick is a
 

3303
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,970
but maybe that is not trick trick is a
bad word right Inspire but Inspire I

3304
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:43,980
bad word right Inspire but Inspire I
 

3305
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,010
bad word right Inspire but Inspire I
like I I like the idea of providing

3306
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:46,020
like I I like the idea of providing
 

3307
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:47,930
like I I like the idea of providing
nature with a choice which is why I love

3308
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:47,940
nature with a choice which is why I love
 

3309
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,870
nature with a choice which is why I love
that elegant mathematical equation of

3310
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:50,880
that elegant mathematical equation of
 

3311
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,170
that elegant mathematical equation of
empowerment and agency empower the uh

3312
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:54,180
empowerment and agency empower the uh
 

3313
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,870
empowerment and agency empower the uh
the Rose Garden to uh to create a

3314
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
the Rose Garden to uh to create a
 

3315
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,789
the Rose Garden to uh to create a
romantic moment for the uh for the

3316
01:07:58,789 --> 01:07:58,799
romantic moment for the uh for the
 

3317
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:01,010
romantic moment for the uh for the
wearer of the fragrance but now again

3318
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:01,020
wearer of the fragrance but now again
 

3319
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:04,010
wearer of the fragrance but now again
you're you're again all of this to go

3320
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:04,020
you're you're again all of this to go
 

3321
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:07,069
you're you're again all of this to go
back to back to that human-centric

3322
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:07,079
back to back to that human-centric
 

3323
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:09,049
back to back to that human-centric
notion of romance but maybe there's

3324
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:09,059
notion of romance but maybe there's
 

3325
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:11,450
notion of romance but maybe there's
another way to do romance right that

3326
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:11,460
another way to do romance right that
 

3327
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:14,150
another way to do romance right that
that we haven't yet you know that we

3328
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:14,160
that we haven't yet you know that we
 

3329
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,450
that we haven't yet you know that we
haven't yet explored and and maybe

3330
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:17,460
haven't yet explored and and maybe
 

3331
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,390
haven't yet explored and and maybe
you know there's a way to tap into what

3332
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:20,400
you know there's a way to tap into what
 

3333
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,030
you know there's a way to tap into what
happens to the Rose when it's dreaming

3334
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:22,040
happens to the Rose when it's dreaming
 

3335
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,130
happens to the Rose when it's dreaming
assuming that plants are sentient and

3336
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:25,140
assuming that plants are sentient and
 

3337
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:26,990
assuming that plants are sentient and
assuming that we can tap into that

3338
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:27,000
assuming that we can tap into that
 

3339
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,749
assuming that we can tap into that
sentience what can we discover about

3340
01:08:29,749 --> 01:08:29,759
sentience what can we discover about
 

3341
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,209
sentience what can we discover about
what what does the Rose want like what

3342
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:32,219
what what does the Rose want like what
 

3343
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:35,030

solving the problem and I look at what
 

3579
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,850
solving the problem and I look at what
I've created and it's not beautiful I

so this idea of empowerment that you

3592
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:50,640
so this idea of empowerment that you
 

3593
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,430
so this idea of empowerment that you
talked about yes they connected to it

3594
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:52,440
talked about yes they connected to it
 

3595
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,649
talked about yes they connected to it
comes back to that yeah what's the

3596
01:13:54,649 --> 01:13:54,659
comes back to that yeah what's the
 

3597
01:13:54,659 --> 01:13:57,890
comes back to that yeah what's the
difference that you hinted at between it

3598
01:13:57,890 --> 01:13:57,900
difference that you hinted at between it
 

3599
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:02,390
difference that you hinted at between it
empowerment and emergence is a emergence

3600

completely lacks control
 

3603
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:08,110
completely lacks control
is it and empowerment is more

3604
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:08,120
is it and empowerment is more
 

3605
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,510
is it and empowerment is more
uh is more controlled

3606
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
uh is more controlled

there's an agent making decisions is is
 

3609
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:16,729
there's an agent making decisions is is
there an interesting distinction there

3610
01:14:16,729 --> 01:14:16,739
there an interesting distinction there
 

3611
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:19,850
there an interesting distinction there
yes I think empowerment is a force with

3616
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:25,560
emergence
 

3617
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,910
emergence
is I believe multi-directional again

3618
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:28,920
is I believe multi-directional again

is I believe multi-directional again
that depends on the application

3620
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:30,800
that depends on the application

01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,229
that depends on the application
emergence is perhaps

3622
01:14:33,229 --> 01:14:33,239
emergence is perhaps
 

3623
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:35,149
emergence is perhaps
in terms of sort of a material

3624
01:14:35,149 --> 01:14:35,159
in terms of sort of a material

um empowerment is at the end is a Tropic

3628
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:41,280
um empowerment is at the end is a Tropic
 

3629
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,550
um empowerment is at the end is a Tropic
and counterpart

3630
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:43,560
and counterpart
 

3631
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,330
and counterpart
um

3632
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:44,340
um
 

3633
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:45,649
um
I think

3634
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:45,659
I think
 

3635
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:51,430
I think
they overlap because I think that

3636
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:51,440

 

3637
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,149

um
inspiring emergence I think emergence

3642
01:14:59,630 --> 01:14:59,640
inspiring emergence I think emergence
 

3643
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,169
inspiring emergence I think emergence
does not happen without empowerment but

3644
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:03,179
does not happen without empowerment but
 

3645
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:05,510
does not happen without empowerment but
empowerment can happen without emergence

3646
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:05,520
empowerment can happen without emergence
 

3647
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,490
empowerment can happen without emergence
do you think of emergence as the loss of

3648
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:07,500
do you think of emergence as the loss of
 

3649
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,930
do you think of emergence as the loss of
control like when you're thinking about

3650
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:08,940
control like when you're thinking about
 

3651
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:11,209
control like when you're thinking about
these capsules and the things they

3652
01:15:11,209 --> 01:15:11,219
these capsules and the things they
 

3653
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:15,649
these capsules and the things they
create is emergence of things that is uh

3654
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:15,659
create is emergence of things that is uh
 

3655
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:17,709
create is emergence of things that is uh
not a desirable

3656
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:17,719
not a desirable
 

3657
01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:22,030
not a desirable
conclusion I love that question because

3658
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:22,040
conclusion I love that question because
 

3659
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:24,950
conclusion I love that question because
to some of us the loss of control is

3660
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:24,960
to some of us the loss of control is
 

3661
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,330
to some of us the loss of control is
control

3662

01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:33,649
levels of control over form and the
shape of a thing and how it behaves and

3668
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:33,659
shape of a thing and how it behaves and
 

3669
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:35,270
shape of a thing and how it behaves and
how it functions

3670
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:35,280
how it functions
 

3671
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,430
how it functions
and that's something we've inherited

3672
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
and that's something we've inherited
 

3673
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,070
and that's something we've inherited
from the Industrial Revolution

3674
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:40,080
from the Industrial Revolution
 

3675
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,890
from the Industrial Revolution
but with nature there is this

3676
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:42,900
but with nature there is this
 

3677
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:43,550
but with nature there is this
um

3678
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:43,560
um
 

3679
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,570
um
there's this diversity that happens

3680
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:46,580
there's this diversity that happens
 

3681
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:49,010
there's this diversity that happens
without necessarily having a reward

3682
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:49,020
without necessarily having a reward
 

3683
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,870
without necessarily having a reward
function right this is good or bad

3684
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:50,880
function right this is good or bad
 

3685
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,030
function right this is good or bad
things just happen and some of them

3686
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,040
things just happen and some of them
 

3687
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:54,830
things just happen and some of them
happen to have wings and some of them

3688
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:54,840
happen to have wings and some of them
 

3689
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,110
happen to have wings and some of them
happen to have scales and

3690
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,120
happen to have scales and
 

3691
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,630
happen to have scales and
you know you end up with this incredible

3692
01:15:59,630 --> 01:15:59,640
you know you end up with this incredible
 

3693
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,850
you know you end up with this incredible
potential

3694
01:16:01,850 --> 01:16:01,860
potential
 

3695
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:04,130
potential
um for for diversity so I think the

3696
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:04,140
um for for diversity so I think the
 

3697
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,350
um for for diversity so I think the
future of of design is in that soft

3698
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:06,360
future of of design is in that soft
 

3699
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,810
future of of design is in that soft
control is in the ability to design

3700
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:08,820
control is in the ability to design
 

3701
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:12,890
control is in the ability to design
highly controlled systems that enable

3702
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:12,900
highly controlled systems that enable
 

3703
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,229
highly controlled systems that enable
um that enable the loss of control and

3704
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:15,239
um that enable the loss of control and
 

3705
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:17,870
um that enable the loss of control and
creativity is very much part of this

3706
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:17,880
creativity is very much part of this
 

3707
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,610
creativity is very much part of this
because

3708
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:19,620
because
 

3709
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,390
because
creativity is all about letting go

3710
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:23,400
creativity is all about letting go
 

3711
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:25,430
creativity is all about letting go
and beginning again and beginning again

3712
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
and beginning again and beginning again
 

3713
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,750
and beginning again and beginning again
beginning again

3714
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:26,760
beginning again
 

3715
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,570
beginning again
and when you cannot let go you cannot be

3716
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:29,580
and when you cannot let go you cannot be
 

3717
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,970
and when you cannot let go you cannot be
creative and you can't you you can't you

3718
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:31,980
creative and you can't you you can't you
 

3719
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,430
creative and you can't you you can't you
can't find novelty but I think that

3720
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:34,440
can't find novelty but I think that
 

3721
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:38,090
can't find novelty but I think that
letting go is a moment that enables

3722
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:38,100
letting go is a moment that enables
 

3723
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,970
letting go is a moment that enables
empowerment agency creativity emergence

3724
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:40,980
empowerment agency creativity emergence
 

3725
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:44,149
empowerment agency creativity emergence
and they're all connected they're sort

3726
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,159
and they're all connected they're sort
 

3727
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,649
and they're all connected they're sort
of associate themselves with definition

3728
01:16:45,649 --> 01:16:45,659
of associate themselves with definition
 

3729
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:49,430
of associate themselves with definition
of Destiny or the inevitable

3730
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:49,440
of Destiny or the inevitable
 

3731
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,250
of Destiny or the inevitable
a good friend of mine shared with me

3732
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:52,260
a good friend of mine shared with me
 

3733
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:56,570
a good friend of mine shared with me
elegant definition of Faith which is the

3734
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:56,580
elegant definition of Faith which is the
 

3735
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:59,630
elegant definition of Faith which is the
ratio of of who you are and and who you

3736
01:16:59,630 --> 01:16:59,640
ratio of of who you are and and who you
 

3737
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,250
ratio of of who you are and and who you
want to be

3738
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:01,260
want to be
 

3739
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,850
want to be
ratio of who you are who you want to be

3740
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:03,860
ratio of who you are who you want to be
 

3741
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:06,649
ratio of who you are who you want to be
exactly and that sort of ends up

3742
01:17:06,649 --> 01:17:06,659
exactly and that sort of ends up
 

3743
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:09,470
exactly and that sort of ends up
defining you yeah and those tools I

3744
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:09,480
defining you yeah and those tools I
 

3745
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,410
defining you yeah and those tools I
think when when when when you let go you

3746
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:12,420
think when when when when you let go you
 

3747
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:15,169
think when when when when you let go you
sort of find you you give peace to your

3748
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:15,179
sort of find you you give peace to your
 

3749
01:17:15,179 --> 01:17:18,470
sort of find you you give peace to your
will right to a sense of Will and and

3750
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:18,480
will right to a sense of Will and and
 

3751
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,910
will right to a sense of Will and and
and so I think that's very very

3752
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:19,920
and so I think that's very very
 

3753
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,290
and so I think that's very very
important

3754
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:21,300
important
 

3755
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,630
important
in design but also in life

3756
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:23,640
in design but also in life
 

3757
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,110
in design but also in life
she said this fate is the ratio of

3758
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:27,120
she said this fate is the ratio of
 

3759
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:29,030
she said this fate is the ratio of
um who you are what you want to be who

3760
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:29,040
um who you are what you want to be who
 

3761
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,830
um who you are what you want to be who
you want to be do you think there's

3762
01:17:30,830 --> 01:17:30,840
you want to be do you think there's
 

3763
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,350
you want to be do you think there's
something to this whole manifestation

3764
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:33,360
something to this whole manifestation
 

3765
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:35,330
something to this whole manifestation
thing like focusing on a vision of what

3766
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:35,340
thing like focusing on a vision of what
 

3767
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:38,570
thing like focusing on a vision of what
you want the world to become and in in

3768
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:38,580
you want the world to become and in in
 

3769
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:42,110
you want the world to become and in in
that focusing you manifest it like Paula

3770
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:42,120
that focusing you manifest it like Paula
 

3771
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,030
that focusing you manifest it like Paula
Cole said in The Alchemist when you want

3772
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:44,040
Cole said in The Alchemist when you want
 

3773
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,770
Cole said in The Alchemist when you want
something all the universe conspires in

3774
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:45,780
something all the universe conspires in
 

3775
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:47,330
something all the universe conspires in
helping you to achieve it

3776
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:47,340
helping you to achieve it
 

3777
01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:49,550
helping you to achieve it
is there something to that I think so

3778
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:49,560
is there something to that I think so
 

3779
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,970
is there something to that I think so
yes and I always think of you know what

3780
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:52,980
yes and I always think of you know what
 

3781
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:55,850
yes and I always think of you know what
I do as this the culmination of energy

3782
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:55,860
I do as this the culmination of energy
 

3783
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:59,149
I do as this the culmination of energy
information and matter and how to Direct

3784
01:17:59,149 --> 01:17:59,159
information and matter and how to Direct
 

3785
01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:01,910
information and matter and how to Direct
Energy Information and matter in the

3786
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
Energy Information and matter in the
 

3787
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,250
Energy Information and matter in the
design of a thing or in the design of a

3788
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:04,260
design of a thing or in the design of a
 

3789
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,030
design of a thing or in the design of a
life

3790
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:05,040
life
 

3791
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:09,290
life
I think living is very much a process of

3792
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:09,300
I think living is very much a process of
 

3793
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,229
I think living is very much a process of
channeling these energies to where they

3794
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
channeling these energies to where they
 

3795
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:14,990
channeling these energies to where they
need to go I think that the

3796
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,000
need to go I think that the
 

3797
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,490
need to go I think that the
manifestation or part of that

3798
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:16,500
manifestation or part of that
 

3799
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,729
manifestation or part of that
manifestation is the pointing to the

3800
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:19,739
manifestation is the pointing to the
 

3801
01:18:19,739 --> 01:18:22,310
manifestation is the pointing to the
Moon in order to get to the moon and and

3802
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,320
Moon in order to get to the moon and and
 

3803
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,350
Moon in order to get to the moon and and
and that's why manifestation is also

3804
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:24,360
and that's why manifestation is also
 

3805
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,229
and that's why manifestation is also
directional it has that vector quality

3806
01:18:27,229 --> 01:18:27,239
directional it has that vector quality
 

3807
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:28,610
directional it has that vector quality
to it that

3808
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:28,620
to it that
 

3809
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,950
to it that
I think of agency is

3810
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
I think of agency is
 

3811
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,530
I think of agency is
have you uh in your own life has there

3812
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:33,540
have you uh in your own life has there
 

3813
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,930
have you uh in your own life has there
been things you've done where you kind

3814
01:18:35,930 --> 01:18:35,940
been things you've done where you kind
 

3815
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,070
been things you've done where you kind
of direct

3816
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:37,080
of direct
 

3817
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,950
of direct
that energy information and matter in a

3818
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:39,960
that energy information and matter in a
 

3819
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,430
that energy information and matter in a
way that opens up new possibilities yeah

3820
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:43,440
way that opens up new possibilities yeah
 

3821
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,189
way that opens up new possibilities yeah
I mean you've also said somewhere I'm

3822
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:46,199
I mean you've also said somewhere I'm
 

3823
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:48,470
I mean you've also said somewhere I'm
probably misquoting that uh you're

3824
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:48,480
probably misquoting that uh you're
 

3825
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:49,790
probably misquoting that uh you're

which basically uh Embraces imperfection

4152
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:40,620
which basically uh Embraces imperfection
 

4153
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,590
which basically uh Embraces imperfection
nothing lasts nothing is finished and

4154

nothing lasts nothing is finished and
 

4155
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,870
nothing lasts nothing is finished and
nothing is perfect what do you think of

4156
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:44,880
nothing is perfect what do you think of
 

4157
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,130
nothing is perfect what do you think of
that I totally agree that change is the

that I totally agree that change is the
 

4159
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:52,310
that I totally agree that change is the
only permanence that imperfection is

4160
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:52,320
only permanence that imperfection is
 

4161
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,390
only permanence that imperfection is
there if only to to signal that we are

4162
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:56,400
there if only to to signal that we are
 

4163
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,790
there if only to to signal that we are
part of a bigger thing than ourselves

4164
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:58,800
part of a bigger thing than ourselves
 

4165
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,270
part of a bigger thing than ourselves
that that we are on a journey

4166
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:02,280
that that we are on a journey
 

4167
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,510
that that we are on a journey
um that that were

4168
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:04,520
um that that were
 

4169
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,970
um that that were
that things are in movement

4170
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:07,980
that things are in movement
 

4171
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:11,209
that things are in movement
um and if they were perfect I of of

4172
01:26:11,209 --> 01:26:11,219
um and if they were perfect I of of
 

4173
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:12,709
um and if they were perfect I of of
course when things are perfect it is

4174
01:26:12,709 --> 01:26:12,719
course when things are perfect it is
 

4175
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:14,390
course when things are perfect it is
just so boring we end up with

4176
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:14,400
just so boring we end up with
 

4177
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,149
just so boring we end up with
stereotypes and as humans but I think

4178
01:26:17,149 --> 01:26:17,159
stereotypes and as humans but I think
 

4179
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:19,729
stereotypes and as humans but I think
just in general as living beings

4180
01:26:19,729 --> 01:26:19,739
just in general as living beings
 

4181
01:26:19,739 --> 01:26:21,890
just in general as living beings
we're here to find meaning and that

4182
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:21,900
we're here to find meaning and that
 

4183
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,169
we're here to find meaning and that
meaning cannot be found without struggle

4184
01:26:24,169 --> 01:26:24,179
meaning cannot be found without struggle
 

4185
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,930
meaning cannot be found without struggle
and without seeking to not to perfect

4186
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:26,940
and without seeking to not to perfect
 

4187
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:29,209
and without seeking to not to perfect
but to build to work to build towards

4188
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:29,219
but to build to work to build towards
 

4189
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:31,310
but to build to work to build towards
something better

4190
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:31,320
something better
 

4191
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,450
something better
um when I was a child my mother who who

4192

um when I was a child my mother who who
 

4193

I love so much always explained to me
 

4195
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:41,090
I love so much always explained to me
how important it is to fall and to fail

4196

how important it is to fall and to fail
 

4197

how important it is to fall and to fail
and to fight and to argue

um
 

4203
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,689
um
and that there is a way that there is a

4204
01:26:47,689 --> 01:26:47,699
and that there is a way that there is a
 

4205
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:49,430
and that there is a way that there is a

imperfection

4210
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:54,120
imperfection
 

4211
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:56,090
imperfection
um so I I think it is

4212
01:26:56,090 --> 01:26:56,100
um so I I think it is
 

4213
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:58,430
um so I I think it is
it is uh

4214
01:26:58,430 --> 01:26:58,440
it is uh
 

4215
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:01,610
it is uh
necessary for something beautiful to be

4216
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:01,620
necessary for something beautiful to be
 

4217
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:05,450
necessary for something beautiful to be
imperfect and it is a sign that it is a

4218
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:05,460
imperfect and it is a sign that it is a
 

4219
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,790
imperfect and it is a sign that it is a
sign of nature because nothing in nature

4220
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:07,800
sign of nature because nothing in nature
 

4221
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,350
sign of nature because nothing in nature
is perfect

4222
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:09,360
is perfect
 

4223
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,330
is perfect
what about human relations you mentioned

4224
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:11,340
what about human relations you mentioned
 

4225
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,010
what about human relations you mentioned
finding love

4226
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:13,020
finding love
 

4227
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,950
finding love
are the flaws in humans in perfection in

4228
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:15,960
are the flaws in humans in perfection in
 

4229
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,110
are the flaws in humans in perfection in
humans a component of love

4230
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:18,120
humans a component of love
 

4231
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:20,270
humans a component of love
like what role do you think the the

4232
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:20,280
like what role do you think the the
 

4233
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,209
like what role do you think the the
flaws play

4234
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:23,219

 

4235
01:27:23,219 --> 01:27:27,050

it's a that's a really profound question

4236
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:27,060
it's a that's a really profound question
 

4237
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,149
it's a that's a really profound question
I think

4238
01:27:29,149 --> 01:27:29,159
I think
 

4239
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:39,290
I think
the flaws are there uh to

4240
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:39,300

 

4241
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,709

the flaws are there to present a a

4242
01:27:41,709 --> 01:27:41,719
the flaws are there to present a a
 

4243
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:45,530
the flaws are there to present a a
vulnerability and those flaws are

4244
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:45,540
vulnerability and those flaws are
 

4245
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:46,129
vulnerability and those flaws are
um

4246
01:27:46,129 --> 01:27:46,139
um
 

4247
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:48,530
um
are

4248
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:48,540
are
 

4249
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:52,430
are
um a sign of those vulnerabilities

4250
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:52,440
um a sign of those vulnerabilities
 

4251
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:54,110
um a sign of those vulnerabilities
and I think

4252
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:54,120
and I think
 

4253
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:59,629
and I think
love is very very gentle right love

4254
01:27:59,629 --> 01:27:59,639
love is very very gentle right love
 

4255
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:02,930
love is very very gentle right love
with Bill we often talk about between

4256
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:02,940
with Bill we often talk about between
 

4257
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:04,910
with Bill we often talk about between
the two of us about what drives all

4258
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:04,920
the two of us about what drives all
 

4259
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,530
the two of us about what drives all
human behavior and for him it's

4260
01:28:06,530 --> 01:28:06,540
human behavior and for him it's
 

4261
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:10,129
human behavior and for him it's
incentive as you might expect and he

4262
01:28:10,129 --> 01:28:10,139
incentive as you might expect and he
 

4263
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:11,870
incentive as you might expect and he
will repeat this sentence to me oh

4264
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:11,880
will repeat this sentence to me oh
 

4265
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,930
will repeat this sentence to me oh
incentive drives all human behavior but

4266
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:14,940
incentive drives all human behavior but
 

4267
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:17,990
incentive drives all human behavior but
I I would say to me it's love love very

4268
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:18,000
I I would say to me it's love love very
 

4269
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,669
I I would say to me it's love love very
much so

4270
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:19,679
much so
 

4271
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:21,350
much so
um and

4272
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:21,360
um and
 

4273
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,570
um and
and I think flaws are part of that

4274
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:23,580
and I think flaws are part of that
 

4275
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,990
and I think flaws are part of that
because flaws are a sign of that

4276
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:27,000
because flaws are a sign of that
 

4277
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,149
because flaws are a sign of that
vulnerability whether physical whether

4278
01:28:29,149 --> 01:28:29,159
vulnerability whether physical whether
 

4279
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:30,470
vulnerability whether physical whether
emotional vulnerability and those

4280
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
emotional vulnerability and those
 

4281
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,750
emotional vulnerability and those
vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities

4282
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:32,760
vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities
 

4283
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:34,790
vulnerabilities these vulnerabilities
they either tear us apart or they bring

4284
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:34,800
they either tear us apart or they bring
 

4285
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,830
they either tear us apart or they bring
us together

4286
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:36,840
us together
 

4287
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,129
us together
um the vulnerability is what is the glue

4288
01:28:40,129 --> 01:28:40,139
um the vulnerability is what is the glue
 

4289
01:28:40,139 --> 01:28:43,870
um the vulnerability is what is the glue
I think I think that the vulnerability

4290
01:28:43,870 --> 01:28:43,880
I think I think that the vulnerability
 

4291
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:46,729
I think I think that the vulnerability
enables connection the connection is the

4292
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:46,739
enables connection the connection is the
 

4293
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:49,090
enables connection the connection is the
glue and that connection enables

4294
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:49,100
glue and that connection enables
 

4295
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:52,250
glue and that connection enables
accessing A Higher Ground as a community

4296
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:52,260
accessing A Higher Ground as a community
 

4297
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,890
accessing A Higher Ground as a community
as opposed to as an individual so if

4298
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:54,900
as opposed to as an individual so if
 

4299
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,689
as opposed to as an individual so if
there is a society of the mind or if

4300
01:28:56,689 --> 01:28:56,699
there is a society of the mind or if
 

4301
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,729
there is a society of the mind or if
there are higher levels of awareness

4302
01:28:58,729 --> 01:28:58,739
there are higher levels of awareness
 

4303
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:02,870
there are higher levels of awareness
that can be accessed in community as

4304
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:02,880
that can be accessed in community as
 

4305
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,250
that can be accessed in community as
opposed to

4306
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:04,260
opposed to
 

4307
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:06,350
opposed to
again going to the silkworm as opposed

4308
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:06,360
again going to the silkworm as opposed
 

4309
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,689
again going to the silkworm as opposed
to on the individual level I think that

4310
01:29:08,689 --> 01:29:08,699
to on the individual level I think that
 

4311
01:29:08,699 --> 01:29:11,270
to on the individual level I think that
those occur through the flaws and the

4312
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:11,280
those occur through the flaws and the
 

4313
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,209
those occur through the flaws and the
vulnerabilities and without them we we

4314
01:29:14,209 --> 01:29:14,219
vulnerabilities and without them we we
 

4315
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:17,689
vulnerabilities and without them we we
cannot find connection community and

4316
01:29:17,689 --> 01:29:17,699
cannot find connection community and
 

4317
01:29:17,699 --> 01:29:20,149
cannot find connection community and
without Community we can't build what we

4318
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:20,159
without Community we can't build what we
 

4319
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:22,550
without Community we can't build what we
have built as a civilization you know

4320
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:22,560
have built as a civilization you know
 

4321
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,530
have built as a civilization you know
for the past hundreds of thousands of

4322
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:24,540
for the past hundreds of thousands of
 

4323
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:26,689
for the past hundreds of thousands of
years so I think not only are they

4324
01:29:26,689 --> 01:29:26,699
years so I think not only are they
 

4325
01:29:26,699 --> 01:29:28,490
years so I think not only are they
beautiful but they have a functional

4326
01:29:28,490 --> 01:29:28,500
beautiful but they have a functional
 

4327
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:32,689
beautiful but they have a functional
role in in building civilizations

4328
01:29:32,689 --> 01:29:32,699
role in in building civilizations
 

4329
01:29:32,699 --> 01:29:35,510
role in in building civilizations
yeah there's a sense in which love

4330
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:35,520
yeah there's a sense in which love
 

4331
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,970
yeah there's a sense in which love
requires vulnerability and maybe love is

4332
01:29:37,970 --> 01:29:37,980
requires vulnerability and maybe love is
 

4333
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:41,090
requires vulnerability and maybe love is
the leap into that vulnerability and I

4334
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:41,100
the leap into that vulnerability and I
 

4335
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:43,669
the leap into that vulnerability and I
think yes I think

4336
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:43,679
think yes I think
 

4337
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,270
think yes I think
a flaw think about it like physically

4338
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:47,280
a flaw think about it like physically
 

4339
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,189
a flaw think about it like physically
I'm thinking about

4340
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:49,199
I'm thinking about
 

4341
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:52,070
I'm thinking about
a brick that's flawed but in a way the

4342
01:29:52,070 --> 01:29:52,080
a brick that's flawed but in a way the
 

4343
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,950
a brick that's flawed but in a way the
the I think of a flaw as a as an

4344
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:54,960
the I think of a flaw as a as an
 

4345
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:01,450
the I think of a flaw as a as an
increased surface area

4346
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:01,460

 

4347
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:03,950

that's a good line right a surface area

4348
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:03,960
that's a good line right a surface area
 

4349
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,410
that's a good line right a surface area
that like physically emotionally right

4350
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:06,420
that like physically emotionally right
 

4351
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,169
that like physically emotionally right
it sort of introduces this whole new

4352
01:30:09,169 --> 01:30:09,179
it sort of introduces this whole new
 

4353
01:30:09,179 --> 01:30:11,990
it sort of introduces this whole new
dimension to a human or a brick and

4354
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,000
dimension to a human or a brick and
 

4355
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,669
dimension to a human or a brick and
because you have more surface area you

4356
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:13,679
because you have more surface area you
 

4357
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:17,090
because you have more surface area you
can you know yeah use mortar and build a

4358
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:17,100
can you know yeah use mortar and build a
 

4359
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,550
can you know yeah use mortar and build a
home and and yeah I think of it as

4360
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:19,560
home and and yeah I think of it as
 

4361
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:22,729
home and and yeah I think of it as
accessing this additional dimension of

4362
01:30:22,729 --> 01:30:22,739
accessing this additional dimension of
 

4363
01:30:22,739 --> 01:30:24,830
accessing this additional dimension of
surface area that could be used for good

4364
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:24,840
surface area that could be used for good
 

4365
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,310
surface area that could be used for good
or bad right to to to connect to

4366
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:28,320
or bad right to to to connect to
 

4367
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,430
or bad right to to to connect to
communicate to collaborate

4368

01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,030
would everything I know I know because
of love love yeah I love this quote so

4794
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:29,040
of love love yeah I love this quote so
 

4795
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,370
of love love yeah I love this quote so
you use these kind of

4796
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:31,380
you use these kind of
 

4797
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,189
you use these kind of
inspirations

4798
01:39:34,189 --> 01:39:34,199
inspirations
 

4799
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:37,250
inspirations
uh to focus you and then find the actual

4800
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:37,260
uh to focus you and then find the actual
 

4801
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:40,970
uh to focus you and then find the actual
idea in the periphery yes and then

4802
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:40,980
idea in the periphery yes and then
 

4803
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:42,950
idea in the periphery yes and then
connect them with whatever it is that

4804
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:42,960
connect them with whatever it is that
 

4805

characters and you put them together and
 

4831
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,390
characters and you put them together and
there's a narrative and there's a story

whenever we start a new project it has
 

4835
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:19,310
whenever we start a new project it has

novelty in computational design and you
 

4855
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,370

are bound to create something novel
 

4857
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:46,010
are bound to create something novel
period and that's how I run the company

4858
01:40:46,010 --> 01:40:46,020
period and that's how I run the company
 

4859
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:48,530
period and that's how I run the company
and that's how I pick the people and so

4860
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:48,540
and that's how I pick the people and so
 

4861
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:50,149
and that's how I pick the people and so
that's another very very important

4862
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:50,159
that's another very very important

The Whispers of the ancient oldies right

4872
01:41:02,930 --> 01:41:02,940
The Whispers of the ancient oldies right
 

4873
01:41:02,940 --> 01:41:06,050
The Whispers of the ancient oldies right
the beethovens and the picassos so

4874
01:41:06,050 --> 01:41:06,060
the beethovens and the picassos so
 

4875
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,550

Beethoven's always whispering to you
 

4877
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:10,669
Beethoven's always whispering to you
yeah how could one not include Beethoven

4878
01:41:10,669 --> 01:41:10,679
yeah how could one not include Beethoven
 

4879
01:41:10,679 --> 01:41:12,649
yeah how could one not include Beethoven
and The Whispers I'm going to ask you

4880
01:41:12,649 --> 01:41:12,659
and The Whispers I'm going to ask you
 

4881
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:14,689
and The Whispers I'm going to ask you
about Beethoven and The Afghani kissing

4882
01:41:14,689 --> 01:41:14,699
about Beethoven and The Afghani kissing
 

4883
01:41:14,699 --> 01:41:16,070
about Beethoven and The Afghani kissing
you've mentioned because I'm I've played

4884
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:16,080
you've mentioned because I'm I've played
 

4885
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,930
you've mentioned because I'm I've played
piano my whole life I've obviously know

4886
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:17,940
piano my whole life I've obviously know
 

4887
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:20,090
piano my whole life I've obviously know
a lot about Beethoven

4888
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:20,100
a lot about Beethoven
 

4889
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:21,830
a lot about Beethoven
um and it's it's one of the private

4890
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:21,840
um and it's it's one of the private
 

4891
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,510
um and it's it's one of the private
things for me I suppose because I don't

4892
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:23,520
things for me I suppose because I don't
 

4893
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,430
things for me I suppose because I don't
think I've ever publicly played piano by

4894
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:25,440
think I've ever publicly played piano by
 

4895
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:31,149
think I've ever publicly played piano by
the way me too

4896
01:41:31,149 --> 01:41:31,159

 

4897
01:41:31,159 --> 01:41:34,129

yeah yeah people sometimes even with

4898
01:41:34,129 --> 01:41:34,139
yeah yeah people sometimes even with
 

4899
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:35,810
yeah yeah people sometimes even with
guitar people ask me can you play

4900
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:35,820
guitar people ask me can you play
 

4901
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:37,370
guitar people ask me can you play
something and it just feels like certain

4902
01:41:37,370 --> 01:41:37,380
something and it just feels like certain
 

4903
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:39,950
something and it just feels like certain
things are meant to be done privately

4904

things are meant to be done privately
 

4905
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:42,470
things are meant to be done privately
yeah it's weird I mean it's a difficult

4906
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:42,480
yeah it's weird I mean it's a difficult
 

4907
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,470
yeah it's weird I mean it's a difficult
and and some of uh the times I have

4908
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:45,480
and and some of uh the times I have
 

4909
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:48,410
and and some of uh the times I have
performed publicly uh it is It

4910
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:48,420
performed publicly uh it is It
 

4911
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,330
performed publicly uh it is It
ultimately been vulnerabilities very

4912
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:50,340
ultimately been vulnerabilities very
 

4913
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,430
ultimately been vulnerabilities very
very very difficult for me and I'm sure

4914
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:52,440
very very difficult for me and I'm sure
 

4915
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,350
very very difficult for me and I'm sure
it's I know it's not for a lot of people

4916
01:41:54,350 --> 01:41:54,360
it's I know it's not for a lot of people
 

4917
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,390
it's I know it's not for a lot of people
but it is for me anyway we will turn to

4918
01:41:56,390 --> 01:41:56,400
but it is for me anyway we will turn to
 

4919
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,970
but it is for me anyway we will turn to
that but since you've mentioned

4920
01:41:58,970 --> 01:41:58,980
that but since you've mentioned
 

4921
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,950
that but since you've mentioned

4924
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:02,940
disciplines and that's what you seek
 

4925
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:04,310
disciplines and that's what you seek
when you

4926

when you
 

4927
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:07,669
when you
when you build teams or pick people you

is upon us whether we want to admit it

01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:48,709

Argentina and in in you know various
 

5207
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:51,410
Argentina and in in you know various
places around the world they found these

01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:51,420
places around the world they found these
 

5209
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:54,649
places around the world they found these
spores of the first plants that existed

5210
01:47:54,649 --> 01:47:54,659
spores of the first plants that existed
 

5211
01:47:54,659 --> 01:47:56,709
spores of the first plants that existed
on the planet and they

5212
01:47:56,709 --> 01:47:56,719
on the planet and they
 

5213
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:59,810
on the planet and they
emerged out of these cyanobacteria where

5214
01:47:59,810 --> 01:47:59,820
emerged out of these cyanobacteria where
 

5215
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:01,669
emerged out of these cyanobacteria where
the first of course and then they found

5216
01:48:01,669 --> 01:48:01,679
the first of course and then they found
 

5217
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:05,330
the first of course and then they found
these spore-based plants and because

5218
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:05,340
these spore-based plants and because
 

5219
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:07,490
these spore-based plants and because
they didn't have seeds or only Sports

5220
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:07,500
they didn't have seeds or only Sports
 

5221
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,890
they didn't have seeds or only Sports
the spores became sort of the fossils by

5222
01:48:09,890 --> 01:48:09,900
the spores became sort of the fossils by
 

5223
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,810
the spores became sort of the fossils by
which we've come to known of their

5224
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:11,820
which we've come to known of their
 

5225
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,189
which we've come to known of their
existence

5226
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:13,199
existence
 

5227
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:15,590
existence
and because of these spores we know that

5228
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:15,600
and because of these spores we know that
 

5229
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,930
and because of these spores we know that
this first Extinction existed

5230
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:17,940
this first Extinction existed
 

5231
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:20,810
this first Extinction existed
but this Extinction is actually what

5232
01:48:20,810 --> 01:48:20,820
but this Extinction is actually what
 

5233
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:24,649
but this Extinction is actually what
enabled plants to resurrect right so the

5234
01:48:24,649 --> 01:48:24,659
enabled plants to resurrect right so the
 

5235
01:48:24,659 --> 01:48:28,129
enabled plants to resurrect right so the
death of these first plants because they

5236
01:48:28,129 --> 01:48:28,139
death of these first plants because they
 

5237
01:48:28,139 --> 01:48:31,430
death of these first plants because they
clinked to the rocks and they they

5238
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:31,440
clinked to the rocks and they they
 

5239
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:34,370
clinked to the rocks and they they
generated a ton of phosphorus that went

5240
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:34,380
generated a ton of phosphorus that went
 

5241
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:36,770
generated a ton of phosphorus that went
into the ocean by

5242
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:36,780
into the ocean by
 

5243
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:40,250
into the ocean by
clinging to the Rocks like 60 times more

5244
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:40,260
clinging to the Rocks like 60 times more
 

5245
01:48:40,260 --> 01:48:42,109
clinging to the Rocks like 60 times more
phosphorus than without them and then

5246
01:48:42,109 --> 01:48:42,119
phosphorus than without them and then
 

5247
01:48:42,119 --> 01:48:45,169
phosphorus than without them and then
all this phosphorus basically choked the

5248
01:48:45,169 --> 01:48:45,179
all this phosphorus basically choked the
 

5249
01:48:45,179 --> 01:48:48,470
all this phosphorus basically choked the
oceans and made them super cold and a

5250
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:48,480
oceans and made them super cold and a
 

5251
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:52,189
oceans and made them super cold and a
um without oxygen aoxic and then and

5252
01:48:52,189 --> 01:48:52,199
um without oxygen aoxic and then and
 

5253
01:48:52,199 --> 01:48:54,229
um without oxygen aoxic and then and
then we lost the plant kingdom and then

5254
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:54,239
then we lost the plant kingdom and then
 

5255
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,209
then we lost the plant kingdom and then
because of the death of these first

5256
01:48:56,209 --> 01:48:56,219
because of the death of these first
 

5257
01:48:56,219 --> 01:48:59,810
because of the death of these first
plants they actually enriched the soil

5258
01:48:59,810 --> 01:48:59,820
plants they actually enriched the soil
 

5259
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:02,870
plants they actually enriched the soil
and created nutrients for these new

5260
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:02,880
and created nutrients for these new
 

5261
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,930
and created nutrients for these new
plants to come to the planet

5262
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:05,940
plants to come to the planet
 

5263
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,910
plants to come to the planet
um and those planets had like more

5264
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:07,920
um and those planets had like more
 

5265
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:11,689
um and those planets had like more
sophisticated vein systems and they were

5266
01:49:11,689 --> 01:49:11,699
sophisticated vein systems and they were
 

5267
01:49:11,699 --> 01:49:14,930
sophisticated vein systems and they were
moving beyond spores to seeded plants

5268
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:14,940
moving beyond spores to seeded plants
 

5269
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,629
moving beyond spores to seeded plants
Etc and flowering plants and so in a way

5270
01:49:17,629 --> 01:49:17,639
Etc and flowering plants and so in a way

01:49:17,639 --> 01:49:21,709
Etc and flowering plants and so in a way
you one mass extinction sort of LED

5272
01:49:21,709 --> 01:49:21,719
you one mass extinction sort of LED
 

5273
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:23,810
you one mass extinction sort of LED
in in the the

5274
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:23,820
in in the the
 

5275
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:26,870
in in the the
or division period sort of led to Life

5276
01:49:26,870 --> 01:49:26,880
or division period sort of led to Life
 

5277
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,970
or division period sort of led to Life
as we know it and where would we be

5278
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:28,980
as we know it and where would we be
 

5279
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:32,450
as we know it and where would we be
without plants in a way so I I think

5280
01:49:32,450 --> 01:49:32,460
without plants in a way so I I think
 

5281
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:35,149
without plants in a way so I I think
that death is very much part of life and

5282
01:49:35,149 --> 01:49:35,159
that death is very much part of life and
 

5283
01:49:35,159 --> 01:49:36,890
that death is very much part of life and
through that definition that kind of

5284
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:36,900
through that definition that kind of
 

5285
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:39,169
through that definition that kind of
planetary

5286
01:49:39,169 --> 01:49:39,179
planetary
 

5287
01:49:39,179 --> 01:49:42,050
planetary
the wide definition in the context of

5288
01:49:42,050 --> 01:49:42,060
the wide definition in the context of
 

5289
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:44,870
the wide definition in the context of
hundreds of millions of years

5290
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:44,880
hundreds of millions of years
 

5291
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:48,050
hundreds of millions of years
um life gains a completely new sort of a

5292
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:48,060
um life gains a completely new sort of a
 

5293
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:50,350
um life gains a completely new sort of a
new light and that's where

5294
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:50,360
new light and that's where
 

5295
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:52,970
new light and that's where
that's when the particles become a wave

5296
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:52,980
that's when the particles become a wave
 

5297
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:55,129
that's when the particles become a wave
right where humans are we are not alone

5298
01:49:55,129 --> 01:49:55,139
right where humans are we are not alone
 

5299
01:49:55,139 --> 01:49:57,350
right where humans are we are not alone
and we are here because of those plants

5300
01:49:57,350 --> 01:49:57,360
and we are here because of those plants
 

5301
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,990
and we are here because of those plants
right so I think death is is very much

5302
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:00,000
right so I think death is is very much
 

5303
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,109
right so I think death is is very much
part of life so in the context of you

5304
01:50:03,109 --> 01:50:03,119
part of life so in the context of you
 

5305
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:06,709
part of life so in the context of you
know the redwood tree perhaps you know

5306
01:50:06,709 --> 01:50:06,719
know the redwood tree perhaps you know
 

5307
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:10,490
know the redwood tree perhaps you know
life is defined as uh ten generations

5308
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:10,500
life is defined as uh ten generations
 

5309
01:50:10,500 --> 01:50:12,109
life is defined as uh ten generations
and through the lens of a bacteria

5310
01:50:12,109 --> 01:50:12,119
and through the lens of a bacteria
 

5311
01:50:12,119 --> 01:50:15,470
and through the lens of a bacteria
perhaps life is defined as a millisecond

5312
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:15,480
perhaps life is defined as a millisecond
 

5313
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,410
perhaps life is defined as a millisecond
and perhaps through the lens of of an

5314
01:50:18,410 --> 01:50:18,420
and perhaps through the lens of of an
 

5315
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:21,109
and perhaps through the lens of of an
AGI life is defined as all of human

5316
01:50:21,109 --> 01:50:21,119
AGI life is defined as all of human
 

5317
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:23,510
AGI life is defined as all of human
civilization and so I think it really is

5318
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:23,520
civilization and so I think it really is
 

5319
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,370
civilization and so I think it really is
a question of

5320
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:25,380
a question of
 

5321
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:26,290
a question of
um

5322
01:50:26,290 --> 01:50:26,300
um
 

5323
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:30,250
um
this time scale again the time scale and

5324
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:30,260
this time scale again the time scale and
 

5325
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:33,050
this time scale again the time scale and
the organism the life form that's asking

5326
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:33,060
the organism the life form that's asking
 

5327
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:34,970
the organism the life form that's asking
the question through which we can answer

5328
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:34,980
the question through which we can answer
 

5329
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,470
the question through which we can answer
what is life

5330
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:36,480
what is life
 

5331
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:38,149
what is life
what do you think about this since

5332
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:38,159
what do you think about this since
 

5333
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:40,609
what do you think about this since
you're if we think of ourselves as in

5334
01:50:40,609 --> 01:50:40,619
you're if we think of ourselves as in
 

5335
01:50:40,619 --> 01:50:42,229
you're if we think of ourselves as in
the eye of the storm of an another

5336
01:50:42,229 --> 01:50:42,239
the eye of the storm of an another
 

5337
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:44,149
the eye of the storm of an another
Extinction

5338
01:50:44,149 --> 01:50:44,159
Extinction
 

5339
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:46,609
Extinction
the the natural question to ask here is

5340
01:50:46,609 --> 01:50:46,619
the the natural question to ask here is
 

5341
01:50:46,619 --> 01:50:50,090
the the natural question to ask here is
you have all all of nature and then you

5342
01:50:50,090 --> 01:50:50,100
you have all all of nature and then you
 

5343
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:53,390
you have all all of nature and then you
have this new human creation that is

5344
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:53,400
have this new human creation that is
 

5345
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,430
have this new human creation that is
currently being termed artificial

5346
01:50:55,430 --> 01:50:55,440
currently being termed artificial
 

5347
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:58,209
currently being termed artificial
intelligence

5348
01:50:58,209 --> 01:50:58,219

 

5349
01:50:58,219 --> 01:51:01,609

how does your work play with the

5350
01:51:01,609 --> 01:51:01,619
how does your work play with the
 

5351
01:51:01,619 --> 01:51:03,530
how does your work play with the
possibility of of a future super

5352
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:03,540
possibility of of a future super
 

5353
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:07,250
possibility of of a future super
intelligent ecosystem and AGI that

5354
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:07,260
intelligent ecosystem and AGI that
 

5355
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:12,590
intelligent ecosystem and AGI that
either joins or supersedes humans yeah

5356
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:12,600
either joins or supersedes humans yeah
 

5357
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:15,590
either joins or supersedes humans yeah
um so I'm glad you asked this question

5358
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:15,600
um so I'm glad you asked this question
 

5359
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,189
um so I'm glad you asked this question
and I hope full are terrified both I'm

5360
01:51:19,189 --> 01:51:19,199
and I hope full are terrified both I'm
 

5361
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:21,530
and I hope full are terrified both I'm
hopeful and terrified I did watch your

5362
01:51:21,530 --> 01:51:21,540
hopeful and terrified I did watch your
 

5363
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:24,709
hopeful and terrified I did watch your
interview with Ellie ezrautkovsky and I

5364
01:51:24,709 --> 01:51:24,719
interview with Ellie ezrautkovsky and I
 

5365
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:26,930
interview with Ellie ezrautkovsky and I
loved it because you were scared or

5366
01:51:26,930 --> 01:51:26,940
loved it because you were scared or
 

5367
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:28,250
loved it because you were scared or
because you were excited or because

5368
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:28,260
because you were excited or because
 

5369
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:32,330
because you were excited or because
there's first of all I was both I I was

5370
01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:32,340
there's first of all I was both I I was
 

5371
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:37,250
there's first of all I was both I I was
I totally scared shamed excited and

5372
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:37,260
I totally scared shamed excited and
 

5373
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:40,729
I totally scared shamed excited and
totally also inspired because he's just

5374
01:51:40,729 --> 01:51:40,739
totally also inspired because he's just
 

5375
01:51:40,739 --> 01:51:43,430
totally also inspired because he's just
such an incredible thinker

5376
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:43,440
such an incredible thinker
 

5377
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,649
such an incredible thinker
um and I can agree or disagree with what

5378
01:51:45,649 --> 01:51:45,659
um and I can agree or disagree with what
 

5379
01:51:45,659 --> 01:51:48,109
um and I can agree or disagree with what
he says but I just found his way of

5380
01:51:48,109 --> 01:51:48,119
he says but I just found his way of
 

5381
01:51:48,119 --> 01:51:50,330
he says but I just found his way of
thinking about AGI

5382
01:51:50,330 --> 01:51:50,340
thinking about AGI
 

5383
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:52,790
thinking about AGI
um and The Perils of humanity as a

5384
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:52,800
um and The Perils of humanity as a
 

5385
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,430
um and The Perils of humanity as a
result there's an inevitability to what

5386
01:51:55,430 --> 01:51:55,440
result there's an inevitability to what
 

5387
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:57,649
result there's an inevitability to what
he's saying his advice to young people

5388
01:51:57,649 --> 01:51:57,659
he's saying his advice to young people
 

5389
01:51:57,659 --> 01:52:01,189
he's saying his advice to young people
is that prepare for a short life yeah he

5390
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:01,199
is that prepare for a short life yeah he
 

5391
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:02,330
is that prepare for a short life yeah he
thinks

5392
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:02,340
thinks
 

5393
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:04,490
thinks
it's very

5394
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:04,500
it's very
 

5395
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:08,770
it's very
almost simple it's almost common sense

5396
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:08,780
almost simple it's almost common sense
 

5397
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:12,830
almost simple it's almost common sense
that AGI would get rid of humans that he

5398
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:12,840
that AGI would get rid of humans that he
 

5399
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:16,189
that AGI would get rid of humans that he
can't imagine a trajectory

5400
01:52:16,189 --> 01:52:16,199
can't imagine a trajectory
 

5401
01:52:16,199 --> 01:52:19,430
can't imagine a trajectory
eventually that leads to a place that

5402
01:52:19,430 --> 01:52:19,440
eventually that leads to a place that
 

5403
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:22,010
eventually that leads to a place that
doesn't have AGI kill all humans there's

5404
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:22,020
doesn't have AGI kill all humans there's
 

5405
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:25,010
doesn't have AGI kill all humans there's
just too many trajectories where a super

5406
01:52:25,010 --> 01:52:25,020
just too many trajectories where a super
 

5407
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:28,189
just too many trajectories where a super
intelligent systems gets rid of humans

5408
01:52:28,189 --> 01:52:28,199
intelligent systems gets rid of humans
 

5409
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:31,550
intelligent systems gets rid of humans
and in the near term and so yeah the the

5410
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:31,560
and in the near term and so yeah the the
 

5411
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:33,890
and in the near term and so yeah the the
that Clarity of thinking is very uh

5412
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:33,900
that Clarity of thinking is very uh
 

5413
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:36,169
that Clarity of thinking is very uh
sobering to me

5414
01:52:36,169 --> 01:52:36,179
sobering to me
 

5415
01:52:36,179 --> 01:52:38,930
sobering to me
it's maybe it is to you as well it's

5416
01:52:38,930 --> 01:52:38,940
it's maybe it is to you as well it's
 

5417
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:40,609
it's maybe it is to you as well it's
super inspiring because I think he's

5418
01:52:40,609 --> 01:52:40,619
super inspiring because I think he's
 

5419
01:52:40,619 --> 01:52:43,310
super inspiring because I think he's
wrong but it's like you you almost want

5420
01:52:43,310 --> 01:52:43,320
wrong but it's like you you almost want
 

5421
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,870
wrong but it's like you you almost want
to prove him wrong

5422
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:44,880
to prove him wrong
 

5423
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,970
to prove him wrong
it's like no we humans are clever Bunch

5424
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:46,980
it's like no we humans are clever Bunch
 

5425
01:52:46,980 --> 01:52:49,189
it's like no we humans are clever Bunch
we're gonna find a way it is a bit like

5426
01:52:49,189 --> 01:52:49,199
we're gonna find a way it is a bit like
 

5427
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:51,470
we're gonna find a way it is a bit like
jumping into super cold water it's sort

5428

jumping into super cold water it's sort
 

5429
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:54,169
jumping into super cold water it's sort
of a kind of a fist in your face it

5430
01:52:54,169 --> 01:52:54,179
of a kind of a fist in your face it
 

5431
01:52:54,179 --> 01:52:56,450
of a kind of a fist in your face it
wakes you up and I like these moments so

5432
01:52:56,450 --> 01:52:56,460
wakes you up and I like these moments so
 

5433
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:58,010
wakes you up and I like these moments so
much

5434
01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:58,020
much
 

5435
01:52:58,020 --> 01:52:59,810
much
um and and he was able to bring that

5436
01:52:59,810 --> 01:52:59,820
um and and he was able to bring that
 

5437
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:03,410
um and and he was able to bring that
moment to life even though I think

5438
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:03,420
moment to life even though I think
 

5439
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:05,510
moment to life even though I think
a mother can never

01:53:05,510 --> 01:53:05,520
a mother can never
 

5441
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:07,550
a mother can never
think that way ever

5442
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:07,560
think that way ever
 

5443
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:10,550
think that way ever
um and and it's a little bit like that

5444
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:10,560
um and and it's a little bit like that
 

5445
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,830

Evolution requires on your question
 

5449
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:19,189
Evolution requires on your question
about AGI in nature look I think

5450
01:53:19,189 --> 01:53:19,199
about AGI in nature look I think
 

5451
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:21,950
about AGI in nature look I think
we've been through a lot in terms of to

5452
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:21,960
we've been through a lot in terms of to
 

5453
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:24,709
we've been through a lot in terms of to
to get here we sort of moved from data

5454
01:53:24,709 --> 01:53:24,719
to get here we sort of moved from data
 

5455
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:26,570
to get here we sort of moved from data
right the ability to collect information

5456
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:26,580
right the ability to collect information
 

5457
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:28,609
right the ability to collect information
to knowledge the ability to use this

5458
01:53:28,609 --> 01:53:28,619
to knowledge the ability to use this
 

5459
01:53:28,619 --> 01:53:31,010
to knowledge the ability to use this
information for utility from knowledge

5460
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:31,020
information for utility from knowledge
 

5461
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,750
information for utility from knowledge
to intelligence and what is intelligence

5462
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:32,760
to intelligence and what is intelligence
 

5463
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:34,550
to intelligence and what is intelligence
is the ability to problem solve and

5464
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:34,560
is the ability to problem solve and
 

5465
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,010
is the ability to problem solve and
adapt and translate so that's sort of

5466
01:53:37,010 --> 01:53:37,020
adapt and translate so that's sort of
 

5467
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:39,109
adapt and translate so that's sort of
from from data to information to

5468
01:53:39,109 --> 01:53:39,119
from from data to information to
 

5469
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:40,790
from from data to information to
knowledge I think the next Frontier is

5470
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:40,800
knowledge I think the next Frontier is
 

5471
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,410
knowledge I think the next Frontier is
wisdom

5472

wisdom
 

5473
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:43,970
wisdom
um and what is wisdom wisdom is the

01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:43,980
um and what is wisdom wisdom is the
 

5475
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:47,330
um and what is wisdom wisdom is the
ability to have or find Insight

ability to have or find Insight
 

5477
01:53:47,340 --> 01:53:48,590
ability to have or find Insight
um about

5478
01:53:48,590 --> 01:53:48,600
um about
 

5479
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:51,169
um about
um the world and from wisdom to

01:53:51,169 --> 01:53:51,179
um the world and from wisdom to
 

5481
01:53:51,179 --> 01:53:53,090
um the world and from wisdom to
spiritual awareness which is sort of

5482
01:53:53,090 --> 01:53:53,100
spiritual awareness which is sort of
 

5483
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:55,970
spiritual awareness which is sort of
transcends wisdom and is able and to

5484
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:55,980
transcends wisdom and is able and to
 

5485
01:53:55,980 --> 01:53:59,090
transcends wisdom and is able and to

think what is interesting about AGI is

5488
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:01,260
think what is interesting about AGI is
 

5489
01:54:01,260 --> 01:54:03,350
think what is interesting about AGI is
that it is sort of almost like a

that it is sort of almost like a

self-recursive thing right because it's
 

5493
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:08,149

01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:21,119
like it's regurgitating and that's so
 

5507

things
 

5519
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:38,510
things
um

5520
01:54:38,510 --> 01:54:38,520
um
 

5521
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:41,810
um
um but it's not as if the AGI has

5522
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:41,820
um but it's not as if the AGI has
 

5523
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:43,790
um but it's not as if the AGI has
self-awareness right it's not as if it

5524
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:43,800
self-awareness right it's not as if it
 

5525
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:47,270
self-awareness right it's not as if it
has maybe maybe maybe maybe it maybe it

5526
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:47,280
has maybe maybe maybe maybe it maybe it
 

5527
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,750
has maybe maybe maybe maybe it maybe it
has but as far as I can tell it's not as

5528
01:54:50,750 --> 01:54:50,760
has but as far as I can tell it's not as
 

5529
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,330
has but as far as I can tell it's not as
if AGI has approached Consciousness or

5530
01:54:53,330 --> 01:54:53,340
if AGI has approached Consciousness or
 

5531
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:56,570
if AGI has approached Consciousness or
sentience just yet it it it's it's

5532
01:54:56,570 --> 01:54:56,580
sentience just yet it it it's it's
 

5533
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:59,570
sentience just yet it it it's it's
probably getting there but the language

5534
01:54:59,570 --> 01:54:59,580
probably getting there but the language
 

5535
01:54:59,580 --> 01:55:03,109
probably getting there but the language
appears to present itself as if as if

5536
01:55:03,109 --> 01:55:03,119
appears to present itself as if as if
 

5537
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:04,790
appears to present itself as if as if
there is sentience there but it doesn't

5538
01:55:04,790 --> 01:55:04,800
there is sentience there but it doesn't
 

5539
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,890
there is sentience there but it doesn't
but I think that's the problem at the

5540
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:06,900
but I think that's the problem at the
 

5541
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,830
but I think that's the problem at the
point where this AGI sounds like me and

5542
01:55:09,830 --> 01:55:09,840
point where this AGI sounds like me and
 

5543
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,770
point where this AGI sounds like me and
speaks like me and behaves like me and

5544
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:12,780
speaks like me and behaves like me and
 

5545
01:55:12,780 --> 01:55:14,990
speaks like me and behaves like me and
feels like me and breathes like me and

5546
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:15,000
feels like me and breathes like me and
 

5547
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,870
feels like me and breathes like me and
my daughter knows the AGI to be me is

5548
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:17,880
my daughter knows the AGI to be me is
 

5549
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:20,270
my daughter knows the AGI to be me is
sort of the end of it and the end of

5550
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:20,280
sort of the end of it and the end of
 

5551
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:22,189
sort of the end of it and the end of
everything right it's the end of human

5552
01:55:22,189 --> 01:55:22,199
everything right it's the end of human
 

5553
01:55:22,199 --> 01:55:23,689
everything right it's the end of human
agency

5554
01:55:23,689 --> 01:55:23,699
agency
 

5555
01:55:23,699 --> 01:55:26,870
agency
but what is the end of human agency to

5556
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:26,880
but what is the end of human agency to
 

5557
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,970
but what is the end of human agency to
humans I think is the beginning of

5558
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:28,980
humans I think is the beginning of
 

5559
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:31,669
humans I think is the beginning of
agency to Nature because if you take all

5560
01:55:31,669 --> 01:55:31,679
agency to Nature because if you take all
 

5561
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:33,770
agency to Nature because if you take all
of this agency if you take all of these

5562
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:33,780
of this agency if you take all of these
 

5563
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:37,189
of this agency if you take all of these
language models that can summarize all

5564
01:55:37,189 --> 01:55:37,199
language models that can summarize all
 

5565
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:39,609
language models that can summarize all
of human civilization and Consciousness

5566
01:55:39,609 --> 01:55:39,619
of human civilization and Consciousness
 

5567
01:55:39,619 --> 01:55:43,250
of human civilization and Consciousness
and then upload that to Nature and have

5568
01:55:43,250 --> 01:55:43,260
and then upload that to Nature and have
 

5569
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:46,189
and then upload that to Nature and have
nature now deal with that World Of

5570
01:55:46,189 --> 01:55:46,199
nature now deal with that World Of
 

5571
01:55:46,199 --> 01:55:48,050
nature now deal with that World Of
Consciousness that it never had access

5572
01:55:48,050 --> 01:55:48,060
Consciousness that it never had access
 

5573
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:48,950
Consciousness that it never had access
to

5574
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,960
to
 

5575
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:52,450
to
so maybe through eliezel's lands the

5576
01:55:52,450 --> 01:55:52,460
so maybe through eliezel's lands the
 

5577
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:54,890
so maybe through eliezel's lands the
short-lived human becomes sort of a very

5578
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:54,900
short-lived human becomes sort of a very
 

5579
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:59,270
short-lived human becomes sort of a very
long-lived human like sentient weeping

5580
01:55:59,270 --> 01:55:59,280
long-lived human like sentient weeping
 

5581
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,910
long-lived human like sentient weeping
willow maybe maybe that's the end and

5582
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:01,920
willow maybe maybe that's the end and
 

5583
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:06,169
willow maybe maybe that's the end and
the beginning and and and and maybe

what does that look like right when you
 

5655
01:57:50,159 --> 01:57:54,589
what does that look like right when you
like completely switch the time scale

5656
01:57:54,589 --> 01:57:54,599
like completely switch the time scale
 

5657

do you think there's uh

5666
01:58:09,310 --> 01:58:09,320
do you think there's uh
 

5667
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:11,330
do you think there's uh
because when you start to think about

5668
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:11,340
because when you start to think about
 

5669
01:58:11,340 --> 01:58:14,990
because when you start to think about
time scales like this looking at Earth

life forms on them that are just doing
 

5681
01:58:25,679 --> 01:58:27,530
life forms on them that are just doing
their thing in this kind of way because

5682
01:58:27,530 --> 01:58:27,540
their thing in this kind of way because
 

5683
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:28,790
their thing in this kind of way because
you

you
 

5685
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,430
you
in what you're doing you're

5686
01:58:31,430 --> 01:58:31,440
in what you're doing you're
 

5687
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:34,430
in what you're doing you're
you're directly playing with what's

5688
01:58:34,430 --> 01:58:34,440
you're directly playing with what's
 

5689
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:36,290
you're directly playing with what's
possible with life

5690

possible with life
 

5691
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:39,050
possible with life
life-like things that kind of maps the

5692
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:39,060
life-like things that kind of maps the
 

5693
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:41,209
life-like things that kind of maps the
question of well what kind of other

question of well what kind of other
 

5695
01:58:41,219 --> 01:58:43,129

things are possible elsewhere

5696
01:58:43,129 --> 01:58:43,139
things are possible elsewhere
 

5697
01:58:43,139 --> 01:58:44,629
things are possible elsewhere
do you think

5698
01:58:44,629 --> 01:58:44,639
do you think
 

5699
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,790
do you think
um there's other

5700
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:46,800
um there's other
 

5701
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,310
um there's other
worlds Full of Life full of alien life

5702
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:49,320
worlds Full of Life full of alien life
 

5703
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:52,450
worlds Full of Life full of alien life
out there I've studied the calculations

5704
01:58:52,450 --> 01:58:52,460
out there I've studied the calculations
 

5705
01:58:52,460 --> 01:58:56,570
out there I've studied the calculations
that point you know towards the

5706
01:58:56,570 --> 01:58:56,580
that point you know towards the
 

5707
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:59,149
that point you know towards the
um verdict that the possibility of life

5708
01:58:59,149 --> 01:58:59,159
um verdict that the possibility of life
 

5709
01:58:59,159 --> 01:59:02,990
um verdict that the possibility of life
in you know in in and around us is is

5710
01:59:02,990 --> 01:59:03,000
in you know in in and around us is is
 

5711
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,290
in you know in in and around us is is
very very low we are a chosen planet in

5712
01:59:06,290 --> 01:59:06,300
very very low we are a chosen planet in
 

5713
01:59:06,300 --> 01:59:08,149
very very low we are a chosen planet in
a way right there's water and there's

5714
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:08,159
a way right there's water and there's
 

5715
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:10,430
a way right there's water and there's
love what else do you need

5716
01:59:10,430 --> 01:59:10,440
love what else do you need
 

5717
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:13,990
love what else do you need
um and and and that sort of

5718
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:14,000
um and and and that sort of
 

5719
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,510
um and and and that sort of
very peculiar juxtaposition of

5720
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:17,520
very peculiar juxtaposition of
 

5721
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,390
very peculiar juxtaposition of
conditions the oxygen the water the

5722
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:20,400
conditions the oxygen the water the
 

5723
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:21,709
conditions the oxygen the water the
carbon

5724
01:59:21,709 --> 01:59:21,719
carbon
 

5725
01:59:21,719 --> 01:59:24,890
carbon
um again is is is in a way a miracle

5726
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:24,900
um again is is is in a way a miracle
 

5727
01:59:24,900 --> 01:59:26,990
um again is is is in a way a miracle
given the

5728
01:59:26,990 --> 01:59:27,000
given the
 

5729
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:27,790
given the
um

5730
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:27,800
um
 

5731
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:30,350
um
massive extinctions that we've been

5732
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:30,360
massive extinctions that we've been
 

5733
01:59:30,360 --> 01:59:35,030
massive extinctions that we've been
through as life forms and that said I

5734
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:35,040
through as life forms and that said I
 

5735
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:38,149
through as life forms and that said I
cannot believe that there is no other

5736
01:59:38,149 --> 01:59:38,159
cannot believe that there is no other
 

5737
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:41,870
cannot believe that there is no other
life form I I want to believe

5738
01:59:41,870 --> 01:59:41,880
life form I I want to believe
 

5739
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:44,330
life form I I want to believe
um more than I know

5740
01:59:44,330 --> 01:59:44,340
um more than I know
 

5741
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:48,070
um more than I know
that that yes that there are life forms

5742
01:59:48,070 --> 01:59:48,080
that that yes that there are life forms
 

5743
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:51,169
that that yes that there are life forms
and you know in the white fountain that

5744
01:59:51,169 --> 01:59:51,179
and you know in the white fountain that
 

5745
01:59:51,179 --> 01:59:54,350
and you know in the white fountain that
is the black hole right that there are

5746
01:59:54,350 --> 01:59:54,360
is the black hole right that there are
 

5747
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:56,570
is the black hole right that there are
these life forms that are

5748
01:59:56,570 --> 01:59:56,580
these life forms that are
 

5749
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:58,370
these life forms that are
um you know

5750
01:59:58,370 --> 01:59:58,380
um you know
 

5751
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:01,550
um you know
light years away from us and that are

5752
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:01,560
light years away from us and that are
 

5753
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,589
light years away from us and that are
that are forming other forms of life

5754
02:00:03,589 --> 02:00:03,599
that are forming other forms of life
 

5755
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:07,250
that are forming other forms of life
forces yeah I'm much more worried about

5756
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:07,260
forces yeah I'm much more worried about
 

5757
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:09,410
forces yeah I'm much more worried about
probably the thing that you're working

5758
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:09,420
probably the thing that you're working
 

5759
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:12,229
probably the thing that you're working
on which is that there's all kinds of

5760
02:00:12,229 --> 02:00:12,239
on which is that there's all kinds of
 

5761
02:00:12,239 --> 02:00:16,310
on which is that there's all kinds of
life around us that we're not

5762
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:16,320
life around us that we're not
 

5763
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:20,030
life around us that we're not
communicating with yes there's aliens in

5764
02:00:20,030 --> 02:00:20,040
communicating with yes there's aliens in
 

5765
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,669
communicating with yes there's aliens in
a sense all around us that we're not

5766
02:00:22,669 --> 02:00:22,679
a sense all around us that we're not
 

5767
02:00:22,679 --> 02:00:24,470
a sense all around us that we're not
seeing that we're not talking to they

5768
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:24,480
seeing that we're not talking to they
 

5769
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,050
seeing that we're not talking to they
were not communicating yeah because that

5770
02:00:27,050 --> 02:00:27,060
were not communicating yeah because that
 

5771
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:29,510
were not communicating yeah because that
to me just seems the more likely

5772
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:29,520
to me just seems the more likely
 

5773
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:32,270
to me just seems the more likely
situation that they don't care that

5774
02:00:32,270 --> 02:00:32,280
situation that they don't care that
 

5775
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:34,250
situation that they don't care that
they're here they're all around us in

02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:34,260
they're here they're all around us in
 

5777
02:00:34,260 --> 02:00:36,350
they're here they're all around us in
different forms that that there is a

5778
02:00:36,350 --> 02:00:36,360
different forms that that there is a
 

5779
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,330
different forms that that there is a
connection there's a thing that connects

5780
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:38,340
connection there's a thing that connects
 

5781
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:41,830
connection there's a thing that connects
all of us all of living beings

5782
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:41,840
all of us all of living beings
 

5783
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:44,270
all of us all of living beings
Across the Universe and like we're not

5784
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:44,280
Across the Universe and like we're not
 

5785
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:46,669
Across the Universe and like we're not
we're just beginning to understand any

5786
02:00:46,669 --> 02:00:46,679
we're just beginning to understand any
 

5787
02:00:46,679 --> 02:00:48,410
we're just beginning to understand any
of it and I feel like that's the

5788
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:48,420
of it and I feel like that's the
 

5789
02:00:48,420 --> 02:00:50,570
of it and I feel like that's the
important problem is I feel like you can

5790
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:50,580
important problem is I feel like you can
