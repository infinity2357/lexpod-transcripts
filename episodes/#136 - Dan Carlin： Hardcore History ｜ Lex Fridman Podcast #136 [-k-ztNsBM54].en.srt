so if we define evil maybe i can get a
 

173
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,869
so if we define evil maybe i can get a
better idea of

174
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
better idea of
 

175
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,149
better idea of
and and that could be a whole show

176
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
and and that could be a whole show
 

177
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,070
and and that could be a whole show
couldn't defining evil

178
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
couldn't defining evil
 

179
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,630
couldn't defining evil
but when we say evil what do we mean

180
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
but when we say evil what do we mean
 

181
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,470
but when we say evil what do we mean
that's a slippery one but i think

182
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
that's a slippery one but i think
 

183
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,670
that's a slippery one but i think
there's some way in which your existence

184
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
there's some way in which your existence
 

185
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,350
there's some way in which your existence
your presence in the world leads to

186
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
your presence in the world leads to
 

187
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,390
your presence in the world leads to
pain and suffering and destruction for

188
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
pain and suffering and destruction for
 

189
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,910
pain and suffering and destruction for
many others

190
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
many others
 

191
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,149
many others
in the rest of the world so you you

192
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
in the rest of the world so you you
 

193
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,509
in the rest of the world so you you
steal the resources

194
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
steal the resources
 

195
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,309
steal the resources
and you use them to create more

196
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
and you use them to create more
 

197
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,789
and you use them to create more
suffering than there was before

198
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
suffering than there was before
 

199
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,030
suffering than there was before
in the world so i suppose it's somehow

200
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,040
in the world so i suppose it's somehow
 

201
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,470
in the world so i suppose it's somehow
deeply connected to this

202
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
deeply connected to this
 

203
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,190
deeply connected to this
other slippery word which is suffering

204
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
other slippery word which is suffering
 

205
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,149
other slippery word which is suffering
as you

206
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
as you
 

207
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,070
as you
create suffering in the world you bring

208
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
create suffering in the world you bring
 

209
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,430
create suffering in the world you bring
suffering to the world

210
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
suffering to the world
 

211
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,030
suffering to the world
but here's the problem i think with it

212
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
but here's the problem i think with it
 

213
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,550
but here's the problem i think with it
because i i fully see where you're going

214
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
because i i fully see where you're going
 

215
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:46,869
because i i fully see where you're going
with that

216
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
with that
 

217
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,670
with that
and i understand it the problem is is

218
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
and i understand it the problem is is
 

219
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,670
and i understand it the problem is is
the question of

220
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
the question of
 

221
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,470
the question of
the reason for inflicting suffering so

222
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
the reason for inflicting suffering so
 

223
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,830
the reason for inflicting suffering so
sometimes

224
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
sometimes
 

225
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,110
sometimes
one might inflict suffering upon one

226
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
one might inflict suffering upon one
 

227
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,710
one might inflict suffering upon one
group of individuals

228
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:00,720
group of individuals
 

229
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,149
group of individuals
in order to maximize a lack of suffering

230
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
in order to maximize a lack of suffering
 

231
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,229
in order to maximize a lack of suffering
with another group of individuals or one

232
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
with another group of individuals or one
 

233
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,710
with another group of individuals or one
who might not be considered evil at all

234
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
who might not be considered evil at all
 

235
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,149
who might not be considered evil at all
might make the rational

236
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
might make the rational
 

237
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,229
might make the rational
seemingly rational choice of inflicting

238
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
seemingly rational choice of inflicting
 

239
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,990
seemingly rational choice of inflicting
pain and suffering on a smaller

240
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
pain and suffering on a smaller
 

241
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,469
pain and suffering on a smaller
group of people in order to maximize the

242
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
group of people in order to maximize the
 

243
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,150
group of people in order to maximize the
opposite of that for a larger group of

244
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
opposite of that for a larger group of
 

245
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,870
opposite of that for a larger group of
people

246
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
people
 

247
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,710
people
yeah that's one of the dark things about

248
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
yeah that's one of the dark things about
 

249
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,550
yeah that's one of the dark things about
i've spoken and read the work of stephen

250
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
i've spoken and read the work of stephen
 

251
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,150
i've spoken and read the work of stephen
codkin i'm not sure if you're familiar

252
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
codkin i'm not sure if you're familiar
 

253
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,189
codkin i'm not sure if you're familiar
with the historian

254
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
with the historian
 

255
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,070
with the historian
and he's basically a stalin a joseph

256
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
and he's basically a stalin a joseph
 

257
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,909
and he's basically a stalin a joseph
stalin scholar

258
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
stalin scholar
 

259
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,790
stalin scholar
and one of the things i realized i'm not

260
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
and one of the things i realized i'm not
 

261
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,469
and one of the things i realized i'm not
sure where to put hitler

262
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:34,479
sure where to put hitler
 

263
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,950
sure where to put hitler
but with stalin it really seems that

264
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
but with stalin it really seems that
 

265
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,710
but with stalin it really seems that
he was sane and he thought he was doing

266
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
he was sane and he thought he was doing
 

267
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,749
he was sane and he thought he was doing
good for the world

268
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
good for the world
 

269
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,990
good for the world
he i i really believe from everything

270
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
he i i really believe from everything
 

271
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,830
he i i really believe from everything
i've read about stalin

272
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
i've read about stalin
 

273
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,950
i've read about stalin
that he believed that communism

274
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
that he believed that communism
 

275
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,070
that he believed that communism
is good for the world and if you have to

276
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
is good for the world and if you have to
 

277
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,390
is good for the world and if you have to
kill a few people along the way if it's

278
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
kill a few people along the way if it's
 

279
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,070
kill a few people along the way if it's
like you said the small groups if you

280
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
like you said the small groups if you
 

281
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,670
like you said the small groups if you
have to

282
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
have to
 

283
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,909
have to
sort of remove the people that stand in

284
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
sort of remove the people that stand in
 

285
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,550
sort of remove the people that stand in
the way of this utopian system

286
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
the way of this utopian system
 

287
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,749
the way of this utopian system
of communism then that's actually good

288
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
of communism then that's actually good
 

289
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,189
of communism then that's actually good
for the world and it didn't seem

290
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
for the world and it didn't seem
 

291
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,670
for the world and it didn't seem
to me that he could even consider the

292
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
to me that he could even consider the
 

293
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,150
to me that he could even consider the
possibility that he was evil

294
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
possibility that he was evil
 

295
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,749
possibility that he was evil
he really thought he was doing good for

296
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
he really thought he was doing good for
 

297
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,909
he really thought he was doing good for
the world and that stuck with me because

298
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
the world and that stuck with me because
 

299
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,990
the world and that stuck with me because
he's one of the most

300
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
he's one of the most
 

301
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,350
he's one of the most
is to our definition of evil he seems to

302
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
is to our definition of evil he seems to
 

303
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,189
is to our definition of evil he seems to
have brought more evil onto this world

304
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
have brought more evil onto this world
 

305
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,390
have brought more evil onto this world
than almost any human in history

306
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
than almost any human in history
 

307
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,110
than almost any human in history
and i don't know what to do with that

308
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
and i don't know what to do with that
 

309
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,430
and i don't know what to do with that
well

310
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
well
 

311
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,029
well
i'm fascinated with the concept so

312
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
i'm fascinated with the concept so
 

313
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,950
i'm fascinated with the concept so
fascinated by it that the very first

314
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
fascinated by it that the very first
 

315
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,550
fascinated by it that the very first
hardcore history show we ever did which

316
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
hardcore history show we ever did which
 

317
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,110
hardcore history show we ever did which
was a full

318
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
was a full
 

319
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,950
was a full
15 or 16 minutes um was called alexander

320
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
15 or 16 minutes um was called alexander
 

321
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,070
15 or 16 minutes um was called alexander
versus hitler

322
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
versus hitler
 

323
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,110
versus hitler
and the entire question about it was

324
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
and the entire question about it was
 

325
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,469
and the entire question about it was
the motivations right so if you go to a

326
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
the motivations right so if you go to a
 

327
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,870
the motivations right so if you go to a
court of law because you killed somebody

328
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
court of law because you killed somebody
 

329
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,990
court of law because you killed somebody
one of the things they're going to

330
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
one of the things they're going to
 

331
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,150
one of the things they're going to
consider is why did you kill them

332
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
consider is why did you kill them
 

333
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,390
consider is why did you kill them
right and if you killed somebody for

334
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
i think that
 

499
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,990
i think that
and i think that there's historical

500
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
and i think that there's historical
 

501
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,829
and i think that there's historical
figures that that that one could point

502
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
figures that that that one could point
 

503
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,589
figures that that that one could point
and but that gets to the deeper question

504
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
and but that gets to the deeper question
 

505
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,909
and but that gets to the deeper question
of are these people saying

506
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
of are these people saying
 

507
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,110
of are these people saying
uh do they have something wrong with

508
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
uh do they have something wrong with
 

509
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,790
uh do they have something wrong with
them are they twisted from something in

510
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
them are they twisted from something in
 

511
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,750
them are they twisted from something in
their youth

512
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
their youth
 

513
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,790
their youth
um you know i mean

514
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
um you know i mean
 

515
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,870
um you know i mean
these are the kinds of things where you

516
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
these are the kinds of things where you
 

517
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,550
these are the kinds of things where you
start to delve into the psychological

518
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
start to delve into the psychological
 

519
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,750
start to delve into the psychological
makeup of these people

520
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
makeup of these people
 

521
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,230
makeup of these people
in other words is anybody born evil and

522
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
in other words is anybody born evil and
 

523
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,630
in other words is anybody born evil and
i actually believe that some people are

524
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
i actually believe that some people are
 

525
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,630
i actually believe that some people are

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
i think the dna can get scrambled up in
 

527
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,110
i think the dna can get scrambled up in
ways i think the question of evil is

528
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
ways i think the question of evil is
 

529
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,470
ways i think the question of evil is
important too because i think it's an

530
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
important too because i think it's an
 

531
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,910
important too because i think it's an
eye of the beholder thing i mean if

532
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
eye of the beholder thing i mean if
 

533
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,110
eye of the beholder thing i mean if
hitler for example

534
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
hitler for example
 

535
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,630
hitler for example
had been successful and we were today

536
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
had been successful and we were today

third reich since
 

541
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,110
third reich since
i think his entire history would be

542
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
i think his entire history would be
 

543
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,389
i think his entire history would be
viewed through a different lens because

544
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
viewed through a different lens because
 

545
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,590
viewed through a different lens because
that's the way we do things

546
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
that's the way we do things
 

547
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,070
that's the way we do things
right genghis khan looks different to

548
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
right genghis khan looks different to
 

549
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,829
right genghis khan looks different to
the mongolians than he does to the

um and i think so so an eye of the

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
um and i think so so an eye of the
 

555
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,590
um and i think so so an eye of the

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
beholder question i think comes into all
 

557
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,030
beholder question i think comes into all
these sorts of things as you said it's a

558
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
these sorts of things as you said it's a
 

559
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,710
these sorts of things as you said it's a
very slippery question

560
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
very slippery question
 

561
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,710
very slippery question
where do you put as somebody who's

562
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
where do you put as somebody who's
 

563
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,949
where do you put as somebody who's
fascinated by military history

564
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
fascinated by military history
 

565
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,870
fascinated by military history
where do you put violence as uh

566
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
where do you put violence as uh
 

567
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,509
where do you put violence as uh
as in terms of the human condition is it

568
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
as in terms of the human condition is it
 

569
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,590
as in terms of the human condition is it
core to being human or is it just

570
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
core to being human or is it just
 

571
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,910
core to being human or is it just
a little uh tool that we use every once

572
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
a little uh tool that we use every once
 

573
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,190
a little uh tool that we use every once
in a while

574
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
in a while
 

575
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,710
in a while
so i'm going to respond to your question

576
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
so i'm going to respond to your question
 

577
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,790
so i'm going to respond to your question
with a question what do you

578
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
with a question what do you
 

579
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,710
with a question what do you
see the difference being between

580
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
see the difference being between
 

581
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,829
see the difference being between
violence and force

582
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
violence and force
 

583
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,269
violence and force
let me go farther i'm not sure that

584
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
let me go farther i'm not sure that
 

585
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,350
let me go farther i'm not sure that
violence is something that we have to

586
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
violence is something that we have to
 

587
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,509
violence is something that we have to
put up with as human beings forever that

588
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
put up with as human beings forever that
 

589
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,990
put up with as human beings forever that
we must resign ourselves to violence

590
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
we must resign ourselves to violence
 

591
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,509
we must resign ourselves to violence
forever but i have a much harder time

592
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
forever but i have a much harder time
 

593
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,509
forever but i have a much harder time
seeing us able to abolish force

594
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519
seeing us able to abolish force
 

595
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,949
seeing us able to abolish force
and i there's going to be some ground

596
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
and i there's going to be some ground
 

597
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,190
and i there's going to be some ground
where if those two things are not the

598
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
where if those two things are not the
 

599
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,710
where if those two things are not the
same and i don't know that maybe they

600
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
same and i don't know that maybe they
 

601
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,269
same and i don't know that maybe they
are

602
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
are
 

603
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,269
are
where there's certainly some crossover

604
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
where there's certainly some crossover
 

605
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,790
where there's certainly some crossover
and the re i think

606
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
and the re i think
 

607
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,949
and the re i think
force you know you're an engineer you'll

608
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
force you know you're an engineer you'll
 

609
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,230
force you know you're an engineer you'll
understand this better than i but think

610
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
understand this better than i but think
 

611
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,790
understand this better than i but think
about it as a physical law

612
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
about it as a physical law
 

613
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,790
about it as a physical law
if you can't stop something from moving

614
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
if you can't stop something from moving
 

615
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,470
if you can't stop something from moving
in a certain direction without pushing

616
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
in a certain direction without pushing
 

617
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,870
in a certain direction without pushing
back

618
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
back
 

619
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,910
back
in that same direction i'm not i'm not

620
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
in that same direction i'm not i'm not
 

621
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,310
in that same direction i'm not i'm not
sure

622
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
sure
 

623
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,710
sure
that you can have a society or a

624
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
that you can have a society or a
 

625
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,310
that you can have a society or a
civilization

626
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,320
civilization
 

627
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,670
civilization
without the ability to use a counter

628
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
without the ability to use a counter
 

629
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,470
without the ability to use a counter
force

630
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
force
 

631
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,949
force
when things are going wrong whether it's

632
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
when things are going wrong whether it's
 

633
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,949
when things are going wrong whether it's
on an individual level right

634
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
on an individual level right
 

635
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,350
on an individual level right
a person attacks another person so you

636
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
a person attacks another person so you
 

637
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,269
a person attacks another person so you
step in to save that person

638
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
step in to save that person
 

639
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,829
step in to save that person
um or on uh you know even at the highest

640
00:10:59,829 --> 00:10:59,839
um or on uh you know even at the highest
 

641
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,590
um or on uh you know even at the highest
levels of politics or anything else a

642
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
levels of politics or anything else a
 

643
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,509
levels of politics or anything else a
counter force to stop the

644
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
counter force to stop the
 

645
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,389
counter force to stop the
uh inertia or the impetus of of of

646
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
uh inertia or the impetus of of of
 

647
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,470
uh inertia or the impetus of of of
another movement so i think

648
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
another movement so i think
 

649
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,910
another movement so i think
that force is is a simple almost law of

650
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
that force is is a simple almost law of
 

651
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,550
that force is is a simple almost law of
physics

652
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
physics
 

653
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,550
physics
in human interaction especially at the

654
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
in human interaction especially at the
 

655
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,150
in human interaction especially at the
civilizational level i think

656
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
civilizational level i think
 

657
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,990
civilizational level i think
civilization requires a certain amount

658
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
civilization requires a certain amount
 

659
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,790
civilization requires a certain amount
of if not violence than force

660
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:20,800
of if not violence than force
 

661
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,910

00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
the goals that they want to achieve
 

827
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,590
the goals that they want to achieve
through uh peaceful

828
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,600
through uh peaceful
 

829
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,150
through uh peaceful
discussion or argumentation or um trying

830
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
discussion or argumentation or um trying
 

831
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,590
discussion or argumentation or um trying
to convince the other side

832
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
to convince the other side
 

833
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,509
to convince the other side
that sometimes the next level of

834
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
that sometimes the next level of
 

835
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,110
that sometimes the next level of
operations is something a little bit

836
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
operations is something a little bit
 

837
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,310
operations is something a little bit
more physically

838
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
more physically
 

839
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,069
more physically
uh imposing if that makes sense we go

840
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
uh imposing if that makes sense we go
 

841
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,150
uh imposing if that makes sense we go
from the intellectual to the physical

842
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
from the intellectual to the physical
 

843
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,629
from the intellectual to the physical
yeah so it too easily spills over into

844
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
yeah so it too easily spills over into
 

845
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,189
yeah so it too easily spills over into
violence

846
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
violence
 

847
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,590
violence
yes and one leads to the other often so

848
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
yes and one leads to the other often so
 

849
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,430
yes and one leads to the other often so
you kind of implied uh

850
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
you kind of implied uh
 

851
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,990
you kind of implied uh
perhaps a hopeful message but let me ask

852
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
perhaps a hopeful message but let me ask
 

853
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,189
perhaps a hopeful message but let me ask
in the form of a question

854
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:47,199
in the form of a question
 

855
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,110
in the form of a question
do you think we'll always have war

856
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120

 

857
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,470

i think it goes to the force question

858
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
i think it goes to the force question
 

859
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,150
i think it goes to the force question
too so for example

860
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
too so for example
 

861
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,509
too so for example
um what do you do i mean we're

862
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
um what do you do i mean we're
 

863
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,590
um what do you do i mean we're
let's let's play with nation states now

864
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
let's let's play with nation states now
 

865
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,750
let's let's play with nation states now
although i don't know that nation states

866
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
although i don't know that nation states
 

867
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,069
although i don't know that nation states
uh

868
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
uh
 

869
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,269
uh
are something we should think of as a

870
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
are something we should think of as a
 

871
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,350
are something we should think of as a
permanent constitution forever

872
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
permanent constitution forever
 

873
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,550
permanent constitution forever
um but how is one nation state supposed

874
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
um but how is one nation state supposed
 

875
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,550
um but how is one nation state supposed
to prevent another nation state

876
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
to prevent another nation state
 

877
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,470
to prevent another nation state
from acting in ways that it would see as

878
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
from acting in ways that it would see as
 

879
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,069
from acting in ways that it would see as
either detrimental to the global

880
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
either detrimental to the global
 

881
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,230
either detrimental to the global
community or detrimental to the interest

882
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
community or detrimental to the interest
 

883
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,110
community or detrimental to the interest
of their own nation-state um you know

884
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
of their own nation-state um you know
 

885
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,910
of their own nation-state um you know
and i i think

886
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
and i i think
 

887
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,590
and i i think
i think we've had this question of

888
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
i think we've had this question of
 

889
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,269
i think we've had this question of
going back to ancient times but

890
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
going back to ancient times but
 

891
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,870
going back to ancient times but
certainly in the 20th century this has

892
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
certainly in the 20th century this has
 

893
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,230
certainly in the 20th century this has
come up quite a bit i mean

894
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
come up quite a bit i mean
 

895
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,230
come up quite a bit i mean
the whole second world war argument

896
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,240
the whole second world war argument
 

897
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,990
the whole second world war argument
sometimes revolves around the idea of

898
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
sometimes revolves around the idea of
 

899
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,389
sometimes revolves around the idea of
what the proper counterforce should be

900
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
what the proper counterforce should be
 

901
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,550
what the proper counterforce should be
uh can you create an entity a league of

902
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
uh can you create an entity a league of
 

903
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,230
uh can you create an entity a league of
nations a united nations

904
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
nations a united nations
 

905
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,509
nations a united nations
uh a one world entity maybe even that

906
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:41,519
uh a one world entity maybe even that
 

907
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:41,910
uh a one world entity maybe even that
that

908
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
that
 

909
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,150
that
alleviates the need for counterforce

910
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
alleviates the need for counterforce
 

911
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,069
alleviates the need for counterforce
involving mass violence and armies and

912
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
involving mass violence and armies and
 

913
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,509
involving mass violence and armies and
navies and those things

914
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:47,519
navies and those things
 

915
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,949
navies and those things
uh i think that's an open discussion

916
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:48,959
uh i think that's an open discussion
 

917
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,350
uh i think that's an open discussion
we're still having

918
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
we're still having
 

919
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,990
we're still having
it's good to think through that because

920
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,000
it's good to think through that because
 

921
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,870
it's good to think through that because
um

922
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
um
 

923
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,269
um
having us like a united nations there's

924
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
having us like a united nations there's
 

925
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,350
having us like a united nations there's
usually a centralized control so there's

926
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
usually a centralized control so there's
 

927
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,030
usually a centralized control so there's
humans at the top

928
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
humans at the top
 

929
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,470
humans at the top
there's committees and uh usually like

930
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
there's committees and uh usually like
 

931
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,990
there's committees and uh usually like
leaders emerge a singular figures that

932
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
leaders emerge a singular figures that
 

933
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,790
leaders emerge a singular figures that
then can become corrupted by power and

934
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
then can become corrupted by power and
 

935
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,389
then can become corrupted by power and
it's just a really important

936
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:12,399
it's just a really important
 

937
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,910
it's just a really important
it feels like a really important thought

938
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
it feels like a really important thought
 

939
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,150
it feels like a really important thought
experiment and something to

940
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
experiment and something to
 

941
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,550
experiment and something to
really rigorously think through how can

942
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
really rigorously think through how can
 

943
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,509
really rigorously think through how can
you construct

944
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
you construct
 

945
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,870
you construct
systems of government that

946
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:22,880
systems of government that
 

947
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,150
systems of government that
are stable enough to push us towards

948
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
are stable enough to push us towards
 

949
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,150
are stable enough to push us towards
less and less war

950
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
less and less war
 

951
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,870
less and less war
and less and less unstable

952
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
and less and less unstable
 

953
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,030
and less and less unstable
and another tough war which is unfair

954
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
and another tough war which is unfair
 

955
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,790
and another tough war which is unfair
of application of force you know it's

956
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
of application of force you know it's
 

957
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,990
of application of force you know it's
that's really at the core of the

958
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
that's really at the core of the
 

959
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,590
that's really at the core of the
question that we're trying to figure out

960
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
question that we're trying to figure out
 

961
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,550
question that we're trying to figure out
as humans

962
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
as humans
 

963
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,069
as humans
as our weapons get better and better and

964
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
as our weapons get better and better and
 

965
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,230
as our weapons get better and better and
better destroying ourselves

966
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
better destroying ourselves
 

967
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,829
better destroying ourselves
it feels like it's important to think

968
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
it feels like it's important to think
 

969
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,870
it feels like it's important to think
about how we minimize

970
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
about how we minimize
 

971
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,509
about how we minimize
the over application or unfair

972
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
the over application or unfair
 

973
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,670
the over application or unfair
application of force

974
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
application of force
 

975
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,949
application of force
there's other elements that come into

976
00:16:58,949 --> 00:16:58,959
there's other elements that come into
 

977
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,310
there's other elements that come into
play too you and i are discussing this

978
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
play too you and i are discussing this
 

979
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,310
play too you and i are discussing this
at the very high intellectual level of

980
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
at the very high intellectual level of
 

981
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,150
at the very high intellectual level of
things but there is also a tail wagging

982
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:04,160
things but there is also a tail wagging
 

983
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,829
things but there is also a tail wagging
the dog element to this so think of a

984
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
the dog element to this so think of a
 

985
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,789
the dog element to this so think of a
society of

986
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
society of
 

987
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,990
society of
warriors a tribal society from a long

988
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
warriors a tribal society from a long
 

989
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,510
warriors a tribal society from a long
time ago

990
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:11,520
time ago
 

991
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,510

00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
and so it is the society oftentimes
 

1153
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,390
and so it is the society oftentimes
going to war and i make a distinction

1154
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
going to war and i make a distinction
 

1155
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:02,950
going to war and i make a distinction
between

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
between
 

1157
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,230
between
those warriors and the entities either

those warriors and the entities either
 

1159
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,510
those warriors and the entities either
in the system that they're part of the

in the system that they're part of the
 

1161
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,270
in the system that they're part of the
military or the people

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
military or the people
 

1163
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,029
military or the people
that control the military at the highest

1164
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:11,039
that control the military at the highest
 

1165
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,270
that control the military at the highest
political levels i feel um

1166
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,280
political levels i feel um
 

1167
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,070
political levels i feel um
a lot less moral attachment to them and

1168
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
a lot less moral attachment to them and
 

1169
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,470
a lot less moral attachment to them and
i have

1170
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:16,480
i have
 

1171
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,870
i have
i'm much harsher about how i feel about

1172
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:18,880
i'm much harsher about how i feel about
 

1173
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,990
i'm much harsher about how i feel about
them i do not

1174
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
them i do not
 

1175
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,149
them i do not
consider the military itself to be

1176
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
consider the military itself to be
 

1177
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,149
consider the military itself to be
heroic and i do not consider the

1178
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159
heroic and i do not consider the
 

1179
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,630
heroic and i do not consider the
military-industrial complex to be heroic

1180
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
military-industrial complex to be heroic
 

1181
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,470
military-industrial complex to be heroic
i do think that is a tail wagging the

1182
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
i do think that is a tail wagging the
 

1183
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,669
i do think that is a tail wagging the
dog situation

1184
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
dog situation
 

1185
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,310
dog situation
i do think that draws us into looking at

1186
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
i do think that draws us into looking at
 

1187
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,430
i do think that draws us into looking at
um

1188
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,440
um
 

1189
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,669
um
military endeavors as a solution to the

1190
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
military endeavors as a solution to the
 

1191
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,549
military endeavors as a solution to the
problem

1192
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
problem
 

1193
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,310
problem
much more quickly than we otherwise

1194
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
much more quickly than we otherwise
 

1195
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,390
much more quickly than we otherwise
might and to be honest to tie it all

1196
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
might and to be honest to tie it all
 

1197
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,830
might and to be honest to tie it all
together i actually look at

1198
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
together i actually look at
 

1199
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,630
together i actually look at
the victims of this as the soldiers we

1200
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:46,640
the victims of this as the soldiers we
 

1201
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,990
the victims of this as the soldiers we
were talking about i mean if you

1202
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
were talking about i mean if you
 

1203
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,270
were talking about i mean if you
if you set a fire to send firemen

1204
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280
if you set a fire to send firemen
 

1205
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,110
if you set a fire to send firemen
into to fight um then i feel bad for the

1206
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
into to fight um then i feel bad for the
 

1207
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,110
into to fight um then i feel bad for the
firemen i feel like you've abused the

1208
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
firemen i feel like you've abused the
 

1209
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,710
firemen i feel like you've abused the
trust that you give those people right

1210
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
trust that you give those people right
 

1211
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,430
trust that you give those people right
so when

1212
00:20:59,430 --> 00:20:59,440
so when
 

1213
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,510
so when
when people talk about war i always

1214
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:01,520
when people talk about war i always
 

1215
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,950
when people talk about war i always
think that the people that we have to

1216
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:02,960
think that the people that we have to
 

1217
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,310
think that the people that we have to
make sure that a war is really necessary

1218
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:06,320
make sure that a war is really necessary
 

1219
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,070
make sure that a war is really necessary
uh in order to protect are the people

1220
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,080
uh in order to protect are the people
 

1221
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,270
uh in order to protect are the people
that you're going to send over there to

1222
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
that you're going to send over there to
 

1223
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,750
that you're going to send over there to
fight that

1224
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:09,760
fight that
 

1225
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,149
fight that
the greatest victims in our society of

1226
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
the greatest victims in our society of
 

1227
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,070
the greatest victims in our society of
war are often the warriors

1228
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
war are often the warriors
 

1229
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,950
war are often the warriors
so i in my mind um you know when we see

1230
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:16,960
so i in my mind um you know when we see
 

1231
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,549
so i in my mind um you know when we see
these people coming home from places

1232
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:18,559
these people coming home from places
 

1233
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,390
these people coming home from places
like iraq a place where

1234
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
like iraq a place where
 

1235
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,909
like iraq a place where
i would have made the argument and did

1236
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:21,919
i would have made the argument and did
 

1237
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,909
i would have made the argument and did
at the time that we didn't belong

1238
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:23,919
at the time that we didn't belong
 

1239
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,470
at the time that we didn't belong
to me those people are victims and i

1240
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,480
to me those people are victims and i
 

1241
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,510
to me those people are victims and i
know they don't like to think about

1242
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:27,520
know they don't like to think about
 

1243
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,630
know they don't like to think about
themselves that way because it runs

1244
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
themselves that way because it runs
 

1245
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,990
themselves that way because it runs
totally counter to the

1246
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
totally counter to the
 

1247
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,190
totally counter to the
to the ethos but if you're sending

1248
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
to the ethos but if you're sending
 

1249
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,669
to the ethos but if you're sending
people to protect this country's shores

1250
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
people to protect this country's shores
 

1251
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,070
people to protect this country's shores
those are heroes if you're sending

1252
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
those are heroes if you're sending
 

1253
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,190
those are heroes if you're sending
people to go

1254
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
people to go
 

1255
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,549
people to go
do something that they otherwise

1256
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
do something that they otherwise
 

1257
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,230
do something that they otherwise
probably don't need to do but they're

1258
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
probably don't need to do but they're
 

1259
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,909
probably don't need to do but they're
there for political reasons or anything

1260
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
there for political reasons or anything
 

1261
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,350
there for political reasons or anything
else you want to put in that's not

1262
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:45,360
else you want to put in that's not
 

1263
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,029
else you want to put in that's not
defense related well then you've made

1264
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
defense related well then you've made
 

1265
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,270
defense related well then you've made
victims of our heroes and so i

1266
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
victims of our heroes and so i
 

1267
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,390
victims of our heroes and so i
i feel like we do a lot of talk

1268
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
i feel like we do a lot of talk
 

1269
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,230
i feel like we do a lot of talk
about our troops and our soldiers and

1270
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
about our troops and our soldiers and
 

1271
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,990
about our troops and our soldiers and
stuff but we don't treat them

1272
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
stuff but we don't treat them
 

1273
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,789
stuff but we don't treat them
as valuable as we as as the rhetoric

1274
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
as valuable as we as as the rhetoric
 

1275
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,950
as valuable as we as as the rhetoric
makes them sound otherwise we would be

1276
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:00,960
makes them sound otherwise we would be
 

1277
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,590
makes them sound otherwise we would be
more um we would be much more careful

1278
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:03,600
more um we would be much more careful
 

1279
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,950
more um we would be much more careful
about where we put them

1280
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:04,960
about where we put them
 

1281
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,870
about where we put them
if you're going to send my son and i

1282
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
if you're going to send my son and i
 

1283
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,990
if you're going to send my son and i
don't have a son i have daughters but if

1284
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,000

1285
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,149
don't have a son i have daughters but if
you're going to send my son

1286
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,159
you're going to send my son
 

1287
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,190
you're going to send my son
into harm's way i'm going to demand

1288
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
into harm's way i'm going to demand
 

1289
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,029
into harm's way i'm going to demand
that you really need to be sending him

1290
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
that you really need to be sending him
 

1291
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,230
that you really need to be sending him
into harm's way and i'm going to be

1292
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:16,240
into harm's way and i'm going to be
 

1293
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,190
into harm's way and i'm going to be
angry at you

1294
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200
angry at you
 

1295
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,190
angry at you
if you put him into harm's way if he

1296
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
if you put him into harm's way if he
 

1297
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,190
if you put him into harm's way if he
doesn't if it doesn't warrant it

1298
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
doesn't if it doesn't warrant it
 

1299
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,029
doesn't if it doesn't warrant it
and so i have much more suspicion about

1300
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:23,039
and so i have much more suspicion about
 

1301
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,950
and so i have much more suspicion about
the system that sends these people into

1302
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:24,960
the system that sends these people into
 

1303
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,029
the system that sends these people into
these situations where they're required

1304
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
these situations where they're required
 

1305
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,190
these situations where they're required
to be heroic than i do the people on the

1306
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
to be heroic than i do the people on the
 

1307
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,630
to be heroic than i do the people on the
ground that i look at as

1308
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
ground that i look at as
 

1309
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,789

the various systems of
 

3083
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,670
the various systems of
government whether it's judicial whether

3084
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:23,680
government whether it's judicial whether
 

3085
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,109
government whether it's judicial whether
it's uh

3086
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:25,119
it's uh
 

3087
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,950
it's uh
uh i mean basically the assumption is

3088
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:28,960
uh i mean basically the assumption is
 

3089
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,670
uh i mean basically the assumption is
that the system works well enough for

3090
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680
that the system works well enough for
 

3091
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:31,990
that the system works well enough for
you to

3092
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:32,000
you to
 

3093
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,630
you to
be able to uh elect the popular choice

3094
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:36,640
be able to uh elect the popular choice
 

3095
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,549
be able to uh elect the popular choice
okay so there's a couple of things that

3096
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:38,559
okay so there's a couple of things that
 

3097
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,790
okay so there's a couple of things that
come to mind on that

3098
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:40,800
come to mind on that
 

3099
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,910
come to mind on that
the first one has to do with the idea of

3100
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:43,920
the first one has to do with the idea of
 

3101
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,790
the first one has to do with the idea of
oligarchs

3102
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:44,800
oligarchs
 

3103
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,750
oligarchs
um there's a belief in political science

3104
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:47,760
um there's a belief in political science
 

3105
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,069
um there's a belief in political science
uh

3106
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:48,079
uh
 

3107
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,230
uh
you know it's not the overall belief but

3108
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:50,240
you know it's not the overall belief but
 

3109
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,230
you know it's not the overall belief but
but that every society is sort of an

3110
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:52,240
but that every society is sort of an
 

3111
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,470
but that every society is sort of an
oligarchy really if you break it down

3112
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
oligarchy really if you break it down
 

3113
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,710
oligarchy really if you break it down
right so what you're talking about are

3114
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:56,720
right so what you're talking about are
 

3115
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,190
right so what you're talking about are
some of the people who would form

3116
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
some of the people who would form
 

3117
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,549
some of the people who would form
an oligarchic class in in in russia

3118
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
an oligarchic class in in in russia
 

3119
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,630
an oligarchic class in in in russia
and that putin is the guy who can

3120
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:04,640
and that putin is the guy who can
 

3121
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,670
and that putin is the guy who can
harness

3122
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:05,680
harness
 

3123
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,230
harness
uh the power of the state to keep those

3124
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,240
uh the power of the state to keep those
 

3125
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,829
uh the power of the state to keep those
people in check

3126
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:09,839
people in check
 

3127
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,910
people in check
the problem of course in a system like

3128
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:11,920
the problem of course in a system like
 

3129
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,349
the problem of course in a system like
that a strong man system

3130
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:13,359
that a strong man system
 

3131
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,030
that a strong man system
right where you have somebody who can

3132
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:15,040
right where you have somebody who can
 

3133
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,030
right where you have somebody who can
who can hold the reins and steer the

3134
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
who can hold the reins and steer the
 

3135
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,069
who can hold the reins and steer the
ship when the ship is

3136
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
ship when the ship is
 

3137
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,670
ship when the ship is
violently in a storm is the succession

3138
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:21,680
violently in a storm is the succession
 

3139
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,109
violently in a storm is the succession
so if you're not creating a system

3140
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
so if you're not creating a system
 

3141
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,710
so if you're not creating a system
that can operate without you then that

3142
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:28,720
that can operate without you then that
 

3143
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,030
that can operate without you then that
terrible instability and that terrible

3144
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:31,040
terrible instability and that terrible
 

3145
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,150
terrible instability and that terrible
future that you

3146
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:32,160
future that you
 

3147
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,349
future that you
that you justified the strong man for is

3148
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:35,359
that you justified the strong man for is
 

3149
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,390
that you justified the strong man for is
just awaiting

3150
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
just awaiting
 

3151
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,950
just awaiting
your future right i mean unless unless

3152
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:38,960
your future right i mean unless unless
 

3153
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,470
your future right i mean unless unless
he's actively building

3154
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:40,480
he's actively building
 

3155
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,030
he's actively building
the system that will outlive him and

3156
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:43,040
the system that will outlive him and
 

3157
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,549
the system that will outlive him and
allow successors

3158
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:44,559
allow successors
 

3159
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,030
allow successors
to do what he's doing then then what

3160
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:47,040
to do what he's doing then then what
 

3161
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,950
to do what he's doing then then what
you've done here is create a temporary i

3162
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:48,960
you've done here is create a temporary i
 

3163
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,950
you've done here is create a temporary i
would think a temporary stability here

3164
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:50,960
would think a temporary stability here
 

3165
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:51,510
would think a temporary stability here
because

3166
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,520
because
 

3167
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,870
because
it's the same problem you have in a

3168
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:52,880
it's the same problem you have in a
 

3169
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,630
it's the same problem you have in a
monarchy right um where

3170
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,640
monarchy right um where
 

3171
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,309
monarchy right um where
where you have this one king and he's

3172
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
where you have this one king and he's
 

3173
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,910
where you have this one king and he's
particularly good or you think he's

3174
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:57,920
particularly good or you think he's
 

3175
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,030
particularly good or you think he's
particularly good

3176
00:53:59,030 --> 00:53:59,040
particularly good
 

3177
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,710
particularly good
but he's going to turn that job over to

3178
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:00,720
but he's going to turn that job over to
 

3179
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,470
but he's going to turn that job over to
somebody else down the road

3180
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:02,480
somebody else down the road
 

3181
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,910
somebody else down the road
and the system doesn't guarantee because

3182
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920
and the system doesn't guarantee because
 

3183
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,150
and the system doesn't guarantee because
no one's really worked on and again you

3184
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:08,160
no one's really worked on and again you
 

3185
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,230
no one's really worked on and again you
would tell me if if putin is putting

3186
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:10,240
would tell me if if putin is putting
 

3187
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:10,950
would tell me if if putin is putting
into place

3188
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:10,960
into place
 

3189
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,309
into place
i know he's talked about it over the

3190
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:12,319
i know he's talked about it over the
 

3191
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,309
i know he's talked about it over the
years putting into place a system that

3192
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:14,319
years putting into place a system that
 

3193
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,589
years putting into place a system that
can outlive him

3194
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:15,599
can outlive him
 

3195
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,270
can outlive him
and that will create the stability that

3196
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:17,280
and that will create the stability that
 

3197
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,790
and that will create the stability that
the people in russia

3198
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:18,800
the people in russia
 

3199
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,750
the people in russia
like him for when he's gone because if

3200
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:21,760
like him for when he's gone because if
 

3201
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,270
like him for when he's gone because if
the oligarchs just take over

3202
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,280
the oligarchs just take over
 

3203
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,750
the oligarchs just take over
afterwards then one might argue well we

3204
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:25,760
afterwards then one might argue well we
 

3205
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,990
afterwards then one might argue well we
had 20 good years you know of stability

3206
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,000
had 20 good years you know of stability
 

3207
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,549
had 20 good years you know of stability
but i mean i would say that if we're

3208
00:54:30,549 --> 00:54:30,559
but i mean i would say that if we're
 

3209
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,309
but i mean i would say that if we're
talking about a ship of state here

3210
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,319
talking about a ship of state here
 

3211
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:34,150
talking about a ship of state here
the guy steering the ship maybe if you

3212
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:34,160
the guy steering the ship maybe if you
 

3213
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,270
the guy steering the ship maybe if you
want to look at it from the russian

3214
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:35,280
want to look at it from the russian
 

3215
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,270
want to look at it from the russian
point of view has done a great job maybe

3216
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:37,280
point of view has done a great job maybe
 

3217
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,510
point of view has done a great job maybe
just saying but the rocks are still out

3218
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,520
just saying but the rocks are still out
 

3219
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,109
just saying but the rocks are still out
there and he's not going to be at

3220
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:41,119
there and he's not going to be at
 

3221
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,270
there and he's not going to be at
the helm forever so one would think that

3222
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:43,280
the helm forever so one would think that
 

3223
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,589
the helm forever so one would think that
his job is to make sure that

3224
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:45,599
his job is to make sure that
 

3225
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,589
his job is to make sure that
there's going to be someone who can

3226
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:47,599
there's going to be someone who can
 

3227
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,270
there's going to be someone who can
continue to steer the ship for the

3228
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:49,280
continue to steer the ship for the
 

3229
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,190
continue to steer the ship for the
people of russia after he's gone

3230
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:51,200
people of russia after he's gone
 

3231
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,549
people of russia after he's gone
now let me ask because i'm curious

3232
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
now let me ask because i'm curious
 

3233
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,430
now let me ask because i'm curious
and and ignorant so uh is he doing that

3234
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:57,440
and and ignorant so uh is he doing that
 

3235
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,710
and and ignorant so uh is he doing that
do you think

3236
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:58,720
do you think
 

3237
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,549
do you think
is he setting it up so that when there

3238
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:00,559
is he setting it up so that when there
 

3239
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,069
is he setting it up so that when there
is no putin

3240
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:02,079
is no putin
 

3241
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,870
is no putin

3775
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,710
they look well let's look at it more
like a stock market and that you have

3776
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:11,720
like a stock market and that you have
 

3777
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,870
like a stock market and that you have
fluctuations

3778
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:12,880
fluctuations
 

3779
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,190
fluctuations
in the truthfulness or or believability

3780
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:15,200
in the truthfulness or or believability
 

3781
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:15,990
in the truthfulness or or believability
of the press

3782
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,000
of the press
 

3783
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,910
of the press
and there are periods where it was

3784
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:17,920
and there are periods where it was
 

3785
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,670
and there are periods where it was
higher than other periods

3786
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
higher than other periods
 

3787
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,190
higher than other periods
the funny thing about the so-called

3788
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,200
the funny thing about the so-called
 

3789
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,109
the funny thing about the so-called
click-bait era and i do think it's

3790
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:23,119
click-bait era and i do think it's
 

3791
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,069
click-bait era and i do think it's
terrible

3792
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:24,079
terrible
 

3793
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,430
terrible
but i mean it resembles earlier eras to

3794
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:27,440
but i mean it resembles earlier eras to
 

3795
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:27,750
but i mean it resembles earlier eras to
me

3796
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:27,760
me
 

3797
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,430
me
so i always compare it to when i was a

3798
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:29,440
so i always compare it to when i was a
 

3799
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,670
so i always compare it to when i was a
kid growing up when i thought journalism

3800
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:31,680
kid growing up when i thought journalism
 

3801
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,910
kid growing up when i thought journalism
was as good as it's ever gotten it was

3802
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:33,920
was as good as it's ever gotten it was
 

3803
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,029
was as good as it's ever gotten it was
never perfect

3804
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:35,039
never perfect
 

3805
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,230
never perfect
um but it's also something that you see

3806
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
um but it's also something that you see
 

3807
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,270
um but it's also something that you see
very rarely

3808
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,280
very rarely
 

3809
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,109
very rarely
in in other governments around the world

3810
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:41,119
in in other governments around the world
 

3811
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,710
in in other governments around the world
and there's a reason that journalists

3812
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:42,720
and there's a reason that journalists
 

3813
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,349
and there's a reason that journalists
are often

3814
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:43,359
are often
 

3815
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,589
are often
killed uh regularly in a lot of

3816
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:45,599
killed uh regularly in a lot of
 

3817
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:46,390
killed uh regularly in a lot of
countries

3818
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:46,400
countries
 

3819
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,069
countries
and it's because they report on things

3820
01:04:48,069 --> 01:04:48,079
and it's because they report on things
 

3821
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:49,349
and it's because they report on things
that the authorities do not want

3822
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:49,359
that the authorities do not want
 

3823
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:50,789
that the authorities do not want
reported on and i've always thought that

3824
01:04:50,789 --> 01:04:50,799
reported on and i've always thought that
 

3825
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,950
reported on and i've always thought that
that was what journalism should do

3826
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:52,960
that was what journalism should do
 

3827
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,589
that was what journalism should do
but it's got to be truthful otherwise

3828
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:55,599
but it's got to be truthful otherwise
 

3829
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,589
but it's got to be truthful otherwise
it's just a different kind of propaganda

3830
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:57,599
it's just a different kind of propaganda
 

3831
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,870
it's just a different kind of propaganda
right

and i've also read arguments that say

3888
01:05:59,029 --> 01:05:59,039
and i've also read arguments that say
 

3889
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,430
and i've also read arguments that say
that

3890
01:05:59,430 --> 01:05:59,440
that
 

3891
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,870
that
he was quite a progressive for the time

3892
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:02,880
he was quite a progressive for the time
 

3893
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,390
he was quite a progressive for the time
so where do you put him is he a

3894
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
so where do you put him is he a
 

3895
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,870
so where do you put him is he a
progressive or is he an evil destroyer

3896
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:06,880
progressive or is he an evil destroyer
 

3897
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,190
progressive or is he an evil destroyer
of

3898
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:07,200
of
 

3899
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,589
of
humans as i often say i'm not a

01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:09,599
humans as i often say i'm not a
 

3901
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,510
humans as i often say i'm not a
historian which is why

3902
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:11,520
historian which is why
 

3903
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,230
historian which is why
what i try to bring to the hardcore

3904
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,240
what i try to bring to the hardcore
 

3905
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,069
what i try to bring to the hardcore
history podcasts

3906
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
history podcasts
 

3907
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,789
history podcasts
are these sub themes so each show has

3908
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:18,799
are these sub themes so each show has
 

3909
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:20,390
are these sub themes so each show has
and they're not i try to kind of soft

3910
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:20,400
and they're not i try to kind of soft
 

3911
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,069
and they're not i try to kind of soft
pedal them so they're not always like

3912
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:22,079
pedal them so they're not always like
 

3913
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,230
pedal them so they're not always like
really right in front of your face

3914
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240
really right in front of your face
 

3915
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,510
really right in front of your face
um in that episode the soft pedaling sub

3916
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:27,520
um in that episode the soft pedaling sub
 

3917
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,750
um in that episode the soft pedaling sub
theme had to do with what we uh referred

3918
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
theme had to do with what we uh referred
 

3919
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,230
theme had to do with what we uh referred
to as a historical arsonist

3920
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:32,240
to as a historical arsonist
 

3921
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,870
to as a historical arsonist
and it's because some historians have

3922
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:34,880
and it's because some historians have
 

3923
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,069
and it's because some historians have
taken the position

3924
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:36,079
taken the position
 

3925
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,069
taken the position
that sometimes and and most of this is

3926
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:38,079
that sometimes and and most of this is
 

3927
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,750
that sometimes and and most of this is
earlier so historians don't do this very

3928
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:39,760
earlier so historians don't do this very
 

3929
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,950
earlier so historians don't do this very
much anymore but these were the

3930
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:40,960
much anymore but these were the
 

3931
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,029
much anymore but these were the
wonderful questions i grew up with

3932
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:43,039
wonderful questions i grew up with
 

3933
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:45,510
wonderful questions i grew up with
that blend it's almost the intersection

3934
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:45,520
that blend it's almost the intersection
 

3935
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,990
that blend it's almost the intersection
between history and philosophy

3936
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,000
between history and philosophy
 

3937
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,109
between history and philosophy
and the idea was that sometimes

3938
01:06:51,109 --> 01:06:51,119
and the idea was that sometimes
 

3939
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,309
and the idea was that sometimes
the world has become so overwhelmed with

3940
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
the world has become so overwhelmed with
 

3941
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:55,349
the world has become so overwhelmed with
bureaucracy

3942
01:06:55,349 --> 01:06:55,359
bureaucracy
 

3943
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,710
bureaucracy
or corruption or just stagnation

3944
01:06:58,710 --> 01:06:58,720
or corruption or just stagnation
 

3945
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,190
or corruption or just stagnation
that somebody has to come in or some

3946
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:01,200
that somebody has to come in or some
 

3947
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,349
that somebody has to come in or some
group of people or some force has to

3948
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:03,359
group of people or some force has to
 

3949
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:05,029
group of people or some force has to
come in and do the equivalent of a

3950
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:05,039
come in and do the equivalent of a
 

3951
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,069
come in and do the equivalent of a
forest fire

3952
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
forest fire
 

3953
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,549
forest fire
to clear out all the dead wood so that

3954
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:08,559
to clear out all the dead wood so that
 

3955
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,870
to clear out all the dead wood so that
the forest itself can be rejuvenated

3956
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:10,880
the forest itself can be rejuvenated
 

3957
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,029
the forest itself can be rejuvenated
and and society can then move forward

3958
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:13,039
and and society can then move forward
 

3959
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,390
and and society can then move forward
and there's a lot of these periods where

3960
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
and there's a lot of these periods where
 

3961
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,510
and there's a lot of these periods where
the historians

3962
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:15,520
the historians
 

3963
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,230
the historians
of the past will portray these figures

3964
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
of the past will portray these figures
 

3965
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,910
of the past will portray these figures
who come in and do horrific

3966
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:19,920
who come in and do horrific
 

3967
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,270
who come in and do horrific
things as creating an almost service

3968
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:23,280
things as creating an almost service
 

3969
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,309
things as creating an almost service
for for mankind right uh creating the

3970
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:26,319
for for mankind right uh creating the
 

3971
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:27,349
for for mankind right uh creating the
foundations

3972
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
foundations
 

3973
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,190
foundations
for a new world that will be better than

3974
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:29,200
for a new world that will be better than
 

3975
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,789
for a new world that will be better than
the old one and it's a recurring theme

3976
01:07:30,789 --> 01:07:30,799
the old one and it's a recurring theme
 

3977
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,870
the old one and it's a recurring theme
and so this was the sub theme

3978
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:32,880
and so this was the sub theme
 

3979
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,390
and so this was the sub theme
of the of the cons podcast because

3980
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:34,400

historical arsonist element um and but
this gets to how the khan has been

3990
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:42,720
this gets to how the khan has been
 

3991
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,069
this gets to how the khan has been
portrayed right

3992
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:44,079
portrayed right
 

3993
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,069
portrayed right
if you want to say oh yes he cleared out

3994
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
if you want to say oh yes he cleared out
 

3995
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,750
if you want to say oh yes he cleared out
the dead wood and made for a for

3996
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:47,760
the dead wood and made for a for
 

3997
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,510
the dead wood and made for a for
well then it's a positive thing if you

3998
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:49,520
well then it's a positive thing if you
 

3999
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,910
well then it's a positive thing if you
say my family was in the forest fire

4000
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:51,920
say my family was in the forest fire
 

4001
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,430
say my family was in the forest fire
that he set it you're not going to see

4002
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
that he set it you're not going to see
 

4003
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,470
that he set it you're not going to see
it that way

4004
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:54,480
it that way
 

4005
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,910
it that way
um much of what genghis khan is credited

4006
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
um much of what genghis khan is credited
 

4007
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,670
um much of what genghis khan is credited
with on the upside right

4008
01:07:59,670 --> 01:07:59,680
with on the upside right
 

4009
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,710
with on the upside right
so things like religious toleration and

4010
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:02,720
so things like religious toleration and
 

4011
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,309
so things like religious toleration and
you'll say well he was uh

4012
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,319
you'll say well he was uh
 

4013
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,309
you'll say well he was uh
religiously the mongols were religious

4014
01:08:06,309 --> 01:08:06,319
religiously the mongols were religious
 

4015
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,069
religiously the mongols were religious
uh religiously tolerant

4016
01:08:08,069 --> 01:08:08,079
uh religiously tolerant
 

4017
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,589
uh religiously tolerant
and so this makes them almost like a

4018
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:09,599
and so this makes them almost like a
 

4019
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,349
and so this makes them almost like a
liberal reformer kind of thing

4020
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:11,359
liberal reformer kind of thing
 

4021
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,349
liberal reformer kind of thing
but this needs to be seen within the

4022
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:13,359
but this needs to be seen within the
 

4023
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,630
but this needs to be seen within the
context of of their empire which was

4024
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,640
context of of their empire which was
 

4025
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,470
context of of their empire which was
uh very much like the roman viewpoint

4026
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:18,480
uh very much like the roman viewpoint
 

4027
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,910
uh very much like the roman viewpoint
which is the romans didn't care

4028
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:19,920
which is the romans didn't care
 

4029
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,669
which is the romans didn't care
a lot of time what your local people

4030
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
a lot of time what your local people
 

4031
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,149
a lot of time what your local people
worshipped they wanted stability

4032
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:24,159
worshipped they wanted stability
 

4033
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:25,990
worshipped they wanted stability
and if that kept stability and kept you

4034
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,000
and if that kept stability and kept you
 

4035
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,510
and if that kept stability and kept you
paying taxes and didn't require the

4036
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:27,520
paying taxes and didn't require the
 

4037
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,349
paying taxes and didn't require the
legionaries to come in and and

4038
01:08:29,349 --> 01:08:29,359
legionaries to come in and and
 

4039
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,669
legionaries to come in and and
then they didn't care right and and the

4040
01:08:31,669 --> 01:08:31,679
then they didn't care right and and the
 

4041
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,349
then they didn't care right and and the
cons were the same way like they don't

4042
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:33,359
cons were the same way like they don't
 

4043
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,870
cons were the same way like they don't
care what you're practicing as long as

4044
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:34,880
care what you're practicing as long as
 

4045
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,470
care what you're practicing as long as

well then you have to draw a distinction

4980
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:15,920
well then you have to draw a distinction
 

4981
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,669
well then you have to draw a distinction
between general

4982
01:24:17,669 --> 01:24:17,679
between general
 

4983
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,990

01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,590
pretty common in the era
and something that was a rabid level of

01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:26,000
show a
 

4993
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,270
show a
rabid level of anti-semitism until after

4994
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:29,280
rabid level of anti-semitism until after
 

4995
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,709
rabid level of anti-semitism until after
or at the very end of the first world

so if this is a defining part of this

5000
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:33,360
so if this is a defining part of this
 

5001
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,709
so if this is a defining part of this
person's character

5002
01:24:34,709 --> 01:24:34,719
person's character
 

5003
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:37,030
person's character
and and much of what we consider to be

01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:37,040
and and much of what we consider to be
 

5005
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,229
and and much of what we consider to be
his his evil

5006
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:38,239
his his evil
 

5007
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,950
his his evil

01:41:28,629 --> 01:41:28,639
it's beyond my understanding
 

5977
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:31,109
it's beyond my understanding
of specific german history to talk about

5978
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:31,119
of specific german history to talk about
 

5979
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,629
of specific german history to talk about
it intelligently

5980
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:32,639
it intelligently
 

5981
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,390
it intelligently
but i do think that had the french

5982
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:34,400
but i do think that had the french
 

5983
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,390
but i do think that had the french
responded militarily to hitler's

5984
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:36,400
responded militarily to hitler's
 

5985
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,950
responded militarily to hitler's
initial moves into that area that he

5986
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:38,960
initial moves into that area that he
 

5987
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,390
initial moves into that area that he
would have been thwarted and

5988
01:41:40,390 --> 01:41:40,400
would have been thwarted and
 

5989
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,310
would have been thwarted and
i think he himself believed if i'm

5990
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:42,320
i think he himself believed if i'm
 

5991
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,910
i think he himself believed if i'm
remembering my reading

5992
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:43,920
remembering my reading
 

5993
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,590
remembering my reading
um that this would have led to his

5994
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:45,600
um that this would have led to his
 

5995
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,470
um that this would have led to his
downfall so the potential see i i

5996
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:48,480
downfall so the potential see i i
 

5997
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:49,910
downfall so the potential see i i
what i don't like about this is that it

5998
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:49,920
what i don't like about this is that it
 

5999
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:52,550
what i don't like about this is that it
almost legitimizes military intervention

6000
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:52,560
almost legitimizes military intervention
 

6001
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,870
almost legitimizes military intervention
at a very early stage to prevent worse

6002
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:54,880
at a very early stage to prevent worse
 

6003
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,470
at a very early stage to prevent worse
things from happening

6004
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:56,480
things from happening
 

6005
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,550
things from happening
but it might be a pretty clear-cut case

6006
01:41:58,550 --> 01:41:58,560
but it might be a pretty clear-cut case
 

6007
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,390
but it might be a pretty clear-cut case
but but it should also be pointed out

6008
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:00,400
but but it should also be pointed out
 

6009
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,830
but but it should also be pointed out
that there was a lot of sympathy

6010
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:01,840
that there was a lot of sympathy
 

6011
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,750
that there was a lot of sympathy
on the part of the allies for the fact

6012
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:03,760
on the part of the allies for the fact
 

6013
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,109
on the part of the allies for the fact
that you know the germans

6014
01:42:05,109 --> 01:42:05,119
that you know the germans
 

6015
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,790
that you know the germans
probably should have germany back and

6016
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:06,800
probably should have germany back and
 

6017
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,790
probably should have germany back and
this is traditional german land

6018
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:08,800
this is traditional german land
 

6019
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,870
this is traditional german land
i mean they were trying in a funny way

6020
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:10,880
i mean they were trying in a funny way
 

6021
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,629
i mean they were trying in a funny way
it's almost like

6022
01:42:12,629 --> 01:42:12,639
it's almost like
 

6023
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,030
it's almost like
the love and the sense of justice on the

the love and the sense of justice on the
 

6025
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,990
the love and the sense of justice on the
allies part

6026
01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:16,000
allies part
 

6027
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,629
allies part
may have actually stayed their hand in a

6028
01:42:18,629 --> 01:42:18,639
may have actually stayed their hand in a
 

6029
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:19,350
may have actually stayed their hand in a
way

6030
01:42:19,350 --> 01:42:19,360
way
 

6031
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,189
way
that would have prevented much much much

6032
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:21,199
that would have prevented much much much
 

6033
01:42:21,199 --> 01:42:22,950
that would have prevented much much much
worse things later but

6034
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:22,960
worse things later but
 

6035
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,870
worse things later but
if the times were such that the message

6036
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:26,880
if the times were such that the message
 

6037
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,030
if the times were such that the message
of a hitler resonated then simply

6038
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:29,040
of a hitler resonated then simply
 

6039
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,950
of a hitler resonated then simply
removing hitler from the equation would

6040
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:30,960
removing hitler from the equation would
 

6041
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,030
removing hitler from the equation would
not have removed the context of the

6042
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:33,040
not have removed the context of the
 

6043
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,149
not have removed the context of the
times

6044
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:34,159
times
 

6045
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,790
times
and that means one of two things either

6046
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:36,800
and that means one of two things either
 

6047
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,950
and that means one of two things either
you could have had another one

6048
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:38,960
you could have had another one
 

6049
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,189
you could have had another one
or you could have ended up in a

6050
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:41,199
or you could have ended up in a
 

6051
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:41,990
or you could have ended up in a
situation

6052
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,000
situation
 

6053
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,870
situation
equally bad in a different direction i

6054
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:44,880
equally bad in a different direction i
 

6055
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,550
equally bad in a different direction i
don't know what that means because it's

6056
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:46,560
don't know what that means because it's
 

6057
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:47,669
don't know what that means because it's
hard to imagine

6058
01:42:47,669 --> 01:42:47,679
hard to imagine
 

6059
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:49,430
hard to imagine
anything could be worse than what

6060
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:49,440
anything could be worse than what
 

6061
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,790
anything could be worse than what
actually occurred

6062
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:50,800
actually occurred
 

6063
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:53,189
actually occurred
but history's funny that way and that

6064
01:42:53,189 --> 01:42:53,199
but history's funny that way and that
 

6065
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:54,149
but history's funny that way and that
hitler is always

6066
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:54,159
hitler is always
 

6067
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,750
hitler is always
everyone's favorite example of the

6068
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:55,760
everyone's favorite example of the
 

6069
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,510
everyone's favorite example of the
difference between the great man theory

6070
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:57,520
difference between the great man theory
 

6071
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:58,310
difference between the great man theory
of history

6072
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:58,320
of history
 

6073
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,149
of history
and the trends and forces theories of

6074
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:00,159
and the trends and forces theories of
 

6075
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:03,030
and the trends and forces theories of
history right the times made a hitler

6076
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:03,040
history right the times made a hitler
 

6077
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:03,669
history right the times made a hitler
possible

6078
01:43:03,669 --> 01:43:03,679
possible
 

6079
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,629
possible
and maybe even desirable to some if you

6080
01:43:06,629 --> 01:43:06,639
and maybe even desirable to some if you
 

6081
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,629
and maybe even desirable to some if you
took him out of the equation

6082
01:43:08,629 --> 01:43:08,639
took him out of the equation
 

6083
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:10,790
took him out of the equation
those trends and forces are still in

6084
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:10,800
those trends and forces are still in
 

6085
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,669
those trends and forces are still in
place right so what does that mean

6086
01:43:13,669 --> 01:43:13,679
place right so what does that mean
 

6087
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:15,590
place right so what does that mean
if you take him out and the door is

6088
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:15,600
if you take him out and the door is
 

6089
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,430
if you take him out and the door is
still open does somebody else walk

6090
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:17,440
still open does somebody else walk
 

6091
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,950
still open does somebody else walk
through it

6092
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:18,960
through it
 

6093
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:24,310
through it
yeah it's mathematically speaking the uh

6094
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,320
yeah it's mathematically speaking the uh
 

6095
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,229
yeah it's mathematically speaking the uh
the probability of charismatic leaders

6096
01:43:26,229 --> 01:43:26,239
the probability of charismatic leaders
 

6097
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,669
the probability of charismatic leaders
emerge

6098
01:43:27,669 --> 01:43:27,679
emerge
 

6099
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,709
emerge
i i'm so torn on that i i'm uh

6100
01:43:30,709 --> 01:43:30,719
i i'm so torn on that i i'm uh
 

6101
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:33,030
i i'm so torn on that i i'm uh
uh at this point here's another way to

6102
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:33,040
uh at this point here's another way to
 

6103
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:33,750
uh at this point here's another way to
look at it

6104
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:33,760
look at it
 

6105
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,109
look at it
the institutional um stability

6106
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:37,119
the institutional um stability
 

6107
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:39,350
the institutional um stability
of germany in that time period was not

6108
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:39,360
of germany in that time period was not
 

6109
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,229
of germany in that time period was not
enough

6110
01:43:40,229 --> 01:43:40,239
enough
 

6111
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:42,149
enough
to push back and there are other periods

6112
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:42,159
to push back and there are other periods
 

6113
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:44,470
to push back and there are other periods
in german history i mean that hitler

6114
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:44,480
in german history i mean that hitler
 

6115
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:47,590
in german history i mean that hitler
arose in arizona in 1913

he doesn't get anywhere because

he doesn't get anywhere because
 

6119
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:50,950
he doesn't get anywhere because
germany's institutional uh

6120
01:43:50,950 --> 01:43:50,960
germany's institutional uh
 

6121
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:54,229
germany's institutional uh
power is enough to simply quash that

6122
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:54,239
power is enough to simply quash that
 

6123
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,550
power is enough to simply quash that
it's the fact that germany was unstable

6124
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:56,560
it's the fact that germany was unstable
 

6125
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:57,350
it's the fact that germany was unstable
anyway

6126
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:57,360
anyway
 

6127
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,669
anyway
that prevented a united front that would

6128
01:43:59,669 --> 01:43:59,679
that prevented a united front that would
 

6129
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:01,030
that prevented a united front that would
have kept radicalism

6130
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:01,040
have kept radicalism
 

6131
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:02,550
have kept radicalism
from getting out of hand does that make

6132
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:02,560
from getting out of hand does that make
 

6133
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,070
from getting out of hand does that make
sense yes absolutely

6134
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:04,080
sense yes absolutely
 

6135
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:07,189
sense yes absolutely
a tricky question on this just to

6136
01:44:07,189 --> 01:44:07,199
a tricky question on this just to
 

6137
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:09,590
a tricky question on this just to

the same time right and
 

6307
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,910
the same time right and
and as an outsider people that we can

all that sort of stuff is just weird
 

6315
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:28,070
all that sort of stuff is just weird
right a real outlier

01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:28,080
right a real outlier
 

6317
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:29,830

01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:50,480
you've talked
 

6459
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,070
you've talked
so the seeds of his own destruction

6460
01:49:52,070 --> 01:49:52,080
so the seeds of his own destruction
 

6461
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:55,270
so the seeds of his own destruction
right the tragic flaw

6462
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:55,280

 

6463
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:59,270

and my hope is this is a discussion i

6464
01:49:59,270 --> 01:49:59,280
and my hope is this is a discussion i
 

6465
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,229
and my hope is this is a discussion i
have with my dad

6466
01:50:00,229 --> 01:50:00,239
have with my dad
 

6467
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:04,310
have with my dad
as a physicist

6468
01:50:04,310 --> 01:50:04,320

 

6469
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:07,589

is that evil

6470
01:50:07,589 --> 01:50:07,599
is that evil
 

6471
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:10,149
is that evil
inherently contains with it that kind of

6472
01:50:10,149 --> 01:50:10,159
inherently contains with it that kind of
 

6473
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:12,310
inherently contains with it that kind of
incompetence

6474
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:12,320
incompetence
 

6475
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:16,149
incompetence
so my dad's

6476
01:50:16,149 --> 01:50:16,159
so my dad's
 

6477
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:17,669
so my dad's
discussions he's a physicist and

6478
01:50:17,669 --> 01:50:17,679
discussions he's a physicist and
 

6479
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:19,669
discussions he's a physicist and
engineer his belief

6480
01:50:19,669 --> 01:50:19,679
engineer his belief
 

6481
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:22,390
engineer his belief
is that at this time in our history the

6482
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:22,400
is that at this time in our history the
 

6483
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:23,990
is that at this time in our history the
reason we haven't had nuclear

6484
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:24,000
reason we haven't had nuclear
 

6485
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,750
reason we haven't had nuclear
like uh terrorist uh

6486
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:27,760
like uh terrorist uh
 

6487
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:29,830
like uh terrorist uh
blow up a nuclear weapon somewhere in

6488
01:50:29,830 --> 01:50:29,840
blow up a nuclear weapon somewhere in
 

6489
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,109
blow up a nuclear weapon somewhere in
the world

6490
01:50:31,109 --> 01:50:31,119
the world
 

6491
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:33,270
the world
is that the kind of people that would be

6492
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:33,280
is that the kind of people that would be
 

6493
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,629
is that the kind of people that would be
terrorists

6494
01:50:34,629 --> 01:50:34,639
terrorists
 

6495
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:38,390
terrorists
are simply not competent enough at their

6496
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:38,400
are simply not competent enough at their
 

6497
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:38,950
are simply not competent enough at their
job

6498
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
job
 

6499
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,830
job
of being destructive so like there's a

6500
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:41,840
of being destructive so like there's a
 

6501
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:42,390
of being destructive so like there's a
kind of

6502
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:42,400
kind of
 

6503
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:45,669
kind of
if you plot it the more evil you are

6504
01:50:45,669 --> 01:50:45,679
if you plot it the more evil you are
 

6505
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:50,149
if you plot it the more evil you are
the less able you are and by evil i mean

6506
01:50:50,149 --> 01:50:50,159
the less able you are and by evil i mean
 

6507
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:53,350
the less able you are and by evil i mean
purely just like we said uh if we were

6508
01:50:53,350 --> 01:50:53,360
purely just like we said uh if we were
 

6509
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:55,189
purely just like we said uh if we were
to consider the hatred of jewish people

6510
01:50:55,189 --> 01:50:55,199
to consider the hatred of jewish people
 

6511
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:56,149
to consider the hatred of jewish people
as evil

6512
01:50:56,149 --> 01:50:56,159
as evil
 

6513
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:57,669
as evil
because it's sort of detached from

6514
01:50:57,669 --> 01:50:57,679
because it's sort of detached from
 

6515
01:50:57,679 --> 01:50:59,669
because it's sort of detached from
reality it's like like

6516
01:50:59,669 --> 01:50:59,679
reality it's like like
 

6517
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:02,310
reality it's like like
just this pure hatred of something

6518
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:02,320
just this pure hatred of something
 

6519
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:03,109
just this pure hatred of something
that's

6520
01:51:03,109 --> 01:51:03,119
that's
 

6521
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:06,629
that's
grounded on things you know conspiracy

6522
01:51:06,629 --> 01:51:06,639
grounded on things you know conspiracy
 

6523
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:07,510
grounded on things you know conspiracy
theories

6524
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:07,520
theories
 

6525
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,390
theories
if that's evil then the more you sell

6526
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:10,400
if that's evil then the more you sell
 

6527
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,149
if that's evil then the more you sell
yourself the more you give in to these

6528
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:12,159
yourself the more you give in to these
 

6529
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:13,589
yourself the more you give in to these
conspiracy theories

6530
01:51:13,589 --> 01:51:13,599
conspiracy theories
 

6531
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:15,589
conspiracy theories
the less capable you are at actually

6532
01:51:15,589 --> 01:51:15,599
the less capable you are at actually
 

6533
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:16,709
the less capable you are at actually
engineering

6534
01:51:16,709 --> 01:51:16,719
engineering
 

6535
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,149
engineering
which is very difficult engineering

6536
01:51:18,149 --> 01:51:18,159
which is very difficult engineering
 

6537
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:19,669
which is very difficult engineering
nuclear weapons and effectively

6538
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:19,679
nuclear weapons and effectively
 

6539
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:20,709
nuclear weapons and effectively
deploying them

6540
01:51:20,709 --> 01:51:20,719
deploying them
 

6541
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:23,189
deploying them
so that's the that's a hopeful message

6542
01:51:23,189 --> 01:51:23,199
so that's the that's a hopeful message
 

6543
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:23,910
so that's the that's a hopeful message
that the

6544
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:23,920
that the
 

6545
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:27,430
that the
destructive people in this world are by

6546
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:27,440
destructive people in this world are by
 

6547
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:31,350
destructive people in this world are by
their world view incompetent in creating

6548
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:31,360
their world view incompetent in creating
 

6549
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:34,149
their world view incompetent in creating
the ultimate destruction i don't agree

6550
01:51:34,149 --> 01:51:34,159
the ultimate destruction i don't agree
 

6551
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:34,950
the ultimate destruction i don't agree
with that

6552
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:34,960
with that
 

6553
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,629
with that
oh boy i straight up don't agree with

6554
01:51:36,629 --> 01:51:36,639
oh boy i straight up don't agree with
 

6555
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:39,030
oh boy i straight up don't agree with
that so why are we still here

6556
01:51:39,030 --> 01:51:39,040
that so why are we still here
 

6557
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,589
that so why are we still here
why haven't we destroyed ourselves why

6558
01:51:41,589 --> 01:51:41,599
why haven't we destroyed ourselves why
 

6559
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:42,870
why haven't we destroyed ourselves why
haven't the terrorists

6560
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:42,880
haven't the terrorists
 

6561
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:46,149
haven't the terrorists
blow it's been many decades why haven't

6562
01:51:46,149 --> 01:51:46,159
blow it's been many decades why haven't
 

6563
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:49,030
blow it's been many decades why haven't
we destroyed ourselves to this point

6564
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:49,040
we destroyed ourselves to this point
 

6565
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:49,510
we destroyed ourselves to this point
well

6566
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:49,520
well
 

6567
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:51,669
well
it's when you say it's been many decades

6568
01:51:51,669 --> 01:51:51,679
it's when you say it's been many decades
 

6569
01:51:51,679 --> 01:51:53,109
it's when you say it's been many decades
many day that's like saying

6570
01:51:53,109 --> 01:51:53,119
many day that's like saying
 

6571
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:55,510
many day that's like saying
in the in the life of a 150 year old

6572
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:55,520
in the in the life of a 150 year old
 

6573
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:56,390
in the in the life of a 150 year old
person

6574
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:56,400
person
 

6575
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,950
person
uh we've been doing well for a year the

6576
01:51:58,950 --> 01:51:58,960
uh we've been doing well for a year the
 

6577
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,709
uh we've been doing well for a year the
problem the problem with all these kinds

6578
01:52:00,709 --> 01:52:00,719
problem the problem with all these kinds
 

6579
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,550
problem the problem with all these kinds
of equations and it was bertrand russell

6580
01:52:02,550 --> 01:52:02,560
of equations and it was bertrand russell
 

6581
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,629
of equations and it was bertrand russell
right the philosopher who said so

6582
01:52:04,629 --> 01:52:04,639
right the philosopher who said so
 

6583
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:06,870
right the philosopher who said so
uh he said it was it's unreasonable to

6584
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:06,880
uh he said it was it's unreasonable to
 

6585
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,070
uh he said it was it's unreasonable to
expect a man

6586
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:08,080
expect a man
 

6587
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:11,910
expect a man
to walk on a tightrope for 50 years

6588
01:52:11,910 --> 01:52:11,920
to walk on a tightrope for 50 years
 

6589
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,830
to walk on a tightrope for 50 years
i mean the the the problem is is that

6590
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:13,840
i mean the the the problem is is that
 

6591
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,510
i mean the the the problem is is that
this is a long game

6592
01:52:15,510 --> 01:52:15,520
this is a long game
 

6593
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:17,109
this is a long game
and let's remember that up until

6594
01:52:17,109 --> 01:52:17,119
and let's remember that up until
 

6595
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:18,790
and let's remember that up until
relatively recently what would you say

6596
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:18,800
relatively recently what would you say
 

6597
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:20,070
relatively recently what would you say
30 years ago

6598
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:20,080
30 years ago
 

6599
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,870
30 years ago
it the nuclear weapons in the world were

6600
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:22,880
it the nuclear weapons in the world were
 

6601
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,629
it the nuclear weapons in the world were
really tightly controlled that was one

6602
01:52:24,629 --> 01:52:24,639
really tightly controlled that was one
 

6603
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:25,910
really tightly controlled that was one
of the real dangers in the fall of the

6604
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:25,920
of the real dangers in the fall of the
 

6605
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:27,350
of the real dangers in the fall of the
soviet union remember the

6606
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:27,360
soviet union remember the
 

6607
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,270
soviet union remember the
the um the worry that that all of a

6608
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:29,280
the um the worry that that all of a
 

6609
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:30,550
the um the worry that that all of a
sudden you were going to have

6610
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:30,560
sudden you were going to have
 

6611
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,870
sudden you were going to have
bankrupt former soviet republics selling

6612
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:32,880
bankrupt former soviet republics selling
 

6613
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,390
bankrupt former soviet republics selling
nuclear weapons to terrorists and

6614
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:34,400
nuclear weapons to terrorists and
 

6615
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:35,030
nuclear weapons to terrorists and
whatnot

6616
01:52:35,030 --> 01:52:35,040
whatnot
 

6617
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,790
whatnot
i would suggest and and here's another

6618
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:36,800
i would suggest and and here's another
 

6619
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:38,470
i would suggest and and here's another
problem is that when we call these

6620
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:38,480
problem is that when we call these
 

6621
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,310
problem is that when we call these
terrorists evil it's easy for an

6622
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:40,320
terrorists evil it's easy for an

american for example
to say that osama bin laden is evil easy

6626

to say that osama bin laden is evil easy
 

6627
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,149
to say that osama bin laden is evil easy
for me to say that

6628
01:52:46,149 --> 01:52:46,159
for me to say that
 

6629
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:48,310
for me to say that
but one man's terrorist is another man's

6630
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:48,320
but one man's terrorist is another man's
 

6631
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,149
but one man's terrorist is another man's
freedom fighter as the saying goes and

6632
01:52:50,149 --> 01:52:50,159
freedom fighter as the saying goes and
 

6633
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:51,910
freedom fighter as the saying goes and
to other people he's not

6634
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:51,920
to other people he's not
 

6635
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:55,189
to other people he's not
what osama bin laden did and the people

6636
01:52:55,189 --> 01:52:55,199
what osama bin laden did and the people
 

6637
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,709
what osama bin laden did and the people
that worked with him

6638
01:52:56,709 --> 01:52:56,719
that worked with him
 

6639
01:52:56,719 --> 01:52:59,350
that worked with him
we would call evil genius the idea of

6640
01:52:59,350 --> 01:52:59,360
we would call evil genius the idea of
 

6641
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:01,589
we would call evil genius the idea of
hijacking planes and flying them into

6642
01:53:01,589 --> 01:53:01,599
hijacking planes and flying them into
 

6643

hijacking planes and flying them into
the buildings like that and that he

6644
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:02,880
the buildings like that and that he
 

6645
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,550
the buildings like that and that he
could pull that off

6646
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:04,560
could pull that off
 

6647
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:07,830
could pull that off
and that still boggles my mind i'm still

it's funny i'm still stunned by that and
 

6651
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,070
it's funny i'm still stunned by that and

place and the right time
 

6673
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:36,470
place and the right time
and over and over and over again

6674
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:36,480
and over and over and over again
 

6675
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,870
and over and over and over again
can bring down societies this is the

6676
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:38,880
can bring down societies this is the
 

6677
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,310
can bring down societies this is the
argument behind

6678
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:40,320
argument behind
 

6679
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,229
argument behind
the importance of the stability that a

6680
01:53:42,229 --> 01:53:42,239
the importance of the stability that a
 

6681
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,149
the importance of the stability that a
nation-state provides

6682
01:53:44,149 --> 01:53:44,159
nation-state provides
 

6683
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:46,870
nation-state provides
so when we went in and took out saddam

6684
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:46,880
so when we went in and took out saddam
 

6685
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,550
so when we went in and took out saddam
hussein

6686
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:48,560
hussein
 

6687
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,390
hussein
one of the great counter-arguments from

6688
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:50,400
one of the great counter-arguments from
 

6689
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,750
one of the great counter-arguments from
some of the people who said this is a

6690
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:51,760
some of the people who said this is a
 

6691
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,430
some of the people who said this is a
really stupid thing to do

6692
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:53,440
really stupid thing to do
 

6693
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,750
really stupid thing to do
is that saddam hussein was the greatest

6694
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:55,760
is that saddam hussein was the greatest
 

6695
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:58,149
is that saddam hussein was the greatest
anti-terror weapon in that region that

6696
01:53:58,149 --> 01:53:58,159
anti-terror weapon in that region that
 

6697
01:53:58,159 --> 01:53:59,750
anti-terror weapon in that region that
you could have because they were a

6698
01:53:59,750 --> 01:53:59,760
you could have because they were a
 

6699
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,270
you could have because they were a
threat to him

6700
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:01,280
threat to him
 

6701
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,430
threat to him
so he took that and he did it in a way

6702
01:54:03,430 --> 01:54:03,440
so he took that and he did it in a way
 

6703
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:05,109
so he took that and he did it in a way
that was much more repressive than we

6704
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:05,119
that was much more repressive than we
 

6705
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:06,390
that was much more repressive than we
would ever be

6706
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:06,400
would ever be
 

6707
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,470
would ever be
right and this is the old line about why

6708
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:08,480
right and this is the old line about why
 

6709
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,589
right and this is the old line about why
we supported

6710
01:54:09,589 --> 01:54:09,599
we supported
 

6711
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:12,390
we supported
um uh right-wing death squad countries

6712
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:12,400
um uh right-wing death squad countries
 

6713
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,550
um uh right-wing death squad countries
because they were taking out people

6714
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:14,560
because they were taking out people
 

6715
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,950
because they were taking out people
that would inevitably be a problem for

6716
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:16,960
that would inevitably be a problem for
 

6717
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,629
that would inevitably be a problem for
us if they didn't and they

6718
01:54:18,629 --> 01:54:18,639
us if they didn't and they
 

6719
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:20,070
us if they didn't and they
they were able to do it in a way we

6720
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:20,080
they were able to do it in a way we
 

6721
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:21,750
they were able to do it in a way we
would never be able to do supposedly

6722
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:21,760
would never be able to do supposedly
 

6723
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:21,990
would never be able to do supposedly
we're

6724
01:54:21,990 --> 01:54:22,000
we're
 

6725
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,589
we're
pretty good at that stuff you know just

6726
01:54:23,589 --> 01:54:23,599
pretty good at that stuff you know just
 

6727
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:25,189
pretty good at that stuff you know just
like the soviet union was behind the

6728
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:25,199
like the soviet union was behind the
 

6729
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:26,870
like the soviet union was behind the
scenes and underneath the radar

6730
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:26,880
scenes and underneath the radar
 

6731
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:29,830
scenes and underneath the radar
but the idea that the stability created

6732
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:29,840
but the idea that the stability created
 

6733
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,149
but the idea that the stability created
by

6734
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:30,159
by
 

6735
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:32,070
by
powerful and strong centralized

6736
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:32,080
powerful and strong centralized
 

6737
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,830
powerful and strong centralized
leadership allowed them

6738
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:33,840
leadership allowed them
 

6739
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:36,629
leadership allowed them
it's almost like outsourcing anti-terror

6740
01:54:36,629 --> 01:54:36,639
it's almost like outsourcing anti-terror
 

6741
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:38,390
it's almost like outsourcing anti-terror
activities allowed them to

6742
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:38,400
activities allowed them to
 

6743
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,390
activities allowed them to
for their own reasons i mean you see the

6744
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:40,400
for their own reasons i mean you see the
 

6745
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,070
for their own reasons i mean you see the
same thing in the syria situation with

6746
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:42,080
same thing in the syria situation with
 

6747
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:43,750
same thing in the syria situation with
the assads i mean

6748
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:43,760
the assads i mean
 

6749
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,070
the assads i mean
you can't have an isis in that area

6750
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:46,080
you can't have an isis in that area
 

6751
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:47,510
you can't have an isis in that area
because that's a threat to the assad

6752
01:54:47,510 --> 01:54:47,520
because that's a threat to the assad
 

6753
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:48,790
because that's a threat to the assad
government who will take care of that

6754
01:54:48,790 --> 01:54:48,800
government who will take care of that
 

6755
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:49,510
government who will take care of that

for you
 

6757
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,109
for you
and then that helps us by not having an

6758
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:51,119
and then that helps us by not having an
 

6759
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:53,350
and then that helps us by not having an
isis so um

6760
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
isis so um
 

6761
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,589
isis so um

6943
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,550
somebody mentioned to me you know what
happens if power goes out

6944
01:57:58,550 --> 01:57:58,560
happens if power goes out
 

6945
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:00,790
happens if power goes out
for a day what happens if power goes out

6946
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:00,800
for a day what happens if power goes out
 

6947
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,629
for a day what happens if power goes out
for

6948
01:58:02,629 --> 01:58:02,639
for
 

6949
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:05,430
for
a month oh for example the person that

6950
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:05,440
a month oh for example the person that
 

6951
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:06,709
a month oh for example the person that
mentioned this was a

6952
01:58:06,709 --> 01:58:06,719
mentioned this was a
 

6953
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:09,589
mentioned this was a
berkeley faculty uh that i was talking

6954
01:58:09,589 --> 01:58:09,599
berkeley faculty uh that i was talking
 

6955
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:10,070
berkeley faculty uh that i was talking
with

6956
01:58:10,070 --> 01:58:10,080
with
 

6957
01:58:10,080 --> 01:58:12,070
with
he's an astronomer who's observing solar

6958
01:58:12,070 --> 01:58:12,080
he's an astronomer who's observing solar
 

6959
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,350
he's an astronomer who's observing solar
flares

6960
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:13,360
flares
 

6961
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:16,310
flares
and it's very possible that a solar

6962
01:58:16,310 --> 01:58:16,320
and it's very possible that a solar
 

6963
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:16,870
and it's very possible that a solar
flare

6964
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:16,880
flare
 

6965
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:18,870
flare
they happen all the time to different

6966
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:18,880
they happen all the time to different
 

6967
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,629
they happen all the time to different
degrees i've got your cell phones

6968
01:58:20,629 --> 01:58:20,639
degrees i've got your cell phones
 

6969
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:23,910
degrees i've got your cell phones
yeah to knock out the power grid for

6970
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:23,920
yeah to knock out the power grid for
 

6971
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:27,030
yeah to knock out the power grid for
months so like

6972
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:27,040
months so like
 

6973
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,030
months so like
you know just as a thought experiment

6974
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:29,040
you know just as a thought experiment
 

6975
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,510
you know just as a thought experiment
what happens if just power goes out for

6976
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:31,520
what happens if just power goes out for
 

6977
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,830
what happens if just power goes out for
a week in this country this is like the

6978
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:33,840
a week in this country this is like the
 

6979
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:34,709
a week in this country this is like the
e and the

6980
01:58:34,709 --> 01:58:34,719
e and the
 

6981
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:36,709
e and the
electromagnetic magnetic pulses and the

6982
01:58:36,709 --> 01:58:36,719
electromagnetic magnetic pulses and the
 

6983
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:38,229
electromagnetic magnetic pulses and the
nuclear weapons and all those kinds of

6984
01:58:38,229 --> 01:58:38,239
nuclear weapons and all those kinds of
 

6985
01:58:38,239 --> 01:58:38,790
nuclear weapons and all those kinds of
things yeah

6986
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:38,800
things yeah
 

6987
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,510
things yeah
but maybe that's an act of nature yes

6988
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:41,520
but maybe that's an act of nature yes
 

6989
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:43,910
but maybe that's an act of nature yes
and even just the act of nature will

6990
01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:43,920
and even just the act of nature will
 

6991
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,350
and even just the act of nature will
reveal like a little fragility

6992
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:47,360
reveal like a little fragility
 

6993
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:48,950
reveal like a little fragility
the fragility of it all and then the

6994
01:58:48,950 --> 01:58:48,960
the fragility of it all and then the
 

6995
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:50,629
the fragility of it all and then the
evil can emerge i mean the kind of

6996
01:58:50,629 --> 01:58:50,639
evil can emerge i mean the kind of
 

6997
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:52,229
evil can emerge i mean the kind of
things that might happen when power goes

6998
01:58:52,229 --> 01:58:52,239
things that might happen when power goes
 

6999
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:53,270
things that might happen when power goes
out

7000
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:53,280
out
 

7001
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:56,229
out
especially during a divisive time well

7002
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:56,239
especially during a divisive time well
 

7003
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:57,350
especially during a divisive time well
you won't have food

7004
01:58:57,350 --> 01:58:57,360
you won't have food
 

7005
01:58:57,360 --> 01:59:00,470
you won't have food
at baseline level that would mean that

7006
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:00,480
at baseline level that would mean that
 

7007
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:00,790
at baseline level that would mean that
the

7008
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:00,800
the
 

7009
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:03,750
the
the uh the entire supplies chain begins

7010
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:03,760
the uh the entire supplies chain begins
 

7011
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:04,550
the uh the entire supplies chain begins
to break down

7012
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:04,560
to break down
 

7013
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:05,990
to break down
and then you have desperation and

7014
01:59:05,990 --> 01:59:06,000
and then you have desperation and
 

7015
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,189
and then you have desperation and
desperation opens the door to everything

7016
01:59:09,189 --> 01:59:09,199
desperation opens the door to everything
 

7017
01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:11,350
desperation opens the door to everything

about
 

7023
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:15,510
about
there's there's always a thread a

there's there's always a thread a
 

7025
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,870
there's there's always a thread a
hopeful message i think it'll be a

7026
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:16,880
hopeful message i think it'll be a
 

7027
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,470
hopeful message i think it'll be a
hopeful message on this one too you may

7028
01:59:18,470 --> 01:59:18,480
hopeful message on this one too you may
 

7029
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:21,830
hopeful message on this one too you may
have the wrong guess

7030
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:21,840

 

7031
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:25,669

um if you were to bet money

7032
01:59:25,669 --> 01:59:25,679
um if you were to bet money
 

7033
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:28,950
um if you were to bet money
on the way that human civilization

7034
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:28,960
on the way that human civilization
 

7035
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:30,870
on the way that human civilization
destroys itself

7036
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:30,880
destroys itself
 

7037
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:33,990
destroys itself
or it collapses in some way that

7038
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
or it collapses in some way that
 

7039
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,550
or it collapses in some way that
is where the result would be

7040
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:36,560
is where the result would be
 

7041
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:37,990
is where the result would be
unrecognizable to us

7042
01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:38,000
unrecognizable to us
 

7043
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,750
unrecognizable to us
as anything akin to progress

7044
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:41,760
as anything akin to progress
 

7045

as anything akin to progress
what would you say is it nuclear weapons

7046
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:46,400
what would you say is it nuclear weapons
 

7047
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:49,109
what would you say is it nuclear weapons
is it some societal breakdown through

7048
01:59:49,109 --> 01:59:49,119
is it some societal breakdown through
 

7049
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,430
is it some societal breakdown through
just more traditional kinds of war

7050
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:51,440
just more traditional kinds of war
 

7051
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,310
just more traditional kinds of war
is it engineered pandemics

7052
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:53,320
is it engineered pandemics
 

7053
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:55,270
is it engineered pandemics
nanotechnology is it artificial

7054
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:55,280
nanotechnology is it artificial
 

7055
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:56,470
nanotechnology is it artificial
intelligence

7056
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:56,480
intelligence
 

7057
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,790
intelligence
is it something we can't even expect yet

7058
01:59:58,790 --> 01:59:58,800
is it something we can't even expect yet
 

7059
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,629
is it something we can't even expect yet
do you have a sense of how we humans

7060
02:00:00,629 --> 02:00:00,639
do you have a sense of how we humans
 

7061
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:02,470
do you have a sense of how we humans
will destroy ourselves

7062
02:00:02,470 --> 02:00:02,480
will destroy ourselves
 

7063
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:05,750
will destroy ourselves
or might we live forever i think what

7064
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:05,760
or might we live forever i think what
 

7065
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:08,950
or might we live forever i think what
what governs my view of this thing is

7066
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:08,960
what governs my view of this thing is
 

7067
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,070
what governs my view of this thing is
is the ability for us to focus ourselves

7068
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:12,080
is the ability for us to focus ourselves
 

7069
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,990
is the ability for us to focus ourselves
collectively right and that gives me the

7070
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:14,000
collectively right and that gives me the
 

7071
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,229
collectively right and that gives me the
choice of looking at this and saying

7072
02:00:16,229 --> 02:00:16,239
choice of looking at this and saying
 

7073
02:00:16,239 --> 02:00:17,990
choice of looking at this and saying
what are the odds we will do

7074
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:18,000
what are the odds we will do
 

7075
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,149
what are the odds we will do
x versus y right um so go look at the 62

7076
02:00:22,149 --> 02:00:22,159
x versus y right um so go look at the 62
 

7077
02:00:22,159 --> 02:00:25,350
x versus y right um so go look at the 62
cuban missile crisis where uh we

7078
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:25,360
cuban missile crisis where uh we
 

7079
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:27,830
cuban missile crisis where uh we
looked at the potential of nuclear war

7080
02:00:27,830 --> 02:00:27,840
looked at the potential of nuclear war
 

7081
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:30,470
looked at the potential of nuclear war
and we stared right in the face of that

7082
02:00:30,470 --> 02:00:30,480
and we stared right in the face of that
 

7083
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,709
and we stared right in the face of that
to me i consider that to be you want to

7084
02:00:32,709 --> 02:00:32,719
to me i consider that to be you want to
 

7085
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:34,709
to me i consider that to be you want to
talk about a hopeful moment

7086
02:00:34,709 --> 02:00:34,719
talk about a hopeful moment
 

7087
02:00:34,719 --> 02:00:36,310
talk about a hopeful moment
that's one of the rare times in our

7088
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:36,320
that's one of the rare times in our
 

7089
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,950
that's one of the rare times in our
history where i think the odds

7090
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:38,960
history where i think the odds
 

7091
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:41,589
history where i think the odds
were overwhelmingly that there would be

7092
02:00:41,589 --> 02:00:41,599
were overwhelmingly that there would be
 

7093
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:43,189
were overwhelmingly that there would be
a nuclear war

7094
02:00:43,189 --> 02:00:43,199
a nuclear war
 

7095
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:45,589
a nuclear war
and uh i'm not the super kennedy

7096
02:00:45,589 --> 02:00:45,599
and uh i'm not the super kennedy
 

7097
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:47,189
and uh i'm not the super kennedy
worshiper that you know i grew up in an

7098
02:00:47,189 --> 02:00:47,199
worshiper that you know i grew up in an
 

7099
02:00:47,199 --> 02:00:48,229
worshiper that you know i grew up in an
era where he was

7100
02:00:48,229 --> 02:00:48,239
era where he was
 

7101
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:49,750
era where he was
especially amongst people in the

7102
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:49,760
especially amongst people in the
 

7103
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:51,830
especially amongst people in the
democratic party he was almost worshiped

02:03:21,109 --> 02:03:21,119
the amount of things that have to go
 

7267
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:22,470
the amount of things that have to go
right

7268
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:22,480
right
 

7269
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:24,550
right
in a short period of time we don't have

7270
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:24,560
in a short period of time we don't have
 

7271
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:27,430
in a short period of time we don't have
600 years to figure this out right

7272
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:27,440
600 years to figure this out right
 

7273
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,669
600 years to figure this out right
so to me that that looks like the most

7274
02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:29,679
so to me that that looks like the most
 

7275
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:31,189
so to me that that looks like the most
likely just because the things we would

7276
02:03:31,189 --> 02:03:31,199
likely just because the things we would
 

7277
02:03:31,199 --> 02:03:32,870
likely just because the things we would
have to do to avoid it seem the most

7278
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:32,880
have to do to avoid it seem the most
 

7279
02:03:32,880 --> 02:03:34,470
have to do to avoid it seem the most
unlikely does that make sense yes

7280
02:03:34,470 --> 02:03:34,480
unlikely does that make sense yes
 

7281
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:35,430
unlikely does that make sense yes
absolutely

7282
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:35,440
absolutely
 

7283
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:38,629
absolutely
i i believe call me naive in

7284
02:03:38,629 --> 02:03:38,639
i i believe call me naive in
 

7285
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:41,510
i i believe call me naive in
just like you said with the individual i

7286
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:41,520
just like you said with the individual i
 

7287
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:42,070
just like you said with the individual i
believe

7288
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:42,080
believe
 

7289
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:44,310
believe
that charismatic leaders individual

7290
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:44,320
that charismatic leaders individual
 

7291
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:45,990
that charismatic leaders individual
leaders will save us

7292
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,000
leaders will save us
 

7293
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,510
leaders will save us
like this what if you don't get them all

7294
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:47,520
like this what if you don't get them all
 

7295
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:48,950
like this what if you don't get them all
at the same time what if you get a

7296
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:48,960
at the same time what if you get a
 

7297
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:50,629
at the same time what if you get a
charismatic leader in one country but

7298
02:03:50,629 --> 02:03:50,639
charismatic leader in one country but
 

7299
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:52,069
charismatic leader in one country but
under or what if you get a charismatic

7300
02:03:52,069 --> 02:03:52,079
under or what if you get a charismatic
 

7301
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:53,270
under or what if you get a charismatic
leader in a country that doesn't really

7302
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:53,280
leader in a country that doesn't really
 

7303
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:54,390
leader in a country that doesn't really
matter that much

7304
02:03:54,390 --> 02:03:54,400
matter that much
 

7305
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:56,310
matter that much
well it's a ripple effect so it starts

7306
02:03:56,310 --> 02:03:56,320
well it's a ripple effect so it starts
 

7307
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:57,669
well it's a ripple effect so it starts
with one leader and

7308
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
with one leader and
 

7309
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,790
with one leader and
their charisma inspires other leaders

7310
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:00,800
their charisma inspires other leaders
 

7311
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:01,669
their charisma inspires other leaders
like so

7312
02:04:01,669 --> 02:04:01,679
like so
 

7313
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:05,030
like so
it's uh it's like one ant queen steps up

7314
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:05,040
it's uh it's like one ant queen steps up
 

7315
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:06,310
it's uh it's like one ant queen steps up
and then the rest of the ant starts

7316
02:04:06,310 --> 02:04:06,320
and then the rest of the ant starts
 

7317
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,109
and then the rest of the ant starts
behaving

7318
02:04:07,109 --> 02:04:07,119
behaving
 

7319
02:04:07,119 --> 02:04:08,470
behaving
and then there's like little other

7320
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:08,480
and then there's like little other
 

7321
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:10,950
and then there's like little other
spikes of leaders that emerge

7322
02:04:10,950 --> 02:04:10,960
spikes of leaders that emerge
 

7323
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,390
spikes of leaders that emerge
and then that's where collaboration

7324
02:04:12,390 --> 02:04:12,400
and then that's where collaboration
 

7325
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,629
and then that's where collaboration
emerges i tend to believe that like

7326
02:04:14,629 --> 02:04:14,639
emerges i tend to believe that like
 

7327
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:17,669
emerges i tend to believe that like
when you heat up the system and [\h__\h]

7328
02:04:17,669 --> 02:04:17,679
when you heat up the system and [\h__\h]
 

7329
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:18,390
when you heat up the system and [\h__\h]
starts getting

7330
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:18,400
starts getting
 

7331
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:21,430
starts getting
really chaotic then

7332
02:04:21,430 --> 02:04:21,440
really chaotic then
 

7333
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,910
really chaotic then
the leader whatever this collective

7334
02:04:23,910 --> 02:04:23,920
the leader whatever this collective
 

7335
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:26,069
the leader whatever this collective
intelligence that we've developed

7336
02:04:26,069 --> 02:04:26,079
intelligence that we've developed
 

7337
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:28,790
intelligence that we've developed
the leader will emerge like do you think

7338
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:28,800
the leader will emerge like do you think
 

7339
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:30,229
the leader will emerge like do you think
there's just as much of a chance though

7340
02:04:30,229 --> 02:04:30,239
there's just as much of a chance though
 

7341
02:04:30,239 --> 02:04:31,830
there's just as much of a chance though
that the leader would emerge and say the

7342
02:04:31,830 --> 02:04:31,840
that the leader would emerge and say the
 

7343
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,430
that the leader would emerge and say the
jews are the people who did all this

7344
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:33,440
jews are the people who did all this
 

7345
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:33,830
jews are the people who did all this
right

7346
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:33,840
right
 

7347
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,109
right
you know what i'm saying is that the

7348
02:04:35,109 --> 02:04:35,119
you know what i'm saying is that the
 

7349
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:37,030
you know what i'm saying is that the
idea that they would come up you have a

7350
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:37,040
idea that they would come up you have a
 

7351
02:04:37,040 --> 02:04:38,229
idea that they would come up you have a
charismatic leader and he's going to

7352
02:04:38,229 --> 02:04:38,239
charismatic leader and he's going to
 

7353
02:04:38,239 --> 02:04:39,830
charismatic leader and he's going to
come up with the rights or she

7354
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:39,840
come up with the rights or she
 

7355
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,030
come up with the rights or she
is going to come up with the right

7356
02:04:41,030 --> 02:04:41,040
is going to come up with the right
 

7357
02:04:41,040 --> 02:04:43,030
is going to come up with the right
solution as opposed to totally

7358
02:04:43,030 --> 02:04:43,040
solution as opposed to totally
 

7359
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:45,430
solution as opposed to totally
coming up with the wrong solution i mean

7360
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:45,440
coming up with the wrong solution i mean
 

7361
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,390
coming up with the wrong solution i mean
i guess what i'm saying is

7362
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:46,400
i guess what i'm saying is
 

7363
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,390
i guess what i'm saying is
you could be right but a lot of things

7364
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:48,400
you could be right but a lot of things
 

7365
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,990
you could be right but a lot of things
have to go the right way

7366
02:04:49,990 --> 02:04:50,000
have to go the right way
 

7367
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,310
have to go the right way
but my intuition about the evolutionary

7368
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:52,320
but my intuition about the evolutionary
 

7369
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:53,990
but my intuition about the evolutionary
process that led to the creation of

7370
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:54,000
process that led to the creation of
 

7371
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,709
process that led to the creation of
human

7372
02:04:54,709 --> 02:04:54,719
human
 

7373
02:04:54,719 --> 02:04:57,910
human
intelligence and consciousness on earth

7374
02:04:57,910 --> 02:04:57,920
intelligence and consciousness on earth
 

7375
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:01,030
intelligence and consciousness on earth
results in the the power of

7376
02:05:01,030 --> 02:05:01,040
results in the the power of
 

7377
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,189
results in the the power of
like if we think of it just the love in

7378
02:05:03,189 --> 02:05:03,199
like if we think of it just the love in
 

7379
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:05,350
like if we think of it just the love in
the system versus the hate in the system

7380
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:05,360
the system versus the hate in the system
 

7381
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:08,629
the system versus the hate in the system
that the love is greater the human

7382
02:05:08,629 --> 02:05:08,639
that the love is greater the human
 

7383
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:12,390
that the love is greater the human
the the the human kindness

7384
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:12,400
the the the human kindness
 

7385
02:05:12,400 --> 02:05:14,470
the the the human kindness
potential in the system is greater than

7386
02:05:14,470 --> 02:05:14,480
potential in the system is greater than
 

7387
02:05:14,480 --> 02:05:16,390
potential in the system is greater than
the human

7388
02:05:16,390 --> 02:05:16,400
the human
 

7389
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:19,030
the human
uh hatred potential and so the leader

7390
02:05:19,030 --> 02:05:19,040
uh hatred potential and so the leader
 

7391
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:21,750
uh hatred potential and so the leader
that is in the time when it's needed

7392
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:21,760
that is in the time when it's needed
 

7393
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:24,790
that is in the time when it's needed
the leader that inspires love

7394
02:05:24,790 --> 02:05:24,800
the leader that inspires love
 

7395
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:28,310
the leader that inspires love
and kindness will is more likely to

7396
02:05:28,310 --> 02:05:28,320
and kindness will is more likely to
 

7397
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:29,109
and kindness will is more likely to
emerge

7398
02:05:29,109 --> 02:05:29,119
emerge
 

7399
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:31,589
emerge
and will have more power so you have the

7400
02:05:31,589 --> 02:05:31,599
and will have more power so you have the
 

7401
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:33,109
and will have more power so you have the
hitlers of the world that

7402
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:33,119
hitlers of the world that
 

7403
02:05:33,119 --> 02:05:36,229
hitlers of the world that
emerge but they're actually in the grand

7404
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:36,239
emerge but they're actually in the grand
 

7405
02:05:36,239 --> 02:05:40,550
emerge but they're actually in the grand
scheme of history are not that impactful

7406
02:05:40,550 --> 02:05:40,560
scheme of history are not that impactful
 

7407
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:43,750
scheme of history are not that impactful
so it's it's weird to say but not that

7408
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:43,760
so it's it's weird to say but not that
 

7409
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:45,750
so it's it's weird to say but not that
many people died in world war ii

7410
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:45,760
many people died in world war ii
 

7411
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:49,669
many people died in world war ii
if you look at the the the the full

7412
02:05:49,669 --> 02:05:49,679
if you look at the the the the full
 

7413
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:52,069
if you look at the the the the full
range of human history uh you know it's

7414
02:05:52,069 --> 02:05:52,079
range of human history uh you know it's
 

7415
02:05:52,079 --> 02:05:52,790
range of human history uh you know it's
uh

7416
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:52,800
uh
 

7417
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:55,830
uh
up to 100 million whatever that is with

7418
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:55,840
up to 100 million whatever that is with
 

7419
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,589
up to 100 million whatever that is with
natural pandemics too you can have those

7420
02:05:57,589 --> 02:05:57,599
natural pandemics too you can have those
 

7421
02:05:57,599 --> 02:05:59,030
natural pandemics too you can have those
kinds of numbers but it's still

7422
02:05:59,030 --> 02:05:59,040
kinds of numbers but it's still
 

7423
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,470
kinds of numbers but it's still
a percentage i forget what the

7424
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:00,480
a percentage i forget what the
 

7425
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:02,790
a percentage i forget what the
percentage is maybe three five percent

7426
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:02,800
percentage is maybe three five percent
 

7427
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,709
percentage is maybe three five percent
of the human population on earth maybe

7428
02:06:04,709 --> 02:06:04,719
of the human population on earth maybe
 

7429
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:06,149
of the human population on earth maybe
it's a little bit focused on a different

02:06:06,149 --> 02:06:06,159
it's a little bit focused on a different
 

7431
02:06:06,159 --> 02:06:07,030
it's a little bit focused on a different
region

7432

region
 

7433
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:09,669
region

but it's not destructive to the entirety
 

7435
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:11,750
but it's not destructive to the entirety

though and this is just you know i've
 

7453
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,589
though and this is just you know i've
thought about this all of 30 seconds but

7454
02:06:33,589 --> 02:06:33,599
thought about this all of 30 seconds but
 

7455

i mean uh
 

7457
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,950
i mean uh
it it it's we're betting money here on

i think maybe uh you've divided this

7464
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:42,480
i think maybe uh you've divided this
 

7465
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,709
i think maybe uh you've divided this
into too much of a black and white

7466
02:06:44,709 --> 02:06:44,719
into too much of a black and white
 

7467
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:45,589
into too much of a black and white
dichotomy

7468
02:06:45,589 --> 02:06:45,599
dichotomy
 

7469
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:47,669
dichotomy
this love and good on one side and this

this love and good on one side and this
 

7471
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:49,589
this love and good on one side and this
evil on another let me throw

7472
02:06:49,589 --> 02:06:49,599
evil on another let me throw
 

7473
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:51,109
evil on another let me throw
something that might be more in the

02:06:51,109 --> 02:06:51,119
something that might be more in the
 

7475
02:06:51,119 --> 02:06:53,030
something that might be more in the
center of that linear

02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:53,040
center of that linear
 

7477
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:56,310
center of that linear
uh a balancing act self-interest

7478
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:56,320
uh a balancing act self-interest
 

7479
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:59,270
uh a balancing act self-interest
which may or may not be good you know

02:06:59,270 --> 02:06:59,280
which may or may not be good you know

02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:00,870
which may or may not be good you know
good the good version of it we call

good the good version of it we call
 

7483
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:02,790
good the good version of it we call
enlightened self-interest right

02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:02,800
enlightened self-interest right
 

7485
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,550
enlightened self-interest right
the bad version of it we call

7486
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:04,560
the bad version of it we call
 

7487

the bad version of it we call
selfishness

selfishness
 

7489
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:08,310
selfishness
but self-interest to me seems like

7490
02:07:08,310 --> 02:07:08,320
but self-interest to me seems like
 

7491
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:09,750
but self-interest to me seems like
something more likely to

7492
02:07:09,750 --> 02:07:09,760
something more likely to
 

7493
02:07:09,760 --> 02:07:12,470
something more likely to
impact the outcome than either love on

7494

impact the outcome than either love on
 

7495
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,790
impact the outcome than either love on
one side or evil on the other

02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:14,800
one side or evil on the other
 

7497
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:17,350
one side or evil on the other
simply a question of what's good for me

7498
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:17,360
simply a question of what's good for me
 

7499

a coal mine

7510
02:07:29,669 --> 02:07:29,679
a coal mine
 

7511
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:32,149
a coal mine
if you say to me we have to stop using

7512
02:07:32,149 --> 02:07:32,159
if you say to me we have to stop using
 

7513
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:33,910
if you say to me we have to stop using
coal because it's hurting the earth

7514
02:07:33,910 --> 02:07:33,920
coal because it's hurting the earth
 

7515
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:37,430
coal because it's hurting the earth
i have a hard time disentangling

7516
02:07:37,430 --> 02:07:37,440
i have a hard time disentangling
 

7517
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:40,550
i have a hard time disentangling
that greater good question from my

7518
02:07:40,550 --> 02:07:40,560
that greater good question from my
 

7519
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:42,550
that greater good question from my
right now good feeding my family

7520
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:42,560
right now good feeding my family
 

7521
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:43,669
right now good feeding my family
question right

7522
02:07:43,669 --> 02:07:43,679
question right
 

7523
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:46,390
question right
so i think i think maybe it's going to

7524
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:46,400
so i think i think maybe it's going to
 

7525
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:47,830
so i think i think maybe it's going to
be a much more banal

7526
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:47,840
be a much more banal
 

7527
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:50,229
be a much more banal
thing than good and evil much more a

7528
02:07:50,229 --> 02:07:50,239
thing than good and evil much more a
 

7529
02:07:50,239 --> 02:07:50,950
thing than good and evil much more a
question of

7530
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:50,960
question of
 

7531
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:53,030
question of
we're not all going to decide at the

7532
02:07:53,030 --> 02:07:53,040
we're not all going to decide at the
 

7533
02:07:53,040 --> 02:07:54,310
we're not all going to decide at the
same time

7534
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:54,320
same time
 

7535
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:56,629
same time
that the interests that we have are

7536
02:07:56,629 --> 02:07:56,639
that the interests that we have are
 

7537
02:07:56,639 --> 02:07:57,350
that the interests that we have are
aligned

7538
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:57,360
aligned
 

7539
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:59,350
aligned
does that make sense yeah totally but i

7540
02:07:59,350 --> 02:07:59,360
does that make sense yeah totally but i
 

7541
02:07:59,360 --> 02:08:00,709
does that make sense yeah totally but i
mean i've looked at ayn rand and

7542
02:08:00,709 --> 02:08:00,719
mean i've looked at ayn rand and
 

7543
02:08:00,719 --> 02:08:02,390
mean i've looked at ayn rand and
objectivism and kind of really thought

7544
02:08:02,390 --> 02:08:02,400
objectivism and kind of really thought
 

7545
02:08:02,400 --> 02:08:04,470
objectivism and kind of really thought
like how bad or good can things go when

7546
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:04,480
like how bad or good can things go when
 

7547
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:06,470
like how bad or good can things go when
everybody's acting selfishly

7548
02:08:06,470 --> 02:08:06,480
everybody's acting selfishly
 

7549
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:08,550
everybody's acting selfishly
but i think we're just talking two ants

7550
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:08,560
but i think we're just talking two ants
 

7551
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:09,669
but i think we're just talking two ants
here with microphones

7552
02:08:09,669 --> 02:08:09,679
here with microphones
 

7553
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:13,189
here with microphones
talking about two seconds

7554
02:08:13,189 --> 02:08:13,199

 

7555
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:16,229

but like the the question is

7556
02:08:16,229 --> 02:08:16,239
but like the the question is
 

7557
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:19,189
but like the the question is
when they when this spreads so what what

7558
02:08:19,189 --> 02:08:19,199
when they when this spreads so what what
 

7559
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:19,990
when they when this spreads so what what
is

7560
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:20,000
is
 

7561
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,030
is
what do i mean by love and kindness

7562
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:23,040
what do i mean by love and kindness
 

7563
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:26,550
what do i mean by love and kindness
i think it's human flourishing on earth

7564
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:26,560
i think it's human flourishing on earth
 

7565
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:28,790
i think it's human flourishing on earth
and throughout the cosmos

7566
02:08:28,790 --> 02:08:28,800
and throughout the cosmos
 

7567
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,510
and throughout the cosmos
it feels like whatever the engine that

7568
02:08:31,510 --> 02:08:31,520
it feels like whatever the engine that
 

7569
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:33,910
it feels like whatever the engine that
drives human beings

7570
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:33,920
drives human beings
 

7571
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:35,990
drives human beings
is more likely to result in human

7572
02:08:35,990 --> 02:08:36,000
is more likely to result in human
 

7573
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,189
is more likely to result in human
flourishing

7574
02:08:37,189 --> 02:08:37,199
flourishing
 

7575
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:39,669
flourishing
and people like hitler are not good for

7576
02:08:39,669 --> 02:08:39,679
and people like hitler are not good for
 

7577
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:41,109
and people like hitler are not good for
human flourishing

7578
02:08:41,109 --> 02:08:41,119
human flourishing
 

7579
02:08:41,119 --> 02:08:44,149
human flourishing
so that's what i mean by good is they is

7580
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:44,159
so that's what i mean by good is they is
 

7581
02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:45,990
so that's what i mean by good is they is
is there's a i mean maybe it's an

7582
02:08:45,990 --> 02:08:46,000
is there's a i mean maybe it's an
 

7583
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,189
is there's a i mean maybe it's an
intuition that

7584
02:08:47,189 --> 02:08:47,199
intuition that
 

7585
02:08:47,199 --> 02:08:51,430
intuition that
kindness is an evolutionary advantage

7586
02:08:51,430 --> 02:08:51,440
kindness is an evolutionary advantage
 

7587
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:53,189
kindness is an evolutionary advantage
i hate those terms i hate to reduce

7588
02:08:53,189 --> 02:08:53,199
i hate those terms i hate to reduce
 

7589
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:54,470
i hate those terms i hate to reduce
stuff to the

7590
02:08:54,470 --> 02:08:54,480
stuff to the
 

7591
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:56,790
stuff to the
evolutionary biology always but it just

7592
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:56,800
evolutionary biology always but it just
 

7593
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,470
evolutionary biology always but it just
seems like for us to multiply

7594
02:08:58,470 --> 02:08:58,480
seems like for us to multiply
 

7595
02:08:58,480 --> 02:09:01,270
seems like for us to multiply
throughout the universe it's good to be

7596
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:01,280
throughout the universe it's good to be
 

7597
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,950
throughout the universe it's good to be
kind to each other

7598
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:02,960
kind to each other
 

7599
02:09:02,960 --> 02:09:05,510
kind to each other
and those leaders will always emerge to

7600
02:09:05,510 --> 02:09:05,520
and those leaders will always emerge to
 

7601
02:09:05,520 --> 02:09:06,870
and those leaders will always emerge to
save us

7602
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:06,880
save us
 

7603
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:08,550
save us
from the hitlers of the world that want

7604
02:09:08,550 --> 02:09:08,560
from the hitlers of the world that want
 

7605
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:10,229
from the hitlers of the world that want
to kind of burn the thing down with a

7606
02:09:10,229 --> 02:09:10,239
to kind of burn the thing down with a
 

7607
02:09:10,239 --> 02:09:11,189
to kind of burn the thing down with a
flamethrower

7608
02:09:11,189 --> 02:09:11,199
flamethrower
 

7609
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:12,629
flamethrower
that's the intuition but let's talk

7610
02:09:12,629 --> 02:09:12,639
that's the intuition but let's talk
 

7611
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:14,149
that's the intuition but let's talk
about you you brought up evolution

7612
02:09:14,149 --> 02:09:14,159
about you you brought up evolution
 

7613
02:09:14,159 --> 02:09:14,950
about you you brought up evolution
several times

7614
02:09:14,950 --> 02:09:14,960
several times
 

7615
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:16,470
several times
let me let me play with that for a

7616
02:09:16,470 --> 02:09:16,480
let me let me play with that for a
 

7617
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,149
let me let me play with that for a
minute um

7618
02:09:18,149 --> 02:09:18,159
minute um
 

7619
02:09:18,159 --> 02:09:20,709
minute um
i think going back to animal times we

7620
02:09:20,709 --> 02:09:20,719
i think going back to animal times we
 

7621
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:22,229
i think going back to animal times we
are conditioned

7622
02:09:22,229 --> 02:09:22,239
are conditioned
 

7623
02:09:22,239 --> 02:09:24,550
are conditioned
to deal with overwhelming threats right

7624
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:24,560
to deal with overwhelming threats right
 

7625
02:09:24,560 --> 02:09:26,310
to deal with overwhelming threats right
in front of us so i have quite a bit of

7626
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:26,320
in front of us so i have quite a bit of
 

7627
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:27,109
in front of us so i have quite a bit of
faith

7628
02:09:27,109 --> 02:09:27,119
faith
 

7629
02:09:27,119 --> 02:09:30,870
faith
in humanity when it comes to impending

02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:30,880
in humanity when it comes to impending
 

7631
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:31,669
in humanity when it comes to impending
doom

7632
02:09:31,669 --> 02:09:31,679
doom
 

7633
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:34,629
doom
right outside our door uh if krypton's

right outside our door uh if krypton's
 

7635
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:37,270

the natural ability we have to deal with
 

7657
02:10:01,119 --> 02:10:02,550
the natural ability we have to deal with
the threat that's

the threat that's
 

7659
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:04,950
the threat that's
right on top of us and it requires an

7660
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:04,960
right on top of us and it requires an
 

7661
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:07,030
right on top of us and it requires an
amount of foresight that while some

understandably i think too worried
 

7669
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:15,830
understandably i think too worried
about today's threat rather than next

7670
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:15,840
about today's threat rather than next
 

7671
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:17,830
about today's threat rather than next
generations threat or whatever it might

so i mean when we talk about when you
 

7677
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:21,510
so i mean when we talk about when you
had said what do you think the greatest

i think with nuclear weapons i think

7682
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:25,280
i think with nuclear weapons i think
 

7683
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:26,709
i think with nuclear weapons i think
could we have a nuclear war we darn

7684

could we have a nuclear war we darn
 

7685
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:28,550
could we have a nuclear war we darn
right could but i i think that there's

7686
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:28,560
right could but i i think that there's
 

7687

right could but i i think that there's
enough

enough
 

7689

i think the evolutionary uh

7710
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:50,880
i think the evolutionary uh
 

7711
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:54,390
i think the evolutionary uh
way that we have have evolved mitigates

7712
02:10:54,390 --> 02:10:54,400
way that we have have evolved mitigates
 

7713
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:55,990
way that we have have evolved mitigates
maybe against that in other words

7714
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:56,000
maybe against that in other words
 

7715
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,310
maybe against that in other words
i think i would be pleasantly surprised

i think i would be pleasantly surprised
 

7717
02:10:58,320 --> 02:10:59,990
i think i would be pleasantly surprised
if we could pull that off does that make

if we could pull that off does that make
 

7719
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,189
if we could pull that off does that make
sense

7720

8053
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:20,470
right and we're going to colonize mars
probably anyway if we live long enough

and i think the tesla idea not just
 

8057
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:24,709
and i think the tesla idea not just
elon's version but ones that follow from

other people
 

8061
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:27,350
other people
is the best chance of making sure we're

8062
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:27,360
is the best chance of making sure we're
 

8063
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:29,350
is the best chance of making sure we're
around long enough to see mars colonized

going to break up i'm going from memory

8346
02:21:39,830 --> 02:21:39,840
going to break up i'm going from memory
 

8347
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:40,870
going to break up i'm going from memory
here he might not have said that at all

8348
02:21:40,870 --> 02:21:40,880
here he might not have said that at all
 

8349
02:21:40,880 --> 02:21:42,070
here he might not have said that at all
but something was stuck in my memory

8350
02:21:42,070 --> 02:21:42,080
but something was stuck in my memory
 

8351
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:44,630
but something was stuck in my memory
about that i remember thinking

about that i remember thinking
 

8353
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:48,230
about that i remember thinking
um but i i think some of the arguments

8354
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:48,240
um but i i think some of the arguments
 

8355
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:50,230
um but i i think some of the arguments
were connected to

8356
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:50,240
were connected to
 

8357
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:53,429
were connected to

the differences that we had and the fact
that those differences are being

that those differences are being
 

8361
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:55,990
that those differences are being
exploited so

ratchet the unity back up again so that
we can start from the baseline again and

8550
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:53,120
we can start from the baseline again and
 

8551
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:54,710
we can start from the baseline again and
then pull ourselves apart till the next

8552
02:24:54,710 --> 02:24:54,720
then pull ourselves apart till the next
 

8553
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:56,710
then pull ourselves apart till the next
pearl harbor that you'll pull yourself

8554
02:24:56,710 --> 02:24:56,720
pearl harbor that you'll pull yourself
 

8555
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,309
pearl harbor that you'll pull yourself
apart which i think was

8556
02:24:58,309 --> 02:24:58,319
apart which i think was
 

8557
02:24:58,319 --> 02:25:00,389
apart which i think was
i think that's what the george friedman

8558
02:25:00,389 --> 02:25:00,399
i think that's what the george friedman
 

8559
02:25:00,399 --> 02:25:01,990
i think that's what the george friedman
book was saying that i disagreed with so

8560
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:02,000
book was saying that i disagreed with so
 

8561
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:03,429
book was saying that i disagreed with so
much at the time

8562
02:25:03,429 --> 02:25:03,439
much at the time
 

8563
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:05,910
much at the time
um so in answer to your question about

8564
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:05,920
um so in answer to your question about
 

8565
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:07,830
um so in answer to your question about
civil wars

8566
02:25:07,830 --> 02:25:07,840
civil wars
 

8567
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,590
civil wars
we can't have the same kind of civil war

8568
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:09,600
we can't have the same kind of civil war
 

8569
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:11,349
we can't have the same kind of civil war
because we don't have a geographical

8570
02:25:11,349 --> 02:25:11,359
because we don't have a geographical
 

8571
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:13,030
because we don't have a geographical
division that's as clear-cut as the one

8572
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:13,040
division that's as clear-cut as the one
 

8573
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:14,630
division that's as clear-cut as the one
we had before right you had a basically

8574
02:25:14,630 --> 02:25:14,640
we had before right you had a basically
 

8575
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:16,630
we had before right you had a basically
north-south line and some border states

8576
02:25:16,630 --> 02:25:16,640
north-south line and some border states
 

8577
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:18,870
north-south line and some border states
it was set up for that kind of a split

8578
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:18,880
it was set up for that kind of a split
 

8579
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:21,110
it was set up for that kind of a split
now we're divided within communities

8580
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:21,120
now we're divided within communities
 

8581
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:22,230
now we're divided within communities
within families

8582
02:25:22,230 --> 02:25:22,240
within families
 

8583
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:24,710
within families
within gerrymandered voting districts

8584
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:24,720
within gerrymandered voting districts
 

8585
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:25,830
within gerrymandered voting districts
and precincts right

8586
02:25:25,830 --> 02:25:25,840
and precincts right
 

8587
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:29,429
and precincts right
so you can't disengage we're stuck with

8588
02:25:29,429 --> 02:25:29,439
so you can't disengage we're stuck with
 

8589
02:25:29,439 --> 02:25:32,870
so you can't disengage we're stuck with
each other so if there's a civil war now

8590
02:25:32,870 --> 02:25:32,880
each other so if there's a civil war now
 

8591
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:35,750
each other so if there's a civil war now
for lack of a better word what it might

8592
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:35,760
for lack of a better word what it might
 

8593
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:37,030
for lack of a better word what it might
seem like

8594
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:37,040
seem like
 

8595
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,750
seem like
is the late 1960s early 1970s where you

8596
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:39,760
is the late 1960s early 1970s where you
 

8597
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:40,389
is the late 1960s early 1970s where you
had

8598
02:25:40,389 --> 02:25:40,399
had
 

8599
02:25:40,399 --> 02:25:43,110
had
the bombings and you know let's call it

8600
02:25:43,110 --> 02:25:43,120
the bombings and you know let's call it
 

8601
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:45,670
the bombings and you know let's call it
domestic terrorism and things like that

8602
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:45,680
domestic terrorism and things like that
 

8603
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:46,309
domestic terrorism and things like that
because that

8604
02:25:46,309 --> 02:25:46,319
because that
 

8605
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:48,550
because that
that would seem to be something that

8606
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:48,560
that would seem to be something that
 

8607
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:50,469
that would seem to be something that
once again you don't even need a large

8608
02:25:50,469 --> 02:25:50,479
once again you don't even need a large
 

8609
02:25:50,479 --> 02:25:52,389
once again you don't even need a large
chunk of the country pulling apart ten

8610
02:25:52,389 --> 02:25:52,399
chunk of the country pulling apart ten
 

8611
02:25:52,399 --> 02:25:54,070
chunk of the country pulling apart ten
percent of people who think

8612
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:54,080
percent of people who think
 

8613
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:56,389
percent of people who think
it's it's the end times can do the

8614
02:25:56,389 --> 02:25:56,399
it's it's the end times can do the
 

8615
02:25:56,399 --> 02:25:57,750
it's it's the end times can do the
damage just like we talked about

8616
02:25:57,750 --> 02:25:57,760
damage just like we talked about
 

8617
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:59,030
damage just like we talked about
terrorism before

8618
02:25:59,030 --> 02:25:59,040
terrorism before
 

8619
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:01,510
terrorism before
and a can of gas and a big lighter i've

8620

give anybody ideas where a can of gas in
 

8625
02:26:05,439 --> 02:26:06,469
give anybody ideas where a can of gas in
a bic lighter

8626
02:26:06,469 --> 02:26:06,479
a bic lighter
 

8627
02:26:06,479 --> 02:26:08,870
a bic lighter
would take a thousand houses down before

8628
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:08,880
would take a thousand houses down before
 

8629
02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:09,830
would take a thousand houses down before
you could blink

8630
02:26:09,830 --> 02:26:09,840
you could blink
 

8631
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:13,190
you could blink
yeah right um that terrorist doesn't

02:26:13,190 --> 02:26:13,200
yeah right um that terrorist doesn't
 

8633
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:14,070
yeah right um that terrorist doesn't
have to be

8634
02:26:14,070 --> 02:26:14,080
have to be
 

8635
02:26:14,080 --> 02:26:16,070
have to be
from the middle east doesn't have to

8636
02:26:16,070 --> 02:26:16,080
from the middle east doesn't have to
 

8637
02:26:16,080 --> 02:26:17,510
from the middle east doesn't have to
have some sort of a fundamentalist

8638
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:17,520
have some sort of a fundamentalist
 

8639
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:18,630
have some sort of a fundamentalist
religious agenda

8640

religious agenda
 

8641
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:20,389
religious agenda
it could just be somebody really pissed

8642
02:26:20,389 --> 02:26:20,399
it could just be somebody really pissed
 

8643
02:26:20,399 --> 02:26:22,070
it could just be somebody really pissed
off about the election results

8644
02:26:22,070 --> 02:26:22,080
off about the election results
 

8645
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:24,150
off about the election results
so once again if we're playing an odds

8646
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:24,160
so once again if we're playing an odds
 

8647
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:25,270
so once again if we're playing an odds
game here

8648
02:26:25,270 --> 02:26:25,280
game here
 

8649
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:27,830
game here
everybody has to behave for this to work

8650
02:26:27,830 --> 02:26:27,840
everybody has to behave for this to work
 

8651
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:28,309
everybody has to behave for this to work
right

8652
02:26:28,309 --> 02:26:28,319
right
 

8653
02:26:28,319 --> 02:26:30,389
right
only a few people have to misbehave for

8654
02:26:30,389 --> 02:26:30,399
only a few people have to misbehave for
 

8655
02:26:30,399 --> 02:26:32,389
only a few people have to misbehave for
this thing to go sideways and remember

8656
02:26:32,389 --> 02:26:32,399
this thing to go sideways and remember
 

8657
02:26:32,399 --> 02:26:34,550
this thing to go sideways and remember
for every action there is an equal and

8658
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:34,560
for every action there is an equal and
 

8659
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:36,070
for every action there is an equal and
opposite reaction

8660
02:26:36,070 --> 02:26:36,080
opposite reaction
 

8661
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:37,510
opposite reaction
so you don't even have to have those

8662
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:37,520
so you don't even have to have those
 

8663
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:39,349
so you don't even have to have those
people doing all these things all they

8664
02:26:39,349 --> 02:26:39,359
people doing all these things all they
 

8665
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:41,830
people doing all these things all they
have to do is start

8666
02:26:41,830 --> 02:26:41,840
have to do is start
 

8667
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:43,510
have to do is start
retribution cycle and there's an

8668
02:26:43,510 --> 02:26:43,520
retribution cycle and there's an
 

8669
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:45,270
retribution cycle and there's an
escalation yes and it go

8670
02:26:45,270 --> 02:26:45,280
escalation yes and it go
 

8671
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:48,630
escalation yes and it go
and it creates a momentum of its own

8672
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:48,640
and it creates a momentum of its own
 

8673
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:50,389
and it creates a momentum of its own
which leads fundamentally if you follow

8674
02:26:50,389 --> 02:26:50,399
which leads fundamentally if you follow
 

8675
02:26:50,399 --> 02:26:51,670
which leads fundamentally if you follow
the chain of events down there

8676
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:51,680
the chain of events down there
 

8677
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:53,990
the chain of events down there
to some form of dictatorial government

8678
02:26:53,990 --> 02:26:54,000
to some form of dictatorial government
 

8679
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,670
to some form of dictatorial government
as the only way to

8680
02:26:55,670 --> 02:26:55,680
as the only way to
 

8681
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:57,510
as the only way to
create stability right you want to

8682
02:26:57,510 --> 02:26:57,520
create stability right you want to
 

8683
02:26:57,520 --> 02:26:59,349
create stability right you want to
destroy the republic and have a dictator

8684
02:26:59,349 --> 02:26:59,359
destroy the republic and have a dictator
 

8685
02:26:59,359 --> 02:27:00,710
destroy the republic and have a dictator
that's how you do and there are

8686
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:00,720
that's how you do and there are
 

8687
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:02,790
that's how you do and there are
parallels to nazi germany the burning of

8688
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:02,800
parallels to nazi germany the burning of
 

8689
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:04,469
parallels to nazi germany the burning of
the reichstag that you know blah blah

8695
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:09,750
i'm the doom caster again all right well
and some of it could be manufactured

8696
02:27:09,750 --> 02:27:09,760
and some of it could be manufactured
 

8697
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:11,910
and some of it could be manufactured
by the those seeking authoritarian power

8698
02:27:11,910 --> 02:27:11,920
by the those seeking authoritarian power

02:31:55,429 --> 02:31:55,439
person who was 18 and 15 would not be
 

8937

that different
 

8939
02:31:56,399 --> 02:31:57,590

8945
02:32:02,160 --> 02:32:04,710
would easily classify those two people
as being in the same generation

8946

as being in the same generation
now because of the speed of

now because of the speed of
technological change

8950
02:32:08,150 --> 02:32:08,160
technological change
 

8951
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:10,710

a better time easier time dealing with

9088
02:34:14,150 --> 02:34:14,160
a better time easier time dealing with
 

9089
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:15,670
a better time easier time dealing with
violence and things like that than they

9090
02:34:15,670 --> 02:34:15,680
violence and things like that than they
 

9091
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:15,990
violence and things like that than they
do

9092
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:16,000
do
 

9093
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,150
do
non-violence non-violence is really

9094
02:34:18,150 --> 02:34:18,160
non-violence non-violence is really
 

9095
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:19,670
non-violence non-violence is really
difficult for governments to deal with

9096
02:34:19,670 --> 02:34:19,680
difficult for governments to deal with
 

9097
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:20,790
difficult for governments to deal with
for example

9098
02:34:20,790 --> 02:34:20,800
for example
 

9099
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:24,150
for example
what happens to gandhi and jesus and

9100
02:34:24,150 --> 02:34:24,160
what happens to gandhi and jesus and
 

9101
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:25,910
what happens to gandhi and jesus and
martin luther king and you think about

9102
02:34:25,910 --> 02:34:25,920
martin luther king and you think about
 

9103
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,590
martin luther king and you think about
all those people right

9104
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:27,600
all those people right
 

9105
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:29,910
all those people right
when they're that day it's it's ironic

9106
02:34:29,910 --> 02:34:29,920
when they're that day it's it's ironic
 

9107
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:31,510
when they're that day it's it's ironic
isn't it that these people who push for

9108
02:34:31,510 --> 02:34:31,520
isn't it that these people who push for
 

9109
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:34,469
isn't it that these people who push for
peaceful solutions are so often killed

9110
02:34:34,469 --> 02:34:34,479
peaceful solutions are so often killed
 

9111
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:37,030
peaceful solutions are so often killed
but it's because they're effective and

9112
02:34:37,030 --> 02:34:37,040
but it's because they're effective and
 

9113
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:37,590
but it's because they're effective and
when they're

9114
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:37,600
when they're
 

9115
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:40,230
when they're
killed the effectiveness is diminished

9116
02:34:40,230 --> 02:34:40,240
killed the effectiveness is diminished
 

9117
02:34:40,240 --> 02:34:41,830
killed the effectiveness is diminished
why are they killed because they're

9118
02:34:41,830 --> 02:34:41,840
why are they killed because they're
 

9119
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:43,830
why are they killed because they're
effective and and the only way to stop

9120
02:34:43,830 --> 02:34:43,840
effective and and the only way to stop
 

9121
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,270
effective and and the only way to stop
them is to eliminate them because

9122
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:45,280
them is to eliminate them because
 

9123
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:45,910
them is to eliminate them because
they're

9124
02:34:45,910 --> 02:34:45,920
they're
 

9125
02:34:45,920 --> 02:34:48,469
they're
charismatic leaders who don't come

9126
02:34:48,469 --> 02:34:48,479
charismatic leaders who don't come
 

9127
02:34:48,479 --> 02:34:50,309
charismatic leaders who don't come
around every day and if you eliminate

9128
02:34:50,309 --> 02:34:50,319
around every day and if you eliminate
 

9129
02:34:50,319 --> 02:34:51,670
around every day and if you eliminate
them from the scene

9130
02:34:51,670 --> 02:34:51,680
them from the scene
 

9131
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:53,030
them from the scene
the odds are you're not going to get

9132
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:53,040
the odds are you're not going to get
 

9133
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:55,110
the odds are you're not going to get
another one for a while i guess what i'm

9134
02:34:55,110 --> 02:34:55,120
another one for a while i guess what i'm
 

9135
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:56,710
another one for a while i guess what i'm
saying is the very things you're talking

9136
02:34:56,710 --> 02:34:56,720
saying is the very things you're talking
 

9137
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:57,990
saying is the very things you're talking
about which would have the effect you

9138
02:34:57,990 --> 02:34:58,000
about which would have the effect you
 

9139
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,030
about which would have the effect you
think it would right they would

9140
02:34:59,030 --> 02:34:59,040
think it would right they would
 

9141
02:34:59,040 --> 02:34:59,990
think it would right they would
destabilize

9142
02:34:59,990 --> 02:35:00,000
destabilize
 

9143
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,309
destabilize
systems in a way that most of us would

9144
02:35:02,309 --> 02:35:02,319
systems in a way that most of us would
 

9145
02:35:02,319 --> 02:35:03,670
systems in a way that most of us would
consider positive

9146
02:35:03,670 --> 02:35:03,680
consider positive
 

9147
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:05,270
consider positive
but those systems have a way of

9148
02:35:05,270 --> 02:35:05,280
but those systems have a way of
 

9149
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:06,790
but those systems have a way of
protecting themselves

9150
02:35:06,790 --> 02:35:06,800
protecting themselves
 

9151
02:35:06,800 --> 02:35:09,830
protecting themselves
right and and so i i feel like

9152
02:35:09,830 --> 02:35:09,840
right and and so i i feel like
 

9153
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:11,590
right and and so i i feel like
history shows see history is pretty

9154
02:35:11,590 --> 02:35:11,600
history shows see history is pretty
 

9155
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:13,910
history shows see history is pretty
pessimistic i think by and large um

9156
02:35:13,910 --> 02:35:13,920
pessimistic i think by and large um
 

9157
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:15,670
pessimistic i think by and large um
if only because we can find so many

9158
02:35:15,670 --> 02:35:15,680
if only because we can find so many
 

9159
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:17,270
if only because we can find so many
examples that just sound passive

9160
02:35:17,270 --> 02:35:17,280
examples that just sound passive
 

9161
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:19,590
examples that just sound passive
but i feel like people who are dangerous

9162
02:35:19,590 --> 02:35:19,600
but i feel like people who are dangerous
 

9163
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:20,389
but i feel like people who are dangerous
to the way

9164
02:35:20,389 --> 02:35:20,399
to the way
 

9165
02:35:20,399 --> 02:35:24,150
to the way
things are tend to be removed

9166
02:35:24,150 --> 02:35:24,160
things are tend to be removed
 

9167
02:35:24,160 --> 02:35:27,110
things are tend to be removed
yes but there's two things to say i feel

02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:27,920
like you're right
 

9171
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:31,590
like you're right
that history i feel like

9172
02:35:31,590 --> 02:35:31,600
that history i feel like
 

9173
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:35,190
that history i feel like
the ripples that love leaves in history

9174
02:35:35,190 --> 02:35:35,200
the ripples that love leaves in history
 

9175
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:37,270
the ripples that love leaves in history
are less obvious to detect but are

9176
02:35:37,270 --> 02:35:37,280
are less obvious to detect but are
 

9177
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:38,309
are less obvious to detect but are
actually more

9178
02:35:38,309 --> 02:35:38,319
actually more
 

9179
02:35:38,319 --> 02:35:40,710
actually more
transformational like well one could

9180
02:35:40,710 --> 02:35:40,720
transformational like well one could
 

9181
02:35:40,720 --> 02:35:41,990
transformational like well one could
make a case about i mean if you want to

9182
02:35:41,990 --> 02:35:42,000
make a case about i mean if you want to
 

9183
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:42,870
make a case about i mean if you want to
talk about the

9184
02:35:42,870 --> 02:35:42,880
talk about the
 

9185
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:45,429
talk about the
the long-term value of a jesus a gandhi

9186
02:35:45,429 --> 02:35:45,439
the long-term value of a jesus a gandhi
 

9187
02:35:45,439 --> 02:35:46,870
the long-term value of a jesus a gandhi
yeah yes those people's ripples are

9188
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:46,880
yeah yes those people's ripples are
 

9189
02:35:46,880 --> 02:35:47,190
yeah yes those people's ripples are
still

9190
02:35:47,190 --> 02:35:47,200

9963
02:48:39,520 --> 02:48:40,630
it to people and all that and it was
years later

9964
02:48:40,630 --> 02:48:40,640
years later
 

9965
02:48:40,640 --> 02:48:42,230
years later
that we tried to figure out okay how can

9966
02:48:42,230 --> 02:48:42,240
that we tried to figure out okay how can
 

9967
02:48:42,240 --> 02:48:43,750
that we tried to figure out okay how can
we get enough money to just support us

9968
02:48:43,750 --> 02:48:43,760
we get enough money to just support us
 

9969
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:43,990
we get enough money to just support us
while

9970
02:48:43,990 --> 02:48:44,000
while
 

9971
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,670
while
we're doing this and we and the cheap

9972
02:48:45,670 --> 02:48:45,680
we're doing this and we and the cheap
 

9973
02:48:45,680 --> 02:48:47,269
we're doing this and we and the cheap
and the easy way was just to ask

9974
02:48:47,269 --> 02:48:47,279
and the easy way was just to ask
 

9975
02:48:47,279 --> 02:48:49,190
and the easy way was just to ask
listeners to donate like a pbs kind of

9976
02:48:49,190 --> 02:48:49,200
listeners to donate like a pbs kind of
 

9977
02:48:49,200 --> 02:48:49,910
listeners to donate like a pbs kind of
model and that was

9978
02:48:49,910 --> 02:48:49,920
model and that was
 

9979
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:53,590
model and that was
that was the original model um so then

9980
02:48:53,590 --> 02:48:53,600
that was the original model um so then
 

9981
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:55,590
that was the original model um so then
once we started down that we figured out

9982
02:48:55,590 --> 02:48:55,600
once we started down that we figured out
 

9983
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:57,110
once we started down that we figured out
other models and there's the advertising

9984
02:48:57,110 --> 02:48:57,120
other models and there's the advertising
 

9985
02:48:57,120 --> 02:48:57,590
other models and there's the advertising
thing and

9986
02:48:57,590 --> 02:48:57,600
thing and
 

9987
02:48:57,600 --> 02:48:59,349
thing and
we sell the old shows and so all these

9988
02:48:59,349 --> 02:48:59,359
we sell the old shows and so all these
 

9989
02:48:59,359 --> 02:49:01,990
we sell the old shows and so all these
became ways for us to support ourselves

9990

because some you know that's something
to be decided by other

but i mean we're trying to do art and
there's something very

10126
02:51:12,670 --> 02:51:12,680
there's something very
 

10127
02:51:12,680 --> 02:51:15,830
there's something very
satisfying in that but the part that i

10128
02:51:15,830 --> 02:51:15,840
satisfying in that but the part that i
 

10129
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:17,030
satisfying in that but the part that i
can't stand is

10130
02:51:17,030 --> 02:51:17,040
can't stand is
 

10131
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,190
can't stand is
the the increasing amount of time the

10132
02:51:19,190 --> 02:51:19,200
the the increasing amount of time the
 

10133

the problems that literally i mean just

10182
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:05,120
the problems that literally i mean just
 

10183
02:52:05,120 --> 02:52:06,630
the problems that literally i mean just
all the operating systems all the

10184
02:52:06,630 --> 02:52:06,640
all the operating systems all the

podcatchers
every time some new podcatcher comes out

10188
02:52:09,190 --> 02:52:09,200
every time some new podcatcher comes out

that's something we have to account for

10192
02:52:12,630 --> 02:52:12,640
that's something we have to account for
 

10193
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:14,070
that's something we have to account for
on the back end

10194
02:52:14,070 --> 02:52:14,080
on the back end
 

10195
02:52:14,080 --> 02:52:16,389
on the back end
and i'm not exactly the technological

10196
02:52:16,389 --> 02:52:16,399
and i'm not exactly the technological
 

10197
02:52:16,399 --> 02:52:17,670
and i'm not exactly the technological
wizard of all time

10198
02:52:17,670 --> 02:52:17,680
wizard of all time
 

10199
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:20,790
wizard of all time
so um i think it is maybe maybe the

10200
02:52:20,790 --> 02:52:20,800
so um i think it is maybe maybe the
 

10201
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:23,030
so um i think it is maybe maybe the
short answer is is that as the medium

10202
02:52:23,030 --> 02:52:23,040
short answer is is that as the medium
 

10203
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:24,150
short answer is is that as the medium
develops

10204
02:52:24,150 --> 02:52:24,160
develops
 

10205
02:52:24,160 --> 02:52:26,230
develops
it's becoming something that you have to

10206
02:52:26,230 --> 02:52:26,240
it's becoming something that you have to
 

10207
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:27,990

consider not because you want to sell

10208
02:52:27,990 --> 02:52:28,000
consider not because you want to sell
 

10209
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,309
consider not because you want to sell
out but because you want to keep going

10210
02:52:30,309 --> 02:52:30,319
out but because you want to keep going
 

10211
02:52:30,319 --> 02:52:32,389
out but because you want to keep going
and it's becoming harder and harder to

10212
02:52:32,389 --> 02:52:32,399
and it's becoming harder and harder to
 

10213
02:52:32,399 --> 02:52:32,790
and it's becoming harder and harder to
be

10214
02:52:32,790 --> 02:52:32,800
be
 

10215
02:52:32,800 --> 02:52:35,349
be
pirate-like in this environment the

10216
02:52:35,349 --> 02:52:35,359
pirate-like in this environment the
 

10217
02:52:35,359 --> 02:52:36,469
pirate-like in this environment the
thing that convinced me

10218
02:52:36,469 --> 02:52:36,479
thing that convinced me
 

10219
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:40,230
thing that convinced me
especially inside spotify is that

10220
02:52:40,230 --> 02:52:40,240
especially inside spotify is that
 

10221

especially inside spotify is that
they understand so if you walk

10222
02:52:43,590 --> 02:52:43,600
they understand so if you walk
 

10223
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:45,110
they understand so if you walk
into this whole thing with some

10224
02:52:45,110 --> 02:52:45,120
into this whole thing with some
 

10225
02:52:45,120 --> 02:52:47,190
into this whole thing with some
skepticism as you're saying of big

10226
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:47,200
skepticism as you're saying of big
 

10227
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:50,389
skepticism as you're saying of big
companies then then it works because

10228
02:52:50,389 --> 02:52:50,399
companies then then it works because
 

10229
02:52:50,399 --> 02:52:52,790
companies then then it works because

i'm not going to mention any names but
but up until recently the consolidation

10380
02:55:14,550 --> 02:55:14,560
but up until recently the consolidation
 

10381
02:55:14,560 --> 02:55:15,990
but up until recently the consolidation
was happening with relatively

10382
02:55:15,990 --> 02:55:16,000
was happening with relatively
 

10383
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:17,750
was happening with relatively
small firms compared to people like

10384

small firms compared to people like
 

10385
02:55:17,760 --> 02:55:20,469
small firms compared to people like
spotify and the problem was is that by

deciding to
 

10389
02:55:21,359 --> 02:55:23,510
deciding to
to consolidate your materials in a

to consolidate your materials in a
walled garden

10392
02:55:24,870 --> 02:55:24,880
walled garden
 

10393
02:55:24,880 --> 02:55:26,710
walled garden
you are walling yourself off from

10394
02:55:26,710 --> 02:55:26,720
you are walling yourself off from
 

10395
02:55:26,720 --> 02:55:27,990
you are walling yourself off from
audience right

10396
02:55:27,990 --> 02:55:28,000
audience right
 

10397
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:29,590
audience right
um so your choice is i'm going to accept

10398
02:55:29,590 --> 02:55:29,600
um so your choice is i'm going to accept
 

10399
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:31,190
um so your choice is i'm going to accept
this amount of money from this company

10400
02:55:31,190 --> 02:55:31,200
this amount of money from this company
 

10401
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:32,870
this amount of money from this company
but the loss is going to be a large

10402
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:32,880
but the loss is going to be a large
 

10403
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:34,230
but the loss is going to be a large
chunk of my audience and that's a

10404
02:55:34,230 --> 02:55:34,240
chunk of my audience and that's a
 

10405
02:55:34,240 --> 02:55:36,389
chunk of my audience and that's a
catch-22 because you're negotiating

10406
02:55:36,389 --> 02:55:36,399
catch-22 because you're negotiating
 

10407
02:55:36,399 --> 02:55:38,070
catch-22 because you're negotiating
power with that company is based on your

10408
02:55:38,070 --> 02:55:38,080
power with that company is based on your
 

10409
02:55:38,080 --> 02:55:39,110
power with that company is based on your
audience size

10410
02:55:39,110 --> 02:55:39,120
audience size
 

10411
02:55:39,120 --> 02:55:40,630
audience size
so signing up with them diminishes your

10412
02:55:40,630 --> 02:55:40,640
so signing up with them diminishes your
 

10413
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:43,429
so signing up with them diminishes your
audience size you lose negotiating power

10414
02:55:43,429 --> 02:55:43,439
audience size you lose negotiating power
 

10415
02:55:43,439 --> 02:55:46,070
audience size you lose negotiating power
but when you get to the level of the

03:02:58,800 --> 03:03:00,950
said during the show
that was the feeling that the people at

the time have and i think
at one point we said if this is starting

10888
03:03:04,150 --> 03:03:04,160
at one point we said if this is starting
 

10889
03:03:04,160 --> 03:03:06,950
at one point we said if this is starting
to seem gruesomely repetitive

10890
03:03:06,950 --> 03:03:06,960
to seem gruesomely repetitive
 

10891
03:03:06,960 --> 03:03:09,590
to seem gruesomely repetitive
now you know how the people at the time

10892
03:03:09,590 --> 03:03:09,600
now you know how the people at the time
 

10893
03:03:09,600 --> 03:03:09,990
now you know how the people at the time
felt

10894
03:03:09,990 --> 03:03:10,000

10895
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,710
felt
so in other words that had any sort of

03:03:12,710 --> 03:03:12,720
so in other words that had any sort of
 

10897
03:03:12,720 --> 03:03:14,230
so in other words that had any sort of
inadvertently because when you improvise

10898
03:03:14,230 --> 03:03:14,240
inadvertently because when you improvise
 

10899
03:03:14,240 --> 03:03:15,269
inadvertently because when you improvise
the show some of these things are

10900
03:03:15,269 --> 03:03:15,279
the show some of these things are
 

10901
03:03:15,279 --> 03:03:16,150
the show some of these things are
inadvertent

10902
03:03:16,150 --> 03:03:16,160
inadvertent
 

10903
03:03:16,160 --> 03:03:18,550
inadvertent
but it had inadvertently created the

10904
03:03:18,550 --> 03:03:18,560
but it had inadvertently created the
 

10905
03:03:18,560 --> 03:03:20,230
but it had inadvertently created the
right climate

10906
03:03:20,230 --> 03:03:20,240
right climate
 

10907
03:03:20,240 --> 03:03:23,269

03:03:23,269 --> 03:03:23,279
for having a sense of empathy with the
 

10909
03:03:23,279 --> 03:03:24,389
for having a sense of empathy with the

10911
03:03:24,399 --> 03:03:25,670
storyline
and to me that those are the

10912
03:03:25,670 --> 03:03:25,680
and to me that those are the
 

10913
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:27,670
and to me that those are the
serendipitous moments that make this art

10914
03:03:27,670 --> 03:03:27,680
serendipitous moments that make this art
 

10915
03:03:27,680 --> 03:03:28,630
serendipitous moments that make this art
and not

10916
03:03:28,630 --> 03:03:28,640

10917
03:03:28,640 --> 03:03:30,870
and not
uh some sort of paint by the numbers

10918
03:03:30,870 --> 03:03:30,880
uh some sort of paint by the numbers
 

10919
03:03:30,880 --> 03:03:32,389
uh some sort of paint by the numbers
kind of endeavor you know and

10920
03:03:32,389 --> 03:03:32,399
kind of endeavor you know and
 

10921
03:03:32,399 --> 03:03:34,550
kind of endeavor you know and
and that's to me that wouldn't have

10922
03:03:34,550 --> 03:03:34,560
and that's to me that wouldn't have
 

10923
03:03:34,560 --> 03:03:36,790
and that's to me that wouldn't have
happened had we scripted it out

10924
03:03:36,790 --> 03:03:36,800
happened had we scripted it out
 

10925
03:03:36,800 --> 03:03:39,830
happened had we scripted it out
so it's mostly you just bring the tools

10926
03:03:39,830 --> 03:03:39,840
so it's mostly you just bring the tools
 

10927
03:03:39,840 --> 03:03:42,870
so it's mostly you just bring the tools
of knowledge to the table and then in

10928
03:03:42,870 --> 03:03:42,880
of knowledge to the table and then in
 

10929
03:03:42,880 --> 03:03:43,590
of knowledge to the table and then in
large part

11450
03:11:11,269 --> 03:11:11,279
it's
 

11451
03:11:11,279 --> 03:11:13,030
it's
outdated because there's all this new

11452
03:11:13,030 --> 03:11:13,040
outdated because there's all this new
 

11453
03:11:13,040 --> 03:11:14,950
outdated because there's all this new
stuff from the former soviet union

11454
03:11:14,950 --> 03:11:14,960
stuff from the former soviet union
 

11455
03:11:14,960 --> 03:11:16,309
stuff from the former soviet union
and you do you turn around and you go

11456
03:11:16,309 --> 03:11:16,319
and you do you turn around and you go
 

11457
03:11:16,319 --> 03:11:18,150
and you do you turn around and you go
okay um they're right

11458
03:11:18,150 --> 03:11:18,160
okay um they're right
 

11459
03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:21,510
okay um they're right
and so when you talk about hitler

11460
03:11:21,510 --> 03:11:21,520
and so when you talk about hitler
 

11461
03:11:21,520 --> 03:11:23,269
and so when you talk about hitler
it's very interesting to think about how

11462
03:11:23,269 --> 03:11:23,279
it's very interesting to think about how
 

11463
03:11:23,279 --> 03:11:25,030
it's very interesting to think about how
i would do a hitler show today versus

11464
03:11:25,030 --> 03:11:25,040
i would do a hitler show today versus
 

11465
03:11:25,040 --> 03:11:25,910
i would do a hitler show today versus
how i did one

11466
03:11:25,910 --> 03:11:25,920
how i did one
 

11467
03:11:25,920 --> 03:11:28,070
how i did one
10 years ago um and you would think well

11468
03:11:28,070 --> 03:11:28,080
10 years ago um and you would think well
 

11469
03:11:28,080 --> 03:11:29,349
10 years ago um and you would think well
what's new i mean it happened so long

11470
03:11:29,349 --> 03:11:29,359
what's new i mean it happened so long
 

11471
03:11:29,359 --> 03:11:30,550
what's new i mean it happened so long
but there's lots of new stuff and

11472
03:11:30,550 --> 03:11:30,560
but there's lots of new stuff and
 

11473
03:11:30,560 --> 03:11:32,229
but there's lots of new stuff and
there's lots of new scholarship and

11474
03:11:32,229 --> 03:11:32,239
there's lots of new scholarship and
 

11475
03:11:32,239 --> 03:11:34,389
there's lots of new scholarship and
and so um yeah i would think that would

11476
03:11:34,389 --> 03:11:34,399
and so um yeah i would think that would
 

11477
03:11:34,399 --> 03:11:36,070
and so um yeah i would think that would
be an interesting one to do someday

11478
03:11:36,070 --> 03:11:36,080
be an interesting one to do someday
 

11479
03:11:36,080 --> 03:11:37,910
be an interesting one to do someday
uh i i haven't thought about that that's

11480
03:11:37,910 --> 03:11:37,920
uh i i haven't thought about that that's
 

11481
03:11:37,920 --> 03:11:39,349
uh i i haven't thought about that that's
not in the back pocket

11482
03:11:39,349 --> 03:11:39,359
not in the back pocket
 

11483
03:11:39,359 --> 03:11:40,950
not in the back pocket
but uh but yeah that'd be interesting i

11484
03:11:40,950 --> 03:11:40,960
but uh but yeah that'd be interesting i
 

11485
03:11:40,960 --> 03:11:42,790
but uh but yeah that'd be interesting i
have a disproportionate amount of power

11486
03:11:42,790 --> 03:11:42,800
have a disproportionate amount of power
 

11487
03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:43,269
have a disproportionate amount of power
because

11488
03:11:43,269 --> 03:11:43,279
because
 

11489
03:11:43,279 --> 03:11:46,150
because
i trapped you somehow in the room and

11490
03:11:46,150 --> 03:11:46,160
i trapped you somehow in the room and
 

11491
03:11:46,160 --> 03:11:46,790
i trapped you somehow in the room and
and thereby

11492
03:11:46,790 --> 03:11:46,800
and thereby
 

11493
03:11:46,800 --> 03:11:50,229
and thereby

us with the ancients right

us with the ancients right
that's the part that always makes

11810
03:16:46,870 --> 03:16:46,880
that's the part that always makes
 

11811
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:49,110
that's the part that always makes
history sound like it rhymes

11812

history sound like it rhymes
 

11813
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:52,150
history sound like it rhymes
you know and when you put

11814
03:16:52,150 --> 03:16:52,160
you know and when you put
 

11815
03:16:52,160 --> 03:16:54,630
you know and when you put
the constant the human element and you

11816
03:16:54,630 --> 03:16:54,640
the constant the human element and you
 

11817
03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:55,750
the constant the human element and you
mix it with

11818
03:16:55,750 --> 03:16:55,760
mix it with
 

11819
03:16:55,760 --> 03:16:57,590
mix it with
systems that are similar so one of the

11820
03:16:57,590 --> 03:16:57,600
systems that are similar so one of the
 

11821
03:16:57,600 --> 03:16:59,429
systems that are similar so one of the
reasons that the ancient roman republic

11822
03:16:59,429 --> 03:16:59,439
reasons that the ancient roman republic
 

11823
03:16:59,439 --> 03:17:00,710
reasons that the ancient roman republic
is something that people

11824
03:17:00,710 --> 03:17:00,720
is something that people
 

11825
03:17:00,720 --> 03:17:03,269
is something that people
point to all the time um as a as

11826
03:17:03,269 --> 03:17:03,279
point to all the time um as a as
 

11827
03:17:03,279 --> 03:17:04,229
point to all the time um as a as
something that seems like we're

11828
03:17:04,229 --> 03:17:04,239
something that seems like we're
 

11829
03:17:04,239 --> 03:17:05,750
something that seems like we're
repeating history is because you have

11830
03:17:05,750 --> 03:17:05,760
repeating history is because you have
 

11831
03:17:05,760 --> 03:17:06,469
repeating history is because you have
the two con

11832
03:17:06,469 --> 03:17:06,479
the two con
 

11833
03:17:06,479 --> 03:17:08,870
the two con
you have humans just like you had then

11834
03:17:08,870 --> 03:17:08,880
you have humans just like you had then
 

11835
03:17:08,880 --> 03:17:10,790
you have humans just like you had then
and you have a system that resembles

11836
03:17:10,790 --> 03:17:10,800
and you have a system that resembles
 

11837
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:12,870
and you have a system that resembles
the one we have here so you throw the

11838
03:17:12,870 --> 03:17:12,880
the one we have here so you throw the
 

11839
03:17:12,880 --> 03:17:14,550
the one we have here so you throw the
constant in with a system that is

11840
03:17:14,550 --> 03:17:14,560
constant in with a system that is
 

11841
03:17:14,560 --> 03:17:15,750
constant in with a system that is
somewhat similar

11842
03:17:15,750 --> 03:17:15,760
somewhat similar
 

11843
03:17:15,760 --> 03:17:17,590
somewhat similar
and you begin to see things that look

11844
03:17:17,590 --> 03:17:17,600
and you begin to see things that look
 

11845
03:17:17,600 --> 03:17:19,030
and you begin to see things that look
like they rhyme a little

11846
03:17:19,030 --> 03:17:19,040
like they rhyme a little
 

11847
03:17:19,040 --> 03:17:21,750
like they rhyme a little
um so for me i'm always trying to figure

11848
03:17:21,750 --> 03:17:21,760
um so for me i'm always trying to figure
 

11849
03:17:21,760 --> 03:17:22,870
um so for me i'm always trying to figure
out more about

11850
03:17:22,870 --> 03:17:22,880
out more about
 

11851
03:17:22,880 --> 03:17:26,150
out more about
us and when you show us in uh

11852
03:17:26,150 --> 03:17:26,160
us and when you show us in uh
 

11853
03:17:26,160 --> 03:17:29,990
us and when you show us in uh
500 years ago in asia and 800 years ago

11854
03:17:29,990 --> 03:17:30,000
500 years ago in asia and 800 years ago
 

11855
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:31,590
500 years ago in asia and 800 years ago
in africa and you look at all these

11856
03:17:31,590 --> 03:17:31,600
in africa and you look at all these
 

11857
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:33,349
in africa and you look at all these
different places that you put

11858
03:17:33,349 --> 03:17:33,359
different places that you put
 

11859
03:17:33,359 --> 03:17:35,830
different places that you put
the guinea pig in and you watch how the

11860
03:17:35,830 --> 03:17:35,840
the guinea pig in and you watch how the
 

11861
03:17:35,840 --> 03:17:37,670
the guinea pig in and you watch how the
guinea pig responds to the different

03:17:37,670 --> 03:17:37,680
guinea pig responds to the different
 

11863
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:38,469

11923
03:18:43,359 --> 03:18:45,830
wise enough to to uh
propose a theory myself but i'm

11924
03:18:45,830 --> 03:18:45,840
propose a theory myself but i'm
 

11925
