00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,589

and this is a theme that i thought

176
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
and this is a theme that i thought
 

177
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,030
and this is a theme that i thought
needed to be shared

178
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
needed to be shared
 

179
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,390
needed to be shared
and needed to be

180
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
and needed to be
 

181
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,070

made communicable to the to the lay

182
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
made communicable to the to the lay
 

183
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,630

but of course it's a spectrum and there

in psychiatry we're careful to say we

in psychiatry we're careful to say we
 

265
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,110
in psychiatry we're careful to say we
don't call it a disease or a disorder

266
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
don't call it a disease or a disorder
 

267
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,070
don't call it a disease or a disorder
unless there's a disruption in social or

unless there's a disruption in social or

but of course psychiatry has a long way

but of course psychiatry has a long way
 

273
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,310
but of course psychiatry has a long way
to go in terms of developing

to go in terms of developing
 

275
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,749

and so that line ultimately
 

283
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,749
and so that line ultimately
that you're asking about between order

284
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
that you're asking about between order
 

285
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,230
that you're asking about between order

can we just like linger on the terms for

can we just like linger on the terms for

how careful should we be using those

how careful should we be using those

how careful should we be using those
words can we just even in this

maladies like
 

327
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,350
maladies like
just to use the word dysfunction and

just to use the word dysfunction and

i would say to give ourselves license to

i would say to give ourselves license to
 

333
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,310
i would say to give ourselves license to
capture the whole spectrum let's say

capture the whole spectrum let's say
 

335
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,670
capture the whole spectrum let's say
disorder because that that captures

disorder because that that captures
 

337
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,670

truly i think the essence of it which is

truly i think the essence of it which is
 

339
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,110
truly i think the essence of it which is
we need to talk about it when it's not

340
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
we need to talk about it when it's not
 

341
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,990
we need to talk about it when it's not
working when there's disorder and that

342
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
working when there's disorder and that
 

343
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,469
working when there's disorder and that
that's the fairest and

344
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
that's the fairest and
 

345
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,909
that's the fairest and
you know most uh inclusive term to use

346
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
you know most uh inclusive term to use
 

347
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,110
you know most uh inclusive term to use
so is it fair to assume that basically

348
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
so is it fair to assume that basically
 

349
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,070
so is it fair to assume that basically
every

350
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
every
 

351
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,790
every
member of the human species suffers from

352
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
member of the human species suffers from
 

353
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,189
member of the human species suffers from
a large number of disorders then

354
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
a large number of disorders then
 

355
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,430
a large number of disorders then
well and we just have to pick which ones

356
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
well and we just have to pick which ones
 

357
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,950
well and we just have to pick which ones
are are debilitating and for each person

358
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
are are debilitating and for each person
 

359
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,070
are are debilitating and for each person
you know if you if you look at the

360
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
you know if you if you look at the
 

361
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,029
you know if you if you look at the
numbers

362
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
numbers
 

363
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,070
numbers
there are

364
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
there are
 

365
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,950
there are
uh

366
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
uh
 

367
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,029
uh
you know if you look at how our mental

368
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
you know if you look at how our mental
 

369
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,710
you know if you look at how our mental
health disorders are currently defined

370
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
health disorders are currently defined
 

371
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,909
health disorders are currently defined
you can uh look at population prevalence

372
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
you can uh look at population prevalence
 

373
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,670
you can uh look at population prevalence
values for all these disorders and you

374
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:35,680
values for all these disorders and you
 

375
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,870
values for all these disorders and you
can

376
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
can
 

377
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,189
can
come up with estimates that

378
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
come up with estimates that
 

379
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,309
come up with estimates that
somebody

380
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
somebody
 

381
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,230
somebody
will have a lifetime prevalence of

382
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
will have a lifetime prevalence of
 

383
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,110
will have a lifetime prevalence of
having a psychiatric disorder that

384
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
having a psychiatric disorder that
 

385
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,469
having a psychiatric disorder that
approaches 25 or so and so that's

386
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
approaches 25 or so and so that's
 

387
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,070
approaches 25 or so and so that's
and in some studies it could be more

388
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
and in some studies it could be more
 

389
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,990
and in some studies it could be more
some studies it could be less now what

390
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
some studies it could be less now what
 

391
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,589
some studies it could be less now what
do we do with that number what does that

392
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
do we do with that number what does that
 

393
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,430
do we do with that number what does that
mean and in some ways that's the essence

394
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
mean and in some ways that's the essence
 

395
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,150
mean and in some ways that's the essence
of what i was hoping to approach with

396
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
of what i was hoping to approach with
 

397
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,070
of what i was hoping to approach with
uh the book is to reflect on this

398
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
uh the book is to reflect on this
 

399
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,350
uh the book is to reflect on this
spectrum that exists for all the

400
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
spectrum that exists for all the
 

401
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,270
spectrum that exists for all the
disorders there is

402
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
disorders there is
 

403
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,790
disorders there is
and taking nothing away from the

404
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
and taking nothing away from the
 

405
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,629
and taking nothing away from the
severity and the suffering that comes at

406
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
severity and the suffering that comes at
 

407
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,029
severity and the suffering that comes at
the extreme end of these illnesses but

408
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
the extreme end of these illnesses but
 

409
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,629
the extreme end of these illnesses but
nearly every one of them exists on a

410
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
nearly every one of them exists on a
 

411
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,430
nearly every one of them exists on a
spectrum of severity from

412
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
spectrum of severity from
 

413
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,749
spectrum of severity from
nearly functional to completely

00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
nearly functional to completely
 

415
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,670
nearly functional to completely
dysfunctional life-threatening and and

00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
dysfunctional life-threatening and and
 

417
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,110
dysfunctional life-threatening and and
even fatal

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
even fatal
 

419
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,150
even fatal
and so that that that number 25 more or

420
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
and so that that that number 25 more or
 

421
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,909
and so that that that number 25 more or
less it doesn't capture

00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
less it doesn't capture
 

423
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,990
less it doesn't capture
uh that that spectrum of

uh that that spectrum of
 

425
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,790
uh that that spectrum of
of uh severity to regard that number

426
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
of uh severity to regard that number
 

427
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,550
of uh severity to regard that number
where do those numbers come from is it

428
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
where do those numbers come from is it
 

429
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,710
where do those numbers come from is it
self-report is it people who

430
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
self-report is it people who
 

431
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,270
self-report is it people who
show up and say i need help is it

432
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,280
show up and say i need help is it
 

433
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,029
show up and say i need help is it
somebody else that points out that

434
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
somebody else that points out that
 

435
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,710
somebody else that points out that
person needs help

436
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
person needs help
 

437
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,230
person needs help
or is it like estimates that even go

438
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
or is it like estimates that even go
 

439
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,469
or is it like estimates that even go
beyond that for people who don't ask for

440
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
beyond that for people who don't ask for
 

441
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,550
beyond that for people who don't ask for
help or suffering quietly

442
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
help or suffering quietly
 

443
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,550
help or suffering quietly
alone when you look at self-report

444
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
alone when you look at self-report
 

445
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,469
alone when you look at self-report
numbers that then those numbers get even

446
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
numbers that then those numbers get even
 

447
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,469
numbers that then those numbers get even
higher beyond 25 percent or more

448
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479

 

449
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,430

those the most rigorous studies are

450
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
those the most rigorous studies are
 

451
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,950
those the most rigorous studies are
done with structured psychiatric

452
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
done with structured psychiatric
 

453
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,629
done with structured psychiatric
interviews where people

interviews where people
 

455
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,510
interviews where people
who are trained in eliciting symptoms

who are trained in eliciting symptoms
 

457
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,749
who are trained in eliciting symptoms
carefully do complete psychiatric

carefully do complete psychiatric

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,990
carefully do complete psychiatric
inventories of of individuals and these

inventories of of individuals and these
 

461
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,430
inventories of of individuals and these
are

462
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
are
 

463
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,749
are
time-consuming laborious studies that

464
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
time-consuming laborious studies that
 

465
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,189
time-consuming laborious studies that
not often repeated when they're done

466
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
not often repeated when they're done
 

467
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,029
not often repeated when they're done
they're they're done well

468
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
they're they're done well
 

469
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,390
they're they're done well
but

470
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
but
 

471
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,909
but
very often you'll see a report or

472
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
very often you'll see a report or
 

473
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,830
very often you'll see a report or
something in the news of a very high

474
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
something in the news of a very high
 

475
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,950
something in the news of a very high
number

476
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
number
 

477
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,390
number
for some disorder or or symptom and very

478
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
for some disorder or or symptom and very
 

479
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,270
for some disorder or or symptom and very
often

480
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:23,280
often
 

481
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,790
often
if it's shockingly high that's coming

482
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
if it's shockingly high that's coming
 

483
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,749
if it's shockingly high that's coming
from a self-report of a person

484
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
from a self-report of a person
 

485
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,830
from a self-report of a person
and so that's another another issue that

486
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
and so that's another another issue that
 

487
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,070
and so that's another another issue that
we have again take nothing away from the

488
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
we have again take nothing away from the
 

489
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,550
we have again take nothing away from the
severity and reality and and biological

490
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:34,560
severity and reality and and biological
 

491
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,230
severity and reality and and biological
nature of these disorders which are very

492
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
nature of these disorders which are very
 

493
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,630
nature of these disorders which are very
genetic very you know we we understand

494
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
genetic very you know we we understand
 

495
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,790
genetic very you know we we understand
that these are very biological

496
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
that these are very biological
 

497
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,750
that these are very biological
and yet

498
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
and yet
 

499
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,509
and yet
we lack right now the lab tests and the

500
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
we lack right now the lab tests and the
 

501
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,750
we lack right now the lab tests and the
blood draws to make the diagnoses we'll

502
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
blood draws to make the diagnoses we'll
 

503
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,910
blood draws to make the diagnoses we'll
talk about it just how biological they

504
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
talk about it just how biological they
 

505
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,790
talk about it just how biological they
are because it's a that too is a mystery

506
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
are because it's a that too is a mystery
 

507
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,829
are because it's a that too is a mystery
i mean

508
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
i mean
 

509
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,590
i mean
you know in terms of from a perspective

510
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
you know in terms of from a perspective
 

511
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,509
you know in terms of from a perspective
of how to probe into the disease how to

512
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
of how to probe into the disease how to
 

513
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,829
of how to probe into the disease how to
understand it and how to help it so some

514
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
understand it and how to help it so some
 

515
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,910
understand it and how to help it so some
of it could be neurobiological

516
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
of it could be neurobiological
 

517
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,829
of it could be neurobiological
some of it could be

518
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
some of it could be
 

519
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,710
some of it could be
uh just the the dance of human emotion

520
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
uh just the the dance of human emotion
 

521
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,630
uh just the the dance of human emotion
and interaction and the

522
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
and interaction and the
 

523
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,550
and interaction and the
it's like uh

524
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
it's like uh
 

525
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,590
it's like uh
well it is love when it works and is

526
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
well it is love when it works and is
 

527
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,230
well it is love when it works and is
love when it breaks down uh biological

528
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
love when it breaks down uh biological
 

529
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,470
love when it breaks down uh biological
or is it something else so we're gonna

530
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
or is it something else so we're gonna
 

531
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,310
or is it something else so we're gonna
talk about it but let me just like to

532
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
talk about it but let me just like to
 

533
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,350
talk about it but let me just like to
linger in terms of disorder

534
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
linger in terms of disorder
 

535
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,350
linger in terms of disorder
what about genius

536
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
what about genius
 

537
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,670
what about genius
you know that sort of uh cliche saying

538
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
you know that sort of uh cliche saying
 

539
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,790
you know that sort of uh cliche saying
like the

540
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
like the
 

541
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,630
like the
madness and genius that they kind of

542
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
madness and genius that they kind of
 

543
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,550
madness and genius that they kind of
danced together uh

544
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
danced together uh
 

545
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,949
danced together uh
what about if the thing we see is this

546
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
what about if the thing we see is this
 

547
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,550
what about if the thing we see is this
order is actually

548
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
order is actually
 

549
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,389
order is actually
genius unheard or misunderstood

550
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
genius unheard or misunderstood
 

551
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,389
genius unheard or misunderstood
well here again the numbers help us and

552
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
well here again the numbers help us and
 

553
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,670
well here again the numbers help us and
here's where being rigorous and

554
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:41,680
here's where being rigorous and
 

555
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,269
here's where being rigorous and
quantitative actually really helps if

556
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
quantitative actually really helps if
 

557
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,990
quantitative actually really helps if
you look at disorders like autism

558
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
you look at disorders like autism
 

559
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,389
you look at disorders like autism
and bipolar disorder

560
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
and bipolar disorder
 

561
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,190
and bipolar disorder
and eating disorders anorexia nervosa

562
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
and eating disorders anorexia nervosa
 

563
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,030
and eating disorders anorexia nervosa
for example

564
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
for example
 

565
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,070
for example
these uh you know particularly bipolar

566
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
these uh you know particularly bipolar
 

567
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,230
these uh you know particularly bipolar
and anorexia these can be fatal

568
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
and anorexia these can be fatal
 

569
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,630
and anorexia these can be fatal
they can cause immense suffering

570
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
they can cause immense suffering
 

571
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,509
they can cause immense suffering
but they are heavily genetic all three

572
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
but they are heavily genetic all three
 

573
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,389
but they are heavily genetic all three
of these

574
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
of these
 

575
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,509
of these
and

576
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
and
 

577
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,110
and
what's very interesting is each one of

578
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
what's very interesting is each one of
 

579
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,870
what's very interesting is each one of
these three is actually correlated

580
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
these three is actually correlated
 

581
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,389
these three is actually correlated
positively

582
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
positively
 

583
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,590
positively
positively with measures of intelligence

584
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
positively with measures of intelligence
 

585
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,389
positively with measures of intelligence
of educational attainment

586
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
of educational attainment
 

587
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,790
of educational attainment
and even of income and so you look at

588
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
and even of income and so you look at
 

589
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,630
and even of income and so you look at
this severe disorders in many cases

590
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
this severe disorders in many cases
 

591
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,990
this severe disorders in many cases
causing

592
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
causing
 

593
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,389
causing
quite immense morbidity and mortality

594
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
quite immense morbidity and mortality
 

595
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,430
quite immense morbidity and mortality
and yet

596
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
and yet
 

597
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,949
and yet
they are positively correlated at the

598
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
they are positively correlated at the
 

599
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,030
they are positively correlated at the
population level with positive things

600
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
population level with positive things
 

601
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,509
population level with positive things

835
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,389
people
and it kind of

836
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:30,399
and it kind of
 

837
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,150
and it kind of
it makes me feel all kinds of ways but

838
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,160
it makes me feel all kinds of ways but
 

839
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,150
it makes me feel all kinds of ways but
that story reminds me that

840
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
that story reminds me that
 

841
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,150
that story reminds me that
like you just might be

842
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
like you just might be
 

843
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,670
like you just might be
one of the greatest

844
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:37,680
one of the greatest
 

845
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,750
one of the greatest
writers of the 21st century for example

846
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
writers of the 21st century for example
 

847
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,430
writers of the 21st century for example
if somebody were to tell me that and

848
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
if somebody were to tell me that and
 

849
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,629
if somebody were to tell me that and
like don't

850
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
like don't
 

851
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,790
like don't
just don't immediately disregard that

852
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
just don't immediately disregard that
 

853
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,110
just don't immediately disregard that
because one of the people that say that

854
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
because one of the people that say that
 

855
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,110
because one of the people that say that
that's almost like a pre-condition

856
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
that's almost like a pre-condition
 

857
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,550
that's almost like a pre-condition
that's like a requirement just to

858
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
that's like a requirement just to
 

859
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,150
that's like a requirement just to
believe in yourself maybe it's not a

860
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,160
believe in yourself maybe it's not a
 

861
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,990
believe in yourself maybe it's not a
full requirement but it's it's an

862
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
full requirement but it's it's an
 

863
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,949
full requirement but it's it's an
interesting story

864
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959

 

865
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,389

i think when someone tells you that then

866
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
i think when someone tells you that then
 

867
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,030
i think when someone tells you that then
it creates uh

868
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
it creates uh
 

869
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,030
it creates uh
one sees an opportunity and then it

870
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
one sees an opportunity and then it
 

871
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,550
one sees an opportunity and then it
would be a tragedy if the opportunity

872
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
would be a tragedy if the opportunity
 

873
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,990
would be a tragedy if the opportunity
weren't captured right and so then that

874
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
weren't captured right and so then that
 

875
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,110
weren't captured right and so then that
creates a um some some impetus uh some

876
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
creates a um some some impetus uh some
 

877
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,030
creates a um some some impetus uh some
motivation to do something

878
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
motivation to do something
 

879
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,269
motivation to do something
something good i think the mind it's

880
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
something good i think the mind it's
 

881
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,470
something good i think the mind it's
like uh

882
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
like uh
 

883
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,470
like uh
you know i guess that's what like books

884
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
you know i guess that's what like books
 

885

887
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,590
like the books or whatever i don't even
know if it's a book the secret plugs

888
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
know if it's a book the secret plugs
 

889
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,470
know if it's a book the secret plugs
into uh they kind of make a whole

890
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
into uh they kind of make a whole
 

891
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,990
into uh they kind of make a whole
industry out of it but there is

892
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
industry out of it but there is
 

893
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,430
industry out of it but there is
something about

894
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
something about
 

895
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,590
something about
the mind believing something making it a

896
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
the mind believing something making it a
 

897
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,069
the mind believing something making it a
reality it is just time and time again

919
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,509

you know all the beautiful ways that

you know all the beautiful ways that
 

921
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,550
you know all the beautiful ways that

923
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,350

you know you mentioned love earlier i

926
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
you know you mentioned love earlier i
 

927
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,310
you know you mentioned love earlier i
mean that's that's a great example of

928
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
mean that's that's a great example of
 

929
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,790
mean that's that's a great example of
how belief in something makes it real

930
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
how belief in something makes it real
 

931
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,269
how belief in something makes it real
right it's it's not reasonable

932
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:07,279
right it's it's not reasonable
 

933
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,629
right it's it's not reasonable
on the face of it but because you

934
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
on the face of it but because you
 

935
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,910
on the face of it but because you
believe it's reasonable then it actually

936
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:09,920
believe it's reasonable then it actually
 

937
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,189
believe it's reasonable then it actually
does become reasonable and then it is

938
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
does become reasonable and then it is
 

939
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,710
does become reasonable and then it is
real and so that's a that's a good

940
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
real and so that's a that's a good
 

941
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,310
real and so that's a that's a good
example that doesn't happen i'm also in

942
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
example that doesn't happen i'm also in
 

943
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,470
example that doesn't happen i'm also in
a bioengineering department we don't

imagine that a bridge is soundly built

946
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:18,320
imagine that a bridge is soundly built
 

947
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,150
imagine that a bridge is soundly built
and then it is soundly built that's

948
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
and then it is soundly built that's
 

949
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,829
and then it is soundly built that's
something that it doesn't come up in too

950
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
something that it doesn't come up in too
 

951
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,509
something that it doesn't come up in too
many realms of human existence but love

952
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
many realms of human existence but love
 

953
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,069
many realms of human existence but love
is one of them and and these the ability

954
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
is one of them and and these the ability
 

955
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,350
is one of them and and these the ability
to

956
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
to
 

957
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,069
to
to have a fixed idea and to say it's

958
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
to have a fixed idea and to say it's
 

959
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,150
to have a fixed idea and to say it's
true and then it is true

960
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
true and then it is true
 

961
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,150
true and then it is true
a bridge is a kind of manifestation of

962
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
a bridge is a kind of manifestation of
 

963
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,829
a bridge is a kind of manifestation of
love so maybe it does work a little bit

964
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
love so maybe it does work a little bit
 

965
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,350
love so maybe it does work a little bit
but you know they can break down like

966
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
but you know they can break down like
 

967
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,430
but you know they can break down like
chernobyl did you can't just say it's

968
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:39,440
chernobyl did you can't just say it's
 

969
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,629
chernobyl did you can't just say it's
safe you have to also prove it safe

970
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
safe you have to also prove it safe
 

971
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,189
safe you have to also prove it safe
uh but on finnegan's wake

972
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:45,199
uh but on finnegan's wake
 

973
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:46,949
uh but on finnegan's wake
i think maybe correct me if i'm wrong

974
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:46,959
i think maybe correct me if i'm wrong
 

975
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,350
i think maybe correct me if i'm wrong
you're using kind of finnegan's wake to

976
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
you're using kind of finnegan's wake to
 

977
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,069
you're using kind of finnegan's wake to
give one perspective on what madness is

978
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
give one perspective on what madness is
 

979
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,990
give one perspective on what madness is
of what's going on in the mind how much

980
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
of what's going on in the mind how much
 

981
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,230
of what's going on in the mind how much
of that is

982
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,240
of that is
 

983
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,430
of that is
uh that we're simply unable

984
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
uh that we're simply unable
 

985
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,030
uh that we're simply unable
to communicate with the person on the

986
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
to communicate with the person on the
 

987

other side
 

989
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,230
other side
of of their mind like there's almost

990
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
of of their mind like there's almost
 

991
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,270
of of their mind like there's almost
like a

992
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
like a
 

993
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,669
like a
a little person inside the brain and

994
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:07,679
a little person inside the brain and
 

995
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,309
a little person inside the brain and
they have some circuitry that's used to

996
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
they have some circuitry that's used to
 

997
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,789
they have some circuitry that's used to
communicate emotion communicate ideas to

998
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:12,799
communicate emotion communicate ideas to
 

999
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,549
communicate emotion communicate ideas to
the outside world and there's something

1000
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
the outside world and there's something
 

1001
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,069
the outside world and there's something
about that circuitry that makes it

1002
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
about that circuitry that makes it
 

1003
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,510
about that circuitry that makes it
difficult to communicate with a little

1004
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
difficult to communicate with a little
 

1005
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,270
difficult to communicate with a little
person on the other side so if you look

1006
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
person on the other side so if you look
 

1007
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,510
person on the other side so if you look
at what shows up in schizophrenia with

1008
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
at what shows up in schizophrenia with
 

1009
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,350
at what shows up in schizophrenia with
many cases the

1010
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
many cases the
 

1011
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,350
many cases the
what we call thought disorders what we

1012
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
what we call thought disorders what we
 

1013
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,390
what we call thought disorders what we
call

1014
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
call
 

1015
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,150
call
uh the

1016
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,160
uh the
 

1017
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,310
uh the
the individual speech symptoms of

1018
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
the individual speech symptoms of
 

1019
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,590
the individual speech symptoms of
schizophrenia

1020
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
schizophrenia
 

1021
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,590
schizophrenia
finnegan's wake is is loaded with them

1022
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:33,600
finnegan's wake is is loaded with them
 

1023
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,590
finnegan's wake is is loaded with them
and it's it's just full of them we we

1024
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
and it's it's just full of them we we
 

1025
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,110
and it's it's just full of them we we
talk about uh

1026
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
talk about uh
 

1027
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,750
talk about uh
clang associations in schizophrenia

1028
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
clang associations in schizophrenia
 

1029
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,950
clang associations in schizophrenia
where the word that is said is

1030
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
where the word that is said is
 

1031
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,710
where the word that is said is
echoes in some way the previous word and

1032
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
echoes in some way the previous word and
 

1033
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,789
echoes in some way the previous word and
it's we call that a clang association

1034
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
it's we call that a clang association
 

1035
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,990
it's we call that a clang association
because there's no other reason than the

1036
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
because there's no other reason than the
 

1037
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,830
because there's no other reason than the
similarity of the sound like a like a

1038
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
similarity of the sound like a like a
 

1039
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,270
similarity of the sound like a like a
clang of a

1040
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
clang of a
 

1041
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,110
clang of a
of a garage door being hit and it has a

1042
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
of a garage door being hit and it has a
 

1043
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,549
of a garage door being hit and it has a
and sometimes it's not even a word and

1044
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
and sometimes it's not even a word and
 

1045
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,190
and sometimes it's not even a word and
we call that a neologism a new word

1046
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
we call that a neologism a new word
 

1047
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,870
we call that a neologism a new word
being created and of course finnegan's

1048
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:00,880
being created and of course finnegan's
 

1049
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,190
being created and of course finnegan's
wake is is full of that and then

1050
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
wake is is full of that and then
 

1051
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,190
wake is is full of that and then
uh we we also in schizophrenia where

1052
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,200
uh we we also in schizophrenia where
 

1053
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,870
uh we we also in schizophrenia where
there's what we call loose associations

1054
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
there's what we call loose associations
 

1055
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,990
there's what we call loose associations
or tangential thought processes of

1056
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,000
or tangential thought processes of
 

1057
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,510
or tangential thought processes of
course full of that where things just go

1058
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
course full of that where things just go
 

1059
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,070
course full of that where things just go
off in directions that are not linear or

1060
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
off in directions that are not linear or
 

1061
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,190
off in directions that are not linear or
logical

1062
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
logical
 

1063
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,070
logical
and

1064
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,080
and
 

1065
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,470
and
you can't read finnegan's wake i think

1066
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
you can't read finnegan's wake i think
 

1067
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,390
you can't read finnegan's wake i think
without um

1068
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
without um
 

1069
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,909
without um
certainly a psychiatrist you can't read

1070
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
certainly a psychiatrist you can't read
 

1071
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,990
certainly a psychiatrist you can't read
it without thinking about schizophrenia

1072
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
it without thinking about schizophrenia
 

1073
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,390
it without thinking about schizophrenia
and then when we look at

1074
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400
and then when we look at
 

1075
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,430
and then when we look at
the families of people with

1076
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
the families of people with
 

1077
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,390
the families of people with
schizophrenia and joyce was no exception

1078
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
schizophrenia and joyce was no exception
 

1079
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,070
schizophrenia and joyce was no exception
there very often are people within the

1080
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,080
there very often are people within the
 

1081
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,310
there very often are people within the
family who are on the spectrum some have

1082
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
family who are on the spectrum some have
 

1083
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,950
family who are on the spectrum some have
it

1084
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
it
 

1085
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,430
it
some are

1086
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440

 

1087
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,270

able to see it from a distance from a

1088
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
able to see it from a distance from a
 

1089
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,630
able to see it from a distance from a
safe distance

1090
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:40,640
safe distance
 

1091
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,830
safe distance
there's an association between

1092
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
there's an association between
 

1093
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,549
there's an association between
schizophrenia and what we call

1094
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
schizophrenia and what we call
 

1095
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,710
schizophrenia and what we call
schizotypal personality disorder where

1096
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
schizotypal personality disorder where
 

1097
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,190
schizotypal personality disorder where
people are not quite in this

1098
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
people are not quite in this
 

1099
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,710
people are not quite in this
severe state of schizophrenia but have

1100
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
severe state of schizophrenia but have
 

1101
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,430
severe state of schizophrenia but have
some magical thinking have some unusual

1102
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:53,440
some magical thinking have some unusual
 

1103
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,270
some magical thinking have some unusual
thought patterns very often those are

1104
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
thought patterns very often those are
 

1105
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,390
thought patterns very often those are
family members of people with

1106
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
family members of people with
 

1107
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,870
family members of people with
schizophrenia so this points to this

1108
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
schizophrenia so this points to this
 

1109
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,830
schizophrenia so this points to this
again to this idea that that there is a

1110
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
again to this idea that that there is a
 

1111
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,669
again to this idea that that there is a
range even along

1112
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
range even along
 

1113
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,669
range even along
this very severe

1114
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
this very severe
 

1115
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,990
this very severe
very genetic biological illness that

1116
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
very genetic biological illness that
 

1117
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,070
very genetic biological illness that
human beings dwell on different spots

1118
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
human beings dwell on different spots
 

1119
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,150
human beings dwell on different spots
along that spectrum i should mention

1120
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,160
along that spectrum i should mention
 

1121
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,789
along that spectrum i should mention
that we have my friend sergey pulling up

1122
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
that we have my friend sergey pulling up
 

1123
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,870
that we have my friend sergey pulling up
stuff young sergei or old sergey i don't

1124
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
stuff young sergei or old sergey i don't
 

1125
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,470

yeah i actually saw pictures of this
 

1131
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,270
yeah i actually saw pictures of this
from um

1132
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
from um
 

1133
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,950
from um
i think it was on instagram or something

i think it was on instagram or something
 

1135
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,549
i think it was on instagram or something
these are early giraffes of finnigan's

1136
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:28,559
these are early giraffes of finnigan's
 

1137
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,470
these are early giraffes of finnigan's
wave and it's so beautiful to see for

1138
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
wave and it's so beautiful to see for
 

1139
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,150
wave and it's so beautiful to see for
people who are just listening there's

1140
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
people who are just listening there's
 

1141
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,870
people who are just listening there's
just random paragraphs and writing all

1142
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
just random paragraphs and writing all
 

1143
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,830
just random paragraphs and writing all
over the page with stuff crossed out and

1144
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
over the page with stuff crossed out and
 

1145
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,310
over the page with stuff crossed out and
it's great to see that joyce himself was

1146
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,320
it's great to see that joyce himself was
 

1147
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,870
it's great to see that joyce himself was
thinking in this kind of way as

1148
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:42,880
thinking in this kind of way as
 

1149
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,789
thinking in this kind of way as
um as you're putting it together how

1305
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,710
story each
each chapter is anchored in

1306
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
each chapter is anchored in
 

1307
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,029
each chapter is anchored in
by trying to use words that and style

1308
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:27,039
by trying to use words that and style
 

1309
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,710
by trying to use words that and style
of writing and

1310
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:28,720
of writing and
 

1311
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,190
of writing and
and uh you know diction that captures

1312
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
and uh you know diction that captures
 

1313
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,270
and uh you know diction that captures
the feeling of the disorder and so it's

1314
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
the feeling of the disorder and so it's
 

1315
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,270
the feeling of the disorder and so it's
different in each story in the story

1316
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:35,280

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:15,200
you know i will start putting words in
 

1417
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,070
you know i will start putting words in

00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:35,120
you to make sense of it so i was kind of
 

1439
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,990
you to make sense of it so i was kind of
thinking about in that way which is like

1440
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:38,000
thinking about in that way which is like
 

1441
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,029
thinking about in that way which is like
um

1442
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:39,039

that is kind of
 

1449
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,950
that is kind of

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
in that way we're um
 

1467
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,390
in that way we're um
when there's any kind of disorder

1468
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
when there's any kind of disorder
 

1469
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,470
when there's any kind of disorder
we get to only see that disorder through

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,480
we get to only see that disorder through
 

1471
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,710
we get to only see that disorder through
that narrow window as opposed to the

1479
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,830
definitely serves that purpose here but
it's it's got a few other

1480
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:15,840
it's it's got a few other
 

1481
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,789
it's it's got a few other
really

1482
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
really
 

1483
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,190
really
appropriate other connotations as well

1484
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,200
appropriate other connotations as well
 

1485
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,029
appropriate other connotations as well
so the first thing is a projection in

1486
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,039
so the first thing is a projection in
 

1487
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,269
so the first thing is a projection in
terms of neuroscience is

1488
00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:23,279
terms of neuroscience is
 

1489
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,950
terms of neuroscience is
this long-range connection that goes

1490
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
this long-range connection that goes
 

1491
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,710
this long-range connection that goes
from one part of the brain to another

1492
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
from one part of the brain to another
 

1493
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,870
from one part of the brain to another
and so it's what binds two

1494
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
and so it's what binds two
 

1495
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,710
and so it's what binds two
parts of our brain together there are

1496
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
parts of our brain together there are
 

1497
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,110
parts of our brain together there are
projections long-range connections of

1498
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
projections long-range connections of
 

1499
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,510
projections long-range connections of
axons these are the outgoing

1500
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,520
axons these are the outgoing
 

1501
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,190
axons these are the outgoing
threads that connect

1502
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
threads that connect
 

1503
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,510
threads that connect
one part of the brain to another part

1504
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:39,520
one part of the brain to another part
 

1505
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,789
one part of the brain to another part
there's a there's a projection that

1506
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:40,799
there's a there's a projection that
 

1507
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,950
there's a there's a projection that
links for example auditory cortex where

1508
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:42,960
links for example auditory cortex where
 

1509
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,750
links for example auditory cortex where
we hear things to reward centers where

1510
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
we hear things to reward centers where
 

1511
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,149
we hear things to reward centers where
we can feel where feelings of pleasure

1512
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:48,159
we can feel where feelings of pleasure
 

1513
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,909
we can feel where feelings of pleasure
and reward are initiated

1514
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
and reward are initiated
 

1515
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,430
and reward are initiated
and it's been shown that if you have

1516
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
and it's been shown that if you have
 

1517
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,549
and it's been shown that if you have
reduced

1518
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
reduced
 

1519
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,549
reduced
connectivity along that dimension you

1520
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:54,559
connectivity along that dimension you
 

1521
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,710
connectivity along that dimension you
are less able to enjoy music and so

1522
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
are less able to enjoy music and so
 

1523
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,310
are less able to enjoy music and so
these connections these projections

1524
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
these connections these projections
 

1525
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,070
these connections these projections
matter they define

how effectively two parts of the brain
 

1529
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,990
how effectively two parts of the brain
can engage with each other and join

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
can engage with each other and join
 

1531
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,789
can engage with each other and join
together to form a joint representation

together to form a joint representation
 

1533
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,390
together to form a joint representation
of something so that's one meaning it's

1534
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
of something so that's one meaning it's
 

1535
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,990
of something so that's one meaning it's
pure neuroscience the word projection is

1536
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,000
pure neuroscience the word projection is
 

1537
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,149
pure neuroscience the word projection is
used all the time and it happens to be

1538
00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:12,159
used all the time and it happens to be
 

1539
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,149
used all the time and it happens to be
something that optogenetics a technique

something that optogenetics a technique
 

1541
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,590
something that optogenetics a technique
that we maybe we'll talk about a little

1542
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
that we maybe we'll talk about a little
 

1543
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,190
that we maybe we'll talk about a little
later it works particularly well with we

1544
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,200
later it works particularly well with we
 

1545
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,350

activity along these projections from

1548
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,279
activity along these projections from
 

1549
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,789
activity along these projections from
one spot of the brain to another and

1550
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
one spot of the brain to another and
 

1551
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,230
one spot of the brain to another and
this is particularly referring to the

1552
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
this is particularly referring to the
 

1553
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,630
this is particularly referring to the
long range connections it's particularly

1554
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
long range connections it's particularly
 

1555
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,070
long range connections it's particularly
straightforward along these long range

1556
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
straightforward along these long range
 

1557
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,350
straightforward along these long range
projections that connect different parts

1558
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
projections that connect different parts
 

1559
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,789
projections that connect different parts
of the brain but it works over shorter

1560
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:30,799
of the brain but it works over shorter
 

1561
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,029
of the brain but it works over shorter
range too but then there's this other

1562
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
range too but then there's this other
 

1563
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,390
range too but then there's this other
meaning of projections which you were

1564
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
meaning of projections which you were
 

1565
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,830
meaning of projections which you were
bringing up which is very relevant which

1566
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
bringing up which is very relevant which
 

1567
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,870
bringing up which is very relevant which
is

1568
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:36,880
is
 

1569
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,549
is
at some point you you can reduce

1570
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:38,559
at some point you you can reduce
 

1571
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,750
at some point you you can reduce
something from one level of

1572
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,760
something from one level of
 

1573
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,269
something from one level of
dimensionality to another you can

1574
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:41,279
dimensionality to another you can
 

1575
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,789
dimensionality to another you can
project down into a lower dimensional

1576
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:42,799
project down into a lower dimensional
 

1577
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,710
project down into a lower dimensional
space for example

1578
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
space for example
 

1579
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,269
space for example
and then finally there's a psychiatric

1580
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
and then finally there's a psychiatric
 

1581
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,230
and then finally there's a psychiatric
uh

1582
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
uh
 

1583
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,830
uh
term projections which comes up all the

1584
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:49,840
term projections which comes up all the
 

1585
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,669
term projections which comes up all the

we

1588
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:52,640
we
 

1589
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,789
we
very often uh will

1590
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:54,799
very often uh will
 

1591
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,630
very often uh will
look at our internal states and to

1592
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
look at our internal states and to
 

1593
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,870
look at our internal states and to
understand somebody else we'll

1594
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
understand somebody else we'll
 

1595
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,549
understand somebody else we'll
project them on to somebody else we'll

1596
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:00,559
project them on to somebody else we'll
 

1597
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,149
project them on to somebody else we'll
try to understand someone else's

1598
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,159
try to understand someone else's
 

1599
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,710
try to understand someone else's
behavior and and make sense of it by

1600
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
behavior and and make sense of it by
 

1601
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,549
behavior and and make sense of it by
projecting our own inner feelings our

1602
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:06,559
projecting our own inner feelings our
 

1603
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,830
projecting our own inner feelings our
own

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,789
own
uh sort of narrative onto them

1606
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
uh sort of narrative onto them
 

1607
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,590
uh sort of narrative onto them
and use that as a way to help us

1608
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
and use that as a way to help us
 

1609
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,350
and use that as a way to help us
understand them better and we'll do the

1610
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,360
understand them better and we'll do the
 

1611
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,430
understand them better and we'll do the
reverse too we'll take things we see in

1612
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
reverse too we'll take things we see in
 

1613
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,870
reverse too we'll take things we see in
the outside world and we'll bring them

1614
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:18,880
the outside world and we'll bring them
 

1615
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,549
the outside world and we'll bring them
into ourselves and see how well they map

1616
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
into ourselves and see how well they map
 

1617
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,830
into ourselves and see how well they map
how will they align that's called

1618
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
how will they align that's called
 

1619
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,549
how will they align that's called
introjection so projections is a turns

1620
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:24,559
introjection so projections is a turns
 

1621
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,830
introjection so projections is a turns
out to be a really rich word then

1622
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:25,840
out to be a really rich word then
 

1623
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,110
out to be a really rich word then
finally of course there's the very

1624
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
finally of course there's the very
 

1625
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,230
finally of course there's the very
common

1626
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:28,240
common
 

1627
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,190
common
sense of it as as a projector that that

00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:30,560
an epigraph it kind of
 

2159
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,990
an epigraph it kind of
made it clear

made it clear
 

2161
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,190
made it clear
how vulnerable

2162
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,200
how vulnerable
 

2163
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,550
how vulnerable
i was in taking this step but also

what what could come out of it and also
 

2167
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,630
what what could come out of it and also
in a meta way because i was not familiar

2168

reasonable bond that becomes reasonable
by virtue of its own existence

2340
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:38,560
by virtue of its own existence
 

2341
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,349
by virtue of its own existence
and of course

2342
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359

not a bad thing either
so you put these together

2348
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:48,400
so you put these together
 

2349
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,990
so you put these together
the four the strongest bridge we can

2350
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,000
the four the strongest bridge we can
 

2351
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,430
the four the strongest bridge we can
form

2352
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:51,440
form
 

2353
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,750
form
and the reward and the joy that that it

2354
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:53,760
and the reward and the joy that that it

and
 

2359
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,550
and
from you know my perspective this is

2360
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:00,560
from you know my perspective this is
 

2361
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,550
from you know my perspective this is
something that you know

2362
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:02,560
something that you know
 

2363
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,190
something that you know
it can be hard to capture fairly because

2364
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200
it can be hard to capture fairly because
 

2365
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,550
it can be hard to capture fairly because
you want to talk about

2366
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,560
you want to talk about
 

2367
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,470
you want to talk about
the positive and the negative sides at

2368
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:08,480
the positive and the negative sides at
 

2369
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,230
the positive and the negative sides at
once they need to be wrapped up together

2370
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:10,240
once they need to be wrapped up together
 

2371
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,470
once they need to be wrapped up together
for full honest description of what it

2372
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
for full honest description of what it
 

2373
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,589
for full honest description of what it
is

2374
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:13,599
is
 

2375
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,589
is
and that that's hard to do in a in a

2376
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:15,599
and that that's hard to do in a in a
 

2377
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,589
and that that's hard to do in a in a
compact form and so

2378
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:17,599
compact form and so

deranged so if you play it
so he left his pack

2444
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:30,079
so he left his pack
 

2445
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,069
so he left his pack
and uh

2446
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:32,079
and uh
 

2447
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,710
and uh
and there's a nice like voiceover and

2448
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:34,720
and there's a nice like voiceover and
 

2449
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,550
and there's a nice like voiceover and
you don't need to play it but he for

2450
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:36,560
you don't need to play it but he for
 

2451
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,670
you don't need to play it but he for
some reason left the pack and journeyed

2452
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,680
some reason left the pack and journeyed
 

2453
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,670
some reason left the pack and journeyed
out into the mountains

2454
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:41,680
out into the mountains
 

2455
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,990
out into the mountains
and so the the narrator says that he's

2456
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,000
and so the the narrator says that he's
 

2457
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,390
and so the the narrator says that he's
deranged he's lost his mind

2458
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,400
deranged he's lost his mind
 

2459
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,950
deranged he's lost his mind
now i'd like to project the idea that

2460
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:48,960
now i'd like to project the idea that
 

2461
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,550
now i'd like to project the idea that
he's actually

2462
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,560
he's actually
 

2463
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,390
he's actually
there's so many stories you could think

2464
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:52,400
there's so many stories you could think
 

2465
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,270
there's so many stories you could think
of he's returning to his homeland he's

2466
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,280
of he's returning to his homeland he's
 

2467
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,589
of he's returning to his homeland he's
an outsider thinking journeying out into

2468
00:41:57,589 --> 00:41:57,599
an outsider thinking journeying out into
 

2469
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,589
an outsider thinking journeying out into
the unknown thinking he may be able to

2470
00:41:59,589 --> 00:41:59,599
the unknown thinking he may be able to
 

2471
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,109
the unknown thinking he may be able to
discover something greater than the

2472
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:01,119
discover something greater than the
 

2473
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,270
discover something greater than the
tribe he might be looking for a lost

2474
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:03,280

2475
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,550

2476
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:04,560

why is he deranged immediately why has

2478
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:06,880
why is he deranged immediately why has
 

2479
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,589
why is he deranged immediately why has
he lost his mind anyway but this you

2480
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:09,599
he lost his mind anyway but this you
 

2481
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,109
he lost his mind anyway but this you
people should look up this video because

2482
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
people should look up this video because
 

2483
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,589
people should look up this video because
to me i might be the only one who uh

2484
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
to me i might be the only one who uh
 

2485
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,670
to me i might be the only one who uh
romanticizes this but it's such a nice

2486
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
romanticizes this but it's such a nice
 

2487
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,710
romanticizes this but it's such a nice
kind of it's both a picture of perhaps a

2488
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
kind of it's both a picture of perhaps a
 

2489
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,550
kind of it's both a picture of perhaps a

2490
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:22,560
mental disorder which is what the video
 

2491
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,710
mental disorder which is what the video
kind of describes and it may be some

00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
kind of describes and it may be some
 

2493
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,349
kind of describes and it may be some
deeper explanation that's not

2494
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
deeper explanation that's not
 

2495
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,470
deeper explanation that's not
that that has to do with the motivation

2496
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:30,480
that that has to do with the motivation
 

2497
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,430
that that has to do with the motivation
of a

yeah i don't know if i don't know if you
 

2503
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,150
yeah i don't know if i don't know if you
have a deeper analysis on this penguin

2504
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,160
have a deeper analysis on this penguin
 

2505
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,430
have a deeper analysis on this penguin
well i i

2506
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
well i i
 

2507
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,910
well i i
like you as a psychiatrist

2508
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
like you as a psychiatrist
 

2509
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,349
like you as a psychiatrist
i i would i would want to sit down with

2511
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,470
i i would i would want to sit down with
a penguin and go

2512
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,480
a penguin and go

a penguin and go
i want to see the notes from his prior

but
 

2519
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,870
but
this this actually is

00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
this this actually is

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,790
this this actually is

00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,069
most certainly started from
something like this an exploration

2606
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:18,079
something like this an exploration
 

2607
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,589
something like this an exploration
humans do this too you think and we do

2608
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:19,599
humans do this too you think and we do
 

2609
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,910
humans do this too you think and we do
it too in fact it's that's something we

2610
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:21,920
it too in fact it's that's something we
 

2611
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,670
it too in fact it's that's something we
do extremely well

2612
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
do extremely well
 

2613
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,710
do extremely well
let's talk about psychiatry a little bit

2614
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:28,720

 

2615
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,030

so my book you're a a rock star first of

2616
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,040
so my book you're a a rock star first of
 

2617
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,950
so my book you're a a rock star first of
all for people who don't know you're one

2618
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
all for people who don't know you're one
 

2619
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,990
all for people who don't know you're one
aside from sort of um

2620
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
aside from sort of um
 

2621
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,630
aside from sort of um
the neurological view of the brain and

2622
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:38,640
the neurological view of the brain and
 

2623
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,309
the neurological view of the brain and
neuroscience view of the brain you're

2624
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,319
neuroscience view of the brain you're
 

2625
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,150
neuroscience view of the brain you're
also one of the great psychiatrists of

2626
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,160
also one of the great psychiatrists of
 

2627
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,150
also one of the great psychiatrists of
our time i've always

2628
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:44,160
our time i've always
 

2629
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,670
our time i've always
not always but when i was younger i

2630
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:45,680
not always but when i was younger i
 

2631
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,390
not always but when i was younger i
dreamed about being a psychiatrist

2632
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,400
dreamed about being a psychiatrist
 

2633
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,750
dreamed about being a psychiatrist
um

2634
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:49,760
um
 

2635
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,910
um
so it's like it's like getting to meet

2636
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:51,920
so it's like it's like getting to meet
 

2637
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,270
so it's like it's like getting to meet
your heroes

2638
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:53,280
your heroes
 

2639
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,270
your heroes
and also um

2640
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,280
and also um
 

2641
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,510
and also um
you know getting to meet the people who

2642
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:57,520
you know getting to meet the people who
 

2643
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,870
you know getting to meet the people who
uh

2644
00:44:58,870 --> 00:44:58,880
uh
 

2645
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,150
uh
the best

2646
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,160
the best
 

2647
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,990
the best
at the top of the world at the thing

2648
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,000
at the top of the world at the thing
 

2649
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,309
at the top of the world at the thing
you've failed to pursue so there so

2650
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
you've failed to pursue so there so
 

2651
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,750
you've failed to pursue so there so
there's i'm getting a free therapy

2652
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:05,760
there's i'm getting a free therapy
 

2653
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,670
there's i'm getting a free therapy
session on top of that okay so what uh

2654
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:09,680
session on top of that okay so what uh
 

2655
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,510
session on top of that okay so what uh
big picture what is the practice the

2656
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:11,520
big picture what is the practice the
 

2657
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,910
big picture what is the practice the
goal the hope of modern psychiatry if

2658
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:13,920
goal the hope of modern psychiatry if
 

2659
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,270
goal the hope of modern psychiatry if
you could try to describe the discipline

2660
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:17,280
you could try to describe the discipline
 

2661
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,630
you could try to describe the discipline
as you see it maybe historically

2662
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
as you see it maybe historically
 

2663
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,950
as you see it maybe historically
throughout the 20th century

2664
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:22,960
throughout the 20th century
 

2665
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,510
throughout the 20th century
in contrasting to what it is today or

2666
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:25,520
in contrasting to what it is today or
 

2667
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,750
in contrasting to what it is today or
maybe if you want to describe to what

2668
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,760
maybe if you want to describe to what
 

2669
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,470
maybe if you want to describe to what
you hope psychiatry becomes or longs to

2670
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:30,480
you hope psychiatry becomes or longs to
 

2671
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,990
you hope psychiatry becomes or longs to
become in the 21st century yeah

2672
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,000
become in the 21st century yeah
 

2673
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,230
become in the 21st century yeah
it's been an interesting journey uh it

2674
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:36,240
it's been an interesting journey uh it
 

2675
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,230
it's been an interesting journey uh it
psychiatry started out

2676
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:38,240
psychiatry started out
 

2677
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,150
psychiatry started out
pretty firmly grounded in neurology and

2678
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,160
pretty firmly grounded in neurology and
 

2679
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,630
pretty firmly grounded in neurology and
pathology some of the initial

2680
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:42,640
pathology some of the initial
 

2681
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,309
pathology some of the initial
founders effectively of the field were

2682
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
founders effectively of the field were
 

2683
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,270
founders effectively of the field were
very well grounded in microscopy looking

2684
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
very well grounded in microscopy looking
 

2685
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,430
very well grounded in microscopy looking
at cells

2686
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
at cells
 

2687
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,430
at cells
working with patients uh particularly on

2688
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:51,440
working with patients uh particularly on
 

2689
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,950
working with patients uh particularly on
the neurological side and this certainly

2690
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:52,960
the neurological side and this certainly
 

2691
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,870
the neurological side and this certainly
included you know freud and some of his

2692
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:54,880
included you know freud and some of his
 

2693
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,790
included you know freud and some of his
contemporaries

2694
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
contemporaries
 

2695
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,150
contemporaries
and

2696
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,160
and
 

2697
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,750
and
but they rapidly discovered that

2698
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:01,760
but they rapidly discovered that
 

2699
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,589
but they rapidly discovered that
what they could work with at the level

2700
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:03,599
what they could work with at the level
 

2701
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,470
what they could work with at the level
of

2702
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,480
of
 

2703
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,430
of
cells and microscopy was so far

2704
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
cells and microscopy was so far
 

2705
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,430
cells and microscopy was so far
from the realm of what they could get

2706
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:09,440
from the realm of what they could get
 

2707
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,430
from the realm of what they could get
from a human being

2708
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,440
from a human being
 

2709
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,390
from a human being
and what they were getting from the

2710
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:12,400
and what they were getting from the
 

2711
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,550
and what they were getting from the
human being was so much more interesting

2712
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,560
human being was so much more interesting
 

2713
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,109
human being was so much more interesting
and had was so mysterious and so unknown

2714
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:17,119
and had was so mysterious and so unknown
 

2715
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,309
and had was so mysterious and so unknown
that many of them

2716
00:46:18,309 --> 00:46:18,319
that many of them
 

2717
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,510
that many of them
just said we're going to inhabit this

2718
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:19,520
just said we're going to inhabit this
 

2719
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,270
just said we're going to inhabit this
domain and we're going to work with the

2720
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
domain and we're going to work with the
 

2721
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,109
domain and we're going to work with the
people with their words

2722
00:46:23,109 --> 00:46:23,119
people with their words
 

2723
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,190
people with their words
and understand what we can

2724
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,200
and understand what we can
 

2725
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,109
and understand what we can
based on verbal communication because

2726
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:27,119
based on verbal communication because
 

2727
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,950
based on verbal communication because
that was the only tool that people

2728
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:28,960
that was the only tool that people
 

2729
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,470
that was the only tool that people
really had

2730
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
really had
 

2731
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,430
really had
and

2732
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
and
 

2733
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,190
and
that was

2734
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,200
that was
 

2735
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,030
that was
a very

2736
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
a very
 

2737
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,670
a very
important step for the field i would say

2738
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:37,680
important step for the field i would say
 

2739
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,430
important step for the field i would say
one of the interesting things that came

2740
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:39,440
one of the interesting things that came
 

2741
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,470
one of the interesting things that came
from the early decades of psychiatry

2742
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:42,480
from the early decades of psychiatry
 

2743
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,950
from the early decades of psychiatry
really was this distinction between the

2744
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:44,960
really was this distinction between the
 

2745
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,109
really was this distinction between the
conscious and the unconscious mind

2746
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:47,119
conscious and the unconscious mind
 

2747
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,990
conscious and the unconscious mind
and paying particular attention

2748
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
and paying particular attention
 

2749
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,670
and paying particular attention
to the unconscious mind is something

2750
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:51,680
to the unconscious mind is something
 

2751
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,230
to the unconscious mind is something
that was worthy of consideration uh that

2752
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:54,240
that was worthy of consideration uh that
 

2753
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,870
that was worthy of consideration uh that
that might be important in explaining

2754
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:56,880
that might be important in explaining
 

2755
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,470
that might be important in explaining
people's actions

2756
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:58,480
people's actions
 

2757
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,309
people's actions
and that perhaps even insight into that

2758
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:00,319
and that perhaps even insight into that
 

2759
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,550
and that perhaps even insight into that
was valuable in its own right

2760
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:02,560
was valuable in its own right
 

2761
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,910
was valuable in its own right
and out of that psychoanalysis uh

2762
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:05,920
and out of that psychoanalysis uh
 

2763
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,030
and out of that psychoanalysis uh
became a practice that

2764
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,040
became a practice that
 

2765
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,430
became a practice that
it was not always focused on

2766
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:11,440
it was not always focused on
 

2767
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,510
it was not always focused on

00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,280
uh you know
 

2965
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,190
uh you know
experiences that people have can be

2966
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:45,200
experiences that people have can be
 

2967

experiences that people have can be
colored by this this uh

2968
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:47,599
colored by this this uh
 

2969
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,829
colored by this this uh
concept of the unconscious

2970

concept of the unconscious
 

2971
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,589
concept of the unconscious
now the other thing that was interesting

2972
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:51,599
now the other thing that was interesting
 

2973
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,109
now the other thing that was interesting
is is is this distinction

2974
00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:55,119
is is is this distinction
 

2975
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,870
is is is this distinction
you know what what are the parts of the

2976
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:56,880
you know what what are the parts of the
 

2977
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,589
you know what what are the parts of the
unconscious and and so there were these

2978
00:50:59,589 --> 00:50:59,599
unconscious and and so there were these
 

2979
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,630
unconscious and and so there were these
id and ego and superego uh

2980
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:02,640
id and ego and superego uh
 

2981
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,829
id and ego and superego uh
subdivisions that

2982
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839

 

2983
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,430

you know that that freud for example

2984
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
you know that that freud for example
 

2985
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,670
you know that that freud for example
would would talk about them and and the

2986
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
would would talk about them and and the
 

2987
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,870
would would talk about them and and the
the id was the primary the primal drives

2988
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:12,880
the id was the primary the primal drives
 

2989
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,430
the id was the primary the primal drives
that an infant would have uh or that a

2990
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:15,440
that an infant would have uh or that a
 

2991
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,990
that an infant would have uh or that a
very young child just warmth and feeding

2992
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:18,000
very young child just warmth and feeding
 

2993
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,710
very young child just warmth and feeding
and then then later the you know the

2994
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:20,720
and then then later the you know the
 

2995
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,710
and then then later the you know the
sexual or libidinous aspects and for

2996
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:22,720
sexual or libidinous aspects and for
 

2997
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,710
sexual or libidinous aspects and for
freud the later happened very quickly

2998
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
freud the later happened very quickly
 

2999
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,549
freud the later happened very quickly
that's the controversial thing about him

3000
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:28,559
that's the controversial thing about him
 

3001
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,950
that's the controversial thing about him
i think i guess he thought like even

3002
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:30,960
i think i guess he thought like even
 

3003
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,790
i think i guess he thought like even
children had sexual desires that they're

3004
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:32,800
children had sexual desires that they're
 

3005

like dealing with contending with so

3006
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:35,119
like dealing with contending with so
 

3007
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,510
like dealing with contending with so
it's the full thing hungry wanting to

3008
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:37,520
it's the full thing hungry wanting to
 

3009
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,750
it's the full thing hungry wanting to
eat wanting to poop wanting to have sex

3010

eat wanting to poop wanting to have sex
 

3011
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,510
eat wanting to poop wanting to have sex
yeah and he was extremely focused on

3012
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
yeah and he was extremely focused on
 

3013
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,510
yeah and he was extremely focused on
that on on that aspect

3014
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:43,520
that on on that aspect
 

3015
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,430
that on on that aspect
but then there was then there was this

3016
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
but then there was then there was this
 

3017
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,109
but then there was then there was this
the superego which brought on these

3018
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,119
the superego which brought on these
 

3019
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,950
the superego which brought on these
later sort of moralistic uh

3020
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
later sort of moralistic uh
 

3021
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,589
later sort of moralistic uh
sort of codes of conduct and and that of

3022
00:51:53,589 --> 00:51:53,599
sort of codes of conduct and and that of
 

3023
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,230
sort of codes of conduct and and that of
course was very often in intention but

3024
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
course was very often in intention but
 

3025
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,390
course was very often in intention but
all this could play out subconsciously

3026
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:58,400
all this could play out subconsciously
 

3027
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,750
all this could play out subconsciously
and then the ego

3028
00:51:59,750 --> 00:51:59,760
and then the ego
 

3029
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,069
and then the ego
this third aspect was mediating and for

3030
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
this third aspect was mediating and for
 

3031
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,549
this third aspect was mediating and for
its conception mediated this tension

3032
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:04,559
its conception mediated this tension
 

3033
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,190
its conception mediated this tension
between the different uh parts

3034
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:07,200
between the different uh parts
 

3035
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,670
between the different uh parts
now i think that's interesting uh i will

3036
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:09,680
now i think that's interesting uh i will
 

3037
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,589
now i think that's interesting uh i will
say that

3038
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:11,599
say that
 

3039
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:12,870
say that
in some ways

3040
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
in some ways
 

3041
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,109
in some ways
it's maybe unnecessary

3042
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:15,119
it's maybe unnecessary
 

3043
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,309
it's maybe unnecessary
from the perspective of modern

3044
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:16,319
from the perspective of modern
 

3045
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,349
from the perspective of modern
neuroscience to divide things up that

3046
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:19,359
neuroscience to divide things up that
 

3047
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:23,270
neuroscience to divide things up that
way from the you know the moralistic

3048
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,280
way from the you know the moralistic
 

3049
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,990
way from the you know the moralistic
drives and the primal

3050
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:26,000
drives and the primal
 

3051
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,910
drives and the primal
gratification drives

3052
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:27,920
gratification drives
 

3053
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,990
gratification drives
in some ways they're all drives and

3054
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
in some ways they're all drives and
 

3055
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,309
in some ways they're all drives and
maybe they're even all primal drives you

3056
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:32,319
maybe they're even all primal drives you
 

3057
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,309
maybe they're even all primal drives you
know the the moralistic drives they're

3058
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:34,319
know the the moralistic drives they're
 

3059
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,910
know the the moralistic drives they're
they're taught and they're taught in

3060
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920
they're taught and they're taught in
 

3061
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,309
they're taught and they're taught in
ways that ultimately relate back to

3062
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:38,319
ways that ultimately relate back to
 

3063
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,109
ways that ultimately relate back to
survival and

3064
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:41,119
survival and
 

3065
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,870
survival and
you could even say selfish aspects of

3066
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:44,880
you could even say selfish aspects of
 

3067
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,950
you could even say selfish aspects of
of health and life for the self and

3068
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:46,960
of health and life for the self and
 

3069
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,549
of health and life for the self and
family and

3070
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:48,559
family and
 

3071
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,430
family and
so this is uh i don't i think it's maybe

3072
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:51,440
so this is uh i don't i think it's maybe
 

3073
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,470
so this is uh i don't i think it's maybe
an artificial distinction the concept of

3074
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
an artificial distinction the concept of
 

3075
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,230
an artificial distinction the concept of
the unconscious is very valuable and

3076
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:56,240
the unconscious is very valuable and
 

3077
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,230
the unconscious is very valuable and
very interesting um but

3078
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:58,240
very interesting um but
 

3079
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,470
very interesting um but
these categorizations

00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:00,480
these categorizations
 

3081
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,549
these categorizations
uh of id and and uh superego may not

00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:50,079
where does that start in the brain if
 

3185
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,990
where does that start in the brain if
you're recording listening in on the

you're recording listening in on the
 

3187
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,030
you're recording listening in on the
activity of cells all across the brain

3188
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:55,040
activity of cells all across the brain

00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
where's the earliest spot you can pick
 

3191
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,390

a choice being made
 

3195
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,990
a choice being made
well that's so awesome

3196
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:02,000
well that's so awesome
 

3197
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,030
well that's so awesome
yeah at one level you might think how

3198
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
yeah at one level you might think how
 

3199
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,870
yeah at one level you might think how
excited would young have been to see

3200
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:06,880

3201
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,430
excited would young have been to see
this or freud or the early you know

3202
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:09,440
this or freud or the early you know
 

3203
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,309
this or freud or the early you know
psychoanalysts to see where this starts

3204
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:12,319
psychoanalysts to see where this starts
 

3205
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,870
psychoanalysts to see where this starts
but it's not so simple because

3206
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:14,880
but it's not so simple because
 

3207
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,470
but it's not so simple because
an emerging theme in very recent

3208
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:16,480
an emerging theme in very recent
 

3209
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,990
an emerging theme in very recent
neuroscience literally over the last few

3210
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,000
neuroscience literally over the last few
 

3211
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,589
neuroscience literally over the last few
years

3212
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:19,599
years
 

3213
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,789
years
is that

3214
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:20,799
is that
 

3215
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,430
is that
things sort of all start together all

3216
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:23,440
things sort of all start together all
 

3217
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,270
things sort of all start together all
across the brain and so you can be

3218
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,280
across the brain and so you can be
 

3219
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,829
across the brain and so you can be
recording from the cortex this rim of

3220
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:27,839
recording from the cortex this rim of
 

3221
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,990
recording from the cortex this rim of
cells at the surface of the brain or you

3222
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,000
cells at the surface of the brain or you
 

3223
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,230
cells at the surface of the brain or you
can be recording deeper in a structure

3224
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:32,240
can be recording deeper in a structure
 

3225
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,589
can be recording deeper in a structure
called the striatum which is a little

3226
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:33,599
called the striatum which is a little
 

3227
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,710
called the striatum which is a little
older

3228
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
older
 

3229
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,230
older
it's more tightly linked to to action

3230
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,240
it's more tightly linked to to action
 

3231
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,230
it's more tightly linked to to action
and then structures called the thalamus

3232
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
and then structures called the thalamus
 

3233
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,910
and then structures called the thalamus
other parts of the brain and if you

3234
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:41,920
other parts of the brain and if you
 

3235
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,230
other parts of the brain and if you
record from these these

3236
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:44,240
record from these these
 

3237
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,750
record from these these
all sort of

3238
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
all sort of
 

3239
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,789
all sort of
represent the action and the choice

3240
00:55:48,789 --> 00:55:48,799
represent the action and the choice
 

3241
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,549
represent the action and the choice
more or less all at about the same time

3242
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:50,559
more or less all at about the same time
 

3243
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,870
more or less all at about the same time
very close and so it's you can't point

3244
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
very close and so it's you can't point
 

3245
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,510
very close and so it's you can't point
to a particular spot

3246
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
to a particular spot
 

3247
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,430
to a particular spot
and say here's where

3248
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:57,440
and say here's where
 

3249
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,190
and say here's where
the choice or the action originates it's

3250
00:55:59,190 --> 00:55:59,200
the choice or the action originates it's
 

3251
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,630
the choice or the action originates it's
a

00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:03,680
finding the free will neuron
 

3255
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,829
finding the free will neuron
that's relevant to that question nobody

3256
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:05,839
that's relevant to that question nobody
 

3257
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,430
that's relevant to that question nobody
is is close to being able to point to

3258
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:07,440
is is close to being able to point to
 

3259
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,910
is is close to being able to point to
such a thing well close

3260
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:09,920
such a thing well close
 

3261
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,750
such a thing well close
is a relative term

3262
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
is a relative term
 

3263
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,430
is a relative term
and nobody

3264
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:13,440
and nobody
 

3265
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,309
and nobody
uh what i what i tweet today uh all

3266
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:16,319
uh what i what i tweet today uh all
 

3267
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,620
uh what i what i tweet today uh all
generalizations are wrong

3268
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:17,630
generalizations are wrong
 

3269
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:19,750
generalizations are wrong
[Laughter]

3270
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:19,760
[Laughter]
 

3271
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,510
[Laughter]
so including this one let's actually

3272
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:21,520
so including this one let's actually
 

3273
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,950
so including this one let's actually
talk about that sort of the study of

3274
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
talk about that sort of the study of
 

3275
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,430
talk about that sort of the study of
individual cells

3276
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:25,440
individual cells
 

3277
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,349
individual cells
if you could linger on your

3278
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:27,359
if you could linger on your
 

3279
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,510
if you could linger on your
sense that as you get closer to that

3280
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:29,520
sense that as you get closer to that
 

3281
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,109
sense that as you get closer to that
understanding it feels like you're

3282
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:31,119
understanding it feels like you're
 

3283
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,190
understanding it feels like you're
getting farther away

3284
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:33,200
getting farther away
 

3285
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,190
getting farther away
why is that because that that often is

3286
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:35,200
why is that because that that often is
 

3287
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,390
why is that because that that often is
the feeling until you're actually there

3288
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:38,400
the feeling until you're actually there
 

3289
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,270
the feeling until you're actually there
so

3290
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:39,280
so
 

3291
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,589
so
so like uh you know see that's when i'm

3292
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:41,599
so like uh you know see that's when i'm
 

3293
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,710
so like uh you know see that's when i'm
running

3294
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:42,720
running
 

3295
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,950
running
and i know there's only a mile left it

3296
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:44,960
and i know there's only a mile left it
 

3297
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,270
and i know there's only a mile left it
just feels like that mile is just

3298
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,280
just feels like that mile is just
 

3299
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,510
just feels like that mile is just
getting longer and longer but eventually

3300
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:49,520
getting longer and longer but eventually
 

3301
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,670
getting longer and longer but eventually
you finish so maybe we're getting close

3302
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:51,680
you finish so maybe we're getting close
 

3303
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,670
you finish so maybe we're getting close
to cracking open these like beginnings

3304
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:53,680
to cracking open these like beginnings
 

3305
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,270
to cracking open these like beginnings
of ascent like we'll talk about

3306
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:55,280
of ascent like we'll talk about
 

3307
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,750
of ascent like we'll talk about
consciousness or these very difficult

3308
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:57,760
consciousness or these very difficult
 

3309
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,030
consciousness or these very difficult
big

3310
00:56:59,030 --> 00:56:59,040
big
 

3311
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,030
big
questions about the human mind where do

3312
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:01,040
questions about the human mind where do
 

3313
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,309
questions about the human mind where do
they start

3314
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:02,319
they start
 

3315
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:03,990
they start
you're right to say we shouldn't uh

3316
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,000
you're right to say we shouldn't uh
 

3317
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,230
you're right to say we shouldn't uh
generalize or make absolutist statements

3318
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:06,240
generalize or make absolutist statements
 

3319
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,309
generalize or make absolutist statements
but i would say

3320
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:08,319
but i would say
 

3321
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,230
but i would say
right now the reason things are looking

3322
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
right now the reason things are looking
 

3323
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,829
right now the reason things are looking
even

3324
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
even
 

3325
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,430

harder to crack than we had initially

3326
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:13,440
harder to crack than we had initially
 

3327
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,549
harder to crack than we had initially
thought

3328
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:14,559
thought
 

3329
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,789
thought
we now have the data streams that we've

3330
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:16,799
we now have the data streams that we've
 

3331
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,349
we now have the data streams that we've
wanted for so long

3332
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:19,359
wanted for so long
 

3333
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,670
wanted for so long
in terms of activity patterns all across

3334
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:21,680
in terms of activity patterns all across
 

3335
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,430
in terms of activity patterns all across
the brain at the level of cells we can

3336
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
the brain at the level of cells we can
 

3337
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,870
the brain at the level of cells we can
literally see

3338
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:24,880
literally see
 

3339
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,549
literally see
what cells are doing

3340
00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:26,559
what cells are doing
 

3341
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,190
what cells are doing
immense data sets you know we get

3342
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,200
immense data sets you know we get
 

3343
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,109
immense data sets you know we get
these are you know time series of one

3344
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,119
these are you know time series of one
 

3345
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,430
these are you know time series of one
individual cell with you know sub second

3346
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:33,440
individual cell with you know sub second
 

3347
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,030
individual cell with you know sub second
resolution and you can collect this from

3348
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:35,040
resolution and you can collect this from
 

3349
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,630
resolution and you can collect this from
you know enormous numbers of cells

3350
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:36,640
you know enormous numbers of cells
 

3351
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,990
you know enormous numbers of cells

across the brain
 

3353
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,910
across the brain
so very rich data sets that we've wanted

3354
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:39,920
so very rich data sets that we've wanted
 

3355
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,870
so very rich data sets that we've wanted
for a long time and yet having these

3356
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
for a long time and yet having these
 

3357
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,470
for a long time and yet having these
uh has not led

3358
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
uh has not led
 

3359
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,270
uh has not led
to

3360
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:45,280
to
 

3361
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,670
to
an understanding of truly where actions

3362
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:47,680
an understanding of truly where actions
 

3363
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,109
an understanding of truly where actions
uh initiate um in terms of regions or

3364
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
uh initiate um in terms of regions or
 

3365
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,109
uh initiate um in terms of regions or
locations let's get a few questions on

3366
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
locations let's get a few questions on
 

3367
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,230
locations let's get a few questions on
that is the answer

3368
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:56,240
that is the answer
 

3369
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,270
that is the answer
high-level

3370
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:57,280
high-level
 

3371
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,510
high-level
question by your intuition

3372
00:57:59,510 --> 00:57:59,520
question by your intuition
 

3373
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,150
question by your intuition
is the answer within the data or do we

3374
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:02,160
is the answer within the data or do we
 

3375
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,030
is the answer within the data or do we
need

3376
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:03,040
need
 

3377
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,510
need
different kind of data so we should also

3378
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:05,520
different kind of data so we should also
 

3379
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,630
different kind of data so we should also
say that when you collect data about the

3380
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:08,640
say that when you collect data about the
 

3381
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,630
say that when you collect data about the
the brain there's like the richness of

3382
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:10,640
the brain there's like the richness of
 

3383
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,390
the brain there's like the richness of
information you're collecting

3384
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:12,400
information you're collecting
 

3385
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,990
information you're collecting
but there is also human doing stuff

3386
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:16,000
but there is also human doing stuff
 

3387
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,230
but there is also human doing stuff
um like

3388
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
um like
 

3389
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,750
um like
and the information so static

3390
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:19,760
and the information so static
 

3391
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,829
and the information so static
information about the human and dynamic

3392
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:21,839
information about the human and dynamic
 

3393
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,829
information about the human and dynamic
information about the human and you can

3394
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:23,839
information about the human and you can
 

3395
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,349
information about the human and you can
get them to do different stuff and you

3396
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:25,359
get them to do different stuff and you
 

3397
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,349
get them to do different stuff and you
can select different humans

3398
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:27,359
can select different humans
 

3399
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,349
can select different humans
and that's part of the collection of

3400
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:29,359
and that's part of the collection of
 

3401
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,270
and that's part of the collection of
data aspects so like when you're

3402
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,280
data aspects so like when you're
 

3403
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,430
data aspects so like when you're
collecting data about the brain

3404
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
collecting data about the brain
 

3405
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,190
collecting data about the brain
there's some truths

3406
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,200
there's some truths
 

3407
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,789
there's some truths
that you can you know in machine

rich mess complexity of the human

3418
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:47,200
rich mess complexity of the human
 

3419
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,829
rich mess complexity of the human
mind so given the data you've looked at

3420
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:49,839
mind so given the data you've looked at
 

3421
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,670
mind so given the data you've looked at
do you think the answer

3422
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:51,680
do you think the answer
 

3423
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,069
do you think the answer
for the for the origin of free will in

3424
00:58:54,069 --> 00:58:54,079
for the for the origin of free will in
 

3425
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,990
for the for the origin of free will in
the human mind is can be found

3426
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
the human mind is can be found
 

3427
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,950
the human mind is can be found
well

3428
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:58,960
well
 

3429
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,309
well
one one

3430
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:00,319
one one
 

3431
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,950
one one
amazing thing is that

3432
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
amazing thing is that
 

3433
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,549
amazing thing is that
nobody's nobody's found it but we have

3434
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:04,559
nobody's nobody's found it but we have
 

3435
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,470
nobody's nobody's found it but we have
these rich data sets and and then

3436
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:06,480
these rich data sets and and then
 

3437
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,030
these rich data sets and and then
there's a conundrum which is

3438
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:09,040
there's a conundrum which is
 

3439
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,190
there's a conundrum which is
uh is it in the data and we just don't

3440
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:11,200
uh is it in the data and we just don't
 

3441
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,390
uh is it in the data and we just don't
know how to look at it maybe we don't

3442
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:12,400
know how to look at it maybe we don't
 

3443
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,150
know how to look at it maybe we don't
know the right scale the right

3444
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:14,160
know the right scale the right
 

3445
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,990
know the right scale the right
projection to make of the data the right

3446
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
projection to make of the data the right
 

3447
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,589
projection to make of the data the right
way to interpret it

3448
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:17,599
way to interpret it
 

3449
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,190
way to interpret it
and here's where

3450
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:19,200
and here's where
 

3451
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,109
and here's where
causal testing becomes very valuable

3452
00:59:21,109 --> 00:59:21,119
causal testing becomes very valuable
 

3453
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,950
causal testing becomes very valuable
because then instead of just passively

3454
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
because then instead of just passively
 

3455
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,030
because then instead of just passively
observing

3456
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:25,040
observing
 

3457
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,870
observing
well here are

3458
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:26,880
well here are
 

3459
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,390
well here are
here are the activity patterns and then

3460
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:28,400
here are the activity patterns and then
 

3461
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,390
here are the activity patterns and then
here's the choice made by the animal

3462
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,400
here's the choice made by the animal
 

3463
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,870
here's the choice made by the animal
as we've gotten more

3464
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:34,880
as we've gotten more
 

3465
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,630
as we've gotten more
powerful at reaching in and causing

3466
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:36,640
powerful at reaching in and causing
 

3467
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,390
powerful at reaching in and causing
things to happen in the brain turning up

3468
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:38,400
things to happen in the brain turning up
 

3469
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,510
things to happen in the brain turning up
or down

3470
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:39,520
or down
 

3471
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,069
or down
the activity of certain types of cells

3472
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:42,079
the activity of certain types of cells
 

3473
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,390
the activity of certain types of cells
or defined populations of cells and

00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,400
or defined populations of cells and
 

3475
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,470
or defined populations of cells and
seeing how that affects actions these

3476
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:46,480
seeing how that affects actions these
 

3477
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,789
seeing how that affects actions these
causal perturbations have turned out to

3478
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:48,799
causal perturbations have turned out to
 

3479
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,309
causal perturbations have turned out to
be very valuable

3480
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:50,319
be very valuable
 

3481
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,069
be very valuable
we're just now getting to the point

3482
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:52,079
we're just now getting to the point
 

3483
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,589
we're just now getting to the point
where we can apply these in very

3484
00:59:55,589 --> 00:59:55,599
where we can apply these in very
 

3485
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,190
where we can apply these in very
wide

3486
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,200
wide
 

3487
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,950
wide
swaths of the brain at cellular

3488
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:58,960
swaths of the brain at cellular
 

3489
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,789
swaths of the brain at cellular
resolution and so we're going to be able

3490
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
resolution and so we're going to be able
 

3491
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,630
resolution and so we're going to be able
uh hopefully to make some headway on

3492
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
uh hopefully to make some headway on
 

3493
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,270
uh hopefully to make some headway on
this question with with causality and

3494
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:05,280
this question with with causality and
 

3495
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,630
this question with with causality and
those that's

3496
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
those that's
 

3497
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,470
those that's
the one thing that optogenetics provides

3498
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:08,480
the one thing that optogenetics provides
 

3499
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,230
the one thing that optogenetics provides
us this way of using light that we

3500
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,240
us this way of using light that we
 

3501
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,069
us this way of using light that we
develop to control cells

3502
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:12,079
develop to control cells
 

3503
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,430
develop to control cells
this

3504
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
this
 

3505
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,430
this
is an untapped relatively untapped at

3506
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:15,440
is an untapped relatively untapped at
 

3507
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,109
is an untapped relatively untapped at
this broad brain wide scale and

3508
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:17,119
this broad brain wide scale and
 

3509
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:18,309
this broad brain wide scale and
hopefully we can get there in the near

3510
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:18,319
hopefully we can get there in the near
 

3511
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,990
hopefully we can get there in the near
future but i would say that the answer

3512
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:20,000
future but i would say that the answer
 

3513
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,870
future but i would say that the answer
may be maybe in the data uh but we don't

3514
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:22,880
may be maybe in the data uh but we don't
 

3515
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,230
may be maybe in the data uh but we don't
know how to find it

3516
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:24,240
know how to find it
 

3517
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,829
know how to find it
well there's this interactive element

3518
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:25,839
well there's this interactive element
 

3519
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,430
well there's this interactive element
like where you can cause stuff that's

3520
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:27,440
like where you can cause stuff that's
 

3521
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,750
like where you can cause stuff that's
really powerful because you get to

3522
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:29,760
really powerful because you get to
 

3523
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,109
really powerful because you get to
i mean

3524
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:31,119
i mean
 

3525
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,870
i mean
uh as opposed to collecting data

3526
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:32,880
uh as opposed to collecting data
 

3527
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,630
uh as opposed to collecting data
passively you you're collecting data

3528
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:34,640
passively you you're collecting data
 

3529
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,270
passively you you're collecting data
actively so can you maybe describe

3530
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:37,280
actively so can you maybe describe
 

3531
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,030
actively so can you maybe describe
one of the many things you're known for

3532
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:39,040
one of the many things you're known for
 

3533
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,270
one of the many things you're known for
one of one of the big things is called

one of one of the big things is called
 

3535
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,430
one of one of the big things is called
optogenetics what is it

01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
to happen it's a way of
 

3541
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,069
to happen it's a way of
determining what what actually matters

3542
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:50,079
determining what what actually matters
 

3543
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,150
determining what what actually matters
in terms of the activity of the brain

3544
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,160
in terms of the activity of the brain
 

3545
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,109
in terms of the activity of the brain
for

for
 

3547
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,950
for
the amazing things it does

sensation cognition action
 

3551
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,589
sensation cognition action
and what it does is it provides activity

3552
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:01,599
and what it does is it provides activity
 

3553
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,230
and what it does is it provides activity
it's a way of playing in if you will

3554
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:04,240
it's a way of playing in if you will
 

3555
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,549
it's a way of playing in if you will
activity patterns into precisely defined

activity patterns into precisely defined
 

3557
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,789
activity patterns into precisely defined
cells and the way we do it is pretty

3558
01:01:08,789 --> 01:01:08,799
cells and the way we do it is pretty
 

3559
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,030
cells and the way we do it is pretty
cool i think it's you know

3560
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:11,040
cool i think it's you know
 

3561
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,309
cool i think it's you know
right away there's a problem if you

01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:12,319
right away there's a problem if you
 

3563
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,510
right away there's a problem if you
think about how do we do this how could

3564
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:13,520
think about how do we do this how could
 

3565
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,670
think about how do we do this how could
we play in well-defined activity

3566
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:15,680
we play in well-defined activity
 

3567
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:17,829
we play in well-defined activity
patterns and provide a stream of of

uh

3580
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:28,880

humans
 

3585
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,870
humans
and then the goal is to try to control

3586
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:34,880
and then the goal is to try to control
 

3587
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:37,109
and then the goal is to try to control
accurately the behavior of a single

3588
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,119
accurately the behavior of a single
 

3589
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,470
accurately the behavior of a single
neuron and then to be able to monitor

3590
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:40,480
neuron and then to be able to monitor
 

3591
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,069
neuron and then to be able to monitor
a single

3592
01:01:42,069 --> 01:01:42,079
a single
 

3593
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,870
a single
collection of single neurons to then say

3594
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:44,880
collection of single neurons to then say
 

3595
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,390
collection of single neurons to then say
well to draw some deeper insight about

3596
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:48,400
well to draw some deeper insight about
 

3597
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,270
well to draw some deeper insight about
the

3598
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:49,280
the
 

3599
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,230
the
origins first of all the function of

3600
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:52,240
origins first of all the function of
 

3601
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,430
origins first of all the function of
different parts of the brain different

3602
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
different parts of the brain different
 

3603
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,029
different parts of the brain different
neurons different kinds of neurons but

3604
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:55,039
neurons different kinds of neurons but
 

3605
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,430
neurons different kinds of neurons but
also the origins of the big things the

3606
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:57,440
also the origins of the big things the
 

3607
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,270
also the origins of the big things the
uh the the flap of the butterfly wing

3608
01:01:59,270 --> 01:01:59,280
uh the the flap of the butterfly wing
 

3609
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,870
uh the the flap of the butterfly wing
that leads to an actual behavioral

3610
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:02,880
that leads to an actual behavioral
 

3611
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,029
that leads to an actual behavioral
thing yeah so if you could exactly so if

3612
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:05,039
thing yeah so if you could exactly so if
 

3613
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,190
thing yeah so if you could exactly so if
you could turn on or off

3614
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:07,200
you could turn on or off
 

3615
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,910
you could turn on or off
the brain or parts of the brain or cell

3616
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:09,920
the brain or parts of the brain or cell
 

3617
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,789
the brain or parts of the brain or cell
types or individual cells

3618
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:12,799

01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,630
natural rate and rhythm and timing of
normal brain activity

3624
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:18,640
normal brain activity
 

3625
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,829
normal brain activity
that would be immensely valid because

3626
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
that would be immensely valid because
 

3627
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:20,950
that would be immensely valid because
you could determine what actually

3628
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:20,960
you could determine what actually
 

3629
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,029
you could determine what actually
mattered what what could cause complex

3630
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:23,039
mattered what what could cause complex
 

3631
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,630
mattered what what could cause complex
things to happen and what could prevent

3632
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,640
things to happen and what could prevent
 

3633
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,069

01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,190
specific way
but right away you've got a problem if

3638
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:29,200
but right away you've got a problem if
 

3639
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,829
but right away you've got a problem if
you want to do this and and scientists

3640
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:31,839
you want to do this and and scientists
 

3641
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,109
you want to do this and and scientists
neuroscientists have wanted to do this

3642
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
neuroscientists have wanted to do this
 

3643
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,670
neuroscientists have wanted to do this

01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:40,960
famous paper in 1999 he got interested
 

3649
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,950
famous paper in 1999 he got interested
in neuroscience later in life

in neuroscience later in life
 

3651
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,069
in neuroscience later in life
and he said

3652
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
and he said
 

3653
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,670
and he said
what we need

3654
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
what we need
 

3655
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,990
what we need
in neuroscience is a way that we could

3656
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,000
in neuroscience is a way that we could
 

3657
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,589
in neuroscience is a way that we could
turn on or off

3658
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:49,599
turn on or off
 

3659
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,829

01:02:56,549 --> 01:02:56,559
in a behaving animal
 

3665
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,230
in a behaving animal
and he even said

3666
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:58,240
and he even said
 

3667
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,950
and he even said
the ideal signal would be light because

3668
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:00,960
the ideal signal would be light because
 

3669
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,750
the ideal signal would be light because
it would be fast it could uh

3670
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:03,760
it would be fast it could uh
 

3671
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,349
it would be fast it could uh
penetrate through the

3672
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:05,359
penetrate through the
 

3673
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,750
penetrate through the
brain to some extent

3674
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:07,760
brain to some extent
 

3675
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,430
brain to some extent
and

3676
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:09,440
and
 

3677
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,190
and
he had no idea how to do it he said this

3678
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:11,200
he had no idea how to do it he said this
 

3679
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,829
he had no idea how to do it he said this
would probably be very far-fetched but

3680
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:13,839
would probably be very far-fetched but
 

3681
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,750
would probably be very far-fetched but
it would be a good thing and so that's

3682
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:15,760
it would be a good thing and so that's
 

3683
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,430
it would be a good thing and so that's
what you're actually saying like if you

3684
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:17,440
what you're actually saying like if you
 

3685
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,190
what you're actually saying like if you
want to do this kind of thing

3686
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,200
want to do this kind of thing
 

3687
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,230
want to do this kind of thing
and then

3688
01:03:20,230 --> 01:03:20,240
and then
 

3689
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,829
and then
it's you imagine like how do i get

3690
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:21,839
it's you imagine like how do i get
 

3691
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,309
it's you imagine like how do i get
inside the brain it's pretty difficult

3692
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:24,319
inside the brain it's pretty difficult
 

3693
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:25,829
inside the brain it's pretty difficult
it's very difficult and then even once

3694
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:25,839
it's very difficult and then even once
 

3695
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,069
it's very difficult and then even once
you get in it's hard because all brain

3696
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:28,079
you get in it's hard because all brain
 

3697
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,309
you get in it's hard because all brain
cells are electrical all neurons are

3698
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:30,319
cells are electrical all neurons are
 

3699
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:31,750
cells are electrical all neurons are
electrically activated and so if you

3700
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
electrically activated and so if you
 

3701
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,630
electrically activated and so if you
wanted to use electricity

3702
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:34,640
wanted to use electricity
 

3703
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,109
wanted to use electricity
as what you were putting in

3704
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:37,119
as what you were putting in
 

3705
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,430
as what you were putting in
you won't have any specificity at all if

3706
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:39,440
you won't have any specificity at all if
 

3707
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,589
you won't have any specificity at all if
you have an electrode a wire and you put

3708
01:03:41,589 --> 01:03:41,599
you have an electrode a wire and you put
 

3709
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,349
you have an electrode a wire and you put
it in the brain and you send current

3710
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:43,359
it in the brain and you send current
 

3711
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,190
it in the brain and you send current
through it all

3712
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
through it all
 

3713
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,430
through it all
the cells near the electrode will be

3714
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:47,440
the cells near the electrode will be
 

3715
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,750
the cells near the electrode will be
stimulated it's like trying to control

3716
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:49,760
stimulated it's like trying to control
 

3717
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,029
stimulated it's like trying to control
fish by spraying them with water

3718
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:53,039
fish by spraying them with water
 

3719
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,029
fish by spraying them with water
yeah right because there's already a lot

3720
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:55,039
yeah right because there's already a lot
 

3721
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:55,670
yeah right because there's already a lot
of

3722
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:55,680
of
 

3723
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,349
of
electricity going around anyway and

3724
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359
electricity going around anyway and
 

3725
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,750
electricity going around anyway and
you're adding more but there's no

3726
01:03:59,750 --> 01:03:59,760
you're adding more but there's no
 

3727
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,510
you're adding more but there's no
uh specificity even among the different

3728
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
uh specificity even among the different
 

3729
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,589
uh specificity even among the different
kinds of cells either because all around

3730
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:03,599
kinds of cells either because all around
 

3731
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,109
kinds of cells either because all around
the wire that you've put in they're

3732
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
the wire that you've put in they're
 

3733
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,710
the wire that you've put in they're
going to be so many different cells

3734
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
going to be so many different cells
 

3735
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,630
going to be so many different cells
doing totally different things many of

3736
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:08,640
doing totally different things many of
 

3737
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,870
doing totally different things many of
them in opposition to each other we know

3738
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:10,880
them in opposition to each other we know
 

3739
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,230
them in opposition to each other we know
that's one way the brain is set up there

3740
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:12,240
that's one way the brain is set up there
 

3741
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,069
that's one way the brain is set up there
are parts of the brain that

3742
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:14,079
are parts of the brain that
 

3743
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,150
are parts of the brain that
where neurons side by side are doing

3744
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:16,160
where neurons side by side are doing
 

3745
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,510
where neurons side by side are doing
completely different things and maybe

3746
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
completely different things and maybe
 

3747
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,069
completely different things and maybe
even antagonistic to each other

3748
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:20,079
even antagonistic to each other
 

3749
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,990
even antagonistic to each other
so what do you do how do you play in

3750
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,000
so what do you do how do you play in
 

3751
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,589
so what do you do how do you play in
activity with any kind of specificity

3752
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:23,599
activity with any kind of specificity
 

3753
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:24,630
activity with any kind of specificity
well

3754
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:24,640
well
 

3755
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,109
well
what you do is use what we found is what

3756
01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:27,119
what you do is use what we found is what
 

3757
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,789
what you do is use what we found is what
what you can do is

3758
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:28,799
what you can do is
 

3759
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,950
what you can do is
make

3760
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:30,960
make
 

3761
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,190
make
some cells responsive to light now

3762
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:33,200
some cells responsive to light now
 

3763
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,549
some cells responsive to light now
normally

3764
01:04:34,549 --> 01:04:34,559
normally
 

3765
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,870
normally
no cells deep in the in the brain really

3766
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:36,880
no cells deep in the in the brain really
 

3767
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,230
no cells deep in the in the brain really
respond to light they're not built for

3768
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
respond to light they're not built for
 

3769
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,150
respond to light they're not built for
that there's no reason for them to

3770
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:40,160
that there's no reason for them to
 

3771
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,230
that there's no reason for them to
respond to light in there

3772
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,240
respond to light in there
 

3773
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,109
respond to light in there
which is a great situation to start with

3774
01:04:45,109 --> 01:04:45,119
which is a great situation to start with
 

3775
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,950
which is a great situation to start with
because any light sensitivity you can

3776
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:46,960
because any light sensitivity you can
 

3777
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,510
because any light sensitivity you can
provide to some cells will be a huge

3778
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:49,520
provide to some cells will be a huge
 

3779
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,430
provide to some cells will be a huge
signal above the noise

3780
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:51,440
signal above the noise
 

3781
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,789
signal above the noise
and so that's that's what we do with

3782
01:04:52,789 --> 01:04:52,799
and so that's that's what we do with
 

3783
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,510
and so that's that's what we do with
optogenetics we take

3784
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:55,520
optogenetics we take
 

3785
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,549
optogenetics we take
genes bits of dna from

3786
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
genes bits of dna from
 

3787
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,990
genes bits of dna from
microbes single-celled organisms

3788
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,000
microbes single-celled organisms
 

3789
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,309
microbes single-celled organisms
and these single-celled organisms like

3790
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:04,319
and these single-celled organisms like
 

3791
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,270
and these single-celled organisms like
algae they

3792
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:07,280
algae they
 

3793
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,750
algae they
make uh little proteins that sit in the

3794
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:09,760
make uh little proteins that sit in the
 

3795
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,829
make uh little proteins that sit in the
surface of their cells

3796
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:11,839
surface of their cells
 

3797
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,230
surface of their cells
that receive light capture a photon of

3798
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:14,240
that receive light capture a photon of
 

3799
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,029
that receive light capture a photon of

3800
01:05:15,029 --> 01:05:15,039
light
 

3801
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,870
light
and open up a little hole in the

3802
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:16,880
and open up a little hole in the
 

3803
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,029
and open up a little hole in the
membrane of the cell and let charged

3804
01:05:19,029 --> 01:05:19,039
membrane of the cell and let charged
 

3805
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:21,670
membrane of the cell and let charged
particles ions like sodium and potassium

particles ions like sodium and potassium
 

3807
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,309
particles ions like sodium and potassium
flow across the membrane of the cell

3808
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:24,319
flow across the membrane of the cell
 

3809
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,270
flow across the membrane of the cell
and that they these algae and bacteria

3810
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:27,280
and that they these algae and bacteria
 

3811
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,630
and that they these algae and bacteria
they do this for their own reasons

3812
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:28,640
they do this for their own reasons
 

3813
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,470
they do this for their own reasons
because that helps them move it helps

3814
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,480
because that helps them move it helps
 

3815
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,510
because that helps them move it helps
them

3816
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:31,520
them
 

3817
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,150
them
make and use energy

3818
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:34,160
make and use energy
 

3819
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,910
make and use energy
but that's a beautiful thing for

3820
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:35,920
but that's a beautiful thing for
 

3821
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,309
but that's a beautiful thing for
neuroscience because movement of ions

3822
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:38,319
neuroscience because movement of ions
 

3823
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,150
neuroscience because movement of ions
charged particles across the membrane of

3824
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:40,160
charged particles across the membrane of
 

3825
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,069
charged particles across the membrane of
the cell is exactly the kind of

3826
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:42,079
the cell is exactly the kind of
 

3827
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,069
the cell is exactly the kind of
electricity that neurons work with so if

3828
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:44,079
electricity that neurons work with so if
 

3829
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:45,670
electricity that neurons work with so if
we can take this

3830
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:45,680
we can take this
 

3831
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,109
we can take this
bit of dna

3832
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:47,119
bit of dna
 

3833
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,710
bit of dna
that encodes this beautiful protein that

3834
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:48,720
that encodes this beautiful protein that
 

3835
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,270
that encodes this beautiful protein that
turns light into electricity from algae

3836
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,280
turns light into electricity from algae
 

3837
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,510
turns light into electricity from algae
and if we can put it into

3838
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:53,520
and if we can put it into
 

3839
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,910
and if we can put it into
some neurons but not other neurons which

3840
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:55,920
some neurons but not other neurons which
 

3841
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,069
some neurons but not other neurons which
we can do using genetic tricks

3842
01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:58,079
we can do using genetic tricks
 

3843
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,670
we can do using genetic tricks
then you've got a situation then you can

3844
01:05:59,670 --> 01:05:59,680
then you've got a situation then you can
 

3845
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,109
then you've got a situation then you can
shine on the light

3846
01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:01,119
shine on the light
 

3847
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,309
shine on the light
and only

3848
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:02,319
and only
 

3849
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,069
and only
the cells that have the gene and that

3850
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:04,079
the cells that have the gene and that
 

3851
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,589
the cells that have the gene and that
are expressing the gene

3852
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:05,599
are expressing the gene
 

3853
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,069
are expressing the gene
will be the initial direct cells that

3854
01:06:08,069 --> 01:06:08,079
will be the initial direct cells that
 

3855
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,510
will be the initial direct cells that
are activated by the light and so that's

3856
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:09,520
are activated by the light and so that's
 

3857
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,270
are activated by the light and so that's
the essence of optogenetics is the

3858
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:11,280
the essence of optogenetics is the
 

3859
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,270
the essence of optogenetics is the
ability to do that we get that initial

3860
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:13,280
ability to do that we get that initial
 

3861
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,710
ability to do that we get that initial
specificity that you could never get

3862
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
specificity that you could never get
 

3863
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,549
specificity that you could never get
with an electrode okay so let me say

3864
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:16,559
with an electrode okay so let me say
 

3865
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,069
with an electrode okay so let me say
that this is uh we recently got uh the

3866
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:20,079
that this is uh we recently got uh the
 

3867
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,470
that this is uh we recently got uh the
alaska prize for this

3868
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:22,480
alaska prize for this
 

3869
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,549
alaska prize for this
is a brilliant idea

3870
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:24,559
is a brilliant idea
 

3871
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:25,670
is a brilliant idea
um

3872
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:25,680
um
 

3873
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:26,789
um
so

3874
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:26,799
so
 

3875
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:29,349
so
i talked to um andrew huberman who's a

3876
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:29,359
i talked to um andrew huberman who's a
 

3877
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,510
i talked to um andrew huberman who's a
friend of yours friend of mine

3878
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:31,520
friend of yours friend of mine
 

3879
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,390
friend of yours friend of mine
um

3880
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:32,400
um
 

3881
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,470
um
not to jinx things but he believes that

3882
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:34,480
not to jinx things but he believes that
 

3883
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,230
not to jinx things but he believes that
he deserves the nobel prize for this so

3884
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:38,240
he deserves the nobel prize for this so
 

3885
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,589
he deserves the nobel prize for this so
um

3886
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
um
 

3887
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,470
um
i do too but what uh my votes

3888
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480
i do too but what uh my votes
 

3889
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,309
i do too but what uh my votes
anyway the thing is does it doesn't

3890
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:44,319
anyway the thing is does it doesn't
 

3891
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,309
anyway the thing is does it doesn't
matter prizes will be all forgotten all

3892
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:46,319
matter prizes will be all forgotten all
 

3893
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,910
matter prizes will be all forgotten all
of us will be forgotten one of the cool

3894
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:47,920
of us will be forgotten one of the cool
 

3895
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,150

ideas cool idea is a cool idea that's a

3896
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:50,160
ideas cool idea is a cool idea that's a
 

3897
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,789
ideas cool idea is a cool idea that's a
really powerful idea it's actually the

3898
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:52,799
really powerful idea it's actually the
 

3899
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,990
really powerful idea it's actually the
the origins of it you might be

3900
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,000
the origins of it you might be
 

3901
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,430
the origins of it you might be
interested in are even are very deep uh

interested in are even are very deep uh
there was a botanist in saint petersburg

3904
01:06:59,670 --> 01:06:59,680
there was a botanist in saint petersburg
 

3905
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,430
there was a botanist in saint petersburg
named andrei fomensen

3906
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,440
named andrei fomensen
 

3907
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,270
named andrei fomensen
in 1866

3908
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:03,280
in 1866
 

3909
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,510
in 1866
he published a paper

3910
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:05,520
he published a paper
 

3911
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,069
he published a paper
on the single-celled green algae and he

3912
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:08,079
on the single-celled green algae and he
 

3913
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,990
on the single-celled green algae and he
was the botanist who first noticed that

3914
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,000
was the botanist who first noticed that
 

3915
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,150
was the botanist who first noticed that
they moved in response to light these

3916
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,160
they moved in response to light these
 

3917
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,910
they moved in response to light these
are tiny single-celled algae that have

3918
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:13,920
are tiny single-celled algae that have
 

3919
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,470
are tiny single-celled algae that have
flagella so they swim through the water

3920
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:16,480
flagella so they swim through the water
 

3921
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,990
flagella so they swim through the water
and

3922
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:18,000
and
 

3923
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,870
and
he noticed this he was a botanist and he

3924
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:20,880
he noticed this he was a botanist and he
 

3925
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,510
he noticed this he was a botanist and he
published this it was as a paper you

3926
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,520
published this it was as a paper you
 

3927
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,270
published this it was as a paper you
know he wrote in

3928
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:25,280
know he wrote in
 

3929
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,870
know he wrote in
in german but he published it in a

3930
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:26,880
in german but he published it in a
 

3931
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,470
in german but he published it in a
french journal and he was doing it from

3932
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:28,480
french journal and he was doing it from
 

3933
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,470
french journal and he was doing it from
st petersburg so it was a very

3934
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
st petersburg so it was a very
 

3935
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,230
st petersburg so it was a very
international effort

3936
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,240
international effort
 

3937
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,789
international effort
but you have to go back to 1866 and that

3938
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:34,799
but you have to go back to 1866 and that
 

3939
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:36,630
but you have to go back to 1866 and that
i just i like to highlight how far back

3940
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:36,640
i just i like to highlight how far back
 

3941
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,750
i just i like to highlight how far back
the that

3942
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:37,760
the that
 

3943
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,150
the that
discovery goes is back to to andre

3944
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,160
discovery goes is back to to andre
 

3945
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,549
discovery goes is back to to andre
feminism and this is a

3946
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:42,559
feminism and this is a
 

3947
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,630
feminism and this is a
it highlights the value of just pure

3948
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:44,640
it highlights the value of just pure
 

3949
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,230
it highlights the value of just pure
basic science discovery that always

3950
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,240
basic science discovery that always
 

3951
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,950
basic science discovery that always
originates uh somewhere in the eastern

3952
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:48,960
originates uh somewhere in the eastern
 

3953
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,990
originates uh somewhere in the eastern
european bloc uh but i don't think he uh

3954
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,000
european bloc uh but i don't think he uh
 

3955
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,990

expected the splicing of genetic

3956
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:54,000
expected the splicing of genetic
 

3957
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,829
expected the splicing of genetic
material from into the human brain and

3958
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:57,839
material from into the human brain and
 

3959
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:58,950
material from into the human brain and
one of the cool things we've been able

3960
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960
one of the cool things we've been able
 

3961
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,309
one of the cool things we've been able
to do now with modern methods is to

3962
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:00,319
to do now with modern methods is to
 

3963
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:02,150
to do now with modern methods is to
really study these these proteins and so

3964
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:02,160
really study these these proteins and so
 

3965
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,670
really study these these proteins and so
we we've discovered some of these

3966
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:03,680
we we've discovered some of these
 

3967
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,349
we we've discovered some of these
proteins other other groups have as well

3968
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:05,359
proteins other other groups have as well
 

3969
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:07,510
proteins other other groups have as well
we've dived deep into their structure

3970
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:07,520
we've dived deep into their structure
 

3971
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,430
we've dived deep into their structure
just like the double helix structure of

3972
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:09,440
just like the double helix structure of
 

3973
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,670
just like the double helix structure of
dna was uncovered with x-ray

3974
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:11,680
dna was uncovered with x-ray
 

3975
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,750
dna was uncovered with x-ray
crystallography we used the same method

3976
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:13,760
crystallography we used the same method
 

3977
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,430
crystallography we used the same method
x-ray crystallography to see how these

3978
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:15,440
x-ray crystallography to see how these
 

3979
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,709
x-ray crystallography to see how these
beautiful little

3980
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:16,719
beautiful little
 

3981
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,030
beautiful little
proteins work we re-engineered them for

3982
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:19,040
proteins work we re-engineered them for
 

3983
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,870
proteins work we re-engineered them for
all kinds of function we can make them

3984
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:20,880
all kinds of function we can make them
 

3985
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,309
all kinds of function we can make them
instead of responding to blue light we

3986
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:22,319
instead of responding to blue light we
 

3987
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:24,390
instead of responding to blue light we
can make them respond to red light

3988
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:24,400
can make them respond to red light
 

3989
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,390
can make them respond to red light
we can speed them up slow them down we

3990
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:26,400
we can speed them up slow them down we
 

3991
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,430
we can speed them up slow them down we
can make them

3992
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:27,440
can make them
 

3993
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,510
can make them
with genetic engineering we can make

3994
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:29,520
with genetic engineering we can make
 

3995
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,430
with genetic engineering we can make
them have different ions flow through

3996
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,440
them have different ions flow through
 

3997
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,149
them have different ions flow through
them

3998
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159
them
 

3999
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:34,390
them
and so it's it's this convergence as you

4000
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,400
and so it's it's this convergence as you
 

4001
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,390
and so it's it's this convergence as you
said like the botanist in 1866 couldn't

4002
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:36,400
said like the botanist in 1866 couldn't
 

4003
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,510
said like the botanist in 1866 couldn't
have predicted what we could do with

4004
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:37,520
have predicted what we could do with
 

4005
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,829
have predicted what we could do with
this uh and and the fact that we've been

4006
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
this uh and and the fact that we've been
 

4007
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,269
this uh and and the fact that we've been
able to discover how these beautiful

4008
01:08:41,269 --> 01:08:41,279
able to discover how these beautiful
 

4009
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,510
able to discover how these beautiful
proteins work and then

4010
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:43,520
proteins work and then
 

4011
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,349
proteins work and then
uh apply them to neuroscience is really

4012
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:45,359
uh apply them to neuroscience is really
 

4013
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,950
uh apply them to neuroscience is really
a thrilling story is it possible to

4014
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:46,960
a thrilling story is it possible to
 

4015
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,430
a thrilling story is it possible to
achieve scale do you think with this

4016
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:49,440
achieve scale do you think with this
 

4017

by 2009 we had a pretty general so we
 

4045
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,470
by 2009 we had a pretty general so we
had methods to really make it a

01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,310
range is a little easier is there
constraints on which cells uh now there

constraints on which cells uh now there
 

4117
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,229
constraints on which cells uh now there
really isn't now that we have this

4118
01:10:42,229 --> 01:10:42,239
really isn't now that we have this
 

4119
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,630
really isn't now that we have this
individual cell guidance we can target

4120
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:44,640
individual cell guidance we can target
 

4121
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,630
individual cell guidance we can target
any individual kind of cell very

reliably
and

4126
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:49,920
and
 

4127
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,790
and
so now to your question of scale

4128
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:52,800
so now to your question of scale
 

4129
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,390
so now to your question of scale
uh

4130
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:54,400
uh
 

4131
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,590
uh
how far can we go well

4132
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:57,600
how far can we go well
 

4133
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,189
how far can we go well
things are moving quickly it's hard to

4134
01:10:59,189 --> 01:10:59,199
things are moving quickly it's hard to
 

4135
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,910
things are moving quickly it's hard to
say uh we we can access individual cells

4136
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:01,920
say uh we we can access individual cells
 

4137
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:04,390
say uh we we can access individual cells
across the entire brain now

4138
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:04,400
across the entire brain now
 

4139
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,470
across the entire brain now
if you look 10 20 years in the future um

4140
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:08,480
if you look 10 20 years in the future um
 

4141
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,630
if you look 10 20 years in the future um
you know i think we'll

4142
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:10,640
you know i think we'll
 

4143
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,149
you know i think we'll
we'll surprise ourselves but the fact

4144
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:12,159
we'll surprise ourselves but the fact
 

4145
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:14,390
we'll surprise ourselves but the fact
that we're already able to yeah to cause

4146
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
that we're already able to yeah to cause
 

4147
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,149
that we're already able to yeah to cause
specific perceptions to happen and

4148
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:16,159
specific perceptions to happen and
 

4149
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,630
specific perceptions to happen and
specific actions means we're essentially

4150
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:18,640
specific actions means we're essentially
 

4151
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,830
specific actions means we're essentially
where we want to be and now it's a

4152
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:19,840
where we want to be and now it's a
 

4153
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,790
where we want to be and now it's a
matter of

4154
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:20,800
matter of
 

4155
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,830
matter of
just uh

4156
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:21,840
just uh
 

4157
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,470
just uh
you know

4158
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:24,480

 

4159
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,870

more experiments more discoveries but

4160
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:26,880
more experiments more discoveries but
 

4161
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,630
more experiments more discoveries but
the the basic

4162
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:28,640
the the basic
 

4163
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,470
the the basic
principles are clear now the basic

4164
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:30,480
principles are clear now the basic
 

4165
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,870
principles are clear now the basic
capabilities is there is there a pathway

4166
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:32,880
capabilities is there is there a pathway
 

4167
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,149
capabilities is there is there a pathway
to doing

4168
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:34,159
to doing
 

4169
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:36,149
to doing
the same for humans

4170
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:36,159
the same for humans
 

4171
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:37,590
the same for humans
optogenetics is primarily it's a

4172
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:37,600
optogenetics is primarily it's a
 

4173
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,669
optogenetics is primarily it's a
discovery tool it really is well suited

4174
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:39,679
discovery tool it really is well suited
 

4175
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,709
discovery tool it really is well suited
for use in mice and rats and and monkeys

4176
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
for use in mice and rats and and monkeys
 

4177
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,590
for use in mice and rats and and monkeys
because it's uh

4178
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:45,600
because it's uh
 

4179
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,430
because it's uh
it involves putting in a gene

4180
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
it involves putting in a gene
 

4181
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,910
it involves putting in a gene
uh and also delivering light and those

4182
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
uh and also delivering light and those
 

4183
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,590
uh and also delivering light and those
are two things that you can do in human

4184
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:51,600
are two things that you can do in human
 

4185
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,709
are two things that you can do in human
beings but you'd want to do in a very

4186
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:54,719
beings but you'd want to do in a very
 

4187
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,110
beings but you'd want to do in a very
careful way now that that said there is

4188
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:57,120
careful way now that that said there is
 

4189
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,590
careful way now that that said there is
actually just less than a year ago um my

and he put one of those into an
extracted retina from a human being

4222
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
extracted retina from a human being
 

4223
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,189
extracted retina from a human being
who had died so it was a catavaric

4224
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
who had died so it was a catavaric
 

4225
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,270
who had died so it was a catavaric
retina and he was able to show that

4226
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:39,280
retina and he was able to show that
 

4227
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,149
retina and he was able to show that
optical control in this in this paper

4228
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:42,159
optical control in this in this paper
 

4229
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:44,950
optical control in this in this paper
uh was able to turn on or off individual

4230
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:44,960
uh was able to turn on or off individual
 

4231
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,110
uh was able to turn on or off individual
cells in the human retina so that was a

4232
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:47,120
cells in the human retina so that was a
 

4233
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,390
cells in the human retina so that was a
while back

4234
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:48,400
while back
 

4235
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,709
while back
he spent about 10 years of going through

4236
01:12:50,709 --> 01:12:50,719
he spent about 10 years of going through
 

4237
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,550
he spent about 10 years of going through
all the regulatory

4238
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
all the regulatory
 

4239
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,189
all the regulatory
you know hoops and hurdles and going

4240
01:12:55,189 --> 01:12:55,199
you know hoops and hurdles and going
 

4241
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,350
you know hoops and hurdles and going
through primate studies and finally he

4242
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
through primate studies and finally he
 

4243
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,470
through primate studies and finally he
was able to take a human being

4244
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480
was able to take a human being
 

4245
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,870
was able to take a human being
with a retinal degeneration syndrome so

4246
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
with a retinal degeneration syndrome so
 

4247
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,390
with a retinal degeneration syndrome so
someone who's blind in both eyes

4248
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:06,400
someone who's blind in both eyes
 

4249
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,830
someone who's blind in both eyes
and he gave a one of these options

4250
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:09,840
and he gave a one of these options
 

4251
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,870
and he gave a one of these options
into

4252
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:10,880
into
 

4253
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,110
into
one eye of this human being

4254
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:13,120
one eye of this human being
 

4255
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,950
one eye of this human being
who was blind

4256
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:14,960
who was blind
 

4257
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,149
who was blind
and

4258
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:16,159
and
 

4259
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,669
and
with the goal of conferring light

4260
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
with the goal of conferring light
 

4261
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,709
with the goal of conferring light
sensitivity onto this retina that

4262
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:20,719
sensitivity onto this retina that
 

4263
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:23,270
sensitivity onto this retina that
was not able to see light

4264
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:23,280
was not able to see light
 

4265
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,430
was not able to see light
and he was able to to make this person

4266
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:25,440
and he was able to to make this person
 

4267
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,189
and he was able to to make this person
see through that eye so he took a blind

4268
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
see through that eye so he took a blind
 

4269
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,630
see through that eye so he took a blind
person and the blind person could could

4270
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:28,640
person and the blind person could could
 

4271
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,790
person and the blind person could could
see now could reach for objects

4272
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
see now could reach for objects
 

4273
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,669
see now could reach for objects

it was
 

4281
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,510
it was
you know that's an amazing thing um do

4282

you know that's an amazing thing um do
 

4283
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,709
you know that's an amazing thing um do
you know the title of the pit what's his

4284
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:40,719
you know the title of the pit what's his
 

4285
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,669
you know the title of the pit what's his
name again uh roska r-o-s-k-a

can you look up the nature paper yeah

4288
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:45,600
can you look up the nature paper yeah
 

4289
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:46,790
can you look up the nature paper yeah

nature medicine so that that's sort of
proof of principle now the retina is

4294
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:50,159
proof of principle now the retina is
 

4295
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,550
proof of principle now the retina is
very accessible it's near the surface

4296
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
very accessible it's near the surface
 

4297
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,550
very accessible it's near the surface
you can use natural light or you can use

4298
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
you can use natural light or you can use
 

4299
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,669
you can use natural light or you can use
brighter natural light

4300
01:13:57,669 --> 01:13:57,679
brighter natural light
 

4301
01:13:57,679 --> 01:13:59,350

i see optogenetics as as a discovery

4304
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:01,679
i see optogenetics as as a discovery
 

4305
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:02,709
i see optogenetics as as a discovery
tool it's a way to figure out the

4306
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:02,719
tool it's a way to figure out the
 

4307
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,870
tool it's a way to figure out the
principles by which the brain works and

4308
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:04,880
principles by which the brain works and
 

4309
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,550
principles by which the brain works and
how it operates partial recovery of

4310
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:06,560
how it operates partial recovery of
 

4311
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,030
how it operates partial recovery of
visual function in a blind patient after

4312
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:09,040
visual function in a blind patient after
 

4313
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,630
visual function in a blind patient after
optogenetic therapy so he went through

4314
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:10,640
optogenetic therapy so he went through
 

4315
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,550
optogenetic therapy so he went through
the full process of

4316
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:12,560
the full process of
 

4317
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,950
the full process of
doing primate societies and then and

4318
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:14,960
doing primate societies and then and
 

4319
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,270
doing primate societies and then and
then going well that's dedication and

4320
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:17,280
then going well that's dedication and
 

4321
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,149
then going well that's dedication and
that that's really exciting to see yeah

4322
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:20,159
that that's really exciting to see yeah
 

4323
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,310
that that's really exciting to see yeah
as beautiful as that is and i'm glad he

as beautiful as that is and i'm glad he
 

4325
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,830
as beautiful as that is and i'm glad he
did all that work

4326
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:23,840
did all that work
 

4327
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,310
did all that work
there there are so many other ways that

once you know the principles
 

4333
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,310
once you know the principles
then any kind of therapy can become more

4334

then any kind of therapy can become more
 

4335
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,189
then any kind of therapy can become more
powerful once you know the causal cells

4336
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:35,199
powerful once you know the causal cells
 

4337
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:36,630

4383
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,870
example of how you can cure or you can
you know provide some relief for a

4384
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
you know provide some relief for a
 

4385
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,030
you know provide some relief for a
symptom of a person who has a serious

4386
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:31,040
symptom of a person who has a serious
 

4387
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,030
symptom of a person who has a serious
degenerative disease

4388
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
degenerative disease
 

4389
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:33,830
degenerative disease
but

4390
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:33,840
but
 

4391
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,510
but
but the principles are what what we're

4392
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
but the principles are what what we're
 

4393
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,030
but the principles are what what we're
after and

4394
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:37,040
after and
 

4395
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,709
after and
that's why i spend even though i'm a

4396
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
that's why i spend even though i'm a
 

4397
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:40,470
that's why i spend even though i'm a
psychiatrist even though i i still see

4398
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:40,480
psychiatrist even though i i still see
 

4399
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,870
psychiatrist even though i i still see
patients i'm not myself trying to drive

4400
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:42,880
patients i'm not myself trying to drive
 

4401
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,830
patients i'm not myself trying to drive
any clinical trials in the lab i'm

4402
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:45,840
any clinical trials in the lab i'm
 

4403
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,189
any clinical trials in the lab i'm
trying to discover

4404
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:47,199
trying to discover
 

4405
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:48,070
trying to discover
and then

4406
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:48,080
and then
 

4407
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,910
and then
any kind of therapy could result from

4408
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:49,920
any kind of therapy could result from
 

4409
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,709
any kind of therapy could result from
that

4410
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:50,719
that
 

4411
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,950
that
what do you think about

4412
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:52,960
what do you think about
 

4413
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,229
what do you think about
uh

4414
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:54,239
uh
 

4415
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:57,189
uh
my friend elon musk and his efforts with

4416
01:15:57,189 --> 01:15:57,199
my friend elon musk and his efforts with
 

4417
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:00,470
my friend elon musk and his efforts with
neuralink so this is another

4418
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:00,480
neuralink so this is another
 

4419
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,070
neuralink so this is another
i mean there's a lot of things to say

4420
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,080
i mean there's a lot of things to say
 

4421
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,310
i mean there's a lot of things to say
here because there's a lot of ideas

4422
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:04,320
here because there's a lot of ideas
 

4423
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,030
here because there's a lot of ideas
under the umbrella of neuralink

4424
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:07,040
under the umbrella of neuralink
 

4425
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,870
under the umbrella of neuralink
but one of them is to use electrical

4426
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:08,880
but one of them is to use electrical
 

4427
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,430
but one of them is to use electrical
signals to stimulate and then

4428
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:11,440
signals to stimulate and then
 

4429
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:14,470
signals to stimulate and then
you also record you collect electrical

4430
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:14,480
you also record you collect electrical
 

4431
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,310
you also record you collect electrical
signals from the brain at a higher and

4432
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,320
signals from the brain at a higher and
 

4433
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,750
signals from the brain at a higher and
higher resolution

4434
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:17,760
higher resolution
 

4435
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,110
higher resolution
and you go

4436
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:19,120
and you go
 

4437
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,630
and you go
implant

4438
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:20,640
implant
 

4439
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,229
implant
surgically

4440
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:22,239
surgically
 

4441
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:23,590
surgically
the methods by which you do the

4442
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:23,600
the methods by which you do the
 

4443
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,310
the methods by which you do the
stimulation and the the data collection

4444
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:26,320
stimulation and the the data collection
 

4445
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,510
stimulation and the the data collection
so it's possible for the ideas of

4446
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
so it's possible for the ideas of
 

4447
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,709
so it's possible for the ideas of
optogenetics to play well with this

4448
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:32,719
optogenetics to play well with this
 

4449
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,550
optogenetics to play well with this
and we can even zoom out outside of just

4450
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:34,560
and we can even zoom out outside of just
 

4451
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,030
and we can even zoom out outside of just
neural link and just the whole idea of

4452
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:37,040
neural link and just the whole idea of
 

4453
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,830
neural link and just the whole idea of
brain computer interfaces

4454
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:39,840
brain computer interfaces
 

4455
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,590
brain computer interfaces
what are your thoughts

4456
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:41,600
what are your thoughts
 

4457
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,030
what are your thoughts
well i think the engineering that

4458
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,040
well i think the engineering that
 

4459
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,550
well i think the engineering that
they've done is actually pretty cool so

4460
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
they've done is actually pretty cool so
 

4461
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,669
they've done is actually pretty cool so
i i like the uh robots yeah from the

4462
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:47,679
i i like the uh robots yeah from the
 

4463
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,310
i i like the uh robots yeah from the
from the design perspective and it

4464
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:50,320
from the design perspective and it
 

4465
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,229
from the design perspective and it
wasn't a it was a design approach that

4466
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:52,239
wasn't a it was a design approach that
 

4467
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,390
wasn't a it was a design approach that
wasn't being taken in academia

4468
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:54,400
wasn't being taken in academia
 

4469
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,830
wasn't being taken in academia
and it's great that they did it and i

4470
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,840
and it's great that they did it and i
 

4471
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,669
and it's great that they did it and i
think it's it's pretty cool um so i'll

4472
01:16:57,669 --> 01:16:57,679
think it's it's pretty cool um so i'll
 

4473
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:58,870
think it's it's pretty cool um so i'll
say that

4474
01:16:58,870 --> 01:16:58,880
say that
 

4475
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,870
say that
also there are many ways that you can

4476
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:00,880
also there are many ways that you can
 

4477
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:04,470
also there are many ways that you can
record from many thousands of neurons

4478
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
record from many thousands of neurons
 

4479
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,390
record from many thousands of neurons
and that's not the only way it's a it's

4480
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:06,400
and that's not the only way it's a it's
 

4481
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:07,830
and that's not the only way it's a it's
a very interesting way

4482
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:07,840
a very interesting way
 

4483
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,870
a very interesting way
we and others are using uh

4484
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:10,880
we and others are using uh
 

4485
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,390
we and others are using uh
brain penetrating electrodes that

4486
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
brain penetrating electrodes that
 

4487
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,390
brain penetrating electrodes that
actually get quite deep this whole

4488
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:14,400
actually get quite deep this whole
 

4489
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,669
actually get quite deep this whole
structure the brain is very interesting

4490
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
structure the brain is very interesting
 

4491
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,390
structure the brain is very interesting
we there's the surface cortex where it's

4492
01:17:18,390 --> 01:17:18,400
we there's the surface cortex where it's
 

4493
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,390
we there's the surface cortex where it's
the most recently

4494
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:20,400
the most recently

uh
 

4499
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,070
uh
mammals have it reptiles have something

4500
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:26,080
mammals have it reptiles have something
 

4501
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,750
mammals have it reptiles have something
a little bit like it but it's not really

4502
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:27,760
a little bit like it but it's not really
 

4503
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,350
a little bit like it but it's not really
the full thing

4504
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:29,360
the full thing
 

4505
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,870
the full thing
it's a this is a very recent thing

4506
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:30,880
it's a this is a very recent thing
 

4507
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,390
it's a this is a very recent thing
that's what we can access with some of

4508
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:32,400
that's what we can access with some of
 

4509
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,310
that's what we can access with some of
these you know like the neural link

4510
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,320
these you know like the neural link
 

4511
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,630
these you know like the neural link
approach and with some of these short

4512
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:36,640
approach and with some of these short
 

4513
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,070
approach and with some of these short
electrodes

4514

this part of the brain the cortex is
 

4517
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,030
this part of the brain the cortex is
only a few millimeters thick there's so

4518
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,040
only a few millimeters thick there's so
 

4519
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,310
only a few millimeters thick there's so
much that's deep though that's so

much that's deep though that's so
 

4521
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,830
much that's deep though that's so
important there's the striatum there's

01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:43,840
important there's the striatum there's
 

4523
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,510
important there's the striatum there's
the thalamus there are the parts of the

not getting to and so we and others are
using these very long

4544
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:06,000
using these very long
 

4545
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,990
using these very long
electrodes that help us get deep and we

4546
01:18:07,990 --> 01:18:08,000
electrodes that help us get deep and we
 

4547
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,590
electrodes that help us get deep and we
can still record for many cells many

4548
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:09,600
can still record for many cells many
 

4549
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,430
can still record for many cells many
thousands of cells

4550
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:11,440
thousands of cells
 

4551
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,590
thousands of cells
we can have multiple of these at once in

4552
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:13,600
we can have multiple of these at once in
 

4553
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,189
we can have multiple of these at once in
the same animal

4554
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:15,199
the same animal
 

4555
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:16,709
the same animal
and so there's a diversity of methods to

4556
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:16,719
and so there's a diversity of methods to
 

4557
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:19,030
and so there's a diversity of methods to
get to this goal um i think it's great

4558
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:19,040
get to this goal um i think it's great
 

4559
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,350
get to this goal um i think it's great

but

4628
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:33,040
but
 

4629
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,750
but
you're able to but it's less ability to

4630
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:35,760
you're able to but it's less ability to
 

4631
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,470
you're able to but it's less ability to

control precisely at scale
 

4633
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:39,990
control precisely at scale
so like there's challenges and there's

4634
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:40,000
so like there's challenges and there's
 

4635
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,990
so like there's challenges and there's
benefits and having those two interplay

01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:55,199
well the the mushy mesh is kind of
 

4651
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,630
well the the mushy mesh is kind of

problems with light light scatters in

4654
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,400
problems with light light scatters in
 

4655
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,709
problems with light light scatters in
the brain so the the photons don't just

4656
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
the brain so the the photons don't just
 

4657
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,390
the brain so the the photons don't just
go you know linearly through they

4658
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:02,400
go you know linearly through they
 

4659
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,390
go you know linearly through they
whenever they hit an interface between

4660
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:04,400
whenever they hit an interface between
 

4661
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,870
whenever they hit an interface between
fat and water lipid and water

4662
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:06,880
fat and water lipid and water
 

4663
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,390
fat and water lipid and water
they they bounce off in different

4664
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:08,400
they they bounce off in different
 

4665
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,790
they they bounce off in different
directions and so you can come in with

4666
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:10,800
directions and so you can come in with
 

4667
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,149
directions and so you can come in with
all the resolution you want you could

4668
01:20:12,149 --> 01:20:12,159
all the resolution you want you could
 

4669
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:14,709
all the resolution you want you could
play in an incredibly detailed high

4670
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:14,719
play in an incredibly detailed high
 

4671
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,629
play in an incredibly detailed high
resolution pattern of light but the

4672
01:20:16,629 --> 01:20:16,639
resolution pattern of light but the
 

4673
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,870
resolution pattern of light but the
photons start scattering uh quite

4674
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:18,880
photons start scattering uh quite
 

4675
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,470
photons start scattering uh quite
quickly and by the time you've gone a

4676
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:20,480
quickly and by the time you've gone a
 

4677
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,709
quickly and by the time you've gone a
couple millimeters deep you've lost

4678
01:20:22,709 --> 01:20:22,719
couple millimeters deep you've lost
 

4679
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,350
couple millimeters deep you've lost
almost all that fine spatial information

4680
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:25,360
almost all that fine spatial information
 

4681
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,149
almost all that fine spatial information
so

4682
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:26,159
so
 

4683
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:27,990
so
but we've developed workarounds the

4684
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,000
but we've developed workarounds the
 

4685
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,070
but we've developed workarounds the
longer wavelength light you use if you

4686
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:30,080
longer wavelength light you use if you
 

4687
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,270
longer wavelength light you use if you
get into the infrared there's less

4688
01:20:31,270 --> 01:20:31,280
get into the infrared there's less
 

4689
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,110
get into the infrared there's less
scattering you can use two photon

4690
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:33,120
scattering you can use two photon
 

4691
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,870
scattering you can use two photon
methods or three photon methods where

4692
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:34,880
methods or three photon methods where
 

4693
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,870
methods or three photon methods where
the photons have to arrive all together

4694
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:36,880
the photons have to arrive all together
 

4695
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,310
the photons have to arrive all together
at the same time

4696
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:38,320
at the same time
 

4697
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,470

you can access these deep structures

4702
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:44,880
you can access these deep structures
 

4703
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,629
you can access these deep structures
with fiber optic methods and you can put

01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,149
with fiber optic methods and you can put
many of these fiber optics at the same

4706
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:48,159
many of these fiber optics at the same
 

4707
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:50,709
many of these fiber optics at the same
time in an animal we've used holographic

4708
01:20:50,709 --> 01:20:50,719
time in an animal we've used holographic
 

4709
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:52,229
time in an animal we've used holographic
methods

4710
01:20:52,229 --> 01:20:52,239
methods
 

4711
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,310
methods
3d holograms to play in

4712
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:54,320
3d holograms to play in
 

4713
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,390
3d holograms to play in
hundreds of individual cell sized spots

4714
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:56,400
hundreds of individual cell sized spots
 

4715
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,990
hundreds of individual cell sized spots
of light and we can and we can change

4716
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
of light and we can and we can change
 

4717
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,830
of light and we can and we can change
those quickly and so there are a lot of

4718
01:20:59,830 --> 01:20:59,840
those quickly and so there are a lot of
 

4719
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,270
those quickly and so there are a lot of
tricks a lot of interesting optics

4720
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:01,280
tricks a lot of interesting optics
 

4721
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,110
tricks a lot of interesting optics
engineering that has come together with

4722
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:03,120
engineering that has come together with
 

4723
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,790
engineering that has come together with
neuroscience in a pretty exciting way

4724
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:04,800
neuroscience in a pretty exciting way
 

4725
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,229
neuroscience in a pretty exciting way
but it's engineering too it was just

4726
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
but it's engineering too it was just
 

4727
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,830
but it's engineering too it was just
super super super exciting i should

4728
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:07,840
super super super exciting i should
 

4729
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,110
super super super exciting i should
mention because i remember mentioning

4730
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120

for the first time ever
 

4737
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:16,870
for the first time ever
got covered

4738
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:16,880
got covered
 

4739
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,910
got covered
um

4740
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:17,920
um
 

4741
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,550
um
how did i go so long

4742
01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:20,560
how did i go so long
 

4743
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,030
how did i go so long
without finally so i'm all vaccinated

4744
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,040
without finally so i'm all vaccinated
 

4745
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,830
without finally so i'm all vaccinated
and everything like that and so i got uh

4746
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:25,840
and everything like that and so i got uh
 

4747
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,350
and everything like that and so i got uh
because i think he he mentioned it

4748
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
because i think he he mentioned it
 

4749
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,189
because i think he he mentioned it
publicly so i can mention it but i won't

4750
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
publicly so i can mention it but i won't
 

4751
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,629
publicly so i can mention it but i won't
mention anybody else involved but

4752
01:21:30,629 --> 01:21:30,639
mention anybody else involved but
 

4753
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,870
mention anybody else involved but
hanging out we've all got you and got

4754
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:32,880
hanging out we've all got you and got
 

4755
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,030
hanging out we've all got you and got
covered and the interesting thing about

4756
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,040
covered and the interesting thing about
 

4757
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,629
covered and the interesting thing about
maybe you can comment about this so i

4758
01:21:36,629 --> 01:21:36,639
maybe you can comment about this so i
 

4759
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,790
maybe you can comment about this so i
was only sick for like a half a day i

4760
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
was only sick for like a half a day i
 

4761
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,390
was only sick for like a half a day i
got a fever of like 104 i just went up

4762
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,400
got a fever of like 104 i just went up
 

4763
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,350
got a fever of like 104 i just went up
and then crashed and then i was

4764
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,360
and then crashed and then i was
 

4765
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,830
and then crashed and then i was
now maybe i'm just seeing the silver

4766
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:47,840
now maybe i'm just seeing the silver
 

4767
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,590
now maybe i'm just seeing the silver
lining of everything but

4768
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:49,600
lining of everything but
 

4769
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,590
lining of everything but
afterwards

4770
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
afterwards
 

4771
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:52,790
afterwards
uh

4772
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
uh
 

4773
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,950
uh
i have like a greater clarity about the

4774
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:54,960
i have like a greater clarity about the
 

4775
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,350
i have like a greater clarity about the
world

4776
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,360
world
 

4777
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,709
world
you just think it's greater clarity

4778
01:21:58,709 --> 01:21:58,719
you just think it's greater clarity
 

4779
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:01,350
you just think it's greater clarity
maybe maybe i just it was so

4780
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:01,360
maybe maybe i just it was so
 

4781
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:03,830
maybe maybe i just it was so
uh maybe so intensely

4782
01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:03,840
uh maybe so intensely
 

4783
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:04,550
uh maybe so intensely
the

4784
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560
the
 

4785
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,790
the
mind fog kind of thing for such a short

4786
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:06,800
mind fog kind of thing for such a short
 

4787
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,950
mind fog kind of thing for such a short
amount of time but the people were

4788
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:08,960
amount of time but the people were
 

4789
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,070
amount of time but the people were
involved were also reporting this it's

4790
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:12,080
involved were also reporting this it's
 

4791
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,229
involved were also reporting this it's
kind of interesting it's like uh because

4792
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:14,239
kind of interesting it's like uh because
 

4793
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,070
kind of interesting it's like uh because
i i do know

4794
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
i i do know
 

4795
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,990
i i do know
like the immune system

4796
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:18,000
like the immune system
 

4797
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,550
like the immune system
uh is involved with the brain in very

4798
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:20,560
uh is involved with the brain in very
 

4799
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,950
uh is involved with the brain in very
interesting ways so like the human mind

4800
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:22,960
interesting ways so like the human mind
 

4801
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,790
interesting ways so like the human mind

4819
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:41,910
stephen pinker on this but like i wonder
what the benefits of certain diseases

4820
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:41,920
what the benefits of certain diseases
 

4821
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,750
what the benefits of certain diseases
are if you're able to recover

4822
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:43,760
are if you're able to recover
 

4823
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,310
are if you're able to recover
like what is there some like uh again

4824
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:46,320
like what is there some like uh again
 

4825
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,990
like what is there some like uh again
don't want to romanticize it but if your

4826
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,000
don't want to romanticize it but if your
 

4827
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,149
don't want to romanticize it but if your
system goes to some kind of hardship and

4828
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:50,159
system goes to some kind of hardship and
 

4829
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,229
system goes to some kind of hardship and
you come out on the other end i wonder

4830
01:22:52,229 --> 01:22:52,239
you come out on the other end i wonder
 

4831
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:55,110
you come out on the other end i wonder
sometimes if there's a greater um maybe

4832
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:55,120
sometimes if there's a greater um maybe
 

4833
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,550
sometimes if there's a greater um maybe

of this work uh akiko iwasaki yale has
 

4865
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,350
of this work uh akiko iwasaki yale has
done a lot of this

4866
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:25,360
done a lot of this
 

4867
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:28,149
done a lot of this
but what what they found is that

01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:31,280
there's a loss of myelin this is the
 

4871
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,189
there's a loss of myelin this is the

4875
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,430
that go from one part of the brain to
another myelin is this sort of insulator

01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,629
is there a belief neuron
is there so through this methodology of

is there so through this methodology of
 

4977
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:29,590
is there so through this methodology of
optogenetics can you start

4978
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:29,600
optogenetics can you start
 

4979
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,550
optogenetics can you start
getting

01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:05,920
you there's no good answer but they're

temporal lobe uh in these parts of the
 

5031
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:29,990
temporal lobe uh in these parts of the
brain that are

5032
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:30,000
brain that are
 

5033
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,189
brain that are
at the side

5034
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:31,199
at the side
 

5035
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,030
at the side
and so that's initial

5036
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:33,040
and so that's initial
 

5037
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:34,229
and so that's initial
clue

5038
01:26:34,229 --> 01:26:34,239
clue
 

5039
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:35,430
clue
there are also

5040
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:35,440
there are also
 

5041
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,830
there are also
parts of the brain that

5042
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
parts of the brain that
 

5043
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:40,229
parts of the brain that
are involved in the

5044
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:40,239
are involved in the
 

5045
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:41,830
are involved in the
definition of the self

5046
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:41,840
definition of the self
 

5047
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,390
definition of the self
uh and defining the borders or

5048
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:44,400
uh and defining the borders or
 

5049
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,629
uh and defining the borders or
boundaries of the self

5050
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:46,639
boundaries of the self
 

5051
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:47,669
boundaries of the self
and

5052
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:47,679
and
 

5053
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:48,790
and
we know this there's just some

5054
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:48,800
we know this there's just some
 

5055
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,310
we know this there's just some
experiments that we did in my lab

5056
01:26:50,310 --> 01:26:50,320
experiments that we did in my lab
 

5057
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,910
experiments that we did in my lab
there's a part of the brain where if

5058
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:51,920
there's a part of the brain where if
 

5059
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:55,030
there's a part of the brain where if
there's a rhythm

5060
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:55,040

 

5061
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,950

of a particular type you can cause a

5062
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:56,960
of a particular type you can cause a
 

5063
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,669
of a particular type you can cause a
separation of the sense of

5064
01:26:59,669 --> 01:26:59,679
separation of the sense of
 

5065
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:00,629
separation of the sense of
self

5066
01:27:00,629 --> 01:27:00,639
self
 

5067
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,629
self
from the sense of the body

5068
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:02,639
from the sense of the body
 

5069
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,110
from the sense of the body
what's normally bound up and unitary we

5070
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:05,120
what's normally bound up and unitary we
 

5071
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,870
what's normally bound up and unitary we
normally think of ourself in our body as

5072
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:06,880
normally think of ourself in our body as
 

5073
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,709
normally think of ourself in our body as
is pretty tightly bound up together

5074
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:08,719
is pretty tightly bound up together
 

5075
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,390
is pretty tightly bound up together
those can be separated it turns out we

5076
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:10,400
those can be separated it turns out we
 

5077
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,750
those can be separated it turns out we
can't take that for granted and there

5078
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:11,760
can't take that for granted and there
 

5079
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,189
can't take that for granted and there
are certain conditions certain patterns

5080
01:27:13,189 --> 01:27:13,199
are certain conditions certain patterns
 

5081
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,470
are certain conditions certain patterns
of activity in

5082
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:14,480
of activity in
 

5083
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,750
of activity in
one part of the brain called the

5084
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:15,760
one part of the brain called the
 

5085
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,270
one part of the brain called the
retrosplenial cortex where you can

5086
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:19,280
retrosplenial cortex where you can
 

5087
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,430
retrosplenial cortex where you can
actually separate those two out and so

5088
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:21,440
actually separate those two out and so
 

5089
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,189
actually separate those two out and so
if you think about

5090
01:27:23,189 --> 01:27:23,199
if you think about
 

5091
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,030
if you think about
these very big questions

5092
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:25,040
these very big questions
 

5093
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,870
these very big questions
you know what is

5094
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:26,880
you know what is
 

5095
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,350
you know what is
where are the origins of religiosity

5096
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:29,360
where are the origins of religiosity
 

5097
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,310
where are the origins of religiosity
where how do we define the boundaries of

5098
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:32,320
where how do we define the boundaries of
 

5099
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,870
where how do we define the boundaries of
who we are relative to others and to the

5100
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:34,880
who we are relative to others and to the
 

5101
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,550
who we are relative to others and to the
world

5102
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:36,560
world
 

5103
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,709
world
how do we link

5104
01:27:38,709 --> 01:27:38,719
how do we link
 

5105
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:40,950
how do we link
our self to our body and how can that

5106
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:40,960
our self to our body and how can that
 

5107
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,030
our self to our body and how can that
become separated these are actually

5108
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:43,040
become separated these are actually
 

5109
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,950
become separated these are actually
believe it or not now

5110
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:44,960
believe it or not now
 

5111
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,510
believe it or not now
accessible and rigorously and

5112
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520
accessible and rigorously and
 

5113
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,750
accessible and rigorously and
quantitatively so we did an experiment

5114
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:49,760
quantitatively so we did an experiment
 

5115
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,310
quantitatively so we did an experiment
with optogenetics where we provided

5116
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:52,320
with optogenetics where we provided
 

5117
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,470
with optogenetics where we provided
this abnormal rhythm

5118
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
this abnormal rhythm
 

5119
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,550
this abnormal rhythm
to this particular part of the mouse

5120
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:56,560
to this particular part of the mouse
 

5121
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,629
to this particular part of the mouse
brain and we saw this separation of

5122
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:00,639
brain and we saw this separation of
 

5123
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,470
brain and we saw this separation of
detection of a stimulus

5124
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:02,480
detection of a stimulus
 

5125
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,590
detection of a stimulus
and

5126
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:03,600
and
 

5127
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,590
and
caring about it so that's that's like

5128
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:05,600
caring about it so that's that's like
 

5129
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,110
caring about it so that's that's like
stimulating something about the model's

5130
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:07,120
stimulating something about the model's
 

5131
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,270
stimulating something about the model's
brain that affects these

5132
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:09,280
brain that affects these
 

5133
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,830
brain that affects these
neurons that give the conception of self

5134
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:11,840
neurons that give the conception of self
 

5135
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,149
neurons that give the conception of self
so you're able to dissociate the

5136
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
so you're able to dissociate the
 

5137
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,550
so you're able to dissociate the
experience from the impact of the

5138
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:16,560
experience from the impact of the
 

5139
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,709
experience from the impact of the
experience unto you that's right exactly

5140
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:18,719
experience unto you that's right exactly
 

5141
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:19,430
experience unto you that's right exactly
right

5142
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:19,440
right
 

5143
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,709
right
so like these are the goals of

5144
01:28:20,709 --> 01:28:20,719
so like these are the goals of
 

5145
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,870
so like these are the goals of
meditation

5146
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:22,880
meditation
 

5147
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,110
meditation
uh these are the goals whenever i get

5148
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:25,120
uh these are the goals whenever i get
 

5149
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,430
uh these are the goals whenever i get
drunk pretty much effective i mean

5150
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,440
drunk pretty much effective i mean
 

5151
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,030
drunk pretty much effective i mean
that's not a scientific statement just

5152
01:28:29,030 --> 01:28:29,040
that's not a scientific statement just
 

5153
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:32,229
that's not a scientific statement just
an experiential anecdotal one um also

5154
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:32,239
an experiential anecdotal one um also
 

5155
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,270
an experiential anecdotal one um also
psychedelics seek to this

5156
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:35,280
psychedelics seek to this
 

5157
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,070
psychedelics seek to this
uh to attain this kind of state that's

5158
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:38,080
uh to attain this kind of state that's
 

5159
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:39,510
uh to attain this kind of state that's
so interesting well you mentioned

5160
01:28:39,510 --> 01:28:39,520
so interesting well you mentioned
 

5161
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,310
so interesting well you mentioned
psychedelics you know dmt and five meow

record it across many people

5196
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:14,400
record it across many people
 

5197
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,189
record it across many people
and then from there see where do these

5198
01:29:17,189 --> 01:29:17,199
and then from there see where do these
 

5199
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,510
and then from there see where do these
experiences originate in the brain in

5200
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,520
experiences originate in the brain in
 

5201
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,510
experiences originate in the brain in
terms of single neurons

5202
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:21,520
terms of single neurons
 

5203
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,030
terms of single neurons
and then

5204
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:23,040
and then
 

5205
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:25,350
and then
how do they how do they propagate and

5206
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:25,360
how do they how do they propagate and
 

5207
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,709
how do they how do they propagate and
interact with everything else and if

5208
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:26,719
interact with everything else and if
 

5209
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,550
interact with everything else and if
there's some kind of

5210
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:28,560
there's some kind of
 

5211
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,149
there's some kind of
uh common

5212
01:29:30,149 --> 01:29:30,159
uh common
 

5213
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,310
uh common
signal like how do you

5214
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:32,320
signal like how do you
 

5215
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:34,470
signal like how do you
narrow down the set of neurons that are

5216
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:34,480
narrow down the set of neurons that are
 

5217
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,709
narrow down the set of neurons that are
responsible for particular experience or

5218
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:36,719
responsible for particular experience or
 

5219
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,709
responsible for particular experience or
for a particular behavioral effect yeah

5220
01:29:38,709 --> 01:29:38,719
for a particular behavioral effect yeah
 

5221
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:40,390
for a particular behavioral effect yeah
here's where optogenetics is so useful

5222
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:40,400
here's where optogenetics is so useful
 

5223
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,110
here's where optogenetics is so useful
because any time you give an agent like

5224
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:43,120
because any time you give an agent like
 

5225
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,430
because any time you give an agent like
a you know an agent like

5226
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:45,440
a you know an agent like
 

5227
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:48,070
a you know an agent like
ketamine or pcp which we used for our

5228
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:48,080
ketamine or pcp which we used for our
 

5229
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,669
ketamine or pcp which we used for our
dissociation experiments that i was

5230
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:49,679
dissociation experiments that i was
 

5231
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:52,470
dissociation experiments that i was
mentioning or you have a psychedelic

5232
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:52,480

for this uh altered perceptual state

5236
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:57,840
for this uh altered perceptual state
 

5237
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,189
for this uh altered perceptual state
if you

5238
01:29:59,189 --> 01:29:59,199
if you
 

5239
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,270
if you
if you give either of those these

5240
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:01,280
if you give either of those these
 

5241
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,950
if you give either of those these
change everything across the brain okay

5242
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:02,960
change everything across the brain okay
 

5243
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,110
change everything across the brain okay
so just just the fact that you maybe

5244
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:05,120
so just just the fact that you maybe
 

5245
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,790
so just just the fact that you maybe
give them to a mouse let's say or

5246
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:06,800
give them to a mouse let's say or
 

5247
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,830
give them to a mouse let's say or
eventually to a human

01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:09,840

 

5249
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,189

you won't know

5250
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:11,199
you won't know
 

5251
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:12,229
you won't know

but then what we found is that
 

5261
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,189
but then what we found is that
optogenetics providing a causal pattern

5262

5265
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,470
of activity guided by what you see
can let you test hypotheses and we saw

5266
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:28,480
can let you test hypotheses and we saw
 

5267
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,669
can let you test hypotheses and we saw
this rhythm

5268
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:29,679
this rhythm
 

5269
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:32,229
this rhythm
with ketamine and pcp for dissociation

5270
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:32,239
with ketamine and pcp for dissociation
 

5271
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,550
with ketamine and pcp for dissociation
and then we said okay let's test what's

5272
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:34,560
and then we said okay let's test what's
 

5273
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,750
and then we said okay let's test what's
causal

5274
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:35,760
causal
 

5275
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,070
causal
we came in and provided that rhythm we

5276
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:38,080
we came in and provided that rhythm we
 

5277
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:39,830
we came in and provided that rhythm we
tried a few different things but only

5278
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:39,840
tried a few different things but only
 

5279
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,830
tried a few different things but only
one of the causal tests we tried

5280
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:41,840
one of the causal tests we tried
 

5281
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,590
one of the causal tests we tried
actually caused the behavioral

5282
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:43,600
actually caused the behavioral
 

5283
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,950
actually caused the behavioral
dissociation

5284
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:44,960
dissociation
 

5285
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,790
dissociation
and so that's how we hone in on what

5286
01:30:46,790 --> 01:30:46,800
and so that's how we hone in on what
 

5287
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,550
and so that's how we hone in on what
actually and is it repeatable once you

5288
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:48,560
actually and is it repeatable once you
 

5289
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,910
actually and is it repeatable once you
see the cause so like that's one

5290
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:49,920
see the cause so like that's one
 

5291
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,470
see the cause so like that's one
definition of causality is like you try

5292
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,480
definition of causality is like you try
 

5293
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,110
definition of causality is like you try
and repeats across different mice and

5294
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,120
and repeats across different mice and
 

5295
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,910
and repeats across different mice and
all that kind of stuff exactly

5296
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:57,920
all that kind of stuff exactly
 

5297
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,910
all that kind of stuff exactly
and so you could do that for dmt you

5298
01:30:59,910 --> 01:30:59,920
and so you could do that for dmt you
 

5299
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,510
and so you could do that for dmt you
could do that for like the really

5300
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,520
could do that for like the really
 

5301
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:04,790
could do that for like the really

01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,030
appreciate that
so what we're talking about so do there

5334
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:35,040
so what we're talking about so do there
 

5335
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:36,790
so what we're talking about so do there
is i mean i think a connection between

5336
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:36,800
is i mean i think a connection between
 

5337
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,709
is i mean i think a connection between
gmt and religious experiences or some of

5338
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:38,719
gmt and religious experiences or some of
 

5339
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,790
gmt and religious experiences or some of
these psychedelics do you think it's

5340
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:40,800
these psychedelics do you think it's
 

5341
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,990
these psychedelics do you think it's
possible to

5342
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:44,000
possible to
 

5343
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,270
possible to
sort of stimulate religious experiences

5344
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:47,280
sort of stimulate religious experiences
 

5345
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,030
sort of stimulate religious experiences
so religious experiences are one of the

5346
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,040
so religious experiences are one of the
 

5347
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,310
so religious experiences are one of the
most

5348
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:50,320
most
 

5349
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,270
most
deep kind of experiences and so here you

5350
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,280
deep kind of experiences and so here you
 

5351
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,870
deep kind of experiences and so here you
could

5352
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:54,880
could
 

5353
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,950
could
first understand

5354
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:56,960
first understand
 

5355
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,390
first understand
where they originate

5356
01:31:58,390 --> 01:31:58,400
where they originate
 

5357
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,189
where they originate
how they propagate to the brain

5358
01:32:01,189 --> 01:32:01,199
how they propagate to the brain
 

5359
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,669
how they propagate to the brain
and then to stimulate them yeah

5360
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:03,679
and then to stimulate them yeah
 

5361
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:04,870
and then to stimulate them yeah
yeah

5362

yeah
 

5363
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:06,629
yeah
and so this is and these that can happen

5364
01:32:06,629 --> 01:32:06,639
and so this is and these that can happen
 

5365
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:07,590
and so this is and these that can happen
in

5366
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:07,600

these states
 

5379
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,830
these states
now to be clear i'm not advocating these

5380

we don't know what's safe uh in human
beings but we definitely

5384
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:25,760
beings but we definitely
 

5385
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,669
beings but we definitely
have not yet but we definitely can do

5386
01:32:27,669 --> 01:32:27,679
have not yet but we definitely can do
 

5387
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:30,229
have not yet but we definitely can do
these experiments in in mice and that

5388
01:32:30,229 --> 01:32:30,239
these experiments in in mice and that
 

5389
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,510
these experiments in in mice and that
was already

5390
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:31,520
was already
 

5391
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,790
was already
very productive in understanding

5392
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:32,800
very productive in understanding
 

5393
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,950
very productive in understanding
dissociation so we can already imagine

5394
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:34,960
dissociation so we can already imagine
 

5395
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,189
dissociation so we can already imagine
making headway on these methods

5396
01:32:37,189 --> 01:32:37,199
making headway on these methods
 

5397
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:38,950
making headway on these methods
and then you know i had a and this this

5398
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:38,960
and then you know i had a and this this

pushed into a mania a manic state

5442
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:24,800
pushed into a mania a manic state
 

5443
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,030
pushed into a mania a manic state
revealing that he had bipolar never

5444
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:27,040
revealing that he had bipolar never
 

5445
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:30,629
revealing that he had bipolar never
before known in this case in this person

01:33:30,629 --> 01:33:30,639
before known in this case in this person
 

5447
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:33,350
before known in this case in this person
and his mania his elevated state and

5448
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,360
and his mania his elevated state and
 

5449
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,189
and his mania his elevated state and
bipolar included this profound

5450
01:33:35,189 --> 01:33:35,199
bipolar included this profound
 

5451
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:36,950
bipolar included this profound
religiosity he

5452
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:36,960
religiosity he
 

5453
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,110
religiosity he
which he had never had before and he was

5454
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:39,120
which he had never had before and he was
 

5455
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,470
which he had never had before and he was
he was you know

5456
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
he was you know
 

5457
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,950
he was you know
preaching in a

5458
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:42,960
preaching in a
 

5459
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,590
preaching in a
elevated you know vigorous way to his

5460
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:45,600
elevated you know vigorous way to his
 

5461
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,149
elevated you know vigorous way to his
family and so this this state

5462
01:33:48,149 --> 01:33:48,159
family and so this this state
 

5463
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:50,629
family and so this this state
can be created and people even late in

5464
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:50,639
can be created and people even late in
 

5465
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,470
can be created and people even late in
life who had no predisposition for it

5466
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:52,480
life who had no predisposition for it
 

5467
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,350
life who had no predisposition for it
and know

5468
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,360
and know
 

5469
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,750
and know
even without a neurochemical so

5470
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:55,760
even without a neurochemical so
 

5471
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,430
even without a neurochemical so
there's the the the causality of that is

5472
01:33:59,430 --> 01:33:59,440
there's the the the causality of that is
 

5473
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,669
there's the the the causality of that is
very interesting to explore how did the

5474
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:01,679
very interesting to explore how did the
 

5475
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,830
very interesting to explore how did the
the manic state

5476
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:03,840
the manic state
 

5477
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:06,149

unleash this religiosity but you see

5478
01:34:06,149 --> 01:34:06,159
unleash this religiosity but you see
 

5479
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:08,310
unleash this religiosity but you see
that in other realms of of psychiatry

5480
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:08,320
that in other realms of of psychiatry
 

5481
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,590
that in other realms of of psychiatry
too ocd

5482
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:09,600
too ocd
 

5483
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,830
too ocd
can manifest as religiosity also you can

5484
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:11,840
can manifest as religiosity also you can
 

5485
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,189

take people who never really had a

5486
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:15,199
take people who never really had a
 

5487
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:15,990
take people who never really had a
a

5488
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,000
a
 

5489
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,510
a
religion ever played a powerful role in

5490
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:17,520
religion ever played a powerful role in
 

5491
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,390
religion ever played a powerful role in
their life

5492
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:18,400
their life
 

5493
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,669
their life
but then when their

5494
01:34:19,669 --> 01:34:19,679
but then when their
 

5495
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:21,270
but then when their
obsessive compulsive symptoms become

5496
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:21,280
obsessive compulsive symptoms become
 

5497
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:23,270
obsessive compulsive symptoms become
severe they can manifest in this i think

5498
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:23,280
severe they can manifest in this i think
 

5499
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,229
severe they can manifest in this i think
i'm in that group so i'm a bit ocd

5500
01:34:26,229 --> 01:34:26,239
i'm in that group so i'm a bit ocd
 

5501
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:27,590
i'm in that group so i'm a bit ocd
we have uh

5502
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:27,600
we have uh
 

5503
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,750
we have uh
there's i think this is subreddits uh

5504
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:29,760
there's i think this is subreddits uh
 

5505
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,709
there's i think this is subreddits uh
one is oddly satisfying things

5506
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:32,719
one is oddly satisfying things
 

5507
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:34,709
one is oddly satisfying things
so there's certain things that are

5508
01:34:34,709 --> 01:34:34,719
so there's certain things that are
 

5509
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,390
so there's certain things that are
really satisfying to my ocd in my mild

5510
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:38,400
really satisfying to my ocd in my mild
 

5511
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,030
really satisfying to my ocd in my mild
ocd i think it's pretty much a religious

5512
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:41,040
ocd i think it's pretty much a religious
 

5513
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,790
ocd i think it's pretty much a religious
experience

5514
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:42,800
experience
 

5515
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,109
experience
so i understand that there's it if it's

5516
01:34:45,109 --> 01:34:45,119
so i understand that there's it if it's
 

5517
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:48,229
so i understand that there's it if it's
not direct it's at least uh rhymes

5518
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:48,239
not direct it's at least uh rhymes
 

5519
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:51,830
not direct it's at least uh rhymes
so maybe can you speak to the

5520
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:51,840
so maybe can you speak to the
 

5521
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:53,990
so maybe can you speak to the

but at a very deep level
 

5695
01:37:58,400 --> 01:37:59,830
but at a very deep level
there's nothing we can measure in a

there's nothing we can measure in a
 

5697
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,830
there's nothing we can measure in a
person objectively so we don't have

that's different not a known brain
 

5705
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:09,510
that's different not a known brain
activity pattern that we can pick up

5706
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:09,520
activity pattern that we can pick up
 

5707
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:10,790

a lot of people are exploring this but

5710
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:12,560
a lot of people are exploring this but
 

5711
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,149
a lot of people are exploring this but
right now we have no objective measures

5712
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:14,159
right now we have no objective measures
 

5713
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,149
right now we have no objective measures
all we do is talk to people and we

5714
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:16,159
all we do is talk to people and we
 

5715
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,149
all we do is talk to people and we
elicit these symptoms

5716
01:38:18,149 --> 01:38:18,159
elicit these symptoms
 

5717
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:20,709
elicit these symptoms
we explore them

5718
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:20,719
we explore them
 

5719
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,310
we explore them
distinguish them from other possible

5720
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:22,320
distinguish them from other possible
 

5721
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,510
distinguish them from other possible
causes

5722
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:23,520
causes
 

5723
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,189
causes
and then what do we do

5724
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:25,199
and then what do we do
 

5725
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,350
and then what do we do
well we have a range of treatments we

5726
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:27,360
well we have a range of treatments we
 

5727
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,430
well we have a range of treatments we
have medications that

5728
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:29,440
have medications that
 

5729
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,510
have medications that
can help people do help people but not

5730
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:31,520
can help people do help people but not
 

5731
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,189
can help people do help people but not
everybody um

5732
01:38:33,189 --> 01:38:33,199
everybody um
 

5733
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:34,870
everybody um
and if they don't work then we can go to

5734
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:34,880
and if they don't work then we can go to
 

5735
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,030
and if they don't work then we can go to
brain stimulation methods we can do

5736
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,040
brain stimulation methods we can do
 

5737
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,030
brain stimulation methods we can do
things even like electroconvulsive

5738
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:39,040
things even like electroconvulsive
 

5739
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:42,390
things even like electroconvulsive
therapy which is uh a very effective but

5740
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:42,400
therapy which is uh a very effective but
 

5741
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,870
therapy which is uh a very effective but
it's that's a sort of the final thing we

5742
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:44,880
it's that's a sort of the final thing we
 

5743
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,030
it's that's a sort of the final thing we
go to in the end

5744
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,040
go to in the end
 

5745
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:48,229
go to in the end
and

5746
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:48,239
and
 

5747
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:51,189
and
so we have treatments they they work uh

5748
01:38:51,189 --> 01:38:51,199
so we have treatments they they work uh
 

5749
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,790
so we have treatments they they work uh
for some people they don't do everything

5750
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,800
for some people they don't do everything
 

5751
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,109
for some people they don't do everything
we'd like but here's the problem is at a

5752
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:55,119
we'd like but here's the problem is at a
 

5753
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:56,709
we'd like but here's the problem is at a
very deep level

5754
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:56,719
very deep level
 

5755
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:58,790
very deep level
we don't understand really what's going

5756
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:58,800
we don't understand really what's going
 

5757
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,310
we don't understand really what's going
on in the brain we don't have a physical

5758
01:39:00,310 --> 01:39:00,320
on in the brain we don't have a physical
 

5759
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,950
on in the brain we don't have a physical
interpretation of the problem

5760
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:02,960
interpretation of the problem
 

5761
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,550
interpretation of the problem
we have all these symptoms

5762
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:04,560
we have all these symptoms
 

5763
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,669
we have all these symptoms
but we can't yet point to a set of cells

5764
01:39:07,669 --> 01:39:07,679
but we can't yet point to a set of cells
 

5765
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:09,990
but we can't yet point to a set of cells
or a set of circuits or an activity

why do you think you can't yet from an

5774
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:18,080
why do you think you can't yet from an
 

5775
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,390
why do you think you can't yet from an
optogenetics perspective is it because

5776
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:20,400
optogenetics perspective is it because
 

5777
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,629
optogenetics perspective is it because
there's so many possible causes is it so

5778
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:22,639
there's so many possible causes is it so
 

5779
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:24,709
there's so many possible causes is it so
much so many things involved

5780
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:24,719
much so many things involved
 

5781
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:26,470
much so many things involved
so i think the answer is there are many

5782
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,480
so i think the answer is there are many
 

5783
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,470
so i think the answer is there are many
things involved and all these different

5784
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:28,480
things involved and all these different
 

5785
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,470
things involved and all these different
symptoms that i've mentioned

01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,480
symptoms that i've mentioned
 

5787
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,790

01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:35,679
the individual symptoms and we can do
 

5791
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,669
the individual symptoms and we can do
this in animals to be clear so in a

uh what's the what's the unifying
 

5895
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,390
uh what's the what's the unifying
unifying i mean is there is there some

own way so basically
 

5905
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,350

i mean this is the human condition

5906

i mean this is the human condition
 

5907
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,990
i mean this is the human condition
and and it basically that might you know

01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,430
i don't think we need a first date
of the century it would be nice

5930
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:05,440
of the century it would be nice
 

5931
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,870
of the century it would be nice
it's also a good question if it's

5932
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:06,880
it's also a good question if it's
 

5933
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,910
it's also a good question if it's
possible yeah yeah well that that i i

5934
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:09,920
possible yeah yeah well that that i i
 

5935
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,390
possible yeah yeah well that that i i
have uh some thoughts on too but but to

have uh some thoughts on too but but to
 

5937
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:14,790
have uh some thoughts on too but but to
your to this specific question um i

01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:14,800
your to this specific question um i
 

5939
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,910
your to this specific question um i
don't think we need a theory of

don't think we need a theory of
 

5941
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:17,830
don't think we need a theory of
everything i think there will be

everything i think there will be

01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,590
everything i think there will be
unifying principles principles we can

5944
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:19,600
unifying principles principles we can
 

5945
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,310
unifying principles principles we can
get to but even shy of that if we can we

5946
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:22,320
get to but even shy of that if we can we
 

5947
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,550
get to but even shy of that if we can we
can treat symptoms and that's a big step

5948
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:24,560
can treat symptoms and that's a big step
 

5949
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,390
can treat symptoms and that's a big step
and as you say different different

and as you say different different
 

5951
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,070
and as you say different different
unhappy families are different different

01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:45,270
work that a particular medication
can treat anhedonia even if it doesn't

5968
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:45,280
can treat anhedonia even if it doesn't
 

5969
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,510
can treat anhedonia even if it doesn't
fix major depression in everybody if i

5970
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:47,520
fix major depression in everybody if i
 

5971
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,109
fix major depression in everybody if i
treat that one symptom in that one

5972

that's a good thing

5976

that's a good thing
 

5977
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:54,229
that's a good thing
and and so i we don't need

5978
01:42:54,229 --> 01:42:54,239
and and so i we don't need
 

5979
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,149
and and so i we don't need
the theory of everything and we don't

5980
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
the theory of everything and we don't
 

5981
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,629
the theory of everything and we don't
even need the unifying principle to help

5982
01:42:58,629 --> 01:42:58,639
even need the unifying principle to help
 

5983
01:42:58,639 --> 01:42:59,990
even need the unifying principle to help

motivation and you have to be motivated
 

6181
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:22,470
motivation and you have to be motivated
but if you are then you can identify

6182
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:22,480
but if you are then you can identify
 

6183
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,149
but if you are then you can identify
these triggers that send you down

6184
01:46:24,149 --> 01:46:24,159
these triggers that send you down
 

6185
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:25,830
these triggers that send you down
particular pathways and work to

6186
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:25,840
particular pathways and work to
 

6187
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:28,390
particular pathways and work to
intercept them and that is

6188
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:28,400
intercept them and that is
 

6189
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,189
intercept them and that is
amazingly very effective in mild to

6190
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:31,199
amazingly very effective in mild to
 

6191
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:34,070
amazingly very effective in mild to
moderate cases so you're basically

6192
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:34,080
moderate cases so you're basically
 

6193
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:36,550
moderate cases so you're basically
have to train yourself to see the world

6194
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:36,560
have to train yourself to see the world
 

6195
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,830
have to train yourself to see the world
as a

6196
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:37,840
as a
 

6197
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,189
as a
collection of triggers and you have to

6198
01:46:41,189 --> 01:46:41,199
collection of triggers and you have to
 

6199
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:44,709
collection of triggers and you have to
first understand like collect the data

6200
01:46:44,709 --> 01:46:44,719
first understand like collect the data
 

6201
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:48,629
first understand like collect the data
like basically see every experience

6202
01:46:48,629 --> 01:46:48,639
like basically see every experience
 

6203
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:51,990
like basically see every experience
as a thing that creates a follow-on

6204
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:52,000
as a thing that creates a follow-on
 

6205
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,550
as a thing that creates a follow-on
emotion of feeling

6206
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:54,560
emotion of feeling
 

6207
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:57,910
emotion of feeling
and like i've learned this

6208
01:46:57,910 --> 01:46:57,920
and like i've learned this
 

6209
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,390
and like i've learned this
you know like on social media

6210
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:00,400
you know like on social media
 

6211
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,790
you know like on social media
where like early on

6212
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:02,800
where like early on
 

6213
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:04,790
where like early on
you know like all of us

6214
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:04,800
you know like all of us
 

6215
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,229
you know like all of us
um you know i'll i'll say something i

6216
01:47:08,229 --> 01:47:08,239
um you know i'll i'll say something i
 

6217
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:10,870
um you know i'll i'll say something i
kind of respond to negativity

6218
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:10,880
kind of respond to negativity
 

6219
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,709
kind of respond to negativity
with negativity

6220
01:47:12,709 --> 01:47:12,719
with negativity
 

6221
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:14,550
with negativity
and then you observe

6222
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:14,560
and then you observe
 

6223
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,430
and then you observe
the results of that

6224
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:17,440
the results of that
 

6225
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,109
the results of that
over time

6226
01:47:19,109 --> 01:47:19,119
over time
 

6227
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:21,189
over time
you think wait a minute

6228
01:47:21,189 --> 01:47:21,199
you think wait a minute
 

6229
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:23,830
you think wait a minute
th this thing that i've been doing where

6230
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:23,840
th this thing that i've been doing where
 

6231
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,390
th this thing that i've been doing where
when somebody says you suck and you say

6232
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:26,400
when somebody says you suck and you say
 

6233
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:28,870
when somebody says you suck and you say
no you suck

6234
01:47:28,870 --> 01:47:28,880
no you suck
 

6235
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:31,350
no you suck
that never produces the result you

6236
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:31,360
that never produces the result you
 

6237
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:32,790
that never produces the result you
thought it might

6238
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:32,800
thought it might
 

6239
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,229
thought it might
and so might not want to just

6240
01:47:36,229 --> 01:47:36,239
and so might not want to just
 

6241
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:38,310
and so might not want to just
don't say you suck back

6242
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:38,320
don't say you suck back
 

6243
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,629
don't say you suck back
and i do this through a lot of things in

6244
01:47:40,629 --> 01:47:40,639
and i do this through a lot of things in
 

6245
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:41,669
and i do this through a lot of things in
life

6246
01:47:41,669 --> 01:47:41,679
life
 

6247
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:43,830
life
i'm very fortunate to

6248
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:43,840
i'm very fortunate to
 

6249
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,590
i'm very fortunate to
not suffer from

6250
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:45,600
not suffer from
 

6251
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:47,189
not suffer from
depression but

6252
01:47:47,189 --> 01:47:47,199
depression but
 

6253
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:48,550
depression but
i

6254
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:48,560
i
 

6255
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:51,350
i
first of all i have had and have people

6256
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:51,360
first of all i have had and have people
 

6257
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:52,950
first of all i have had and have people
in my life who do

6258
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:52,960
in my life who do
 

6259
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,669
in my life who do
and and also you know all of us

6260
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:55,679
and and also you know all of us
 

6261
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:57,910
and and also you know all of us
have depression who don't suffer from

6262
01:47:57,910 --> 01:47:57,920
have depression who don't suffer from
 

6263
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:00,629
have depression who don't suffer from
depression have depression out

6264
01:48:00,629 --> 01:48:00,639
depression have depression out
 

6265
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:03,030
depression have depression out
like uh it's always knocking on the door

6266
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:03,040
like uh it's always knocking on the door
 

6267
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:08,229
like uh it's always knocking on the door
right yeah and so you you have mild uh

6268
01:48:08,229 --> 01:48:08,239
right yeah and so you you have mild uh
 

6269
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,510
right yeah and so you you have mild uh
i mean uh

6270
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:09,520
i mean uh
 

6271
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,510
i mean uh
if you're very careless with the

6272
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:11,520
if you're very careless with the
 

6273
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,629
if you're very careless with the
triggers

6274
01:48:12,629 --> 01:48:12,639
triggers
 

6275
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:14,229
triggers
all around you

6276
01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:14,239
all around you
 

6277
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:16,950
all around you
then you you're just i think all of us

6278
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:16,960
then you you're just i think all of us
 

6279
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,350
then you you're just i think all of us
have the capacity to really suffer

6280
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:19,360
have the capacity to really suffer
 

6281
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,189
have the capacity to really suffer
uh from that kind of

6282
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:21,199
uh from that kind of
 

6283
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:23,669
uh from that kind of
uh chemical or psychological or

6284
01:48:23,669 --> 01:48:23,679
uh chemical or psychological or
 

6285
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:27,430
uh chemical or psychological or
philosophical existential crisis

6286
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:27,440
philosophical existential crisis
 

6287
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,350
philosophical existential crisis
but then it raises a question why are we

6288
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:29,360
but then it raises a question why are we
 

6289
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,030
but then it raises a question why are we
built this way it seems like it doesn't

6290
01:48:31,030 --> 01:48:31,040
built this way it seems like it doesn't
 

6291
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:33,510
built this way it seems like it doesn't
make sense right um and here's where

6292
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:33,520
make sense right um and here's where
 

6293
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,950
make sense right um and here's where
some of this thinking about where we

6294
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:34,960
some of this thinking about where we
 

6295
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,790
some of this thinking about where we
came from

6296
01:48:36,790 --> 01:48:36,800
came from
 

6297
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:37,750
came from
uh

6298
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:37,760
uh
 

6299
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:39,750
uh
as the human family is is kind of

6300
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:39,760
as the human family is is kind of
 

6301
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,270
as the human family is is kind of
interesting

6302
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:41,280
interesting
 

6303
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,350
interesting
does it make sense that somewhere on

6304
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:43,360
does it make sense that somewhere on
 

6305
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,430
does it make sense that somewhere on
that spectrum

6306
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:45,440
that spectrum
 

6307
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,669
that spectrum
that it's good to detect that there's an

6308
01:48:47,669 --> 01:48:47,679
that it's good to detect that there's an
 

6309
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:48,790
that it's good to detect that there's an
array of

6310
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:48,800
array of
 

6311
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,189
array of
adverse forces out there in the world

6312
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
adverse forces out there in the world
 

6313
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,430
adverse forces out there in the world
right now at this moment

6314
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:53,440
right now at this moment
 

6315
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,270
right now at this moment
and to withdraw

6316
01:48:55,270 --> 01:48:55,280
and to withdraw
 

6317
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:56,550
and to withdraw
to

6318
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
to
 

6319
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,149
to
to hunker down

6320
01:48:58,149 --> 01:48:58,159
to hunker down
 

6321
01:48:58,159 --> 01:49:00,950
to hunker down
to not fight not strive not try to meet

6322
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:00,960
to not fight not strive not try to meet
 

6323
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,390
to not fight not strive not try to meet
the challenge

6324
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:02,400
the challenge
 

6325
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,830
the challenge
and

6326
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:03,840
and
 

6327
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:04,790
and
outweigh

6328
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:04,800
outweigh
 

6329
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:05,669
outweigh
these

6330
01:49:05,669 --> 01:49:05,679
these
 

6331
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:07,350
these
negative forces that are present out

6332
01:49:07,350 --> 01:49:07,360
negative forces that are present out
 

6333
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,070
negative forces that are present out
there and that makes a lot of sense

6334
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:10,080
there and that makes a lot of sense
 

6335
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,189
there and that makes a lot of sense
uh

6336

that i mentioned earlier
c elegans with 302 neurons

you can give them a challenging
 

6357
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:31,350
you can give them a challenging
situation and they

6358
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:31,360
situation and they
 

6359
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,350
situation and they
will give up but then if you

6360
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:33,360
will give up but then if you
 

6361
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:35,830
will give up but then if you
stimulate a couple very specific brain

01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:35,840
stimulate a couple very specific brain

01:49:37,510 --> 01:49:37,520
regions in particular ways you can
 

6365
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,229
regions in particular ways you can
motivate them to overcome the challenge

6366
01:49:40,229 --> 01:49:40,239
motivate them to overcome the challenge
 

6367
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:41,990
motivate them to overcome the challenge
and if you inhibit those regions they

6368
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:42,000
and if you inhibit those regions they
 

6369
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,589
and if you inhibit those regions they
give up much more easily than they would

01:49:43,589 --> 01:49:43,599
give up much more easily than they would

the the psychoanalysis is is a little

the the psychoanalysis is is a little
 

6443
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:01,830
the the psychoanalysis is is a little
more niche now and partly because it's

01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:01,840
more niche now and partly because it's

behavioral therapy
 

6457
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,350

but it's still interesting as for

6458
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:15,360
but it's still interesting as for
 

6459
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,109
but it's still interesting as for
insight people a lot of people still do

6460
01:51:17,109 --> 01:51:17,119
insight people a lot of people still do
 

6461
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,589
insight people a lot of people still do
it to gain insight into themselves

6462
01:51:19,589 --> 01:51:19,599
it to gain insight into themselves
 

6463
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:21,910
it to gain insight into themselves
and in general it's a good uh sort of

6464
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:21,920
and in general it's a good uh sort of
 

6465
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,990
and in general it's a good uh sort of
conversation starter those methods you

6466
01:51:23,990 --> 01:51:24,000
conversation starter those methods you
 

6467
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:25,830
conversation starter those methods you
know they're good for

6468
01:51:25,830 --> 01:51:25,840
know they're good for
 

6469
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:27,430
know they're good for
getting things out you know

6470
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:27,440
getting things out you know
 

6471
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,750
getting things out you know
we don't focus on dreams uh typically

6472
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:29,760
we don't focus on dreams uh typically
 

6473
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:31,109
we don't focus on dreams uh typically
these days in psychiatry but they're

6474
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:31,119
these days in psychiatry but they're
 

6475
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:32,550
these days in psychiatry but they're
great conversation starters they're

6476
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:32,560
great conversation starters they're
 

6477
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,870
great conversation starters they're
great ways to get things out if people

6478
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:34,880
great ways to get things out if people
 

6479
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,070
great ways to get things out if people
have

6480
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:36,080
have
 

6481
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:38,950
have
uh and so we like to use those methods

6482
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:38,960
uh and so we like to use those methods
 

6483
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:40,950
uh and so we like to use those methods
just to get the ball rolling sometimes

6484
01:51:40,950 --> 01:51:40,960
just to get the ball rolling sometimes
 

6485
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:42,870
just to get the ball rolling sometimes
get people to open up a little bit but

6486
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:42,880
get people to open up a little bit but
 

6487
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,390
get people to open up a little bit but
the actual treatment

6488
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:44,400
the actual treatment
 

6489
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,550
the actual treatment
that tends not to involve these

6490
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:46,560
that tends not to involve these
 

6491
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,109
that tends not to involve these
psychoanalytic approaches where you

6492
01:51:49,109 --> 01:51:49,119
psychoanalytic approaches where you
 

6493
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:51,830
psychoanalytic approaches where you
are really probing uh the unconscious

6494
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:51,840
are really probing uh the unconscious
 

6495
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,910
are really probing uh the unconscious

it's
in its fullest form

6600
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:38,560
in its fullest form
 

6601
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,910
in its fullest form
it's very different from these more

6602
01:53:39,910 --> 01:53:39,920

01:53:45,589 --> 01:53:45,599
them and so you'll see
 

6609
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:47,109
them and so you'll see
almost like randomized controlled

6610
01:53:47,109 --> 01:53:47,119
almost like randomized controlled
 

6611
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:49,430

and they both can work and actually in
 

6619
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:58,470
and they both can work and actually in
some studies they look uh comparable

01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:30,229
the the best thing for the therapist to
do in that case is to recognize it

6834
01:57:30,229 --> 01:57:30,239
do in that case is to recognize it

01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:31,990
do in that case is to recognize it
and to realize

6836
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:32,000
and to realize
 

6837
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,910
and to realize
that's probably being stirred by other

6838
01:57:33,910 --> 01:57:33,920
that's probably being stirred by other
 

6839
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,990

people in the patient's life and that

6840
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:36,000
people in the patient's life and that
 

6841
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,070
people in the patient's life and that
could be the source of a lot of problems

6842
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,080

7711
02:12:33,119 --> 02:12:34,950
mention anything but
sexual fantasies and then there's i know

7712
02:12:34,950 --> 02:12:34,960
sexual fantasies and then there's i know
 

7713
02:12:34,960 --> 02:12:35,830
sexual fantasies and then there's i know
there's people that have sexual

7714
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:35,840
there's people that have sexual
 

7715
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:36,790
there's people that have sexual
fantasies and they don't want to

7716
02:12:36,790 --> 02:12:36,800
fantasies and they don't want to
 

7717
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,870
fantasies and they don't want to
actually do that in real life that that

7718
02:12:38,870 --> 02:12:38,880
actually do that in real life that that
 

7719
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:40,870
actually do that in real life that that
that sexual fantasy serves some kind of

7720
02:12:40,870 --> 02:12:40,880
that sexual fantasy serves some kind of
 

7721
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:43,669
that sexual fantasy serves some kind of
purpose in imagination only and in that

7722
02:12:43,669 --> 02:12:43,679
purpose in imagination only and in that
 

7723
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:45,750
purpose in imagination only and in that
same way suicide might serve a purpose

7724
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:45,760
same way suicide might serve a purpose
 

7725
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:47,669
same way suicide might serve a purpose
and imagination only is very unlikely to

7726
02:12:47,669 --> 02:12:47,679
and imagination only is very unlikely to
 

7727
02:12:47,679 --> 02:12:50,149
and imagination only is very unlikely to
lead to action and yet there's other

7728
02:12:50,149 --> 02:12:50,159
lead to action and yet there's other
 

7729
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:52,390
lead to action and yet there's other
thoughts that maybe are more amorphous

7730
02:12:52,390 --> 02:12:52,400
thoughts that maybe are more amorphous
 

7731
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:55,510
thoughts that maybe are more amorphous
that do lead to action and that leap

7732
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:55,520
that do lead to action and that leap
 

7733
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:58,390
that do lead to action and that leap
uh yeah that oh boy that's a facet and

7734
02:12:58,390 --> 02:12:58,400
uh yeah that oh boy that's a facet and
 

7735
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:01,109
uh yeah that oh boy that's a facet and
that's such a philosophically powerful

7736
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
that's such a philosophically powerful
 

7737
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:03,990
that's such a philosophically powerful
thought to not exist right like that

7738
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:04,000
thought to not exist right like that
 

7739
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,390
thought to not exist right like that
question uh that's this uh is it sarcher

7740
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:06,400
question uh that's this uh is it sarcher
 

7741

question yeah right
so

7750
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:18,960
so
 

7751
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,870
so
that's a great question actually and

7752
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:20,880
that's a great question actually and
 

7753
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:23,030
that's a great question actually and
there are other related questions some

7754
02:13:23,030 --> 02:13:23,040
there are other related questions some
 

7755
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:24,629
there are other related questions some
people

7756
02:13:24,629 --> 02:13:24,639
people
 

7757
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:29,510
people
may have the thought of suicide

7758
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:29,520

 

7759
02:13:29,520 --> 02:13:30,470

because

7760
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:30,480
because
 

7761
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:32,470
because
there seems no point there's no joy in

7762
02:13:32,470 --> 02:13:32,480
there seems no point there's no joy in
 

7763
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:35,109
there seems no point there's no joy in
life that's one reason that some people

7764
02:13:35,109 --> 02:13:35,119
life that's one reason that some people
 

7765
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:36,629
life that's one reason that some people
can put forward

7766
02:13:36,629 --> 02:13:36,639
can put forward
 

7767
02:13:36,639 --> 02:13:38,149
can put forward
sometimes there's an it's not just the

7768
02:13:38,149 --> 02:13:38,159
sometimes there's an it's not just the
 

7769
02:13:38,159 --> 02:13:41,350
sometimes there's an it's not just the
absence of of joy there's an active pain

7770
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:41,360
absence of of joy there's an active pain
 

7771
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:43,910
absence of of joy there's an active pain
an active psychic pain in some people

7772
02:13:43,910 --> 02:13:43,920
an active psychic pain in some people
 

7773
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:47,350
an active psychic pain in some people
and that the inescapability of that

7774
02:13:47,350 --> 02:13:47,360
and that the inescapability of that
 

7775
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:49,030
and that the inescapability of that
is enough to drive the thoughts of

7776
02:13:49,030 --> 02:13:49,040
is enough to drive the thoughts of
 

7777
02:13:49,040 --> 02:13:50,390
is enough to drive the thoughts of
suicide

7778
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:50,400
suicide
 

7779
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:52,390
suicide
and then there are interpersonal and

7780
02:13:52,390 --> 02:13:52,400
and then there are interpersonal and
 

7781
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,229
and then there are interpersonal and
cultural reasons as well that can show

7782
02:13:54,229 --> 02:13:54,239
cultural reasons as well that can show
 

7783
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:55,510
cultural reasons as well that can show
up

7784
02:13:55,510 --> 02:13:55,520
up
 

7785
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:58,229
up
the but the act this act of ending of

7786
02:13:58,229 --> 02:13:58,239
the but the act this act of ending of
 

7787
02:13:58,239 --> 02:13:59,910
the but the act this act of ending of
the self is

7788
02:13:59,910 --> 02:13:59,920
the self is
 

7789
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:01,669
the self is
in all these cases there's no real way

7790
02:14:01,669 --> 02:14:01,679
in all these cases there's no real way
 

7791
02:14:01,679 --> 02:14:04,310
in all these cases there's no real way
to study this in animals no other animal

7792
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:04,320
to study this in animals no other animal
 

7793
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:07,030
to study this in animals no other animal
as far as we know that we can study

7794
02:14:07,030 --> 02:14:07,040
as far as we know that we can study
 

7795
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:10,629
as far as we know that we can study
has this concept of this is myself

7796
02:14:10,629 --> 02:14:10,639
has this concept of this is myself
 

7797
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:12,470
has this concept of this is myself
the situation is not

7798
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:12,480
the situation is not
 

7799
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:15,189
the situation is not
tolerable therefore i will end the self

7800
02:14:15,189 --> 02:14:15,199
tolerable therefore i will end the self
 

7801
02:14:15,199 --> 02:14:16,629
tolerable therefore i will end the self
to our knowledge this is not something

7802
02:14:16,629 --> 02:14:16,639
to our knowledge this is not something
 

7803
02:14:16,639 --> 02:14:18,310
to our knowledge this is not something
that that can be studied in other

7804
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:18,320
that that can be studied in other
 

7805
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:22,629
that that can be studied in other
animals so it remains this this uh

7806
02:14:22,629 --> 02:14:22,639
animals so it remains this this uh
 

7807
02:14:22,639 --> 02:14:27,189
animals so it remains this this uh
uh very poorly understood action and

7808
02:14:27,189 --> 02:14:27,199
uh very poorly understood action and
 

7809
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:29,030
uh very poorly understood action and
in predicting it so what do we do with

7810
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:29,040
in predicting it so what do we do with
 

7811
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,550
in predicting it so what do we do with
psychiatrists we have this challenge

7812
02:14:30,550 --> 02:14:30,560
psychiatrists we have this challenge
 

7813
02:14:30,560 --> 02:14:32,550
psychiatrists we have this challenge
people come to the emergency room

7814
02:14:32,550 --> 02:14:32,560
people come to the emergency room
 

7815
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:34,069
people come to the emergency room

02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:42,629
that that didn't lead to death what do
we do well there's a whole range of

we do well there's a whole range of
 

7825
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:44,870
we do well there's a whole range of
options you know was it a suicidal

death
 

7831
02:14:48,159 --> 02:14:49,669

or was it

and if it was the intent was was death

and if it was the intent was was death
 

7839
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:54,870

what were the reasons are the reasons

what's the probability that it'll be

02:14:58,709 --> 02:14:58,719
what's the probability that it'll be

so we do all these things just to decide
 

7849

so we do all these things just to decide
what sort of treatment should be carried

and so you could imagine strategies to
 

7959
02:17:02,639 --> 02:17:04,549
and so you could imagine strategies to

to go
 

7975
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:20,309
to go
after that question so i think there is

02:17:20,309 --> 02:17:20,319
after that question so i think there is
 

7977
02:17:20,319 --> 02:17:22,309
after that question so i think there is

02:18:56,629 --> 02:18:56,639
it's it's it's a much harder situation

haven't done
uh i haven't you know

8140
02:20:08,630 --> 02:20:08,640
uh i haven't you know
 

8141
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:10,790
uh i haven't you know
made the most of the opportunities that

8142
02:20:10,790 --> 02:20:10,800
made the most of the opportunities that
 

8143
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:12,070
made the most of the opportunities that
are available

8144
02:20:12,070 --> 02:20:12,080
are available
 

8145
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:14,630
are available
still early i haven't you know

8146
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:14,640
still early i haven't you know
 

8147
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:16,550
still early i haven't you know
you know progressed as far as i should

8148
02:20:16,550 --> 02:20:16,560
you know progressed as far as i should
 

8149
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:18,870
you know progressed as far as i should
and exactly as you're saying

8150
02:20:18,870 --> 02:20:18,880
and exactly as you're saying
 

8151
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:20,710
and exactly as you're saying
that works for a while

8152
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:20,720
that works for a while
 

8153
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:22,630
that works for a while
but then what happens as as you get

8154
02:20:22,630 --> 02:20:22,640
but then what happens as as you get
 

8155
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:25,030
but then what happens as as you get
later in life and there's less

8156
02:20:25,030 --> 02:20:25,040
later in life and there's less
 

8157
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:26,389
later in life and there's less
runway

8158
02:20:26,389 --> 02:20:26,399
runway
 

8159
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:27,590
runway
to

8160
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:27,600
to
 

8161
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:29,750
to
you know fix that and then maybe maybe

8162
02:20:29,750 --> 02:20:29,760
you know fix that and then maybe maybe
 

8163
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:32,070
you know fix that and then maybe maybe
then maybe then that negative voice is

8164
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:32,080
then maybe then that negative voice is
 

8165
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:34,150
then maybe then that negative voice is
is a problem but also at that point the

8166
02:20:34,150 --> 02:20:34,160
is a problem but also at that point the
 

8167
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:35,590
is a problem but also at that point the
negative voice starts having more and

8168
02:20:35,590 --> 02:20:35,600
negative voice starts having more and
 

8169
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:37,590
negative voice starts having more and
more of a point that's when when you're

8170
02:20:37,590 --> 02:20:37,600
more of a point that's when when you're
 

8171
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:39,750
more of a point that's when when you're
being when you're being very successful

8172
02:20:39,750 --> 02:20:39,760
being when you're being very successful
 

8173
02:20:39,760 --> 02:20:43,510
being when you're being very successful
it's easy to be like no okay well

8174
02:20:43,510 --> 02:20:43,520
it's easy to be like no okay well
 

8175
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:45,670
it's easy to be like no okay well
like later in life you're really

8176
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:45,680
like later in life you're really
 

8177
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:47,750
like later in life you're really
literally just sitting there on a

8178
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:47,760
literally just sitting there on a
 

8179
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:49,670
literally just sitting there on a
on a rocking chair doing nothing and

8180
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:49,680
on a rocking chair doing nothing and
 

8181
02:20:49,680 --> 02:20:50,469
on a rocking chair doing nothing and
then

8182
02:20:50,469 --> 02:20:50,479
then
 

8183
02:20:50,479 --> 02:20:51,349
then
it's

8184
02:20:51,349 --> 02:20:51,359
it's
 

8185
02:20:51,359 --> 02:20:53,510
it's
or maybe any kind of tragedy happens

8186
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:53,520
or maybe any kind of tragedy happens
 

8187
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:55,190
or maybe any kind of tragedy happens
loss of a loved one

8188

02:20:59,830 --> 02:20:59,840
kind of
 

8195
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:02,469
kind of
um some kind of way i don't know those

8196
02:21:02,469 --> 02:21:02,479
um some kind of way i don't know those
 

8197
02:21:02,479 --> 02:21:04,150
um some kind of way i don't know those
and then also in the negative voice is

8198
02:21:04,150 --> 02:21:04,160
and then also in the negative voice is
 

8199
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:06,469
and then also in the negative voice is
just you and the negative voice for

8200
02:21:06,469 --> 02:21:06,479
just you and the negative voice for
 

8201
02:21:06,479 --> 02:21:08,309
just you and the negative voice for
days and days and days and so i don't

8202
02:21:08,309 --> 02:21:08,319
days and days and days and so i don't
 

8203
02:21:08,319 --> 02:21:09,270
days and days and days and so i don't
know

02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:46,389
his brain was falling apart yeah louis
body dementia this is a very interesting

8234
02:21:46,389 --> 02:21:46,399
body dementia this is a very interesting
 

8235
02:21:46,399 --> 02:21:48,630
body dementia this is a very interesting
neurological disorder where

8236
02:21:48,630 --> 02:21:48,640
neurological disorder where
 

8237
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:50,469
neurological disorder where
among other things there are there's

8238
02:21:50,469 --> 02:21:50,479
among other things there are there's
 

8239
02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:53,750
among other things there are there's
neuron death indeed so you've got frank

8240
02:21:53,750 --> 02:21:53,760
neuron death indeed so you've got frank
 

8241
02:21:53,760 --> 02:21:55,990
neuron death indeed so you've got frank
neuron loss it's not just a matter of

8242
02:21:55,990 --> 02:21:56,000
neuron loss it's not just a matter of
 

8243
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,510
neuron loss it's not just a matter of
some long-standing

8244
02:21:57,510 --> 02:21:57,520
some long-standing
 

8245
02:21:57,520 --> 02:21:58,630
some long-standing
psychic pain but you've got a

8246
02:21:58,630 --> 02:21:58,640
psychic pain but you've got a
 

8247
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:00,230
psychic pain but you've got a
progressive

8248
02:22:00,230 --> 02:22:00,240
progressive
 

8249
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:02,389
progressive
loss and so clearly you've got a

8250
02:22:02,389 --> 02:22:02,399
loss and so clearly you've got a
 

8251
02:22:02,399 --> 02:22:03,670
loss and so clearly you've got a
situation where he could have finally

8252
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:03,680
situation where he could have finally
 

8253
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:05,510
situation where he could have finally
reached a point where

8254
02:22:05,510 --> 02:22:05,520
reached a point where
 

8255
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:07,830
reached a point where
the balance that he'd worked out between

8256
02:22:07,830 --> 02:22:07,840
the balance that he'd worked out between
 

8257
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:10,950
the balance that he'd worked out between
negativity and positivity uh

8258
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:10,960
negativity and positivity uh
 

8259
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:12,710
negativity and positivity uh
was disrupted due to loss the wrong

8260
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:12,720
was disrupted due to loss the wrong
 

8261
02:22:12,720 --> 02:22:14,389
was disrupted due to loss the wrong
cells died the wrong projections were

8262
02:22:14,389 --> 02:22:14,399
cells died the wrong projections were
 

8263
02:22:14,399 --> 02:22:17,190
cells died the wrong projections were
cut by the lewy body dementia certainly

8264
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:17,200
cut by the lewy body dementia certainly
 

8265
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:19,030
cut by the lewy body dementia certainly
dopamine neurons die in lewy body

8266
02:22:19,030 --> 02:22:19,040
dopamine neurons die in lewy body
 

8267
02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:20,790
dopamine neurons die in lewy body
dementia those are neurons that give

8268
02:22:20,790 --> 02:22:20,800
dementia those are neurons that give
 

8269
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:22,389
dementia those are neurons that give
rise to

8270
02:22:22,389 --> 02:22:22,399
rise to
 

8271
02:22:22,399 --> 02:22:23,990
rise to
much of the feelings of reward and

8272
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:24,000
much of the feelings of reward and
 

8273
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,150
much of the feelings of reward and
pleasure that we experience among other

8274
02:22:26,150 --> 02:22:26,160
pleasure that we experience among other
 

8275
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:27,270
pleasure that we experience among other
roles

8276
02:22:27,270 --> 02:22:27,280
roles
 

8277
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:28,070
roles
so

8278
02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:28,080
so
 

8279
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:30,389
so
uh clearly in his case there could have

8280
02:22:30,389 --> 02:22:30,399
uh clearly in his case there could have
 

8281
02:22:30,399 --> 02:22:31,670
uh clearly in his case there could have
been a very

8282
02:22:31,670 --> 02:22:31,680
been a very
 

8283
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:34,230
been a very
concrete cellular neurological issue

8284
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:34,240
concrete cellular neurological issue
 

8285
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:36,150
concrete cellular neurological issue
that was progressive and pushed him to

8286
02:22:36,150 --> 02:22:36,160
that was progressive and pushed him to
 

8287
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:37,590
that was progressive and pushed him to
that point

8288
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:37,600
that point
 

8289
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,750
that point
but what were you uh

8290
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:39,760
but what were you uh
 

8291
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:41,110
but what were you uh
were you about to make a point about

8292
02:22:41,110 --> 02:22:41,120
were you about to make a point about
 

8293
02:22:41,120 --> 02:22:43,110
were you about to make a point about
broader that if there isn't another

8294
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:43,120
broader that if there isn't another
 

8295
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:45,510
broader that if there isn't another
neurological degeneration yeah so in his

8296
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:45,520
neurological degeneration yeah so in his
 

8297
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:48,230
neurological degeneration yeah so in his
case not knowing that uh

8298
02:22:48,230 --> 02:22:48,240
case not knowing that uh
 

8299
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:49,910
case not knowing that uh
it could have been simply that let's say

8300
02:22:49,910 --> 02:22:49,920
it could have been simply that let's say
 

8301
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:51,030
it could have been simply that let's say
he had

8302
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:51,040
he had
 

8303
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:53,030
he had
an internal psychic pain state and it

8304
02:22:53,030 --> 02:22:53,040
an internal psychic pain state and it
 

8305
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:54,309
an internal psychic pain state and it
was in

8306
02:22:54,309 --> 02:22:54,319
was in
 

8307
02:22:54,319 --> 02:22:56,630
was in
he was in sort of a compensated mode for

8308
02:22:56,630 --> 02:22:56,640
he was in sort of a compensated mode for
 

8309
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:58,309
he was in sort of a compensated mode for
much of his life able to generate enough

8310
02:22:58,309 --> 02:22:58,319
much of his life able to generate enough
 

8311
02:22:58,319 --> 02:23:00,150
much of his life able to generate enough
joy from his his comedy and his social

8312
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:00,160
joy from his his comedy and his social
 

8313
02:23:00,160 --> 02:23:01,990
joy from his his comedy and his social
interactions and

8314
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:02,000
interactions and
 

8315
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,830
interactions and
and then but eventually later in life

8316
02:23:03,830 --> 02:23:03,840
and then but eventually later in life
 

8317
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:04,870
and then but eventually later in life
you know the

8318
02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:04,880
you know the
 

8319
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:07,429
you know the
the those things drop away the balance

8320
02:23:07,429 --> 02:23:07,439
the those things drop away the balance
 

8321
02:23:07,439 --> 02:23:09,670
the those things drop away the balance
shifts you get tired of fighting the

8322
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:09,680
shifts you get tired of fighting the
 

8323
02:23:09,680 --> 02:23:11,429
shifts you get tired of fighting the
pain for that long and then so you've

8324
02:23:11,429 --> 02:23:11,439
pain for that long and then so you've
 

8325
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:13,110
pain for that long and then so you've
got this time dependent

8326
02:23:13,110 --> 02:23:13,120
got this time dependent
 

8327
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:15,830
got this time dependent
non-stationarity that happens and then

8328
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:15,840
non-stationarity that happens and then
 

8329
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:17,270
non-stationarity that happens and then
the same

8330
02:23:17,270 --> 02:23:17,280
the same
 

8331
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:19,510
the same
symptom becomes no longer tolerable in

8332
02:23:19,510 --> 02:23:19,520
symptom becomes no longer tolerable in
 

8333
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:21,110
symptom becomes no longer tolerable in
the end

8334
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:21,120

human beings exist on a spectrum of uh

how social we can be
 

8343
02:23:30,800 --> 02:23:33,270
how social we can be
and this is pretty interesting actually

and this is pretty interesting actually
 

8345
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:35,590

it's a it's a spectrum some have

it's a it's a spectrum some have
 

8377
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:10,710
it's a it's a spectrum some have
mild to moderate difficulties they

8378
02:24:10,710 --> 02:24:10,720
mild to moderate difficulties they
 

8379
02:24:10,720 --> 02:24:13,750
mild to moderate difficulties they
may have inability to understand what

8380
02:24:13,750 --> 02:24:13,760
may have inability to understand what
 

8381
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:15,190
may have inability to understand what
the next thing to do in a social

8382
02:24:15,190 --> 02:24:15,200
the next thing to do in a social
 

8383
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:17,190
the next thing to do in a social
situation is but may have

8384
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:17,200
situation is but may have
 

8385
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,670
situation is but may have
perfectly good language abilities

8386
02:24:19,670 --> 02:24:19,680
perfectly good language abilities
 

8387
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,110
perfectly good language abilities
and as you progress further along the

8388
02:24:21,110 --> 02:24:21,120
and as you progress further along the
 

8389
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:23,110
and as you progress further along the
spectrum that gets more and more severe

8390
02:24:23,110 --> 02:24:23,120
spectrum that gets more and more severe
 

8391
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:24,469
spectrum that gets more and more severe
so they

8392
02:24:24,469 --> 02:24:24,479
so they
 

8393
02:24:24,479 --> 02:24:27,030
so they
can't make eye contact because it's too

8394
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:27,040
can't make eye contact because it's too
 

8395
02:24:27,040 --> 02:24:28,950
can't make eye contact because it's too
overwhelming to think about what has to

8396
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:28,960
overwhelming to think about what has to
 

8397
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:30,550
overwhelming to think about what has to
be done next if a person looks in a

8398
02:24:30,550 --> 02:24:30,560
be done next if a person looks in a
 

8399
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:32,150
be done next if a person looks in a
particular way yeah

8400
02:24:32,150 --> 02:24:32,160
particular way yeah
 

8401
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:34,070
particular way yeah
and then as you go farther then

8402
02:24:34,070 --> 02:24:34,080
and then as you go farther then
 

8403
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:35,270
and then as you go farther then
language

8404
02:24:35,270 --> 02:24:35,280
language
 

8405
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:37,270
language
and social communication themselves

8406
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:37,280
and social communication themselves
 

8407
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:39,030
and social communication themselves
break down so there's no

8408
02:24:39,030 --> 02:24:39,040
break down so there's no
 

8409
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:41,830
break down so there's no
reciprocity there's no shared enjoyment

8410
02:24:41,830 --> 02:24:41,840
reciprocity there's no shared enjoyment
 

8411
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:43,670
reciprocity there's no shared enjoyment
and that this gets very hard then as you

8412
02:24:43,670 --> 02:24:43,680
and that this gets very hard then as you
 

8413
02:24:43,680 --> 02:24:45,190
and that this gets very hard then as you
get to this far end of the spectrum

8414
02:24:45,190 --> 02:24:45,200
get to this far end of the spectrum
 

8415
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:46,469
get to this far end of the spectrum
where there's

8416
02:24:46,469 --> 02:24:46,479
where there's
 

8417
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:49,030
where there's
really an absence of social cognition at

8418
02:24:49,030 --> 02:24:49,040
really an absence of social cognition at
 

8419
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:52,710
really an absence of social cognition at
all uh and and social bonding

8420
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:52,720
all uh and and social bonding
 

8421
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:55,429
all uh and and social bonding
so why why does this exist what is it uh

8422
02:24:55,429 --> 02:24:55,439
so why why does this exist what is it uh
 

8423
02:24:55,439 --> 02:24:57,510
so why why does this exist what is it uh
it's very genetic as i mentioned it's

8424
02:24:57,510 --> 02:24:57,520
it's very genetic as i mentioned it's
 

8425
02:24:57,520 --> 02:24:59,590
it's very genetic as i mentioned it's
it's one of the you know top three or

8426
02:24:59,590 --> 02:24:59,600
it's one of the you know top three or
 

8427
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:01,670
it's one of the you know top three or
four most biological in the sense of

8428
02:25:01,670 --> 02:25:01,680
four most biological in the sense of
 

8429
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:03,910
four most biological in the sense of
most genetically determined of the

8430
02:25:03,910 --> 02:25:03,920
most genetically determined of the
 

8431
02:25:03,920 --> 02:25:06,070
most genetically determined of the
psychiatric illnesses it does have these

8432
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,080
psychiatric illnesses it does have these
 

8433
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:08,150
psychiatric illnesses it does have these
interesting positive correlations slight

8434
02:25:08,150 --> 02:25:08,160
interesting positive correlations slight
 

8435
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:09,830
interesting positive correlations slight
positive correlations with

8436
02:25:09,830 --> 02:25:09,840
positive correlations with
 

8437
02:25:09,840 --> 02:25:13,429
positive correlations with
intelligence and education

8438
02:25:13,429 --> 02:25:13,439

 

8439
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:14,790

and

8440
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:14,800
and
 

8441
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:16,710
and
the reason for that is kind of

8442
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:16,720
the reason for that is kind of
 

8443
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:18,150
the reason for that is kind of
interesting to think about

8444
02:25:18,150 --> 02:25:18,160
interesting to think about
 

8445
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:19,590
interesting to think about
is there something good about it just

8446
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:19,600
is there something good about it just
 

8447
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:20,389
is there something good about it just
like

8448
02:25:20,389 --> 02:25:20,399
like
 

8449
02:25:20,399 --> 02:25:21,110
like
or

8450
02:25:21,110 --> 02:25:21,120
or
 

8451
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:22,469
or
at least with at least part of the

8452
02:25:22,469 --> 02:25:22,479
at least with at least part of the
 

8453
02:25:22,479 --> 02:25:23,750
at least with at least part of the
spectrum is there's something good about

8454
02:25:23,750 --> 02:25:23,760
spectrum is there's something good about
 

8455
02:25:23,760 --> 02:25:24,870
spectrum is there's something good about
it just as we were talking about for

8456
02:25:24,870 --> 02:25:24,880
it just as we were talking about for
 

8457
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:26,070
it just as we were talking about for
depression

8458
02:25:26,070 --> 02:25:26,080
depression
 

8459
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:27,670
depression
as you could say for mania as you could

8460
02:25:27,670 --> 02:25:27,680
as you could say for mania as you could
 

8461
02:25:27,680 --> 02:25:30,309
as you could say for mania as you could
say for schizophrenia

8462
02:25:30,309 --> 02:25:30,319
say for schizophrenia
 

8463
02:25:30,319 --> 02:25:31,990
say for schizophrenia
and

8464
02:25:31,990 --> 02:25:32,000

02:25:34,160 --> 02:25:35,670
here it's kind of interesting to think

that's right dynamic information but you

02:28:29,190 --> 02:28:29,200
that's right dynamic information but you
 

8639
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:30,790
that's right dynamic information but you
critically your use of the word often

there is really i think smart because

8642
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:33,120
there is really i think smart because

it's not just social interaction that is
 

8645
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:37,990
it's not just social interaction that is
a challenge in autism and so many people

8646
02:28:37,990 --> 02:28:38,000
a challenge in autism and so many people
 

8647
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,750
a challenge in autism and so many people
conceptualize it purely as a social

8648
02:28:41,750 --> 02:28:41,760
conceptualize it purely as a social
 

8649

conceptualize it purely as a social

8653
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,950
disorder
but it's really any unpredictable

8654
02:28:46,950 --> 02:28:46,960
but it's really any unpredictable
 

8655
02:28:46,960 --> 02:28:48,950
but it's really any unpredictable
information that's a problem that's a

8656
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:48,960
information that's a problem that's a
 

8657
02:28:48,960 --> 02:28:50,790
information that's a problem that's a
challenge for for people on the spectrum

8658
02:28:50,790 --> 02:28:50,800
challenge for for people on the spectrum
 

8659
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:53,670
challenge for for people on the spectrum
they react very

8660
02:28:53,670 --> 02:28:53,680
they react very
 

8661
02:28:53,680 --> 02:28:56,469
they react very
negatively to unexpected sounds even if

8662
02:28:56,469 --> 02:28:56,479
negatively to unexpected sounds even if
 

8663
02:28:56,479 --> 02:28:59,110
negatively to unexpected sounds even if
not social sounds unexpected lights

8664
02:28:59,110 --> 02:28:59,120
not social sounds unexpected lights
 

8665
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:01,110
not social sounds unexpected lights
unexpected touches

8666
02:29:01,110 --> 02:29:01,120
unexpected touches
 

8667
02:29:01,120 --> 02:29:02,710
unexpected touches
and so it's really unpredictable

8668
02:29:02,710 --> 02:29:02,720
and so it's really unpredictable
 

8669
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:05,110
and so it's really unpredictable
information that is uh in my view the

8670
02:29:05,110 --> 02:29:05,120
information that is uh in my view the
 

8671
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:07,510
information that is uh in my view the
core problem with with the processing

8672
02:29:07,510 --> 02:29:07,520
core problem with with the processing
 

8673
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:09,590
core problem with with the processing
and autism not just social social just

8674
02:29:09,590 --> 02:29:09,600
and autism not just social social just
 

8675
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:11,429
and autism not just social social just
shows up because it's so unpredictable

8676
02:29:11,429 --> 02:29:11,439
shows up because it's so unpredictable
 

8677
02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:14,070
shows up because it's so unpredictable
yeah it's so interesting i mean um

8678

02:31:19,910 --> 02:31:19,920
i mean you've articulated what uh
 

8791
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,790
i mean you've articulated what uh
you know

8792
02:31:20,790 --> 02:31:20,800
you know
 

8793
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:22,630
you know
captures it for for so many people which

8794
02:31:22,630 --> 02:31:22,640
captures it for for so many people which
 

8795
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:24,309
captures it for for so many people which
is that it's overwhelming there's just

8796
02:31:24,309 --> 02:31:24,319
is that it's overwhelming there's just
 

8797
02:31:24,319 --> 02:31:25,910
is that it's overwhelming there's just
just too much information just coming in

8798
02:31:25,910 --> 02:31:25,920
just too much information just coming in
 

8799
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:27,590
just too much information just coming in
through the eyes

8800
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:27,600
through the eyes
 

8801
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,670
through the eyes
and

8802
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:29,680
and
 

8803
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,510
and
to keep up with it to know

8804
02:31:31,510 --> 02:31:31,520
to keep up with it to know
 

8805
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:32,870
to keep up with it to know
you're going to be expected to keep up

8806
02:31:32,870 --> 02:31:32,880
you're going to be expected to keep up
 

8807
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:34,309
you're going to be expected to keep up
with it first of all so there's that

8808
02:31:34,309 --> 02:31:34,319
with it first of all so there's that
 

8809
02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:36,550
with it first of all so there's that
that aspect you know you learned

8810
02:31:36,550 --> 02:31:36,560
that aspect you know you learned
 

8811
02:31:36,560 --> 02:31:38,150
that aspect you know you learned
socially that there's going to be an

8812
02:31:38,150 --> 02:31:38,160
socially that there's going to be an
 

8813
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:40,550
socially that there's going to be an
expectation if you're making eye contact

8814
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:40,560
expectation if you're making eye contact
 

8815
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:41,910
expectation if you're making eye contact
people are going to think you're keeping

8816
02:31:41,910 --> 02:31:41,920
people are going to think you're keeping
 

8817
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:43,830
people are going to think you're keeping
up with it and

8818
02:31:43,830 --> 02:31:43,840
up with it and
 

8819
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:45,190
up with it and
you don't want to because you want to

8820
02:31:45,190 --> 02:31:45,200
you don't want to because you want to
 

8821
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:47,190
you don't want to because you want to
focus on other things and make progress

8822
02:31:47,190 --> 02:31:47,200
focus on other things and make progress
 

8823
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:48,070
focus on other things and make progress
in other

8824
02:31:48,070 --> 02:31:48,080
in other
 

8825
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:50,150
in other
you know dimensions

8826
02:31:50,150 --> 02:31:50,160
you know dimensions
 

8827
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:51,750
you know dimensions
yeah and so that then there's a strong

8828
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:51,760
yeah and so that then there's a strong
 

8829
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:53,510
yeah and so that then there's a strong
desire to look away or to close the eyes

8830
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:53,520
desire to look away or to close the eyes
 

8831
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:55,190
desire to look away or to close the eyes
because

8832
02:31:55,190 --> 02:31:55,200
because
 

8833
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,030
because
it's it's it's it's overwhelming it's a

8834
02:31:57,030 --> 02:31:57,040
it's it's it's it's overwhelming it's a
 

8835
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:58,790
it's it's it's it's overwhelming it's a
distraction and it's going to cause

8836
02:31:58,790 --> 02:31:58,800
distraction and it's going to cause
 

8837
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:00,630
distraction and it's going to cause
errors of of understanding and of course

8838
02:32:00,630 --> 02:32:00,640
errors of of understanding and of course
 

8839
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:02,950
errors of of understanding and of course
our eyes that's part the way we use our

8840
02:32:02,950 --> 02:32:02,960
our eyes that's part the way we use our
 

8841
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:04,469
our eyes that's part the way we use our
eyes as part of the human communications

8842
02:32:04,469 --> 02:32:04,479
eyes as part of the human communications
 

8843
02:32:04,479 --> 02:32:07,110
eyes as part of the human communications
you have to kind of be aware of that

8844
02:32:07,110 --> 02:32:07,120
you have to kind of be aware of that
 

8845
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:09,429
you have to kind of be aware of that
of that um

8846
02:32:09,429 --> 02:32:09,439
of that um
 

8847
02:32:09,439 --> 02:32:11,510
of that um
that element of it so yeah i mean but

8848
02:32:11,510 --> 02:32:11,520
that element of it so yeah i mean but
 

8849
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:12,950
that element of it so yeah i mean but
it's fascinating you should be aware of

8850
02:32:12,950 --> 02:32:12,960
it's fascinating you should be aware of
 

8851
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:14,710
it's fascinating you should be aware of
your own self in those those little

8852
02:32:14,710 --> 02:32:14,720
your own self in those those little
 

8853
02:32:14,720 --> 02:32:16,070
your own self in those those little
characteristics

8854
02:32:16,070 --> 02:32:16,080
characteristics
 

8855
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:17,670
characteristics
whether it's uh

8856
02:32:17,670 --> 02:32:17,680
whether it's uh
 

8857
02:32:17,680 --> 02:32:19,429
whether it's uh
whether it's classified on some aspect

8858
02:32:19,429 --> 02:32:19,439
whether it's classified on some aspect
 

8859
02:32:19,439 --> 02:32:21,990
whether it's classified on some aspect
of the uh autism spectrum or just in

8860
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:22,000
of the uh autism spectrum or just in
 

8861
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,790
of the uh autism spectrum or just in
general whether it's eating whether it's

8862
02:32:24,790 --> 02:32:24,800
general whether it's eating whether it's
 

8863
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:26,070
general whether it's eating whether it's
depression

8864
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:26,080
depression
 

8865
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:29,030
depression
whether it's um even like schizophrenia

8866
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:29,040
whether it's um even like schizophrenia
 

8867
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:30,710
whether it's um even like schizophrenia
that would i hope we get a chance to

8868
02:32:30,710 --> 02:32:30,720
that would i hope we get a chance to
 

8869
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:34,309
that would i hope we get a chance to
talk to a a little bit yeah but those

8870
02:32:34,309 --> 02:32:34,319
talk to a a little bit yeah but those
 

8871
02:32:34,319 --> 02:32:37,429
talk to a a little bit yeah but those
things are all made up of different care

8872
02:32:37,429 --> 02:32:37,439
things are all made up of different care

symptoms and characteristics

8874
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:40,000
symptoms and characteristics
 

8875
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,790
symptoms and characteristics
and use use them as a superpower i i

8876
02:32:42,790 --> 02:32:42,800
and use use them as a superpower i i
 

8877
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:45,429
and use use them as a superpower i i
suppose this is the best we can hope for

8878
02:32:45,429 --> 02:32:45,439
suppose this is the best we can hope for
 

8879
02:32:45,439 --> 02:32:48,790
suppose this is the best we can hope for
in mild cases i guess i do think both

8880
02:32:48,790 --> 02:32:48,800
in mild cases i guess i do think both
 

8881
02:32:48,800 --> 02:32:50,630
in mild cases i guess i do think both

02:33:52,870 --> 02:33:52,880
or
 

8951
02:33:52,880 --> 02:33:54,230
or
might make one

8952
02:33:54,230 --> 02:33:54,240
might make one
 

8953
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:57,030
might make one
state too sticky too hard to get out of

8954
02:33:57,030 --> 02:33:57,040
state too sticky too hard to get out of
 

8955
02:33:57,040 --> 02:33:59,670
state too sticky too hard to get out of
right yeah that is a huge opportunity

8956
02:33:59,670 --> 02:33:59,680
right yeah that is a huge opportunity
 

8957
02:33:59,680 --> 02:34:02,389
right yeah that is a huge opportunity
for an interaction from the theoretical

8958
02:34:02,389 --> 02:34:02,399
for an interaction from the theoretical
 

8959
02:34:02,399 --> 02:34:04,950
for an interaction from the theoretical
and experimental side together

8960
02:34:04,950 --> 02:34:04,960
and experimental side together
 

8961
02:34:04,960 --> 02:34:07,830
and experimental side together
make one state too sticky

8962
02:34:07,830 --> 02:34:07,840
make one state too sticky
 

8963
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:09,670
make one state too sticky
the

8964
02:34:09,670 --> 02:34:09,680
the
 

8965
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:12,150
the
sort of uh measure the stickiness of the

8966
02:34:12,150 --> 02:34:12,160
sort of uh measure the stickiness of the
 

8967
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:14,230
sort of uh measure the stickiness of the
state and how to lessen the stickiness

8968
02:34:14,230 --> 02:34:14,240
state and how to lessen the stickiness
 

8969
02:34:14,240 --> 02:34:16,469
state and how to lessen the stickiness
that's right get some oil in the machine

8970
02:34:16,469 --> 02:34:16,479
that's right get some oil in the machine
 

8971
02:34:16,479 --> 02:34:18,630
that's right get some oil in the machine
yes yeah what would predict the kind of

8972
02:34:18,630 --> 02:34:18,640
yes yeah what would predict the kind of
 

8973
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:21,830
yes yeah what would predict the kind of
oil that would work well

8974
02:34:21,830 --> 02:34:21,840
oil that would work well
 

8975
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:25,510
oil that would work well
uh what in your practice is um

8976
02:34:25,510 --> 02:34:25,520
uh what in your practice is um
 

8977
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:27,910
uh what in your practice is um
treatment or advice

8978
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:27,920
treatment or advice
 

8979
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:31,429
treatment or advice
for the people on the autism spectrum so

8980
02:34:31,429 --> 02:34:31,439
for the people on the autism spectrum so
 

8981
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:33,510
for the people on the autism spectrum so
right now there's no real medical

8982
02:34:33,510 --> 02:34:33,520
right now there's no real medical
 

8983
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:35,349
right now there's no real medical
treatment there are behavioral

8986
02:34:36,389 --> 02:34:36,399
treatments
 

8987
02:34:36,399 --> 02:34:38,710

thing very often my patients with autism

9030
02:35:19,590 --> 02:35:19,600
thing very often my patients with autism
 

9031
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:21,270
thing very often my patients with autism
are very anxious

and then and then it'll go it'll unravel
in all these kinds of ways and this

9120
02:36:46,550 --> 02:36:46,560
in all these kinds of ways and this
 

9121
02:36:46,560 --> 02:36:48,790
in all these kinds of ways and this
moment could be completely life-changing

9122
02:36:48,790 --> 02:36:48,800
moment could be completely life-changing
 

9123
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:51,429
moment could be completely life-changing
or it can be mundane and meaningless and

9124
02:36:51,429 --> 02:36:51,439
or it can be mundane and meaningless and

it's amazing and overwhelming if you
allow yourself to think about it yes

9186
02:37:58,150 --> 02:37:58,160

 

9187
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:01,830

exactly seems like uh a to-do item for

02:38:01,830 --> 02:38:01,840
exactly seems like uh a to-do item for
 

9189
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:04,389
exactly seems like uh a to-do item for
anybody living in austin for sure

9190
02:38:04,389 --> 02:38:04,399
anybody living in austin for sure
 

9191
02:38:04,399 --> 02:38:06,309
anybody living in austin for sure
but you know the the spectrum is an

9192
02:38:06,309 --> 02:38:06,319
but you know the the spectrum is an
 

9193
02:38:06,319 --> 02:38:08,469
but you know the the spectrum is an
interesting concept because

9194
02:38:08,469 --> 02:38:08,479
interesting concept because
 

9195
02:38:08,479 --> 02:38:10,710
interesting concept because
that is you know when i say when i refer

9196
02:38:10,710 --> 02:38:10,720
that is you know when i say when i refer
 

9197
02:38:10,720 --> 02:38:11,910
that is you know when i say when i refer
to the spectrum

9198
02:38:11,910 --> 02:38:11,920
to the spectrum
 

9199
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:13,910
to the spectrum
uh i'm actually referring to it's a

9200
02:38:13,910 --> 02:38:13,920
uh i'm actually referring to it's a
 

9201
02:38:13,920 --> 02:38:15,590
uh i'm actually referring to it's a
precise clinical term but you're right

9202
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:15,600
precise clinical term but you're right
 

9203
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:17,990
precise clinical term but you're right
it's been co-opted more broadly and it

9204
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:18,000
it's been co-opted more broadly and it
 

9205
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,710
it's been co-opted more broadly and it
is widely used and it can be

9206
02:38:20,710 --> 02:38:20,720
is widely used and it can be
 

9207
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:22,389
is widely used and it can be
an unfair categorization of someone

9208
02:38:22,389 --> 02:38:22,399
an unfair categorization of someone
 

9209
02:38:22,399 --> 02:38:23,429
an unfair categorization of someone
who's

9210
02:38:23,429 --> 02:38:23,439
who's
 

9211
02:38:23,439 --> 02:38:25,750
who's
socially and occupationally very healthy

9212
02:38:25,750 --> 02:38:25,760
socially and occupationally very healthy
 

9213
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:27,270
socially and occupationally very healthy
and that

9214
02:38:27,270 --> 02:38:27,280
and that
 

9215
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,590
and that
is critical

9216
02:38:29,590 --> 02:38:29,600
is critical
 

9217
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:32,150
is critical
because we we don't define a disorder

9218
02:38:32,150 --> 02:38:32,160
because we we don't define a disorder
 

9219
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:34,150
because we we don't define a disorder
unless there's social or occupational

unless there's social or occupational

02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:35,750
unless there's social or occupational
dysfunction it doesn't matter what the

9222
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:35,760
dysfunction it doesn't matter what the
 

9223
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:37,670
dysfunction it doesn't matter what the
symptoms are i've had

patients who are pleasantly

02:38:38,880 --> 02:38:41,590
patients who are pleasantly
hallucinating so frankly psychotic but

02:38:41,590 --> 02:38:41,600
hallucinating so frankly psychotic but
 

9229
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:43,510
hallucinating so frankly psychotic but
doesn't affect their lives so i don't

9230
02:38:43,510 --> 02:38:43,520
doesn't affect their lives so i don't
 

9231
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:45,349
doesn't affect their lives so i don't
give that person

9232
02:38:45,349 --> 02:38:45,359
give that person
 

9233
02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:48,070
give that person
as diagnosis because there's not social

9234

same with
any anything on this

any anything on this
 

9241
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:55,510
any anything on this
you know any of the diverse symptoms of

9242
02:38:55,510 --> 02:38:55,520
you know any of the diverse symptoms of
 

9243
02:38:55,520 --> 02:38:58,389
you know any of the diverse symptoms of
autism spectrum disorder

9244
02:38:58,389 --> 02:38:58,399
autism spectrum disorder
 

9245
02:38:58,399 --> 02:38:59,830
autism spectrum disorder
if someone has them

9246
02:38:59,830 --> 02:38:59,840
if someone has them
 

9247
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:01,429
if someone has them
but they're

9248
02:39:01,429 --> 02:39:01,439
but they're
 

9249
02:39:01,439 --> 02:39:03,030
but they're
successful socially and occupationally

9250
02:39:03,030 --> 02:39:03,040
successful socially and occupationally
 

9251
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:05,429
successful socially and occupationally
we don't say that there's a disorder

9252
02:39:05,429 --> 02:39:05,439
we don't say that there's a disorder
 

9253
02:39:05,439 --> 02:39:07,190
we don't say that there's a disorder
but then you're right the concept of the

9254
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:07,200
but then you're right the concept of the
 

9255
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:09,670
but then you're right the concept of the
spectrum does become a useful uh you

9256
02:39:09,670 --> 02:39:09,680
spectrum does become a useful uh you
 

9257
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:12,950
spectrum does become a useful uh you
know pigeonholing um device which is

9258
02:39:12,950 --> 02:39:12,960
know pigeonholing um device which is
 

9259
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:16,950
know pigeonholing um device which is
maybe not not the best thing

9260
02:39:16,950 --> 02:39:16,960

 

9261
02:39:16,960 --> 02:39:19,830

has this progressive quality to it
untreated so it's very interesting

there's a break that happens we call it
 

9589
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:17,030
there's a break that happens we call it
first break

9590
02:45:17,030 --> 02:45:17,040
first break
 

9591
02:45:17,040 --> 02:45:18,230
first break
when

9592
02:45:18,230 --> 02:45:18,240
when
 

9593
02:45:18,240 --> 02:45:21,429
when
someone experiences their first

9594

someone experiences their first
 

9595
02:45:21,439 --> 02:45:22,950
someone experiences their first
disruption of reality they can have a

9596
02:45:22,950 --> 02:45:22,960
disruption of reality they can have a
 

9597
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:24,710
disruption of reality they can have a
completely typical life up into that

9598
02:45:24,710 --> 02:45:24,720
completely typical life up into that
 

9599
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:26,710
completely typical life up into that

more and more severe

more and more severe
 

9653
02:46:20,240 --> 02:46:22,070
more and more severe
so one can't even

9654
02:46:22,070 --> 02:46:22,080
so one can't even
 

9655
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:24,070
so one can't even
maintain thoughts in any sort of ordered

9656

fashion
and then eventually uh you know it can

9660
02:46:29,429 --> 02:46:29,439
and then eventually uh you know it can
 

9661
02:46:29,439 --> 02:46:31,910
and then eventually uh you know it can
be fatal can lead to suicide it can lead

9662
02:46:31,910 --> 02:46:31,920
be fatal can lead to suicide it can lead
 

9663
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:34,469
be fatal can lead to suicide it can lead
to erratic behavior that leads to

9664
02:46:34,469 --> 02:46:34,479
to erratic behavior that leads to
 

9665
02:46:34,479 --> 02:46:36,630
to erratic behavior that leads to
accidents

9666
02:46:36,630 --> 02:46:36,640
accidents
 

9667
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:37,429
accidents
now

9668
02:46:37,429 --> 02:46:37,439
now
 

9669
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:39,590
now
it can be treated there are medications

9670
02:46:39,590 --> 02:46:39,600
it can be treated there are medications
 

9671
02:46:39,600 --> 02:46:41,110
it can be treated there are medications
that help uh

9672
02:46:41,110 --> 02:46:41,120
that help uh
 

9673
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:43,110
that help uh
fortunately they have side effects so

9674
02:46:43,110 --> 02:46:43,120
fortunately they have side effects so
 

9675
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:45,030
fortunately they have side effects so
they're not perfect you can have

9676
02:46:45,030 --> 02:46:45,040
they're not perfect you can have
 

9677
02:46:45,040 --> 02:46:47,349
they're not perfect you can have
movement problems and

9678
02:46:47,349 --> 02:46:47,359
movement problems and
 

9679
02:46:47,359 --> 02:46:48,790
movement problems and
uh

9680
02:46:48,790 --> 02:46:48,800
uh
 

9681
02:46:48,800 --> 02:46:50,070
uh
actually a whole host of different side

9682
02:46:50,070 --> 02:46:50,080
actually a whole host of different side
 

9683
02:46:50,080 --> 02:46:51,510
actually a whole host of different side
effects that come from the medications

9684
02:46:51,510 --> 02:46:51,520
effects that come from the medications
 

9685
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:53,990
effects that come from the medications
but we can help people now with with

9686
02:46:53,990 --> 02:46:54,000
but we can help people now with with
 

9687
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:57,910
but we can help people now with with
schizophrenia very very significantly

9688
02:46:57,910 --> 02:46:57,920
schizophrenia very very significantly
 

9689
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:59,750
schizophrenia very very significantly
but the amazing thing and this is

9690
02:46:59,750 --> 02:46:59,760
but the amazing thing and this is
 

9691
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:02,309
but the amazing thing and this is
emblematic of where psychiatry stands

9692
02:47:02,309 --> 02:47:02,319
emblematic of where psychiatry stands
 

9693
02:47:02,319 --> 02:47:04,309
emblematic of where psychiatry stands
we don't have the deep understanding

9694
02:47:04,309 --> 02:47:04,319
we don't have the deep understanding
 

9695
02:47:04,319 --> 02:47:06,150
we don't have the deep understanding
just like with depression we don't have

9696
02:47:06,150 --> 02:47:06,160
just like with depression we don't have
 

9697
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:07,910
just like with depression we don't have
that heart as a pump

9698
02:47:07,910 --> 02:47:07,920
that heart as a pump
 

9699
02:47:07,920 --> 02:47:09,429
that heart as a pump
level of understanding

9700
02:47:09,429 --> 02:47:09,439
level of understanding
 

9701
02:47:09,439 --> 02:47:10,790
level of understanding
that we'd like to have with

9702
02:47:10,790 --> 02:47:10,800
that we'd like to have with
 

9703
02:47:10,800 --> 02:47:12,389
that we'd like to have with
schizophrenia despite it being so

9704
02:47:12,389 --> 02:47:12,399
schizophrenia despite it being so
 

9705
02:47:12,399 --> 02:47:15,269
schizophrenia despite it being so
biological so genetic in its nature

9706
02:47:15,269 --> 02:47:15,279
biological so genetic in its nature
 

9707
02:47:15,279 --> 02:47:16,790
biological so genetic in its nature
so is there a way

9708
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:16,800
so is there a way
 

9709
02:47:16,800 --> 02:47:18,870
so is there a way
once

9710
02:47:18,870 --> 02:47:18,880
once
 

9711
02:47:18,880 --> 02:47:20,710
once
a wait to return to the other side of

9712
02:47:20,710 --> 02:47:20,720
a wait to return to the other side of
 

9713
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:22,230
a wait to return to the other side of
the first break

9714
02:47:22,230 --> 02:47:22,240
the first break
 

9715
02:47:22,240 --> 02:47:23,990
the first break
so when you have a break with reality

9716
02:47:23,990 --> 02:47:24,000
so when you have a break with reality
 

9717
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,670
so when you have a break with reality
it's a way to kind of

9718
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:25,680
it's a way to kind of
 

9719
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:28,309
it's a way to kind of
stitch it together yeah so some people

9720
02:47:28,309 --> 02:47:28,319
stitch it together yeah so some people
 

9721
02:47:28,319 --> 02:47:30,790
stitch it together yeah so some people
that that works

9722
02:47:30,790 --> 02:47:30,800
that that works
 

9723
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:33,269
that that works
but we don't really know how so

9724
02:47:33,269 --> 02:47:33,279
but we don't really know how so
 

9725
02:47:33,279 --> 02:47:35,510
but we don't really know how so

hallucinating actively paranoid put them
 

9743
02:47:55,279 --> 02:47:57,190
hallucinating actively paranoid put them
back in a completely normal state and

9744
02:47:57,190 --> 02:47:57,200
back in a completely normal state and
 

9745
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:58,870
back in a completely normal state and
some people

9746
02:47:58,870 --> 02:47:58,880
some people
 

9747
02:47:58,880 --> 02:48:00,389
some people
stay that way

9748
02:48:00,389 --> 02:48:00,399
stay that way
 

9749
02:48:00,399 --> 02:48:02,389
stay that way
indefinitely and so you can bring people

9750
02:48:02,389 --> 02:48:02,399
indefinitely and so you can bring people
 

9751
02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:04,710
indefinitely and so you can bring people
back from from that back to the other

9752

back from from that back to the other
 

9753
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:07,110
back from from that back to the other
side have it stitched together

side have it stitched together
 

9755
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:09,429
side have it stitched together
more typically um

9756
02:48:09,429 --> 02:48:09,439
more typically um
 

9757
02:48:09,439 --> 02:48:11,830

you'll end up in some intermediate state

you'll end up in some intermediate state
 

9759

there's a symptoms are reduced
 

9763
02:48:14,720 --> 02:48:16,230
there's a symptoms are reduced
powerfully but there might be still

something there and you've got a drop

9766
02:48:17,910 --> 02:48:17,920
something there and you've got a drop
 

9767
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:18,870
something there and you've got a drop
down in

9768
02:48:18,870 --> 02:48:18,880
down in
 

9769
02:48:18,880 --> 02:48:20,630
down in
functioning that may be persistent for a

functioning that may be persistent for a

while
 

9773
02:48:21,840 --> 02:48:23,510
while
but

9774
02:48:23,510 --> 02:48:23,520
but
 

9775
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:26,150
but
concepts what physically is going on one

9776
02:48:26,150 --> 02:48:26,160
concepts what physically is going on one
 

9777
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:28,070
concepts what physically is going on one
idea is that

9778
02:48:28,070 --> 02:48:28,080
idea is that
 

9779
02:48:28,080 --> 02:48:30,550
idea is that
it's communication

9780
02:48:30,550 --> 02:48:30,560
it's communication
 

9781
02:48:30,560 --> 02:48:33,510
it's communication
within the brain one part of the brain

9782
02:48:33,510 --> 02:48:33,520
within the brain one part of the brain
 

9783
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:35,190
within the brain one part of the brain
is not able to tell other parts of the

9784
02:48:35,190 --> 02:48:35,200
is not able to tell other parts of the
 

9785
02:48:35,200 --> 02:48:36,630
is not able to tell other parts of the
brain what it's doing and so the

9786
02:48:36,630 --> 02:48:36,640
brain what it's doing and so the
 

9787
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:38,230
brain what it's doing and so the
auditory hallucinations are very

9788
02:48:38,230 --> 02:48:38,240
auditory hallucinations are very
 

9789
02:48:38,240 --> 02:48:39,990
auditory hallucinations are very
interesting in this regard

9790
02:48:39,990 --> 02:48:40,000
interesting in this regard
 

9791
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:41,910
interesting in this regard
they often have this conversational

9792
02:48:41,910 --> 02:48:41,920
they often have this conversational
 

9793

02:48:44,389 --> 02:48:44,399
inner monologue like quality as we're
 

9795
02:48:44,399 --> 02:48:45,910
inner monologue like quality as we're
walking along the street we may have an

if we see somebody we don't like we

02:48:50,630 --> 02:48:50,640
if we see somebody we don't like we
 

9803
02:48:50,640 --> 02:48:52,309
if we see somebody we don't like we
might have a thought out where somebody

9804
02:48:52,309 --> 02:48:52,319
might have a thought out where somebody
 

9805
02:48:52,319 --> 02:48:53,910
might have a thought out where somebody
would punch that guy something like that

9806
02:48:53,910 --> 02:48:53,920
would punch that guy something like that
 

9807

these are so far below
 

9811
02:48:57,520 --> 02:49:01,349
these are so far below
where we would ever you know act or even

9812
02:49:01,349 --> 02:49:01,359
where we would ever you know act or even
 

9813
02:49:01,359 --> 02:49:03,110
where we would ever you know act or even
think of acting but they're just things

9814
02:49:03,110 --> 02:49:03,120
think of acting but they're just things
 

9815
02:49:03,120 --> 02:49:04,790
think of acting but they're just things
that come up and and people with

that come up and and people with
 

9817
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:07,590

02:49:09,269 --> 02:49:09,279
those inner thoughts that inner
 

9821

those inner thoughts that inner
monologue is not recognized as the inner

9822
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:13,520
monologue is not recognized as the inner
 

9823
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:16,309
monologue is not recognized as the inner
monologue of the self and so it's it's

could be conceptualized as a

02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:38,230
could be conceptualized as a
communication within the brain problem

9844

like self-reflection
that society forces on you

that society forces on you
 

9909

positive uh they're the unusual ways
 

9929
02:51:05,439 --> 02:51:07,910
positive uh they're the unusual ways
they view the world it was

9930
02:51:07,910 --> 02:51:07,920
they view the world it was
 

9931
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,070
they view the world it was
but it's always interesting it's uh it

9932
02:51:10,070 --> 02:51:10,080
but it's always interesting it's uh it
 

9933
02:51:10,080 --> 02:51:12,309
but it's always interesting it's uh it
could be conspiratorial thinking too

9934
02:51:12,309 --> 02:51:12,319
could be conspiratorial thinking too
 

9935
02:51:12,319 --> 02:51:14,710
could be conspiratorial thinking too
yeah like but like the the theories they

9936
02:51:14,710 --> 02:51:14,720
yeah like but like the the theories they
 

9937
02:51:14,720 --> 02:51:16,630
yeah like but like the the theories they
have about the way the world functions

9938
02:51:16,630 --> 02:51:16,640
have about the way the world functions
 

9939
02:51:16,640 --> 02:51:19,349
have about the way the world functions
it often very well read which is also

9940
02:51:19,349 --> 02:51:19,359
it often very well read which is also
 

9941
02:51:19,359 --> 02:51:20,309
it often very well read which is also
interesting

9942
02:51:20,309 --> 02:51:20,319
interesting
 

9943
02:51:20,319 --> 02:51:21,750
interesting
because they're almost like looking for

9944
02:51:21,750 --> 02:51:21,760
because they're almost like looking for
 

9945
02:51:21,760 --> 02:51:23,590
because they're almost like looking for
helpful answers from somewhere

9946
02:51:23,590 --> 02:51:23,600
helpful answers from somewhere
 

9947
02:51:23,600 --> 02:51:25,510
helpful answers from somewhere
absolutely and so they're you know they

9948
02:51:25,510 --> 02:51:25,520
absolutely and so they're you know they
 

9949
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:27,190
absolutely and so they're you know they
might be citing some very interesting

9950
02:51:27,190 --> 02:51:27,200
might be citing some very interesting
 

9951
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:30,070
might be citing some very interesting
literature and then using that

9952
02:51:30,070 --> 02:51:30,080
literature and then using that
 

9953
02:51:30,080 --> 02:51:31,510
literature and then using that
um

9954
02:51:31,510 --> 02:51:31,520
um
 

9955
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:33,429
um
there's a stickiness in their mind to

9956
02:51:33,429 --> 02:51:33,439
there's a stickiness in their mind to
 

9957
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:34,950
there's a stickiness in their mind to
different models of the world and trying

9958
02:51:34,950 --> 02:51:34,960
different models of the world and trying
 

9959
02:51:34,960 --> 02:51:36,950
different models of the world and trying
to make sense of that world and those

9960
02:51:36,950 --> 02:51:36,960
to make sense of that world and those
 

9961
02:51:36,960 --> 02:51:38,950
to make sense of that world and those
models could include conspiracy theories

9962
02:51:38,950 --> 02:51:38,960
models could include conspiracy theories
 

9963
02:51:38,960 --> 02:51:40,070
models could include conspiracy theories
yeah

9964
02:51:40,070 --> 02:51:40,080
yeah
 

9965
02:51:40,080 --> 02:51:42,389
yeah
they're very attuned to complexity and

9966
02:51:42,389 --> 02:51:42,399
they're very attuned to complexity and
 

9967
02:51:42,399 --> 02:51:44,349
they're very attuned to complexity and
they come up with unlikely

9968
02:51:44,349 --> 02:51:44,359
they come up with unlikely
 

9969
02:51:44,359 --> 02:51:46,870
they come up with unlikely
explanations uh which is one of the

9970
02:51:46,870 --> 02:51:46,880
explanations uh which is one of the
 

9971
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:48,790
explanations uh which is one of the
things that makes them it makes it hard

9972
02:51:48,790 --> 02:51:48,800
things that makes them it makes it hard
 

9973
02:51:48,800 --> 02:51:50,389
things that makes them it makes it hard
for them to function in the in the world

9974
02:51:50,389 --> 02:51:50,399
for them to function in the in the world
 

9975
02:51:50,399 --> 02:51:52,630
for them to function in the in the world
is how unlikely their explanations are

9976
02:51:52,630 --> 02:51:52,640
is how unlikely their explanations are
 

9977
02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:54,870
is how unlikely their explanations are
but but you're right there's a depth of

9978
02:51:54,870 --> 02:51:54,880
but but you're right there's a depth of
 

9979
02:51:54,880 --> 02:51:56,790
but but you're right there's a depth of
consideration of the complexity of the

9980
02:51:56,790 --> 02:51:56,800
consideration of the complexity of the
 

9981
02:51:56,800 --> 02:51:57,910
consideration of the complexity of the
world

9982
02:51:57,910 --> 02:51:57,920
world
 

9983
02:51:57,920 --> 02:52:02,870
world
and a concern about it and a work uh a

9984
02:52:02,870 --> 02:52:02,880
and a concern about it and a work uh a
 

9985
02:52:02,880 --> 02:52:04,710
and a concern about it and a work uh a
an impulse to work to understand it that

9986
02:52:04,710 --> 02:52:04,720
an impulse to work to understand it that
 

9987
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:06,950
an impulse to work to understand it that
is actually quite refreshing um

9988
02:52:06,950 --> 02:52:06,960
is actually quite refreshing um
 

9989
02:52:06,960 --> 02:52:07,670
is actually quite refreshing um
but

9990
02:52:07,670 --> 02:52:07,680
but
 

9991
02:52:07,680 --> 02:52:09,590
but
you know the first case in the medical

9992
02:52:09,590 --> 02:52:09,600
you know the first case in the medical
 

9993
02:52:09,600 --> 02:52:10,550
you know the first case in the medical
literature

9994
02:52:10,550 --> 02:52:10,560
literature
 

9995
02:52:10,560 --> 02:52:12,469
literature
uh there was a

9996
02:52:12,469 --> 02:52:12,479
uh there was a
 

9997
02:52:12,479 --> 02:52:15,110
uh there was a
classical schizophrenia

9998
02:52:15,110 --> 02:52:15,120
classical schizophrenia
 

9999
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:17,110
classical schizophrenia
there was a patient named james tilly

10000
02:52:17,110 --> 02:52:17,120
there was a patient named james tilly
 

10001
02:52:17,120 --> 02:52:19,590
there was a patient named james tilly
matthews who

10002
02:52:19,590 --> 02:52:19,600
matthews who
 

10003
02:52:19,600 --> 02:52:21,830
matthews who
had this uh he sketched out for his

02:52:21,830 --> 02:52:21,840
had this uh he sketched out for his
 

10005
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:23,030
had this uh he sketched out for his
doctor the

10006
02:52:23,030 --> 02:52:23,040
doctor the
 

10007
02:52:23,040 --> 02:52:25,910
doctor the

10008
02:52:25,910 --> 02:52:25,920
uh experiences he was he was
 

10009
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:29,670
uh experiences he was he was
sensing and he drew himself as a

a cowering figure on the ground

10012
02:52:31,670 --> 02:52:31,680
a cowering figure on the ground

controlled
 

10015
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:35,670
controlled
by a loom a weaving device that was

10016
02:52:35,670 --> 02:52:35,680
by a loom a weaving device that was
 

10017
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:37,750
by a loom a weaving device that was
sending threads

10018
02:52:37,750 --> 02:52:37,760
sending threads
 

10019
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:40,710
sending threads
long threads projections across space

10020

from the loom to him to his arms and to

10022
02:52:43,110 --> 02:52:43,120
from the loom to him to his arms and to
 

10023
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:45,670
from the loom to him to his arms and to
his body and controlling him

10024
02:52:45,670 --> 02:52:45,680
his body and controlling him
 

10025
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:47,590

and he called this the heirloom

10028
02:52:49,750 --> 02:52:49,760
and he called this the heirloom
 

10029
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:51,670
and he called this the heirloom
a loom in the air

10030
02:52:51,670 --> 02:52:51,680
a loom in the air
 

10031
02:52:51,680 --> 02:52:52,870
a loom in the air
and

and
 

10033
02:52:52,880 --> 02:52:54,469
and
it was such an evocative thing because

10034
02:52:54,469 --> 02:52:54,479
it was such an evocative thing because
 

10035
02:52:54,479 --> 02:52:55,510
it was such an evocative thing because
you know this was the start of the

10036
02:52:55,510 --> 02:52:55,520
you know this was the start of the
 

10037
02:52:55,520 --> 02:52:57,670
you know this was the start of the
industrial revolution or mid and it was

10038
02:52:57,670 --> 02:52:57,680
industrial revolution or mid and it was
 

10039
02:52:57,680 --> 02:52:59,030
industrial revolution or mid and it was
where you know

10040
02:52:59,030 --> 02:52:59,040
where you know
 

10041
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:00,870
where you know
really industrial strength

10042
02:53:00,870 --> 02:53:00,880
really industrial strength
 

10043
02:53:00,880 --> 02:53:02,790
really industrial strength
you know looms and weaving devices were

10044
02:53:02,790 --> 02:53:02,800
you know looms and weaving devices were
 

10045
02:53:02,800 --> 02:53:05,110
you know looms and weaving devices were
really uh kind of the

10046
02:53:05,110 --> 02:53:05,120
really uh kind of the
 

10047
02:53:05,120 --> 02:53:07,110
really uh kind of the
emblematic of the most

powerful technological achievements of

02:53:10,240 --> 02:53:12,630
powerful technological achievements of
the time and so that was the explanation

10054
02:53:12,630 --> 02:53:12,640
the time and so that was the explanation
 

10055
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:15,990
the time and so that was the explanation
available to him to explain how

available to him to explain how

their limbs
but it's this it's the same thing it's

10088
02:53:44,710 --> 02:53:44,720
but it's this it's the same thing it's
 

10089
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:45,910
but it's this it's the same thing it's
that whether it's a thread from an

that whether it's a thread from an

right it's because it's so involuntary

10136
02:54:34,070 --> 02:54:34,080
right it's because it's so involuntary
 

10137
02:54:34,080 --> 02:54:35,990
right it's because it's so involuntary
and it's reflecting something true and

and it's reflecting something true and
inside

10145
02:54:40,720 --> 02:54:43,110
seems like a problem right wouldn't it
be better if we could control it if if

10146
02:54:43,110 --> 02:54:43,120
be better if we could control it if if
 

10147
02:54:43,120 --> 02:54:44,630
be better if we could control it if if
we could

10148
02:54:44,630 --> 02:54:44,640
we could
 

10149
02:54:44,640 --> 02:54:46,790
we could
not show that emotion

10150
02:54:46,790 --> 02:54:46,800
not show that emotion
 

10151
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:49,030
not show that emotion
when it's not useful show it when it's

10152
02:54:49,030 --> 02:54:49,040
when it's not useful show it when it's
 

10153
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:50,870
when it's not useful show it when it's
useful but it's not it's it's largely

10154
02:54:50,870 --> 02:54:50,880
useful but it's not it's it's largely
 

10155
02:54:50,880 --> 02:54:52,790
useful but it's not it's it's largely
involuntary

that's hard to uh hard to control and
but is it is it well understood

but is it is it well understood
 

10241
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,790
but is it is it well understood
what how that connects to

10242
02:56:22,790 --> 02:56:22,800
what how that connects to
 

10243
02:56:22,800 --> 02:56:24,790
what how that connects to
the internal state

10244
02:56:24,790 --> 02:56:24,800
the internal state
 

10245
02:56:24,800 --> 02:56:27,030

there are
 

10249
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:30,469
there are
long-range projections that come so

10250
02:56:30,469 --> 02:56:30,479
long-range projections that come so
 

10251
02:56:30,479 --> 02:56:31,990
long-range projections that come so
where where is crying generate this is

10417
02:59:24,479 --> 02:59:26,630
uh sensors that are sensitive to certain
aspects of the human face but to me it

10418
02:59:26,630 --> 02:59:26,640
aspects of the human face but to me it

to community something is communicating
 

10447
02:59:59,279 --> 03:00:01,910
to community something is communicating
and those that stuff is really useful

10448
03:00:01,910 --> 03:00:01,920
and those that stuff is really useful
 

10449
03:00:01,920 --> 03:00:04,309
and those that stuff is really useful
the human face and when it's gone that

10450
03:00:04,309 --> 03:00:04,319
the human face and when it's gone that
 

10451
03:00:04,319 --> 03:00:06,230
the human face and when it's gone that
something is missing and a lot of little

10452
03:00:06,230 --> 03:00:06,240
something is missing and a lot of little
 

10453
03:00:06,240 --> 03:00:08,630
something is missing and a lot of little
stuff it feels like can really it's

10454
03:00:08,630 --> 03:00:08,640
stuff it feels like can really it's
 

10455
03:00:08,640 --> 03:00:10,950
stuff it feels like can really it's
almost involuntary i guess but it's

10456
03:00:10,950 --> 03:00:10,960
almost involuntary i guess but it's
 

10457
03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:12,870
almost involuntary i guess but it's
harder to describe as the presence or

10458
03:00:12,870 --> 03:00:12,880
harder to describe as the presence or
 

10459
03:00:12,880 --> 03:00:14,950
harder to describe as the presence or
absence of tears it's like something

10460
03:00:14,950 --> 03:00:14,960
absence of tears it's like something
 

10461
03:00:14,960 --> 03:00:17,429
absence of tears it's like something
about this person you can tell they're

10462
03:00:17,429 --> 03:00:17,439
about this person you can tell they're
 

10463
03:00:17,439 --> 03:00:19,429
about this person you can tell they're
not bullshitting you yeah yeah

10464
03:00:19,429 --> 03:00:19,439
not bullshitting you yeah yeah
 

10465
03:00:19,439 --> 03:00:21,190
not bullshitting you yeah yeah
and so that was that was what made

10466
03:00:21,190 --> 03:00:21,200
and so that was that was what made
 

10467
03:00:21,200 --> 03:00:23,269
and so that was that was what made
presumably that that

10468
03:00:23,269 --> 03:00:23,279
presumably that that
 

10469
03:00:23,279 --> 03:00:25,110
presumably that that
tier recruitment so powerful is it just

10470
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:25,120
tier recruitment so powerful is it just
 

10471
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:27,190
tier recruitment so powerful is it just
landed in this very

10472
03:00:27,190 --> 03:00:27,200
landed in this very
 

10473
03:00:27,200 --> 03:00:28,710
landed in this very
high value real estate for social

10474
03:00:28,710 --> 03:00:28,720
high value real estate for social
 

10475
03:00:28,720 --> 03:00:31,510
high value real estate for social

communication if it had gone to you know
 

10477
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:32,550
communication if it had gone to you know
there's a lot of

10478
03:00:32,550 --> 03:00:32,560
there's a lot of
 

10479
03:00:32,560 --> 03:00:34,870
there's a lot of
neurons in the in the ponds that control

10480
03:00:34,870 --> 03:00:34,880
neurons in the in the ponds that control
 

10481
03:00:34,880 --> 03:00:36,950

03:00:36,950 --> 03:00:36,960
you know movement of
 

10483
03:00:36,960 --> 03:00:39,190
you know movement of
large you know muscles uh you know

10484
03:00:39,190 --> 03:00:39,200
large you know muscles uh you know
 

10485
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:41,110
large you know muscles uh you know
elsewhere that would have been much less

10486
03:00:41,110 --> 03:00:41,120
elsewhere that would have been much less
 

10487
03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:42,550
elsewhere that would have been much less
effective as a social signal than

something around the eye so it was

10490
03:00:44,309 --> 03:00:44,319
something around the eye so it was
 

10491
03:00:44,319 --> 03:00:45,990
something around the eye so it was
however that that little misdirection

10492
03:00:45,990 --> 03:00:46,000
however that that little misdirection
 

10493
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,389
however that that little misdirection
happened it it landed in a great area

10494
03:00:48,389 --> 03:00:48,399
happened it it landed in a great area
 

10495
03:00:48,399 --> 03:00:50,230
happened it it landed in a great area
for social communication

10496
03:00:50,230 --> 03:00:50,240
for social communication
 

10497
03:00:50,240 --> 03:00:51,590
for social communication
and because it was coming from the fear

10498
03:00:51,590 --> 03:00:51,600
and because it was coming from the fear
 

10499
03:00:51,600 --> 03:00:52,790
and because it was coming from the fear
and anxiety

10500
03:00:52,790 --> 03:00:52,800

circuits that regulate that necessary

10502
03:00:55,590 --> 03:00:55,600
circuits that regulate that necessary
 

10503
03:00:55,600 --> 03:00:57,670
circuits that regulate that necessary
involuntary change in

10504
03:00:57,670 --> 03:00:57,680
involuntary change in
 

10505
03:00:57,680 --> 03:00:59,910
involuntary change in
heart rate and respiratory rate it also

10506
03:00:59,910 --> 03:00:59,920
heart rate and respiratory rate it also
 

10507
03:00:59,920 --> 03:01:02,309
heart rate and respiratory rate it also
was involuntary and that became valuable

10508
03:01:02,309 --> 03:01:02,319
was involuntary and that became valuable
 

10509
03:01:02,319 --> 03:01:05,750
was involuntary and that became valuable
as a as a truth signal as social beings

10510
03:01:05,750 --> 03:01:05,760
as a as a truth signal as social beings
 

10511
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:06,870
as a as a truth signal as social beings
so

10512
03:01:06,870 --> 03:01:06,880
so
 

10513
03:01:06,880 --> 03:01:08,309
so
very interesting when you think about

10514
03:01:08,309 --> 03:01:08,319
very interesting when you think about
 

10515
03:01:08,319 --> 03:01:09,590
very interesting when you think about
the origins of the human family the

10516
03:01:09,590 --> 03:01:09,600
the origins of the human family the
 

10517
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:11,670
the origins of the human family the
origins of social

10518
03:01:11,670 --> 03:01:11,680
origins of social
 

10519
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:14,150
origins of social
structures and our ability and need to

10520
03:01:14,150 --> 03:01:14,160

call for help when there's hope

10522
03:01:16,150 --> 03:01:16,160
call for help when there's hope
 

10523
03:01:16,160 --> 03:01:20,309
call for help when there's hope
but but need at the same time

10524
03:01:20,309 --> 03:01:20,319
but but need at the same time
 

10525
03:01:20,319 --> 03:01:22,230
but but need at the same time
what is consciousness

10526
03:01:22,230 --> 03:01:22,240
what is consciousness
 

10527
03:01:22,240 --> 03:01:26,389
what is consciousness
bro so you're actually using techniques

10528
03:01:26,389 --> 03:01:26,399
bro so you're actually using techniques
 

10529
03:01:26,399 --> 03:01:28,230
bro so you're actually using techniques
i mean even putting psychiatry aside

10530
03:01:28,230 --> 03:01:28,240
i mean even putting psychiatry aside
 

10531
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:29,429
i mean even putting psychiatry aside
just looking

10532
03:01:29,429 --> 03:01:29,439
just looking
 

10533
03:01:29,439 --> 03:01:31,670
just looking
at optogenetics

10534
03:01:31,670 --> 03:01:31,680
at optogenetics
 

10535
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:32,950
at optogenetics
you're trying to understand some of

10536
03:01:32,950 --> 03:01:32,960
you're trying to understand some of
 

10537
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:35,910
you're trying to understand some of
these deep aspects of the human mind

10538
03:01:35,910 --> 03:01:35,920
these deep aspects of the human mind
 

10539
03:01:35,920 --> 03:01:37,510
these deep aspects of the human mind
and maybe this is a good time to return

10540
03:01:37,510 --> 03:01:37,520
and maybe this is a good time to return
 

10541
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:39,349
and maybe this is a good time to return
to a question you mentioned

10542
03:01:39,349 --> 03:01:39,359
to a question you mentioned
 

10543
03:01:39,359 --> 03:01:41,510
to a question you mentioned
you might have an opinion on if there's

10544
03:01:41,510 --> 03:01:41,520
you might have an opinion on if there's
 

10545
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:43,110
you might have an opinion on if there's
such a thing as a theory of everything

10546
03:01:43,110 --> 03:01:43,120
such a thing as a theory of everything
 

10547
03:01:43,120 --> 03:01:44,870
such a thing as a theory of everything
for the human mind

10548
03:01:44,870 --> 03:01:44,880
for the human mind
 

10549
03:01:44,880 --> 03:01:46,950
for the human mind
because surely answering of what is

10550
03:01:46,950 --> 03:01:46,960
because surely answering of what is
 

10551
03:01:46,960 --> 03:01:49,190
because surely answering of what is
consciousness is as

10552

consciousness is as

03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:50,790
consciousness is as
well that's not sure

10554
03:01:50,790 --> 03:01:50,800
well that's not sure
 

10555
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:53,110
well that's not sure
but it seems like it's a fundamental

10556
03:01:53,110 --> 03:01:53,120
but it seems like it's a fundamental
 

10557
03:01:53,120 --> 03:01:54,790
but it seems like it's a fundamental
part of the human

10558
03:01:54,790 --> 03:01:54,800
part of the human
 

10559
03:01:54,800 --> 03:01:56,710
part of the human
experience in the human mind and solving

that question

10562
03:01:58,389 --> 03:01:58,399
that question
 

10563
03:01:58,399 --> 03:02:00,630
that question
will result in solving

10564
03:02:00,630 --> 03:02:00,640
will result in solving
 

10565
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:02,469
will result in solving
the bigger thing about the human mind

10566
03:02:02,469 --> 03:02:02,479
the bigger thing about the human mind
 

10567
03:02:02,479 --> 03:02:04,950
the bigger thing about the human mind
the flip side could be consciousness

10568
03:02:04,950 --> 03:02:04,960
the flip side could be consciousness
 

10569
03:02:04,960 --> 03:02:07,030
the flip side could be consciousness
it's just the few neurons that are

10570
03:02:07,030 --> 03:02:07,040
it's just the few neurons that are
 

10571
03:02:07,040 --> 03:02:09,590
it's just the few neurons that are
generating some useful thing that make

10572
03:02:09,590 --> 03:02:09,600
generating some useful thing that make
 

10573
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:11,429
generating some useful thing that make
us it's like uh

10574
03:02:11,429 --> 03:02:11,439
us it's like uh
 

10575
03:02:11,439 --> 03:02:13,510
us it's like uh
the the sense of self that you talked

10576
03:02:13,510 --> 03:02:13,520
the the sense of self that you talked
 

10577
03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:17,190
the the sense of self that you talked
about in the uh in the mice maybe it's a

10578
03:02:17,190 --> 03:02:17,200
about in the uh in the mice maybe it's a
 

10579
03:02:17,200 --> 03:02:18,950
about in the uh in the mice maybe it's a
subset of those cells that are just

10580
03:02:18,950 --> 03:02:18,960
subset of those cells that are just
 

10581
03:02:18,960 --> 03:02:21,110
subset of those cells that are just
creating a richer sense of self and

10582
03:02:21,110 --> 03:02:21,120
creating a richer sense of self and
 

10583
03:02:21,120 --> 03:02:22,870
creating a richer sense of self and
that's it

10584
03:02:22,870 --> 03:02:22,880
that's it
 

10585
03:02:22,880 --> 03:02:23,590
that's it
so

10586
03:02:23,590 --> 03:02:23,600
so
 

10587
03:02:23,600 --> 03:02:26,230
so
this is a great question

10588
03:02:26,230 --> 03:02:26,240
this is a great question
 

10589
03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:28,070
this is a great question
all neuroscientists think about this and

10590
03:02:28,070 --> 03:02:28,080
all neuroscientists think about this and
 

10591
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:30,070
all neuroscientists think about this and
a lot of non-neuroscientists too it's

10592
03:02:30,070 --> 03:02:30,080
a lot of non-neuroscientists too it's
 

10593
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:31,190
a lot of non-neuroscientists too it's
it's such a

10594
03:02:31,190 --> 03:02:31,200
it's such a
 

10595
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:33,510
it's such a
it's the reason a lot of people came to

10596
03:02:33,510 --> 03:02:33,520
it's the reason a lot of people came to
 

10597
03:02:33,520 --> 03:02:35,349
it's the reason a lot of people came to
the study of the brain is to think about

10598
03:02:35,349 --> 03:02:35,359
the study of the brain is to think about
 

10599
03:02:35,359 --> 03:02:37,190
the study of the brain is to think about
consciousness and not just

10600
03:02:37,190 --> 03:02:37,200
consciousness and not just
 

10601
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:39,349
consciousness and not just
being awake or alert but really

10602
03:02:39,349 --> 03:02:39,359
being awake or alert but really
 

10603
03:02:39,359 --> 03:02:41,349
being awake or alert but really
what's sometimes called the hard problem

10604
03:02:41,349 --> 03:02:41,359
what's sometimes called the hard problem
 

10605
03:02:41,359 --> 03:02:43,429
what's sometimes called the hard problem
of consciousness which is

10606
03:02:43,429 --> 03:02:43,439
of consciousness which is
 

10607
03:02:43,439 --> 03:02:45,830
of consciousness which is
what is that nature of that inner

10608
03:02:45,830 --> 03:02:45,840
what is that nature of that inner
 

10609
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:48,630
what is that nature of that inner
subjective sense we have not just

10610
03:02:48,630 --> 03:02:48,640
subjective sense we have not just
 

10611
03:02:48,640 --> 03:02:51,670
subjective sense we have not just
information processing

10612
03:02:51,670 --> 03:02:51,680
information processing
 

10613
03:02:51,680 --> 03:02:53,429
information processing
but feeling something about the

10614
03:02:53,429 --> 03:02:53,439
but feeling something about the
 

10615
03:02:53,439 --> 03:02:56,230
but feeling something about the
information that what is that inner

10616
03:02:56,230 --> 03:02:56,240
information that what is that inner
 

10617
03:02:56,240 --> 03:02:59,349
information that what is that inner
state of subjectivity physically what is

10618
03:02:59,349 --> 03:02:59,359
state of subjectivity physically what is
 

10619
03:02:59,359 --> 03:03:00,790
state of subjectivity physically what is
it

10620
03:03:00,790 --> 03:03:00,800
it
 

10621
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:02,469
it
and that's called the hard problem of

10622
03:03:02,469 --> 03:03:02,479
and that's called the hard problem of
 

10623
03:03:02,479 --> 03:03:04,309
and that's called the hard problem of
consciousness and

10624
03:03:04,309 --> 03:03:04,319
consciousness and
 

10625
03:03:04,319 --> 03:03:07,830
consciousness and
it's not an extremely well-defined

10626
03:03:07,830 --> 03:03:07,840
it's not an extremely well-defined
 

10627
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:09,910
it's not an extremely well-defined
question everybody has sort of a sense

10628
03:03:09,910 --> 03:03:09,920
question everybody has sort of a sense
 

10629
03:03:09,920 --> 03:03:11,269
question everybody has sort of a sense
of what it means

10630
03:03:11,269 --> 03:03:11,279
of what it means
 

10631
03:03:11,279 --> 03:03:12,469
of what it means
but

10632
03:03:12,469 --> 03:03:12,479
but
 

10633
03:03:12,479 --> 03:03:14,870
but
it's such a hard problem because you run

10634
03:03:14,870 --> 03:03:14,880
it's such a hard problem because you run
 

10635
03:03:14,880 --> 03:03:17,349
it's such a hard problem because you run
into paradoxes quite quickly the more

10636
03:03:17,349 --> 03:03:17,359
into paradoxes quite quickly the more
 

10637
03:03:17,359 --> 03:03:20,710
into paradoxes quite quickly the more
you think about it and that

10638
03:03:20,710 --> 03:03:20,720
you think about it and that
 

10639
03:03:20,720 --> 03:03:22,630
you think about it and that
is exciting also because it makes us

10640
03:03:22,630 --> 03:03:22,640
is exciting also because it makes us
 

10641
03:03:22,640 --> 03:03:25,830
is exciting also because it makes us
think actually there's some

10642
03:03:25,830 --> 03:03:25,840
think actually there's some
 

10643
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:27,990
think actually there's some
there's a big thing that we're missing

10644
03:03:27,990 --> 03:03:28,000
there's a big thing that we're missing
 

10645
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,150
there's a big thing that we're missing
the brain is not just a collection of

10646
03:03:30,150 --> 03:03:30,160
the brain is not just a collection of
 

10647
03:03:30,160 --> 03:03:32,230
the brain is not just a collection of
little tricks there is a big

10648
03:03:32,230 --> 03:03:32,240
little tricks there is a big
 

10649
03:03:32,240 --> 03:03:33,670
little tricks there is a big
big concept so that's your sense of

10650
03:03:33,670 --> 03:03:33,680
big concept so that's your sense of
 

10651
03:03:33,680 --> 03:03:36,710
big concept so that's your sense of
because like a flip side could be with

10652
03:03:36,710 --> 03:03:36,720
because like a flip side could be with
 

10653
03:03:36,720 --> 03:03:38,630
because like a flip side could be with
optogenetics you can

10654
03:03:38,630 --> 03:03:38,640
optogenetics you can
 

10655
03:03:38,640 --> 03:03:40,710
optogenetics you can
there's an engineering question can you

10656
03:03:40,710 --> 03:03:40,720
there's an engineering question can you
 

10657
03:03:40,720 --> 03:03:43,190
there's an engineering question can you
turn consciousness on and off like a

10658
03:03:43,190 --> 03:03:43,200
turn consciousness on and off like a
 

10659
03:03:43,200 --> 03:03:45,670
turn consciousness on and off like a
light switch okay so here here's where

10660
03:03:45,670 --> 03:03:45,680
light switch okay so here here's where
 

10661
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:47,910
light switch okay so here here's where
exactly consciousness frames the problem

10662
03:03:47,910 --> 03:03:47,920
exactly consciousness frames the problem
 

10663
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:49,990
exactly consciousness frames the problem
extremely well and it frames it the

10664
03:03:49,990 --> 03:03:50,000
extremely well and it frames it the
 

10665
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,389
extremely well and it frames it the
following way so i told you earlier that

10666
03:03:52,389 --> 03:03:52,399
following way so i told you earlier that
 

10667
03:03:52,399 --> 03:03:57,670
following way so i told you earlier that
we can stimulate 20 or 25 cells in

10668
03:03:57,670 --> 03:03:57,680
we can stimulate 20 or 25 cells in
 

10669
03:03:57,680 --> 03:03:59,910
we can stimulate 20 or 25 cells in
the visual cortex of a mouse and we can

10670
03:03:59,910 --> 03:03:59,920
the visual cortex of a mouse and we can
 

10671
03:03:59,920 --> 03:04:00,870
the visual cortex of a mouse and we can
make it

10672
03:04:00,870 --> 03:04:00,880
make it
 

10673
03:04:00,880 --> 03:04:03,590
make it
behave and we can make its brain act as

10674
03:04:03,590 --> 03:04:03,600
behave and we can make its brain act as
 

10675
03:04:03,600 --> 03:04:05,190
behave and we can make its brain act as
if it's seeing something that isn't

10676
03:04:05,190 --> 03:04:05,200
if it's seeing something that isn't
 

10677
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:07,110
if it's seeing something that isn't
there we have that level of control now

10678
03:04:07,110 --> 03:04:07,120
there we have that level of control now
 

10679
03:04:07,120 --> 03:04:09,750
there we have that level of control now
we can pick out 25 neurons play an

10680
03:04:09,750 --> 03:04:09,760
we can pick out 25 neurons play an
 

10681
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:10,790
we can pick out 25 neurons play an
activity

10682
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:10,800
activity
 

10683
03:04:10,800 --> 03:04:13,110
activity
in both behavior and in the brain it's

10684
03:04:13,110 --> 03:04:13,120
in both behavior and in the brain it's
 

10685
03:04:13,120 --> 03:04:15,990
in both behavior and in the brain it's
as if it's seeing something specific

10686
03:04:15,990 --> 03:04:16,000
as if it's seeing something specific
 

10687
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:16,950
as if it's seeing something specific
okay

10688
03:04:16,950 --> 03:04:16,960
okay
 

10689
03:04:16,960 --> 03:04:18,550
okay
now let's do a thought experiment you

10690
03:04:18,550 --> 03:04:18,560
now let's do a thought experiment you
 

10691
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:20,870
now let's do a thought experiment you
know a good duncan experiment and let's

10692
03:04:20,870 --> 03:04:20,880
know a good duncan experiment and let's
 

10693
03:04:20,880 --> 03:04:22,630
know a good duncan experiment and let's
play this out

10694
03:04:22,630 --> 03:04:22,640
play this out
 

10695
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:24,469
play this out
let's say we could do the same thing for

10696
03:04:24,469 --> 03:04:24,479
let's say we could do the same thing for
 

10697
03:04:24,479 --> 03:04:26,710
let's say we could do the same thing for
every single neuron in the brain of a

10698
03:04:26,710 --> 03:04:26,720
every single neuron in the brain of a
 

10699
03:04:26,720 --> 03:04:28,710
every single neuron in the brain of a
human being let's say we had total

10700
03:04:28,710 --> 03:04:28,720
human being let's say we had total
 

10701
03:04:28,720 --> 03:04:29,910
human being let's say we had total
control

10702
03:04:29,910 --> 03:04:29,920
control
 

10703
03:04:29,920 --> 03:04:31,750
control
and i could do something like i could

10704
03:04:31,750 --> 03:04:31,760
and i could do something like i could
 

10705
03:04:31,760 --> 03:04:33,110
and i could do something like i could
show you

10706
03:04:33,110 --> 03:04:33,120
show you
 

10707
03:04:33,120 --> 03:04:35,349
show you
a rich deep color red and you could look

10708
03:04:35,349 --> 03:04:35,359
a rich deep color red and you could look
 

10709
03:04:35,359 --> 03:04:36,630
a rich deep color red and you could look
at it and you would be aware that it's

10710
03:04:36,630 --> 03:04:36,640
at it and you would be aware that it's
 

10711
03:04:36,640 --> 03:04:37,750
at it and you would be aware that it's
red but also you might have some

10712
03:04:37,750 --> 03:04:37,760
red but also you might have some
 

10713
03:04:37,760 --> 03:04:39,590
red but also you might have some
feelings about it some something would

10714
03:04:39,590 --> 03:04:39,600
feelings about it some something would
 

10715
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:41,269
feelings about it some something would
be stirred in you some subjective sense

10716
03:04:41,269 --> 03:04:41,279
be stirred in you some subjective sense
 

10717
03:04:41,279 --> 03:04:44,630
be stirred in you some subjective sense
as you looked at that rich color red

10718
03:04:44,630 --> 03:04:44,640
as you looked at that rich color red
 

10719
03:04:44,640 --> 03:04:46,070
as you looked at that rich color red
and then

10720
03:04:46,070 --> 03:04:46,080
and then
 

10721
03:04:46,080 --> 03:04:47,830
and then
i would take away

10722
03:04:47,830 --> 03:04:47,840
i would take away
 

10723
03:04:47,840 --> 03:04:49,510
i would take away
the visual stimulus and i would in this

10724
03:04:49,510 --> 03:04:49,520
the visual stimulus and i would in this
 

10725
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:51,429
the visual stimulus and i would in this
thought experiment i would

10726
03:04:51,429 --> 03:04:51,439
thought experiment i would
 

10727
03:04:51,439 --> 03:04:53,510
thought experiment i would
using some hyperoptogenetics i would

10728
03:04:53,510 --> 03:04:53,520
using some hyperoptogenetics i would
 

10729
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:54,870
using some hyperoptogenetics i would
play in

10730
03:04:54,870 --> 03:04:54,880
play in
 

10731
03:04:54,880 --> 03:04:57,110
play in
exactly the same pattern of activity in

10732
03:04:57,110 --> 03:04:57,120
exactly the same pattern of activity in
 

10733
03:04:57,120 --> 03:04:58,950
exactly the same pattern of activity in
every cell in your brain

10734
03:04:58,950 --> 03:04:58,960
every cell in your brain
 

10735
03:04:58,960 --> 03:05:00,950
every cell in your brain
for as long as it was needed whatever 15

10736
03:05:00,950 --> 03:05:00,960
for as long as it was needed whatever 15
 

10737
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:03,190
for as long as it was needed whatever 15
seconds something like that

10738
03:05:03,190 --> 03:05:03,200
seconds something like that
 

10739
03:05:03,200 --> 03:05:05,990
seconds something like that
that exactly matched

10740
03:05:05,990 --> 03:05:06,000
that exactly matched
 

10741
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,150
that exactly matched
what was going on when you were feeling

10742
03:05:08,150 --> 03:05:08,160
what was going on when you were feeling
 

10743
03:05:08,160 --> 03:05:10,230
what was going on when you were feeling
that inner subjective sense

10744
03:05:10,230 --> 03:05:10,240
that inner subjective sense
 

10745
03:05:10,240 --> 03:05:12,230
that inner subjective sense
okay so in that thought experiment a

10746
03:05:12,230 --> 03:05:12,240
okay so in that thought experiment a
 

10747
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:15,190
okay so in that thought experiment a
question for you is would you

10748
03:05:15,190 --> 03:05:15,200
question for you is would you
 

10749
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:17,590
question for you is would you
be feeling that same inner subjective

10750
03:05:17,590 --> 03:05:17,600
be feeling that same inner subjective
 

10751
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:19,750
be feeling that same inner subjective
sense stimulus is gone every neuron's

10752
03:05:19,750 --> 03:05:19,760
sense stimulus is gone every neuron's
 

10753
03:05:19,760 --> 03:05:20,630
sense stimulus is gone every neuron's
doing the same thing because i'm

10754
03:05:20,630 --> 03:05:20,640
doing the same thing because i'm
 

10755
03:05:20,640 --> 03:05:22,870
doing the same thing because i'm
controlling it

10756
03:05:22,870 --> 03:05:22,880
controlling it
 

10757
03:05:22,880 --> 03:05:25,030
controlling it
there's a philosophical question there

10758
03:05:25,030 --> 03:05:25,040
there's a philosophical question there
 

10759
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:27,750
there's a philosophical question there
i'm if if you ask me specifically i

10760
03:05:27,750 --> 03:05:27,760
i'm if if you ask me specifically i
 

10761
03:05:27,760 --> 03:05:29,190
i'm if if you ask me specifically i
would say yes

10762
03:05:29,190 --> 03:05:29,200
would say yes
 

10763
03:05:29,200 --> 03:05:31,269
would say yes
okay good most people would say that

10764
03:05:31,269 --> 03:05:31,279
okay good most people would say that
 

10765
03:05:31,279 --> 03:05:33,830
okay good most people would say that
because it's hard to say no right it's

10766
03:05:33,830 --> 03:05:33,840
because it's hard to say no right it's
 

10767
03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:35,510
because it's hard to say no right it's
very hard to say if every cell in your

10768
03:05:35,510 --> 03:05:35,520
very hard to say if every cell in your
 

10769
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:38,150
very hard to say if every cell in your
brain is doing what it was doing

10770
03:05:38,150 --> 03:05:38,160
brain is doing what it was doing
 

10771
03:05:38,160 --> 03:05:39,510
brain is doing what it was doing
what what else could be different how

10772
03:05:39,510 --> 03:05:39,520
what what else could be different how
 

10773
03:05:39,520 --> 03:05:42,550
what what else could be different how
could most normal people would say yes

10774
03:05:42,550 --> 03:05:42,560
could most normal people would say yes
 

10775
03:05:42,560 --> 03:05:44,870
could most normal people would say yes
of course philosophers would then

10776
03:05:44,870 --> 03:05:44,880
of course philosophers would then
 

10777
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:47,190
of course philosophers would then
start saying no they're they're the ones

10778
03:05:47,190 --> 03:05:47,200
start saying no they're they're the ones
 

10779
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:49,349
start saying no they're they're the ones
that say

10780
03:05:49,349 --> 03:05:49,359
that say
 

10781
03:05:49,359 --> 03:05:52,550
that say
um i'm i'm going to sort of to parallel

10782
03:05:52,550 --> 03:05:52,560
um i'm i'm going to sort of to parallel
 

10783
03:05:52,560 --> 03:05:53,590
um i'm i'm going to sort of to parallel
and sorry if it's a bit of an

10784
03:05:53,590 --> 03:05:53,600
and sorry if it's a bit of an
 

10785
03:05:53,600 --> 03:05:55,110
and sorry if it's a bit of an
interruption but if there's you know if

10786
03:05:55,110 --> 03:05:55,120
interruption but if there's you know if
 

10787
03:05:55,120 --> 03:05:56,710
interruption but if there's you know if
there's a robot that's conscious in

10788
03:05:56,710 --> 03:05:56,720
there's a robot that's conscious in
 

10789
03:05:56,720 --> 03:05:58,309
there's a robot that's conscious in
front of you

10790
03:05:58,309 --> 03:05:58,319
front of you
 

10791
03:05:58,319 --> 03:06:00,790
front of you
if it appears conscious

10792
03:06:00,790 --> 03:06:00,800
if it appears conscious
 

10793
03:06:00,800 --> 03:06:01,830
if it appears conscious
then

10794
03:06:01,830 --> 03:06:01,840
then
 

10795
03:06:01,840 --> 03:06:04,469
then
it's conscious like to me

10796
03:06:04,469 --> 03:06:04,479
it's conscious like to me
 

10797
03:06:04,479 --> 03:06:07,190
it's conscious like to me
uh of course philosophers again speak up

10798
03:06:07,190 --> 03:06:07,200
uh of course philosophers again speak up
 

10799
03:06:07,200 --> 03:06:08,950
uh of course philosophers again speak up
and say well no how do you know it's

10800
03:06:08,950 --> 03:06:08,960
and say well no how do you know it's
 

10801
03:06:08,960 --> 03:06:10,710
and say well no how do you know it's
conscious well

10802
03:06:10,710 --> 03:06:10,720
conscious well
 

10803
03:06:10,720 --> 03:06:12,230
conscious well
how do you know anything is conscious

10804
03:06:12,230 --> 03:06:12,240
how do you know anything is conscious
 

10805
03:06:12,240 --> 03:06:15,349
how do you know anything is conscious
and sort of as normal humans

10806
03:06:15,349 --> 03:06:15,359
and sort of as normal humans
 

10807
03:06:15,359 --> 03:06:17,429
and sort of as normal humans
we tend to uh

10808
03:06:17,429 --> 03:06:17,439
we tend to uh
 

10809
03:06:17,439 --> 03:06:19,830
we tend to uh
lean on the experience versus some kind

10810
03:06:19,830 --> 03:06:19,840
lean on the experience versus some kind
 

10811
03:06:19,840 --> 03:06:20,550
lean on the experience versus some kind
of

10812
03:06:20,550 --> 03:06:20,560
of
 

10813
03:06:20,560 --> 03:06:22,469
of
philosophical concept

10814
03:06:22,469 --> 03:06:22,479
philosophical concept
 

10815
03:06:22,479 --> 03:06:24,630
philosophical concept
so the great thing about the the what

10816
03:06:24,630 --> 03:06:24,640
so the great thing about the the what
 

10817
03:06:24,640 --> 03:06:26,469
so the great thing about the the what
you just said the the turing test is

10818
03:06:26,469 --> 03:06:26,479
you just said the the turing test is
 

10819
03:06:26,479 --> 03:06:29,190
you just said the the turing test is
it's very practical if it acts conscious

10820
03:06:29,190 --> 03:06:29,200
it's very practical if it acts conscious
 

10821
03:06:29,200 --> 03:06:30,790
it's very practical if it acts conscious
it is conscious

10822
03:06:30,790 --> 03:06:30,800
it is conscious
 

10823
03:06:30,800 --> 03:06:33,750
it is conscious
but i think that's limiting i like the

10824
03:06:33,750 --> 03:06:33,760
but i think that's limiting i like the
 

10825
03:06:33,760 --> 03:06:35,030
but i think that's limiting i like the
the thought experiment i think it's

10826
03:06:35,030 --> 03:06:35,040
the thought experiment i think it's
 

10827
03:06:35,040 --> 03:06:36,710
the thought experiment i think it's
actually more informative and so i'm

10828
03:06:36,710 --> 03:06:36,720
actually more informative and so i'm
 

10829
03:06:36,720 --> 03:06:38,950
actually more informative and so i'm
halfway halfway to the to the conclusion

10830
03:06:38,950 --> 03:06:38,960
halfway halfway to the to the conclusion
 

10831
03:06:38,960 --> 03:06:41,590
halfway halfway to the to the conclusion
there but let's let's let's take it as

10832
03:06:41,590 --> 03:06:41,600
there but let's let's let's take it as
 

10833
03:06:41,600 --> 03:06:43,349
there but let's let's let's take it as
your answer was yes that's that you

10834
03:06:43,349 --> 03:06:43,359
your answer was yes that's that you
 

10835
03:06:43,359 --> 03:06:45,590
your answer was yes that's that you
would be feeling the same thing okay

10836
03:06:45,590 --> 03:06:45,600
would be feeling the same thing okay
 

10837
03:06:45,600 --> 03:06:49,510
would be feeling the same thing okay
now here's where it gets fun

10838
03:06:49,510 --> 03:06:49,520

 

10839
03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:52,870

now that every cell in your brain

10840
03:06:52,870 --> 03:06:52,880
now that every cell in your brain
 

10841
03:06:52,880 --> 03:06:55,990
now that every cell in your brain
is knows what it has to do in the sense

10842
03:06:55,990 --> 03:06:56,000
is knows what it has to do in the sense
 

10843
03:06:56,000 --> 03:07:00,230
is knows what it has to do in the sense
that we know it and we're providing it

10844
03:07:00,230 --> 03:07:00,240

 

10845
03:07:00,240 --> 03:07:02,070

your brain cells don't need to be in

10846
03:07:02,070 --> 03:07:02,080
your brain cells don't need to be in
 

10847
03:07:02,080 --> 03:07:04,550
your brain cells don't need to be in
your head anymore at all right

10848
03:07:04,550 --> 03:07:04,560
your head anymore at all right
 

10849
03:07:04,560 --> 03:07:05,990
your head anymore at all right
the only reason they're next to each

10850
03:07:05,990 --> 03:07:06,000
the only reason they're next to each
 

10851
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:07,590
the only reason they're next to each
other the only reason they're wired

10852
03:07:07,590 --> 03:07:07,600
other the only reason they're wired
 

10853
03:07:07,600 --> 03:07:09,990
other the only reason they're wired
together is to affect each other to

10854
03:07:09,990 --> 03:07:10,000
together is to affect each other to
 

10855
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,070
together is to affect each other to
stimulate or inhibit each other

10856
03:07:12,070 --> 03:07:12,080
stimulate or inhibit each other
 

10857
03:07:12,080 --> 03:07:14,070
stimulate or inhibit each other
but we don't need that anymore because

10858
03:07:14,070 --> 03:07:14,080
but we don't need that anymore because
 

10859
03:07:14,080 --> 03:07:16,389
but we don't need that anymore because
optogenetically we're providing that

10860
03:07:16,389 --> 03:07:16,399
optogenetically we're providing that
 

10861
03:07:16,399 --> 03:07:17,910
optogenetically we're providing that
activity pattern for as long as needed

10862
03:07:17,910 --> 03:07:17,920
activity pattern for as long as needed
 

10863
03:07:17,920 --> 03:07:19,110
activity pattern for as long as needed
we're providing the effect of the

10864
03:07:19,110 --> 03:07:19,120
we're providing the effect of the
 

10865
03:07:19,120 --> 03:07:20,469
we're providing the effect of the
communication they don't need to be

10866
03:07:20,469 --> 03:07:20,479
communication they don't need to be
 

10867
03:07:20,479 --> 03:07:22,389
communication they don't need to be
connected anymore

10868
03:07:22,389 --> 03:07:22,399
connected anymore
 

10869
03:07:22,399 --> 03:07:24,309
connected anymore
they don't even need to be in your head

10870
03:07:24,309 --> 03:07:24,319
they don't even need to be in your head
 

10871
03:07:24,319 --> 03:07:26,710
they don't even need to be in your head
i could spread your neurons

10872
03:07:26,710 --> 03:07:26,720
i could spread your neurons
 

10873
03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:28,389
i could spread your neurons
all over the continent all over the

10874

all over the continent all over the
 

10875
03:07:28,399 --> 03:07:30,070
all over the continent all over the
galaxy

galaxy
 

10877
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:32,550
galaxy
and i could still provide

10878
03:07:32,550 --> 03:07:32,560
and i could still provide
 

10879
03:07:32,560 --> 03:07:34,870
and i could still provide
the same stimulus pattern over 10 or 15

10880
03:07:34,870 --> 03:07:34,880
the same stimulus pattern over 10 or 15
 

10881
03:07:34,880 --> 03:07:36,870
the same stimulus pattern over 10 or 15
seconds to all those neurons and

10882
03:07:36,870 --> 03:07:36,880
seconds to all those neurons and
 

10883
03:07:36,880 --> 03:07:40,230
seconds to all those neurons and
somewhere lex friedman would be

10884
03:07:40,230 --> 03:07:40,240
somewhere lex friedman would be
 

10885
03:07:40,240 --> 03:07:42,389
somewhere lex friedman would be
would have to be even though no longer

10886
03:07:42,389 --> 03:07:42,399
would have to be even though no longer
 

10887
03:07:42,399 --> 03:07:43,910
would have to be even though no longer
existing as a

10888
03:07:43,910 --> 03:07:43,920
existing as a
 

10889
03:07:43,920 --> 03:07:46,309
existing as a
physical object anymore would be feeling

10890
03:07:46,309 --> 03:07:46,319
physical object anymore would be feeling
 

10891
03:07:46,319 --> 03:07:48,070
physical object anymore would be feeling
that subjective feeling

10892
03:07:48,070 --> 03:07:48,080
that subjective feeling
 

10893
03:07:48,080 --> 03:07:49,750
that subjective feeling
and it's inescapable because it's

10894
03:07:49,750 --> 03:07:49,760
and it's inescapable because it's
 

10895
03:07:49,760 --> 03:07:51,030
and it's inescapable because it's
exactly the same as the previous

10896
03:07:51,030 --> 03:07:51,040
exactly the same as the previous
 

10897
03:07:51,040 --> 03:07:53,349
exactly the same as the previous
situation all the neurons have to be uh

10898
03:07:53,349 --> 03:07:53,359
situation all the neurons have to be uh
 

10899
03:07:53,359 --> 03:07:55,190
situation all the neurons have to be uh
spatially

10900
03:07:55,190 --> 03:07:55,200
spatially
 

10901
03:07:55,200 --> 03:07:56,950
spatially
like the locality constraint they have

10902
03:07:56,950 --> 03:07:56,960
like the locality constraint they have
 

10903
03:07:56,960 --> 03:07:59,910
like the locality constraint they have
to be spatially close to each other

10904
03:07:59,910 --> 03:07:59,920
to be spatially close to each other
 

10905
03:07:59,920 --> 03:08:01,030
to be spatially close to each other
uh

10906
03:08:01,030 --> 03:08:01,040
uh
 

10907
03:08:01,040 --> 03:08:04,309
uh
and you talk about light opto which is

10908
03:08:04,309 --> 03:08:04,319
and you talk about light opto which is
 

10909
03:08:04,319 --> 03:08:07,429
and you talk about light opto which is
funny because you know light

10910
03:08:07,429 --> 03:08:07,439
funny because you know light
 

10911
03:08:07,439 --> 03:08:09,510
funny because you know light
is the fastest traveling thing that we

10912
03:08:09,510 --> 03:08:09,520
is the fastest traveling thing that we
 

10913
03:08:09,520 --> 03:08:10,630
is the fastest traveling thing that we
know of

10914
03:08:10,630 --> 03:08:10,640
know of
 

10915
03:08:10,640 --> 03:08:12,389
know of
well maybe let's not put them all over

10916
03:08:12,389 --> 03:08:12,399
well maybe let's not put them all over
 

10917
03:08:12,399 --> 03:08:13,429
well maybe let's not put them all over
the universe because we might get

10918
03:08:13,429 --> 03:08:13,439
the universe because we might get
 

10919
03:08:13,439 --> 03:08:14,870
the universe because we might get
relativistic problems then let's let's

10920
03:08:14,870 --> 03:08:14,880
relativistic problems then let's let's
 

10921
03:08:14,880 --> 03:08:16,309
relativistic problems then let's let's
just keep them on let's keep all your

10922
03:08:16,309 --> 03:08:16,319
just keep them on let's keep all your
 

10923
03:08:16,319 --> 03:08:17,830
just keep them on let's keep all your
neurons let's spread them over north

10924
03:08:17,830 --> 03:08:17,840
neurons let's spread them over north
 

10925
03:08:17,840 --> 03:08:20,150
neurons let's spread them over north
america okay and let's let's play them

10926
03:08:20,150 --> 03:08:20,160
america okay and let's let's play them
 

10927
03:08:20,160 --> 03:08:20,950
america okay and let's let's play them
out

10928
03:08:20,950 --> 03:08:20,960
out
 

10929
03:08:20,960 --> 03:08:22,550
out
same pattern of activity

10930
03:08:22,550 --> 03:08:22,560
same pattern of activity
 

10931
03:08:22,560 --> 03:08:24,230
same pattern of activity
and right it seems absurd right there's

10932
03:08:24,230 --> 03:08:24,240
and right it seems absurd right there's
 

10933
03:08:24,240 --> 03:08:26,469
and right it seems absurd right there's
no way that could be true there's no way

10934
03:08:26,469 --> 03:08:26,479
no way that could be true there's no way
 

10935
03:08:26,479 --> 03:08:28,710
no way that could be true there's no way
that that that lex would be feeling that

10936
03:08:28,710 --> 03:08:28,720
that that that lex would be feeling that
 

10937
03:08:28,720 --> 03:08:30,309
that that that lex would be feeling that
internal sense if his neurons were

10938
03:08:30,309 --> 03:08:30,319
internal sense if his neurons were
 

10939
03:08:30,319 --> 03:08:32,630
internal sense if his neurons were
spread all over north america

10940
03:08:32,630 --> 03:08:32,640
spread all over north america
 

10941
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:34,230
spread all over north america
and yet it's exactly the same as the

10942
03:08:34,230 --> 03:08:34,240
and yet it's exactly the same as the
 

10943
03:08:34,240 --> 03:08:36,550
and yet it's exactly the same as the
previous situation where you said sure

10944
03:08:36,550 --> 03:08:36,560
previous situation where you said sure
 

10945
03:08:36,560 --> 03:08:38,309
previous situation where you said sure
wow so we've got a paradox and it and

10946
03:08:38,309 --> 03:08:38,319
wow so we've got a paradox and it and
 

10947
03:08:38,319 --> 03:08:39,910
wow so we've got a paradox and it and
this is what makes people say paradox

10948
03:08:39,910 --> 03:08:39,920
this is what makes people say paradox
 

10949
03:08:39,920 --> 03:08:41,110
this is what makes people say paradox
though sorry

10950
03:08:41,110 --> 03:08:41,120
though sorry
 

10951
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:42,309
though sorry
yeah yeah maybe products is the wrong

10952
03:08:42,309 --> 03:08:42,319
yeah yeah maybe products is the wrong
 

10953
03:08:42,319 --> 03:08:43,830
yeah yeah maybe products is the wrong
word we got a problem

10954
03:08:43,830 --> 03:08:43,840
word we got a problem
 

10955
03:08:43,840 --> 03:08:45,990
word we got a problem
we got a problem because it reveals

10956
03:08:45,990 --> 03:08:46,000
we got a problem because it reveals
 

10957
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:47,030
we got a problem because it reveals
that

10958
03:08:47,030 --> 03:08:47,040
that
 

10959
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:48,469
that
there's something big

10960
03:08:48,469 --> 03:08:48,479
there's something big
 

10961
03:08:48,479 --> 03:08:49,349
there's something big
about

10962
03:08:49,349 --> 03:08:49,359
about
 

10963
03:08:49,359 --> 03:08:51,030
about
those that internal subjective state

10964
03:08:51,030 --> 03:08:51,040
those that internal subjective state
 

10965
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:53,269
those that internal subjective state
that we we're not explaining and we

10966
03:08:53,269 --> 03:08:53,279
that we we're not explaining and we
 

10967
03:08:53,279 --> 03:08:54,550
that we we're not explaining and we
don't really have a hope of explaining

10968
03:08:54,550 --> 03:08:54,560
don't really have a hope of explaining
 

10969
03:08:54,560 --> 03:08:56,550
don't really have a hope of explaining
in the near future but don't you think

10970
03:08:56,550 --> 03:08:56,560
in the near future but don't you think
 

10971
03:08:56,560 --> 03:08:58,469
in the near future but don't you think
we would still have that

10972
03:08:58,469 --> 03:08:58,479
we would still have that
 

10973
03:08:58,479 --> 03:09:00,150
we would still have that
it's just the word internal loses

10974
03:09:00,150 --> 03:09:00,160
it's just the word internal loses
 

10975
03:09:00,160 --> 03:09:01,830
it's just the word internal loses
meaning but don't you think we still

10976
03:09:01,830 --> 03:09:01,840
meaning but don't you think we still
 

10977
03:09:01,840 --> 03:09:04,230
meaning but don't you think we still
have that internal subjective state

10978
03:09:04,230 --> 03:09:04,240
have that internal subjective state
 

10979
03:09:04,240 --> 03:09:05,269
have that internal subjective state
where's

10980
03:09:05,269 --> 03:09:05,279
where's
 

10981
03:09:05,279 --> 03:09:06,230
where's
uh

10982
03:09:06,230 --> 03:09:06,240
uh
 

10983
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:08,630
uh
if not then where the heck is the magic

10984
03:09:08,630 --> 03:09:08,640
if not then where the heck is the magic
 

10985
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:10,630
if not then where the heck is the magic
coming from

10986
03:09:10,630 --> 03:09:10,640
coming from
 

10987
03:09:10,640 --> 03:09:13,349
coming from
okay well i just think

10988
03:09:13,349 --> 03:09:13,359
okay well i just think
 

10989
03:09:13,359 --> 03:09:16,710
okay well i just think
i think they're one one of the problems

10990
03:09:16,710 --> 03:09:16,720
i think they're one one of the problems
 

10991
03:09:16,720 --> 03:09:19,030
i think they're one one of the problems
that i think we need to let go of

10992
03:09:19,030 --> 03:09:19,040
that i think we need to let go of
 

10993
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:21,429
that i think we need to let go of
is we tend to

10994
03:09:21,429 --> 03:09:21,439
is we tend to
 

10995
03:09:21,439 --> 03:09:22,710
is we tend to
outside of the experience of

10996
03:09:22,710 --> 03:09:22,720
outside of the experience of
 

10997
03:09:22,720 --> 03:09:23,990
outside of the experience of
consciousness the heart problem of

10998
03:09:23,990 --> 03:09:24,000
consciousness the heart problem of
 

10999
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,590
consciousness the heart problem of
consciousness

11000
03:09:25,590 --> 03:09:25,600
consciousness
 

11001
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:27,349
consciousness
we tend to think that we individual

11002
03:09:27,349 --> 03:09:27,359
we tend to think that we individual
 

11003
03:09:27,359 --> 03:09:30,309
we tend to think that we individual
humans are really special

11004
03:09:30,309 --> 03:09:30,319
humans are really special
 

11005
03:09:30,319 --> 03:09:32,550
humans are really special
not the subjective experience but the

11006
03:09:32,550 --> 03:09:32,560
not the subjective experience but the
 

11007
03:09:32,560 --> 03:09:34,630
not the subjective experience but the
entirety of it like the body

11008
03:09:34,630 --> 03:09:34,640
entirety of it like the body
 

11009
03:09:34,640 --> 03:09:38,070
entirety of it like the body
that contains the things so the local

11010
03:09:38,070 --> 03:09:38,080
that contains the things so the local
 

11011
03:09:38,080 --> 03:09:40,870
that contains the things so the local
the the constraint of all the stuff has

11012
03:09:40,870 --> 03:09:40,880
the the constraint of all the stuff has
 

11013
03:09:40,880 --> 03:09:45,190
the the constraint of all the stuff has
to be together and it's all mine

11014
03:09:45,190 --> 03:09:45,200
to be together and it's all mine
 

11015
03:09:45,200 --> 03:09:46,630
to be together and it's all mine
that's a very

11016
03:09:46,630 --> 03:09:46,640
that's a very
 

11017
03:09:46,640 --> 03:09:48,550
that's a very
i don't know if that has anything to do

11018
03:09:48,550 --> 03:09:48,560
i don't know if that has anything to do
 

11019
03:09:48,560 --> 03:09:51,030
i don't know if that has anything to do
with the mechanisms that are creating

11020
03:09:51,030 --> 03:09:51,040
with the mechanisms that are creating
 

11021
03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:51,830
with the mechanisms that are creating
this

11022
03:09:51,830 --> 03:09:51,840
this
 

11023
03:09:51,840 --> 03:09:55,349
this
so i and in fact one really nice way

11024
03:09:55,349 --> 03:09:55,359
so i and in fact one really nice way
 

11025
03:09:55,359 --> 03:09:58,710
so i and in fact one really nice way
to break through that is to

11026
03:09:58,710 --> 03:09:58,720
to break through that is to
 

11027
03:09:58,720 --> 03:10:02,070
to break through that is to
either achieve either observe or create

11028
03:10:02,070 --> 03:10:02,080
either achieve either observe or create
 

11029
03:10:02,080 --> 03:10:04,469
either achieve either observe or create
consciousness that spans

multiple organisms
 

11033
03:10:07,279 --> 03:10:10,630
multiple organisms
sort of so like that say it's not

11034
03:10:10,630 --> 03:10:10,640
sort of so like that say it's not
 

11035
03:10:10,640 --> 03:10:13,990
sort of so like that say it's not
it's not an organism-dependent

11036
03:10:13,990 --> 03:10:14,000
it's not an organism-dependent
 

11037
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:17,349
it's not an organism-dependent
uh phenomena that the phenomena can

03:10:17,349 --> 03:10:17,359
uh phenomena that the phenomena can
 

11039
03:10:17,359 --> 03:10:19,269
uh phenomena that the phenomena can
that's just a peculiar way it has

11040
03:10:19,269 --> 03:10:19,279
that's just a peculiar way it has
 

11041
03:10:19,279 --> 03:10:20,550
that's just a peculiar way it has

know why that would be the case that

03:11:00,550 --> 03:11:00,560
know why that would be the case that

03:11:08,080 --> 03:11:09,110
unanswered question in the field is is
what is it

11092
03:11:09,110 --> 03:11:09,120
what is it
 

11093
03:11:09,120 --> 03:11:10,389
what is it
that binds

that binds
 

11095
03:11:10,399 --> 03:11:11,990
that binds
the activity of neurons together so they

11096
03:11:11,990 --> 03:11:12,000
the activity of neurons together so they
 

11097
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,389
the activity of neurons together so they
can form a joint representation and

11098
03:11:14,389 --> 03:11:14,399
can form a joint representation and
 

11099
03:11:14,399 --> 03:11:15,510
can form a joint representation and
actually this comes back to the

actually this comes back to the
 

11101
03:11:15,520 --> 03:11:17,429
actually this comes back to the

we used optogenetics to

11124
03:11:39,590 --> 03:11:39,600
we used optogenetics to
 

11125
03:11:39,600 --> 03:11:42,389
we used optogenetics to
drive this rhythm that ketamine and pcp

cause in retrospinal cortex and we got
 

11129
03:11:44,239 --> 03:11:45,510
cause in retrospinal cortex and we got
different parts

11130
03:11:45,510 --> 03:11:45,520
different parts

03:11:49,269 --> 03:11:49,279
they were active
 

11135
03:11:49,279 --> 03:11:51,590
they were active
never able to be active at the same time

11136

03:11:57,670 --> 03:11:57,680
and so we've got a toehold into these
 

11143
03:11:57,680 --> 03:11:59,750
and so we've got a toehold into these
questions we don't have the answers but

11144
03:11:59,750 --> 03:11:59,760
questions we don't have the answers but

um that to create this certain degrees

11168
03:12:30,790 --> 03:12:30,800
um that to create this certain degrees
 

11169
03:12:30,800 --> 03:12:33,110
um that to create this certain degrees
of consciousness decreases subjectivity

11170

of consciousness decreases subjectivity
 

11171
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:34,469
of consciousness decreases subjectivity
and thereby

11172
03:12:34,469 --> 03:12:34,479
and thereby
 

11173
03:12:34,479 --> 03:12:37,510
and thereby
understand what is consciousness

11174
03:12:37,510 --> 03:12:37,520
understand what is consciousness
 

11175
03:12:37,520 --> 03:12:38,229
understand what is consciousness
but

11176
03:12:38,229 --> 03:12:38,239
but
 

11177
03:12:38,239 --> 03:12:39,750

03:12:43,349 --> 03:12:43,359
that and here's the here's the challenge
 

11183
03:12:43,359 --> 03:12:44,070
that and here's the here's the challenge
is

11184
03:12:44,070 --> 03:12:44,080
is
 

11185
03:12:44,080 --> 03:12:45,510
is
the nice thing about the the thought

03:12:45,510 --> 03:12:45,520
the nice thing about the the thought
 

11187
03:12:45,520 --> 03:12:49,830
the nice thing about the the thought
experiment is it it kind of highlights

11188
03:12:49,830 --> 03:12:49,840
experiment is it it kind of highlights
 

11189
03:12:49,840 --> 03:12:53,750
experiment is it it kind of highlights
that we're going to hit a point where

11191
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:54,870

we're

03:12:54,870 --> 03:12:54,880
we're
 

11193
03:12:54,880 --> 03:12:56,790
we're
addressing some very very fundamental

addressing some very very fundamental
questions what what

questions what what
what allows the activity of

03:13:10,710 --> 03:13:10,720
maybe the
 

11209
03:13:10,720 --> 03:13:12,229
maybe the
one of the deepest remaining questions

11210
03:13:12,229 --> 03:13:12,239
one of the deepest remaining questions
 

11211
03:13:12,239 --> 03:13:14,469
one of the deepest remaining questions
in neuroscience is is what allows

11212
03:13:14,469 --> 03:13:14,479
in neuroscience is is what allows
 

11213
03:13:14,479 --> 03:13:17,190
in neuroscience is is what allows
activity patterns to become

11214
03:13:17,190 --> 03:13:17,200
activity patterns to become
 

11215
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:18,710
activity patterns to become
relevant to each other

11216
03:13:18,710 --> 03:13:18,720
relevant to each other
 

11217
03:13:18,720 --> 03:13:21,030
relevant to each other
do they have to be in sync temporarily

11218
03:13:21,030 --> 03:13:21,040
do they have to be in sync temporarily
 

11219
03:13:21,040 --> 03:13:23,750
do they have to be in sync temporarily
do they need to be

11220
03:13:23,750 --> 03:13:23,760
do they need to be
 

11221
03:13:23,760 --> 03:13:25,349
do they need to be
is there some other

11222
03:13:25,349 --> 03:13:25,359
is there some other
 

11223
03:13:25,359 --> 03:13:26,950
is there some other
quality that we don't know about that

11224
03:13:26,950 --> 03:13:26,960
quality that we don't know about that
 

11225
03:13:26,960 --> 03:13:29,110
quality that we don't know about that
also needs to be present to allow cells

11226
03:13:29,110 --> 03:13:29,120
also needs to be present to allow cells
 

11227
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:30,710
also needs to be present to allow cells
to to fuse together into a joint

11228
03:13:30,710 --> 03:13:30,720
to to fuse together into a joint
 

11229
03:13:30,720 --> 03:13:32,070
to to fuse together into a joint
representation

11230
03:13:32,070 --> 03:13:32,080
representation
 

11231
03:13:32,080 --> 03:13:34,950
representation
just just so i understand because it uh

11232
03:13:34,950 --> 03:13:34,960
just just so i understand because it uh
 

11233
03:13:34,960 --> 03:13:36,950
just just so i understand because it uh
it feels

11234
03:13:36,950 --> 03:13:36,960
it feels
 

11235
03:13:36,960 --> 03:13:40,870
it feels
close to some very very deep idea

11236
03:13:40,870 --> 03:13:40,880
close to some very very deep idea
 

11237
03:13:40,880 --> 03:13:43,030
close to some very very deep idea
so there's a bunch of semi-distributed

11238
03:13:43,030 --> 03:13:43,040
so there's a bunch of semi-distributed
 

11239
03:13:43,040 --> 03:13:45,990
so there's a bunch of semi-distributed
signals going on in the brain

11240
03:13:45,990 --> 03:13:46,000
signals going on in the brain
 

11241
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:47,590
signals going on in the brain
and

11242
03:13:47,590 --> 03:13:47,600
and
 

11243
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:50,150
and
you're saying there could be

11244
03:13:50,150 --> 03:13:50,160
you're saying there could be
 

11245
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:52,469
you're saying there could be
something like a theory of everything if

11246
03:13:52,469 --> 03:13:52,479
something like a theory of everything if
 

11247
03:13:52,479 --> 03:13:56,550
something like a theory of everything if
one to exist is to understand why how

11248
03:13:56,550 --> 03:13:56,560
one to exist is to understand why how
 

11249
03:13:56,560 --> 03:14:00,550
one to exist is to understand why how
and why signals close to each other

11250
03:14:00,550 --> 03:14:00,560
and why signals close to each other
 

11251
03:14:00,560 --> 03:14:03,910
and why signals close to each other
start becoming

11252
03:14:03,910 --> 03:14:03,920

 

11253
03:14:03,920 --> 03:14:06,070

relevant to each other that's right

11254
03:14:06,070 --> 03:14:06,080
relevant to each other that's right
 

11255
03:14:06,080 --> 03:14:08,830
relevant to each other that's right
that's right as part of some very much

11256
03:14:08,830 --> 03:14:08,840
that's right as part of some very much
 

11257
03:14:08,840 --> 03:14:11,830
that's right as part of some very much
bigger signal that they're producing

11258
03:14:11,830 --> 03:14:11,840
bigger signal that they're producing
 

11259
03:14:11,840 --> 03:14:14,070
bigger signal that they're producing
that's right how they coordinate

11260
03:14:14,070 --> 03:14:14,080
that's right how they coordinate
 

11261
03:14:14,080 --> 03:14:15,429
that's right how they coordinate
essentially

11262
03:14:15,429 --> 03:14:15,439
essentially
 

11263
03:14:15,439 --> 03:14:16,710
essentially
um

11264
03:14:16,710 --> 03:14:16,720
um
 

11265
03:14:16,720 --> 03:14:18,550
um
because it's very distributed i mean

11266
03:14:18,550 --> 03:14:18,560
because it's very distributed i mean
 

11267
03:14:18,560 --> 03:14:20,469
because it's very distributed i mean
that's a kind of

11268
03:14:20,469 --> 03:14:20,479
that's a kind of
 

11269
03:14:20,479 --> 03:14:23,349
that's a kind of
within a distributed system how is order

11270
03:14:23,349 --> 03:14:23,359
within a distributed system how is order
 

11271
03:14:23,359 --> 03:14:25,830
within a distributed system how is order
achieved

11272
03:14:25,830 --> 03:14:25,840
achieved
 

11273
03:14:25,840 --> 03:14:27,670
achieved
and this is a very specific kind of

11274
03:14:27,670 --> 03:14:27,680
and this is a very specific kind of
 

11275
03:14:27,680 --> 03:14:29,990
and this is a very specific kind of
distributive system that is one of the

11276
03:14:29,990 --> 03:14:30,000
distributive system that is one of the
 

11277
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:32,389
distributive system that is one of the
most intelligent that we're aware of

11278
03:14:32,389 --> 03:14:32,399
most intelligent that we're aware of
 

11279
03:14:32,399 --> 03:14:34,710
most intelligent that we're aware of
in the known universe

11280
03:14:34,710 --> 03:14:34,720
in the known universe
 

11281
03:14:34,720 --> 03:14:38,150
in the known universe
and that would maybe be something also

11282
03:14:38,150 --> 03:14:38,160
and that would maybe be something also
 

11283
03:14:38,160 --> 03:14:39,670
and that would maybe be something also
an understanding of the the full

an understanding of the the full

that this kind of coordination how does

03:14:44,720 --> 03:14:46,070
that this kind of coordination how does

how do they begin to form a big picture
 

11297
03:14:51,600 --> 03:14:53,910
how do they begin to form a big picture
that we see as a human experience

that we see as a human experience
 

11299
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:55,590
that we see as a human experience
that's really really interesting so

and the brain wide resolution will be
 

11327
03:15:19,200 --> 03:15:21,269
and the brain wide resolution will be
critical if you lose touch with either i

11333
03:15:24,319 --> 03:15:25,190

03:15:34,790 --> 03:15:34,800
and meet in the middle
 

11345
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:35,910

do you think you'll see it in your

03:15:35,910 --> 03:15:35,920
do you think you'll see it in your
 

11347
03:15:35,920 --> 03:15:38,309
do you think you'll see it in your
lifetime a major breakthrough in that

11348
03:15:38,309 --> 03:15:38,319
lifetime a major breakthrough in that

11351
03:15:41,359 --> 03:15:42,950

i'm uh it's very hard to predict what

11352
03:15:42,950 --> 03:15:42,960
i'm uh it's very hard to predict what
 

11353
03:15:42,960 --> 03:15:44,550
i'm uh it's very hard to predict what
will happen with with big things like

11354
03:15:44,550 --> 03:15:44,560
will happen with with big things like
 

11355
03:15:44,560 --> 03:15:45,590
will happen with with big things like
this

11356
03:15:45,590 --> 03:15:45,600
this
 

11357
03:15:45,600 --> 03:15:47,349
this
if we don't get there there'll be plenty

11358
03:15:47,349 --> 03:15:47,359
if we don't get there there'll be plenty
 

11359
03:15:47,359 --> 03:15:50,710
if we don't get there there'll be plenty
of other exciting stuff so it's okay

11360
03:15:50,710 --> 03:15:50,720
of other exciting stuff so it's okay
 

11361
03:15:50,720 --> 03:15:52,790
of other exciting stuff so it's okay
but the other aspect of this whole thing

11362
03:15:52,790 --> 03:15:52,800
but the other aspect of this whole thing
 

11363
03:15:52,800 --> 03:15:55,750
but the other aspect of this whole thing
is that your life is pretty short

11364
03:15:55,750 --> 03:15:55,760
is that your life is pretty short
 

11365
03:15:55,760 --> 03:15:57,750
is that your life is pretty short
that's true so first of all you can die

11366
03:15:57,750 --> 03:15:57,760
that's true so first of all you can die
 

11367
03:15:57,760 --> 03:15:59,269
that's true so first of all you can die

what's the why of biology
 

11459
03:17:44,319 --> 03:17:45,830
what's the why of biology
what does it want from us why are all

11460

these cells very busy
 

11463
03:17:47,840 --> 03:17:49,590
these cells very busy
putting together an organism that seems

you know
who's the designer and

11520
03:18:39,830 --> 03:18:39,840
who's the designer and
 

11521
03:18:39,840 --> 03:18:41,910
who's the designer and
what were they up to

11522

and
how hard is it do you have to build the

11526
03:18:44,309 --> 03:18:44,319
how hard is it do you have to build the
 

11527
03:18:44,319 --> 03:18:45,990
how hard is it do you have to build the
whole universe and does the design even

11528
03:18:45,990 --> 03:18:46,000
whole universe and does the design even
 

11529
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,229
whole universe and does the design even
know what the hell they're doing because

11530
03:18:48,229 --> 03:18:48,239
know what the hell they're doing because
 

11531
03:18:48,239 --> 03:18:49,510
know what the hell they're doing because
uh

11532
03:18:49,510 --> 03:18:49,520
uh
 

11533
03:18:49,520 --> 03:18:51,190
uh
you know maybe the designer built

11534
03:18:51,190 --> 03:18:51,200
you know maybe the designer built
 

11535
03:18:51,200 --> 03:18:54,229
you know maybe the designer built
humorous to find out

11536
03:18:54,229 --> 03:18:54,239
humorous to find out
 

11537
03:18:54,239 --> 03:18:56,389
humorous to find out
about themselves

11538
03:18:56,389 --> 03:18:56,399
about themselves
 

11539
03:18:56,399 --> 03:18:58,630
about themselves
that's what i would do like if i had the

11540
03:18:58,630 --> 03:18:58,640
that's what i would do like if i had the
 

11541
03:18:58,640 --> 03:19:00,550
that's what i would do like if i had the
power to build clones

11542
03:19:00,550 --> 03:19:00,560
power to build clones
 

11543
03:19:00,560 --> 03:19:02,790
power to build clones
i'll build a lot of clones and i'll get

11544
03:19:02,790 --> 03:19:02,800
i'll build a lot of clones and i'll get
 

11545
03:19:02,800 --> 03:19:04,710
i'll build a lot of clones and i'll get
them into different trouble

11546
03:19:04,710 --> 03:19:04,720
them into different trouble
 

11547
03:19:04,720 --> 03:19:06,790
them into different trouble
to understand

11548
03:19:06,790 --> 03:19:06,800
to understand
 

11549
03:19:06,800 --> 03:19:09,269
to understand
like what am i design what's this body

11550
03:19:09,269 --> 03:19:09,279
like what am i design what's this body
 

11551
03:19:09,279 --> 03:19:11,590
like what am i design what's this body
designed to do how far can i go that way

11552
03:19:11,590 --> 03:19:11,600
designed to do how far can i go that way
 

11553
03:19:11,600 --> 03:19:12,790
designed to do how far can i go that way
exactly

11554
03:19:12,790 --> 03:19:12,800
exactly
 

11555
03:19:12,800 --> 03:19:14,790
exactly
and then and i dissociate myself

11556
03:19:14,790 --> 03:19:14,800
and then and i dissociate myself
 

11557
03:19:14,800 --> 03:19:17,269
and then and i dissociate myself
completely from having anybody to know

11558
03:19:17,269 --> 03:19:17,279
completely from having anybody to know
 

11559
03:19:17,279 --> 03:19:19,830
completely from having anybody to know
like that i know that person that's good

11560
03:19:19,830 --> 03:19:19,840
like that i know that person that's good
 

11561
03:19:19,840 --> 03:19:21,429
like that i know that person that's good
i mean i suppose you could do that in a

11562
03:19:21,429 --> 03:19:21,439
i mean i suppose you could do that in a
 

11563
03:19:21,439 --> 03:19:24,870
i mean i suppose you could do that in a
single person's body but dissociation

11564
03:19:24,870 --> 03:19:24,880
single person's body but dissociation
 

11565
03:19:24,880 --> 03:19:27,110
single person's body but dissociation
you can you could yeah

11566
03:19:27,110 --> 03:19:27,120
you can you could yeah
 

11567
03:19:27,120 --> 03:19:30,070
you can you could yeah
well but i do wonder what

11568
03:19:30,070 --> 03:19:30,080
well but i do wonder what
 

11569
03:19:30,080 --> 03:19:32,469
well but i do wonder what
if you if you look at earth

11570
03:19:32,469 --> 03:19:32,479
if you if you look at earth
 

11571
03:19:32,479 --> 03:19:33,830
if you if you look at earth
as a collection of humans as the

11572
03:19:33,830 --> 03:19:33,840
as a collection of humans as the
 

11573
03:19:33,840 --> 03:19:36,070
as a collection of humans as the
collection of biological organisms it

11574
03:19:36,070 --> 03:19:36,080
collection of biological organisms it
 

11575
03:19:36,080 --> 03:19:40,389
collection of biological organisms it
seems that we're busy doing something

11576
03:19:40,389 --> 03:19:40,399
seems that we're busy doing something
 

11577
03:19:40,399 --> 03:19:42,630
seems that we're busy doing something
and

11578
03:19:42,630 --> 03:19:42,640
and
 

11579
03:19:42,640 --> 03:19:44,710
and
it just seems too beautiful and too

11580
03:19:44,710 --> 03:19:44,720
it just seems too beautiful and too
 

11581
03:19:44,720 --> 03:19:49,590
it just seems too beautiful and too
special to be a random

11582
03:19:49,590 --> 03:19:49,600

 

11583
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:51,510

a random experiment

11584
03:19:51,510 --> 03:19:51,520
a random experiment
 

11585
03:19:51,520 --> 03:19:54,070
a random experiment
it seems like it's an experiment that's

11586
03:19:54,070 --> 03:19:54,080
it seems like it's an experiment that's
 

11587
03:19:54,080 --> 03:19:56,870
it seems like it's an experiment that's
cleverly designed

11588
03:19:56,870 --> 03:19:56,880
cleverly designed
 

11589
03:19:56,880 --> 03:19:57,990
cleverly designed
that's right

11590
03:19:57,990 --> 03:19:58,000
that's right
 

11591
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:01,510
that's right
by by some forces of nature that are

11592
03:20:01,510 --> 03:20:01,520
by by some forces of nature that are
 

11593
03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:03,750
by by some forces of nature that are
beyond our current understanding and

11594
03:20:03,750 --> 03:20:03,760
beyond our current understanding and
 

11595
03:20:03,760 --> 03:20:05,590
beyond our current understanding and
maybe that's part of our design is to

11596
03:20:05,590 --> 03:20:05,600
maybe that's part of our design is to
 

11597
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:07,429
maybe that's part of our design is to
keep asking why he said answer i'm not

11598
03:20:07,429 --> 03:20:07,439
keep asking why he said answer i'm not
 

11599
03:20:07,439 --> 03:20:09,510
keep asking why he said answer i'm not
sure that's part of the design

11600
03:20:09,510 --> 03:20:09,520
sure that's part of the design
 

11601
03:20:09,520 --> 03:20:11,190
sure that's part of the design
the answer

11602
03:20:11,190 --> 03:20:11,200
the answer
 

11603
03:20:11,200 --> 03:20:13,830
the answer
no i think we're given just the

11604
03:20:13,830 --> 03:20:13,840
no i think we're given just the
 

11605

no i think we're given just the

capability that

11608
03:20:17,349 --> 03:20:17,359
capability that
 

11609
03:20:17,359 --> 03:20:20,150
capability that
we know how to long to to find the

11610
03:20:20,150 --> 03:20:20,160
we know how to long to to find the
 

11611
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:22,790
we know how to long to to find the
answer and we lack the ability to find

11612
03:20:22,790 --> 03:20:22,800
answer and we lack the ability to find
 

11613
03:20:22,800 --> 03:20:23,990
answer and we lack the ability to find
the answer

11614
03:20:23,990 --> 03:20:24,000
the answer
 

11615
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:25,510
the answer
that's basically a summary of your

11616
03:20:25,510 --> 03:20:25,520
that's basically a summary of your
 

11617
03:20:25,520 --> 03:20:27,910
that's basically a summary of your
career no i'm just kidding um and then
