what to use the most beautiful aspect of

228
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
what to use the most beautiful aspect of
 

229
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,630
what to use the most beautiful aspect of
the human genome

230
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
the human genome
 

231
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,990
the human genome
don't get me started

232
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000

 

233
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,110

so we got time um the first answer is

234
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
so we got time um the first answer is
 

235
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,949
so we got time um the first answer is
that the beauty of genomes transcends

236
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
that the beauty of genomes transcends
 

237
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,390
that the beauty of genomes transcends
humanity so it's not just about the

238
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
humanity so it's not just about the
 

239
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,509
humanity so it's not just about the
human genome

240
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
human genome
 

241
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,149
human genome
genomes in general are amazingly

242
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
genomes in general are amazingly
 

243
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,990
genomes in general are amazingly
beautiful and again i'm obviously biased

244
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
beautiful and again i'm obviously biased
 

245
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,349
beautiful and again i'm obviously biased
so um in my view uh

246
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
so um in my view uh
 

247
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,629
so um in my view uh
the way that i like to introduce the

248
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
the way that i like to introduce the
 

249
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,310
the way that i like to introduce the
human genome and the way that i'd like

250
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
human genome and the way that i'd like
 

251
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,150
human genome and the way that i'd like
to introduce genomics to my class

252
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
to introduce genomics to my class
 

253
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,909
to introduce genomics to my class
is by telling them you know we're not

254
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
is by telling them you know we're not
 

255
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,670
is by telling them you know we're not
the inventors of the first digital

256
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
the inventors of the first digital
 

257
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,469
the inventors of the first digital
computer

258
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479

259
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,390
computer
we are the descendants of the first

260
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
we are the descendants of the first
 

261
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,550
we are the descendants of the first
digital computer

digital computer
 

263
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,030

basically life is digital and that's

264
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
basically life is digital and that's
 

265
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,870
basically life is digital and that's
absolutely beautiful about life the fact

266
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
absolutely beautiful about life the fact
 

267
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,430
absolutely beautiful about life the fact
that

268
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
that
 

269
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,590
that
at every replication step you don't lose

270
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
at every replication step you don't lose
 

271
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,189
at every replication step you don't lose
any information because that information

272
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
any information because that information
 

273
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,909
any information because that information
is digital

274
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
is digital
 

275
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,909
is digital
if it was analog it was just protein

276
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
if it was analog it was just protein
 

277
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,030
if it was analog it was just protein
concentrations

278
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
concentrations
 

279
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,790
concentrations
you'd lose it after a few generations it

280
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
you'd lose it after a few generations it
 

281
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,310
you'd lose it after a few generations it
would just dissolve away

282
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:46,320
would just dissolve away
 

283
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,390
would just dissolve away
and that's what the ancients didn't

284
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
and that's what the ancients didn't
 

285
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,990
and that's what the ancients didn't
understand about inheritance

286
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
understand about inheritance
 

287
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,510
understand about inheritance
the first person to understand digital

288
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
the first person to understand digital
 

289
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,030
the first person to understand digital
inheritance was

290
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
inheritance was
 

291
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,310
inheritance was
mendel of course and his theory in fact

292
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
mendel of course and his theory in fact
 

293
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,870
mendel of course and his theory in fact
stayed in a bookshelf for like 50 years

294
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
stayed in a bookshelf for like 50 years
 

295
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,990
stayed in a bookshelf for like 50 years
while darwin was

296
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
while darwin was
 

297
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,310
while darwin was
getting famous about natural selection

298
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
getting famous about natural selection
 

299
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,830
getting famous about natural selection
but the missing component was this

300
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
but the missing component was this
 

301
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,430
but the missing component was this
digital inheritance

302
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
digital inheritance
 

303
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,629
digital inheritance
the mechanism of evolution that mendel

304
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
the mechanism of evolution that mendel
 

305
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,590
the mechanism of evolution that mendel
had discovered

306
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
had discovered
 

307
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,150
had discovered
so that aspect in my view is the most

308
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
so that aspect in my view is the most
 

309
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,909
so that aspect in my view is the most
beautiful aspect but it transcends all

310
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
beautiful aspect but it transcends all
 

311
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,790
beautiful aspect but it transcends all
of life

312
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
of life
 

313
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,550
of life
and can you elaborate maybe the

314
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
and can you elaborate maybe the
 

315
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,990
and can you elaborate maybe the
inheritance part

316
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
inheritance part
 

317
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,469
inheritance part
what was the what was the key thing that

318
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
what was the what was the key thing that
 

319
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,469
what was the what was the key thing that
the ancients didn't understand

320
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
the ancients didn't understand
 

321
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,510
the ancients didn't understand
so the very theory of inheritance uh

322
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
so the very theory of inheritance uh
 

323
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,950
so the very theory of inheritance uh
as discrete units you know throughout

324
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:28,960
as discrete units you know throughout
 

325
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,670
as discrete units you know throughout
the life

326
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
the life
 

327
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,790
the life
of mendel and well after his writing

328
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
of mendel and well after his writing
 

329
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,749
of mendel and well after his writing
people thought that

330
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
people thought that
 

331
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,070
people thought that
his p experiments were just a little

332

401
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,110
most noble molecule over time
is uh you know holds within it the

402
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
is uh you know holds within it the
 

403
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,070
is uh you know holds within it the
secret of that discrete inheritance

404
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
secret of that discrete inheritance
 

405
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,029
secret of that discrete inheritance
but the conceptualization of discrete

406
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
but the conceptualization of discrete
 

407
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:57,589
but the conceptualization of discrete
you know

408
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
you know
 

409
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,670
you know
elements is something that precedes that

410
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
elements is something that precedes that
 

411
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,350
elements is something that precedes that
so even though it's discrete

412
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
so even though it's discrete
 

413
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,629
so even though it's discrete
when it uh materializes itself

414
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
when it uh materializes itself
 

415
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,870
when it uh materializes itself
into actual traits that we see it can be

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
into actual traits that we see it can be
 

417
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,990
into actual traits that we see it can be
continuous it can

418
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
continuous it can

basically arbitrarily rich and complex
so if you have five

422
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
so if you have five
 

423
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,870
so if you have five
genes that contribute to human height

424
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
genes that contribute to human height
 

425
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,870
genes that contribute to human height
and there aren't five there's a thousand

426
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
and there aren't five there's a thousand
 

427
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,870
and there aren't five there's a thousand
if there's only five genes and you

428
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
if there's only five genes and you
 

429
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,790
if there's only five genes and you
inherit some combination of them

430
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
inherit some combination of them
 

431
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,029
inherit some combination of them
and everyone makes you two inches taller

432
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
and everyone makes you two inches taller
 

433
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,390
and everyone makes you two inches taller
or two inches shorter

434
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
or two inches shorter
 

435
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,469
or two inches shorter
it'll look like a continuum trait a

436
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
it'll look like a continuum trait a
 

437
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,390
it'll look like a continuum trait a
continuous trait

438
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
continuous trait
 

439
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,309
continuous trait
but instead of five there are thousands

440
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
but instead of five there are thousands
 

441
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,830
but instead of five there are thousands
and every one of them contributes to

442
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
and every one of them contributes to
 

443
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,629

more during the day than each of these

448
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
more during the day than each of these
 

449
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,150
more during the day than each of these
genetic variants contributes

450
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
genetic variants contributes
 

451
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,309
genetic variants contributes
so by the evening you're shorter than

452
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
so by the evening you're shorter than
 

453
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,550
so by the evening you're shorter than
you were you woke up with isn't it weird

454
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
you were you woke up with isn't it weird
 

455
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,270
you were you woke up with isn't it weird
then

456
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
then
 

457
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,589
then
that we're not more different than we

458
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
that we're not more different than we
 

459
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,670
that we're not more different than we
are why are we all so similar

460
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:49,680
are why are we all so similar
 

461
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,070
are why are we all so similar
if there's so much possibility to be

462
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
if there's so much possibility to be
 

463
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,950
if there's so much possibility to be
different yeah

464
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
different yeah
 

465
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,990
different yeah
so so there are selective advantages

466
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
so so there are selective advantages
 

467
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,550
so so there are selective advantages
to being medium if you're extremely tall

468
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
to being medium if you're extremely tall
 

469
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,830
to being medium if you're extremely tall
or extremely short

470
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
or extremely short
 

471
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,309
or extremely short
you run into selective disadvantages so

472
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
you run into selective disadvantages so
 

473
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,430
you run into selective disadvantages so
you have trouble breathing you have

474
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
you have trouble breathing you have
 

475
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,629
you have trouble breathing you have
trouble running you have trouble

476
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
trouble running you have trouble
 

477
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,629
trouble running you have trouble
sitting if you're too tall if you're too

478
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
sitting if you're too tall if you're too
 

479
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,150
sitting if you're too tall if you're too
short you might i don't know

480
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
short you might i don't know
 

481
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,670
short you might i don't know
have other selective pressures are

482
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
have other selective pressures are
 

483
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,589
have other selective pressures are
acting against that if you look at

484
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
acting against that if you look at
 

485
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,510
acting against that if you look at
natural history of human population

486
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
natural history of human population
 

487
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,830
natural history of human population
there's actually selection for height

488
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
there's actually selection for height
 

489
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,749
there's actually selection for height
in northern europe and selection against

490
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
in northern europe and selection against
 

491
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,830
in northern europe and selection against
height in southern europe

492
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
height in southern europe
 

493
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,830
height in southern europe
so there might actually be advantages to

494
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
so there might actually be advantages to
 

495
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,869
so there might actually be advantages to
actually being

496
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
actually being
 

497
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,749
actually being
not not super tall and if you look

498
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
not not super tall and if you look
 

499
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,150
not not super tall and if you look
across the entire human population

500
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
across the entire human population
 

501
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,990
across the entire human population
you know for many many traits there's a

502
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
you know for many many traits there's a
 

503
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,749
you know for many many traits there's a
lot of push towards the middle

504
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
lot of push towards the middle
 

505
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,070
lot of push towards the middle
uh balancing selection is you know the

506
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
uh balancing selection is you know the
 

507
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,269
uh balancing selection is you know the
usual term

508
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
usual term
 

509
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,149
usual term
for selection that sort of seeks to not

510
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:38,159
for selection that sort of seeks to not
 

511
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,670
for selection that sort of seeks to not
be extreme

512
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
be extreme
 

513
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,790
be extreme
and to sort of have a combination of

514
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
and to sort of have a combination of
 

515
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,509
and to sort of have a combination of
alleles

516
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
alleles
 

517
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,910
alleles
that sort of you know keep recombining

518
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
that sort of you know keep recombining
 

519
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,110
that sort of you know keep recombining
and if you look at

520
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
and if you look at
 

521
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,350
and if you look at
you know mate selection super super tall

522
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
you know mate selection super super tall
 

523
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,310
you know mate selection super super tall
people

524
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
people
 

525
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,070
people
will not tend to sort of marry super

526
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
will not tend to sort of marry super
 

527
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,310
will not tend to sort of marry super
super tall people very often you see

528
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
super tall people very often you see
 

529
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,310
super tall people very often you see
these couples that are kind of

530
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:56,320
these couples that are kind of
 

531
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,910
these couples that are kind of
compensating for each other

532
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
compensating for each other
 

533
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,389
compensating for each other
and the best predictor of the kids age

534
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
and the best predictor of the kids age
 

535
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,070
and the best predictor of the kids age
is very often just take the average of

536
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
is very often just take the average of
 

537
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,710
is very often just take the average of
the

538
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
the
 

539
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,910
the
two parents and then adjust for sex and

540
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
two parents and then adjust for sex and
 

541
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,389
two parents and then adjust for sex and
boom you get it it's extremely heritable

542
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
boom you get it it's extremely heritable
 

543
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,590
boom you get it it's extremely heritable
let me ask uh

544
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
let me ask uh
 

545
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,670
let me ask uh
you kind of uh took a step back to the

546
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
you kind of uh took a step back to the
 

547
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,630
you kind of uh took a step back to the
genome

548
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
genome
 

549
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,470
genome
outside of just humans but is there

550
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
outside of just humans but is there
 

551
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,990
outside of just humans but is there
something that you find beautiful about

552
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
something that you find beautiful about
 

553
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,630
something that you find beautiful about
the human genome specifically

554
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
the human genome specifically
 

555
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,070
the human genome specifically
so i think that genome if more people

556
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
so i think that genome if more people
 

557
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,910
so i think that genome if more people
understood the beauty of the human

558
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
understood the beauty of the human
 

559
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,630
understood the beauty of the human
genome there would be so many fewer wars

560
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
genome there would be so many fewer wars
 

561
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,509
genome there would be so many fewer wars
so much less anger in the world i mean

562
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
so much less anger in the world i mean
 

563
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,949
so much less anger in the world i mean
what's really beautiful about the human

564
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
what's really beautiful about the human
 

565
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,670
what's really beautiful about the human
genome is

566
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
genome is
 

567
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,630
genome is
really the variation that teaches us

568
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
really the variation that teaches us
 

569
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,470
really the variation that teaches us
both about individuality

570
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
both about individuality
 

571
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,110
both about individuality
and about similarity so any two people

572
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
and about similarity so any two people
 

573
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,910
and about similarity so any two people
on the planet

574
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
on the planet
 

575
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,430
on the planet
are 99.9 identical

576
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
are 99.9 identical
 

577
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,590
are 99.9 identical
how can you fight with someone who's

578
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
how can you fight with someone who's
 

579
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,550
how can you fight with someone who's
99.9

580
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
99.9
 

581
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,910
99.9
identical to you it's just

582
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
identical to you it's just
 

583
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,670
identical to you it's just
counterintuitive

584
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
counterintuitive
 

585
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,870
counterintuitive
and yet any two siblings of the same

586
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
and yet any two siblings of the same
 

587
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,990
and yet any two siblings of the same
parent

588
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
parent
 

589
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,350
parent
differ in millions of locations so every

590
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
differ in millions of locations so every
 

591
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,070
differ in millions of locations so every
one of them

592
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
one of them
 

593
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,949
one of them
is basically two to the million unique

594
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
is basically two to the million unique
 

595
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,030
is basically two to the million unique
from any pair of parents

596
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
from any pair of parents
 

597
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,710
from any pair of parents
let alone any two random parents on the

598
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
let alone any two random parents on the
 

599
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,470
let alone any two random parents on the
planet so

600
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
planet so
 

601
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,470
planet so
that's i think something that teaches us

602
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
that's i think something that teaches us
 

603
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,150
that's i think something that teaches us
about sort of the nature of humanity in

604
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
about sort of the nature of humanity in
 

605
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,269
about sort of the nature of humanity in
many ways

606
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
many ways
 

607
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,990
many ways
that every one of us is as unique as any

608
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
that every one of us is as unique as any
 

609
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,550
that every one of us is as unique as any
star

610
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
star
 

611
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,230
star
and way more unique in actually many

612
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
and way more unique in actually many
 

613
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,990
and way more unique in actually many
ways and

614
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
ways and
 

615
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,590
ways and
uh yet we're all brothers and sisters

616
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
uh yet we're all brothers and sisters
 

617
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,069
uh yet we're all brothers and sisters
and yeah just like stars most of it is

618
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
and yeah just like stars most of it is
 

619
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:24,790
and yeah just like stars most of it is
just uh

620
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
just uh
 

621
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,630
just uh
fusion uh reactions yeah you only have a

622
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
fusion uh reactions yeah you only have a
 

623
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,870
fusion uh reactions yeah you only have a
few parameters to describe stars

624
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
few parameters to describe stars
 

625
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,829
few parameters to describe stars
you know mass size initial size and you

626
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
you know mass size initial size and you
 

627
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,030
you know mass size initial size and you
know stage of life

628
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,040
know stage of life
 

629
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,790
know stage of life
whereas for humans it's you know

630
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
whereas for humans it's you know
 

631
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,310
whereas for humans it's you know
thousands of parameters

632
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
thousands of parameters
 

633
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,509
thousands of parameters
scattered across our genome so the other

634
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
scattered across our genome so the other
 

635
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,350
scattered across our genome so the other
thing that makes humans unique

636
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
thing that makes humans unique
 

637
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,750
thing that makes humans unique
the other things that makes inheritance

638
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
the other things that makes inheritance
 

639
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,269
the other things that makes inheritance
unique in humans

640
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:45,279
unique in humans
 

641
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,389
unique in humans
is that most species

642
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
is that most species
 

643
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,350
is that most species
inherit things vertically basically

644
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
inherit things vertically basically
 

645
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,150
inherit things vertically basically
instinct

646
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
instinct
 

647
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,030
instinct
is a huge part of their behavior the way

648
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
is a huge part of their behavior the way
 

649
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,990
is a huge part of their behavior the way
that

650
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
that
 

651
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,750
that
you know i mean with my kids we've been

652
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
you know i mean with my kids we've been
 

653
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,030
you know i mean with my kids we've been
watching this

654
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
watching this
 

655
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,150
watching this
nest of birds with two little eggs

656
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
nest of birds with two little eggs
 

657
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,829
nest of birds with two little eggs
you know outside our window for the last

658
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
you know outside our window for the last
 

659
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,310
you know outside our window for the last
few months uh for the last few weeks as

660
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,320
few months uh for the last few weeks as
 

661
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,590
few months uh for the last few weeks as
they've been growing and there's so much

662
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
they've been growing and there's so much
 

663
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,389
they've been growing and there's so much
behavior

664
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
behavior
 

665

same as a bird that's born in california
 

677
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,110
same as a bird that's born in california
so there's not as much um

so there's not as much um

what's really beautiful about the human

684
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
what's really beautiful about the human
 

685
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,150
what's really beautiful about the human
genome is that if you take a person from

686
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
genome is that if you take a person from
 

687
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,870

and you place them back in ancient egypt

690
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
and you place them back in ancient egypt
 

691
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,710

place them here today they will grow up
 

697
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,949
place them here today they will grow up
to be completely normal

699
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,269

that is not genetics this is

that is not genetics this is

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,670
that is not genetics this is
the other type of inheritance in humans

the other type of inheritance in humans
 

703
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,030
the other type of inheritance in humans
so on one hand we have genetic

704
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
so on one hand we have genetic
 

705
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,750
so on one hand we have genetic

fascinating the this

750
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
fascinating the this
 

751
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,310
fascinating the this

picture of a vertical in the horizontal
i when you talk about the horizontal is

754
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
i when you talk about the horizontal is
 

755
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,910
i when you talk about the horizontal is
it in the realm of ideas

756
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:41,920
it in the realm of ideas
 

757
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,470
it in the realm of ideas
exactly okay so it's the actual social

758
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
exactly okay so it's the actual social
 

759
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,069
exactly okay so it's the actual social
interactions and that's exactly right

760
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
interactions and that's exactly right
 

761
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,750
interactions and that's exactly right
that's exactly right so basically the

762
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
that's exactly right so basically the
 

763
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,190
that's exactly right so basically the
concept of neotimi

764
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
concept of neotimi
 

765
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,910
concept of neotimi
is that you spend acquiring

766
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
is that you spend acquiring
 

767
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,069
is that you spend acquiring
characteristics from your environment

768
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
characteristics from your environment

to primates

776
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
to primates
 

777
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,550
to primates
we are useless you take any primate at

778
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
we are useless you take any primate at
 

779
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,269
we are useless you take any primate at
seven weeks

seven weeks
 

781
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,430
seven weeks
and in human at seven weeks we lose the

782
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,440
and in human at seven weeks we lose the
 

783
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,310
and in human at seven weeks we lose the
battle

784
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
battle
 

785
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,190

but at eighteen years you know all bets
 

787
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,990

basically our brain continues to develop

790
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
basically our brain continues to develop
 

791
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,870
basically our brain continues to develop
in an extremely malleable form

792
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
in an extremely malleable form
 

793
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,269
in an extremely malleable form
until very late and this is what allows

794
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
until very late and this is what allows
 

795
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,230
until very late and this is what allows
education

796
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,240
education
 

797
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,069
education
this is what allows the person from

798
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
this is what allows the person from
 

799
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,670
this is what allows the person from
egypt to do extremely well

800
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
egypt to do extremely well
 

801
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,150
egypt to do extremely well
now and the reason for that is that

802
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
now and the reason for that is that
 

803
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,350
now and the reason for that is that
the wiring of our brain

804
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,360
the wiring of our brain
 

805
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,110
the wiring of our brain
and the development of that wiring is

806
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:33,120
and the development of that wiring is
 

807
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,870
and the development of that wiring is
actually delayed

808
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
actually delayed
 

809
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,350
actually delayed
so you know the longer you delay that

810
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
so you know the longer you delay that
 

811
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,269
so you know the longer you delay that
the more opportunity you have

812
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
the more opportunity you have
 

813
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,990
the more opportunity you have
to pass on knowledge to pass on concepts

814
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
to pass on knowledge to pass on concepts
 

815
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,949
to pass on knowledge to pass on concepts

and what's really absolutely beautiful
 

821
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,069
and what's really absolutely beautiful
about humans today is that that lateral

about humans today is that that lateral

on our what would you call this this
 

919
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,990
on our what would you call this this
geno like would you would you use the

920
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
geno like would you would you use the
 

921
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,829
geno like would you would you use the
term genome by the way

922
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:31,839
term genome by the way
 

923
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,550
term genome by the way
yeah i think um you know we use the

924
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
yeah i think um you know we use the
 

925
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,670
yeah i think um you know we use the
genome to talk about

926
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
genome to talk about
 

927
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,590
genome to talk about
dna but very often we say you know i

928
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
dna but very often we say you know i
 

929
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,590

what's in the greek genome

932
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
what's in the greek genome
 

933
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,310
what's in the greek genome
and i'm like well yeah what's in the

934
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
and i'm like well yeah what's in the

and i'm like well yeah what's in the
greek genome is both our genes and also

936
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
greek genome is both our genes and also
 

937
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,710
greek genome is both our genes and also
our ideas

938

is
 

1163
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,310
is
uh phenomenal the fact that we go from

was i not proven wrong for
 

1253
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,430

rather than wow i was exactly right
 

1255
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,630
rather than wow i was exactly right

i think so much more important than

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,789
i think so much more important than
how far you are on your first step and i

how far you are on your first step and i
 

1265
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,390
how far you are on your first step and i
think that's what sort of

1266
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
think that's what sort of
 

1267
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,430
think that's what sort of
the current pandemic has taught us the

1268
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
the current pandemic has taught us the
 

1269
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,950
the current pandemic has taught us the
fact that yeah no of course we're gonna

1270
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:14,960
fact that yeah no of course we're gonna
 

1271
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,990
fact that yeah no of course we're gonna
make mistakes

1272
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
make mistakes
 

1273
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,350
make mistakes
but at least we're going to learn from

1274
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,360
but at least we're going to learn from
 

1275
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,669
but at least we're going to learn from
those mistakes and become better and

1276
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
those mistakes and become better and
 

1277
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,029
those mistakes and become better and
learn better and spread information

1278
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039
learn better and spread information
 

1279
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,669
learn better and spread information
better so

1280
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
better so
 

1281
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,270
better so

1348
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
respond more or elderly people respond
 

1349
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,789
respond more or elderly people respond
more to the virus

1350
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
more to the virus
 

1351
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,909
more to the virus
while kids are completely you know

1352
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
while kids are completely you know
 

1353
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,950
while kids are completely you know
you know very often not even aware that

1354
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:34,960
you know very often not even aware that
 

1355
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,310
you know very often not even aware that
they're spreading it

1356
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,320
they're spreading it
 

1357
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,110
they're spreading it
so the you know i think there's some

1358
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
so the you know i think there's some
 

1359
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,549
so the you know i think there's some
basic

1360
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
basic
 

1361
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,789
basic
questions that you would start from and

1362
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
questions that you would start from and
 

1363
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,590
questions that you would start from and
then

1364
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
then
 

1365
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,190
then
i'm sorry to say but wikipedia is pretty

so it used to be a time it used to be a
 

1371
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,029
so it used to be a time it used to be a
time maybe five years ago i forget

time maybe five years ago i forget
 

1373
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,190
time maybe five years ago i forget
i forget when but people kind of made

1374
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,200
i forget when but people kind of made
 

1375
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,149
i forget when but people kind of made
fun of wikipedia

1376
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:54,159
fun of wikipedia
 

1377
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,510
fun of wikipedia
for being an unreliable source i never

1378
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
for being an unreliable source i never
 

1379
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,390
for being an unreliable source i never
quite understood it

1380
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
quite understood it
 

1381
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,830
quite understood it
i thought from the early days it was

1382
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
i thought from the early days it was
 

1383
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,909
i thought from the early days it was
pretty reliable or better than

1384
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
pretty reliable or better than
 

1385
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,070
pretty reliable or better than
a lot of the alternatives but at this

1386
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
a lot of the alternatives but at this
 

1387
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,590
a lot of the alternatives but at this
point it's kind of like

1388
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:05,600
point it's kind of like
 

1389
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,870
point it's kind of like
a solid accessible survey paper on every

1390
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
a solid accessible survey paper on every
 

1391
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,710
a solid accessible survey paper on every
subject ever

1392
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
subject ever
 

1393
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,510
subject ever
the there's an ascertainment bias and a

1394
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
the there's an ascertainment bias and a
 

1395
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,549
the there's an ascertainment bias and a
writing bias

1396
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
writing bias
 

1397
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,950
writing bias
so so i think this this is related to

1398
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
so so i think this this is related to
 

1399
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,230
so so i think this this is related to
sort of people saying oh

1400
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
sort of people saying oh
 

1401
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,110
sort of people saying oh
so many nature papers are wrong and

1402
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
so many nature papers are wrong and
 

1403
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,230
so many nature papers are wrong and
they're like why would you publish in

1404
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:22,240
they're like why would you publish in
 

1405
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,669
they're like why would you publish in
nature so many nature papers are wrong

1406
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
nature so many nature papers are wrong
 

1407
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,070
nature so many nature papers are wrong
and

1408
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,080
and
 

1409
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,270
and
my answer is no no no so many nature

1410
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:27,280
my answer is no no no so many nature
 

1411
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,350
my answer is no no no so many nature
papers are scrutinized

1412
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
papers are scrutinized
 

1413
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,270
papers are scrutinized
and just because more of them are being

1414
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,280
and just because more of them are being
 

1415
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,590
and just because more of them are being
proven wrong than in other articles

1416
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
proven wrong than in other articles
 

1417
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,669
proven wrong than in other articles
is actually evidence that they're

1418
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
is actually evidence that they're
 

1419
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,190
is actually evidence that they're
actually better papers overall because

1420
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,200
actually better papers overall because
 

1421
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,190
actually better papers overall because
they're being scrutinized at a rate

1422
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:39,200
they're being scrutinized at a rate
 

1423
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,750
they're being scrutinized at a rate
much higher than any other journal so if

1424
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:41,760
much higher than any other journal so if
 

1425
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,269
much higher than any other journal so if
you basically

1426
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:43,279
you basically
 

1427
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,310
you basically
uh judge wikipedia by

1428
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,320
uh judge wikipedia by
 

1429
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,789
uh judge wikipedia by
not the initial content by but by the

1430
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799
not the initial content by but by the
 

1431
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,990
not the initial content by but by the
number of revisions

1432
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
number of revisions
 

1433
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,430
number of revisions
yeah then of course it's going to be the

1434
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
yeah then of course it's going to be the
 

1435
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,269
yeah then of course it's going to be the
best source of knowledge eventually

1436
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279
best source of knowledge eventually
 

1437
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,350
best source of knowledge eventually
it's still very superficial you then

1438
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
it's still very superficial you then
 

1439
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,190
it's still very superficial you then
have to go into the review papers etc

1440
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
have to go into the review papers etc
 

1441
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,669
have to go into the review papers etc
etc but i mean for most scientific

1442
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
etc but i mean for most scientific
 

1443
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,870
etc but i mean for most scientific
project

1444
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
project
 

1445
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,070
project
topics it's extremely superficial but it

1446
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
topics it's extremely superficial but it
 

1447
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,870
topics it's extremely superficial but it
is quite authoritative because it is the

1448
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:08,880
is quite authoritative because it is the
 

1449
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,549
is quite authoritative because it is the
place that everybody likes to criticize

1450
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:10,559
place that everybody likes to criticize
 

1451
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,230
place that everybody likes to criticize
you as being wrong you say that it's

1452
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
you as being wrong you say that it's
 

1453
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,269
you as being wrong you say that it's
superficial on a lot of topics that

1454
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,279
superficial on a lot of topics that
 

1455
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,990
superficial on a lot of topics that
i'm i've studied a lot of i find it

1456
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,000
i'm i've studied a lot of i find it
 

1457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,510
i'm i've studied a lot of i find it
i don't know if superficial is the right

1458
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
i don't know if superficial is the right
 

1459
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,230
i don't know if superficial is the right
word um

1460
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
word um
 

1461
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,750
word um
because superficial kind of implies that

1462
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:25,760
because superficial kind of implies that
 

1463
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,669
because superficial kind of implies that
it's not correct

1464
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
it's not correct
 

1465
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,630
it's not correct
no no i don't mean any implication of it

1466
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:30,640
no no i don't mean any implication of it
 

1467
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,590
no no i don't mean any implication of it
not being correct

1468
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600
not being correct
 

1469
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,669
not being correct
it's just superficial it's basically

1470
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
it's just superficial it's basically
 

1471
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,430
it's just superficial it's basically
only scratching the surface

1472
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
only scratching the surface
 

1473
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,110
only scratching the surface
for depth you don't go to wikipedia you

1474
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120
for depth you don't go to wikipedia you
 

1475
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,110
for depth you don't go to wikipedia you
go to the review articles but it can be

1476
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
go to the review articles but it can be
 

1477
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,750
go to the review articles but it can be
profound in the way that articles rarely

1478
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
profound in the way that articles rarely
 

1479
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,190
profound in the way that articles rarely
one of the frustrating things to me

1480
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,200
one of the frustrating things to me
 

1481
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,710
one of the frustrating things to me
about

1482
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:44,720
about
 

1483
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,789
about
like certain computer science like in

1484
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
like certain computer science like in
 

1485
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,310
like certain computer science like in
the machine learning world

1486
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
the machine learning world
 

1487
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,070
the machine learning world
articles they they don't as often take

1488
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
articles they they don't as often take
 

1489
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,789
articles they they don't as often take
the uh the bigger picture view you know

1490
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
the uh the bigger picture view you know
 

1491
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,430
the uh the bigger picture view you know
there's a

1492
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:55,440
there's a
 

1493
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,789
there's a
it's a kind of data set and you show

1494
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
it's a kind of data set and you show
 

1495
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,310
it's a kind of data set and you show
that it works and you kind of show that

1496
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
that it works and you kind of show that
 

1497
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,750
that it works and you kind of show that
here's an architectural thing that

1498
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
here's an architectural thing that
 

1499
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,029
here's an architectural thing that
creates an improvement

1500
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:01,039
creates an improvement
 

1501
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,669
creates an improvement
and so on and so forth but you don't say

1502
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:03,679
and so on and so forth but you don't say
 

1503
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,190
and so on and so forth but you don't say
well like what does this mean

1504
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,200
well like what does this mean
 

1505
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,510
well like what does this mean
for the nature of intelligence for

1506
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:07,520
for the nature of intelligence for
 

1507
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,350
for the nature of intelligence for
future data sets we haven't even thought

1508
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
future data sets we haven't even thought
 

1509
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,909
future data sets we haven't even thought
about

1510
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
about
 

1511
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,750
about
or if you were trying to implement this

1512
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:11,760
or if you were trying to implement this
 

1513
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,549
or if you were trying to implement this
like if we took this data set of uh

1514
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
like if we took this data set of uh
 

1515
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,310
like if we took this data set of uh
a hundred thousand examples and scaled

1516
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,320
a hundred thousand examples and scaled
 

1517
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,390
a hundred thousand examples and scaled
it to a hundred billion examples

1518
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
it to a hundred billion examples
 

1519
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,470
it to a hundred billion examples
with this method like like look at the

1520
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,480
with this method like like look at the
 

1521
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,710
with this method like like look at the
bigger picture which is what a wikipedia

1522
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:22,720
bigger picture which is what a wikipedia
 

1523
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,990
bigger picture which is what a wikipedia
article

1524
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
article
 

1525
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,630
article
would actually try to do which is like

1526
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:26,640
would actually try to do which is like
 

1527
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,470
would actually try to do which is like
what does this mean in the context

1528
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
what does this mean in the context
 

1529
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,190
what does this mean in the context
of computer the broad field of computer

1530
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,200
of computer the broad field of computer
 

1531
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,789
of computer the broad field of computer
vision or something like that yeah yeah

1532
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:32,799
vision or something like that yeah yeah
 

1533
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,470
vision or something like that yeah yeah
and no i i agree with you completely

1534
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
and no i i agree with you completely
 

1535
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,990
and no i i agree with you completely
like but it depends on the topic

1536
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
like but it depends on the topic
 

1537
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,510
like but it depends on the topic
i mean for some topics there's been a

1538
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
i mean for some topics there's been a
 

1539
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,110
i mean for some topics there's been a
huge amount of work for other topics

1540
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
huge amount of work for other topics
 

1541
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,310
huge amount of work for other topics
it's just a stub

1542
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
it's just a stub
 

1543
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,789
it's just a stub
so you know i got it yeah well yeah

1544
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
so you know i got it yeah well yeah
 

1545
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,470
so you know i got it yeah well yeah
actually the

1546
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:44,480
actually the
 

1547
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,990
actually the
uh which we'll talk on genomics was not

1548
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,000
uh which we'll talk on genomics was not
 

1549
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,390
uh which we'll talk on genomics was not
yeah it's great very shallow yeah yeah

1550
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
yeah it's great very shallow yeah yeah
 

1551
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,230
yeah it's great very shallow yeah yeah
it's not wrong it's just shallow

1552
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
it's not wrong it's just shallow
 

1553
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,710
it's not wrong it's just shallow
yeah every time i criticize something i

1554
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:54,720
yeah every time i criticize something i
 

1555
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,149
yeah every time i criticize something i
should feel partly responsible

1556
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
should feel partly responsible
 

1557
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,430
should feel partly responsible
basically if more people from my

1558
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:57,440
basically if more people from my
 

1559
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,510
basically if more people from my
community went there and edited

1560
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
community went there and edited
 

1561
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,149
community went there and edited
it would not be shallow it's just that

1562
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:02,159
it would not be shallow it's just that
 

1563
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:02,630
it would not be shallow it's just that
there's

1564
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
there's
 

1565
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,990
there's
different modes of communication in

1566
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
different modes of communication in
 

1567
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,549
different modes of communication in
different fields and in some fields

1568
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:06,559
different fields and in some fields
 

1569
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,029
different fields and in some fields
the experts have embraced wikipedia in

1570
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:09,039
the experts have embraced wikipedia in
 

1571
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,310
the experts have embraced wikipedia in
other fields

1572
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
other fields
 

1573
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,510
other fields
it's relegated and perhaps the reason is

1574
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
it's relegated and perhaps the reason is
 

1575
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,870
it's relegated and perhaps the reason is
that

1576
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
that
 

1577
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,390
that
if it was any better to start with

1578
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
if it was any better to start with
 

1579
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,909
if it was any better to start with
people would invest more time

1580
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:17,919
people would invest more time
 

1581
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,470
people would invest more time
but if it's not great to start with then

1582
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,480
but if it's not great to start with then
 

1583
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,470
but if it's not great to start with then
you need a few initial pioneers who will

1584
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:22,480
you need a few initial pioneers who will
 

1585
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,990
you need a few initial pioneers who will
basically go in and say

1586
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
basically go in and say
 

1587
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,549
basically go in and say
ah enough we're just going to fix that

1588
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:26,559
ah enough we're just going to fix that
 

1589
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,990
ah enough we're just going to fix that
and then i think it'll catch on much

1590
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
and then i think it'll catch on much
 

1591
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,950
and then i think it'll catch on much
more

1592
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:28,960
more
 

1593
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,510
more
so if it's okay before we go on to

1594
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
so if it's okay before we go on to
 

1595
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,630
so if it's okay before we go on to
genomics can we

1596
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640
genomics can we
 

1597
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,269
genomics can we
linger a little bit longer on the beauty

1598
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,279
linger a little bit longer on the beauty
 

1599
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,029
linger a little bit longer on the beauty
of the human genome

1600
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,039
of the human genome
 

1601
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,269
of the human genome
you've given me a few notes what else

1602
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
you've given me a few notes what else
 

1603
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,630
you've given me a few notes what else
what else do you find beautiful about

1604
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
what else do you find beautiful about
 

1605
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,590
what else do you find beautiful about
the human genome

1606
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
the human genome
 

1607
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,669
the human genome
so the last aspect of what makes a human

1608
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:43,679
so the last aspect of what makes a human
 

1609
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:44,789
so the last aspect of what makes a human
genome unique

1610
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
genome unique
 

1611
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,830
genome unique
in addition to the you know

1612
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
in addition to the you know
 

1613
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,070
in addition to the you know
similarity and the differences and

1614
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,080
similarity and the differences and
 

1615
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,430
similarity and the differences and
individuality

1616
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,440
individuality
 

1617
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,230
individuality
is that so very early on

1618
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240
is that so very early on
 

1619
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,669
is that so very early on
people would basically say oh you don't

1620
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,679
people would basically say oh you don't
 

1621
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,510
people would basically say oh you don't
do that experiment in human you have to

1622
00:26:59,510 --> 00:26:59,520
do that experiment in human you have to
 

1623
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,110
do that experiment in human you have to
learn about that in fly

1624
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
learn about that in fly
 

1625
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,710
learn about that in fly
or you have to learn about that in yeast

1626
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:02,720
or you have to learn about that in yeast
 

1627
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,870
or you have to learn about that in yeast
first or in mouse first or in a prime at

1628
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880
first or in mouse first or in a prime at
 

1629
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,750
first or in mouse first or in a prime at
first

1630
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:05,760
first
 

1631
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,669
first
and the human genome was in fact

1632
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
and the human genome was in fact
 

1633
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,830
and the human genome was in fact
relegated to sort of oh the last place

1634
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
relegated to sort of oh the last place
 

1635
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,230
relegated to sort of oh the last place
that you

1636
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
that you
 

1637
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,590
that you
you're going to go to learn something

1638
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
you're going to go to learn something
 

1639
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,149
you're going to go to learn something
new that has dramatically changed

1640
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
new that has dramatically changed
 

1641
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,630
new that has dramatically changed
and the reason that changed is human

1642
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:16,640
and the reason that changed is human
 

1643
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,630
and the reason that changed is human
genetics

1644

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
we are these species
 

1647
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,350
we are these species
in the planet that's the most studied

1648
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:23,360
in the planet that's the most studied
 

1649
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,149
in the planet that's the most studied
right now it's embarrassing to say that

1650
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
right now it's embarrassing to say that
 

1651
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,909
right now it's embarrassing to say that
but this was not the case a few years

1652
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:27,919
but this was not the case a few years
 

1653
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,350
but this was not the case a few years
ago it used to be

1654
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:29,360
ago it used to be
 

1655
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,710
ago it used to be
you know first viruses then

1656
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
you know first viruses then
 

1657
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,830
you know first viruses then
bacteria then yeast then

1658
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
bacteria then yeast then
 

1659
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,070
bacteria then yeast then
the fruit fly and the worm then the

1660
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,080
the fruit fly and the worm then the
 

1661
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,870
the fruit fly and the worm then the
mouse

1662
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:38,880
mouse
 

1663
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,310

and eventually human was very far last

1664
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,320
and eventually human was very far last
 

1665
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,070
and eventually human was very far last
so it's embarrassing that it took us

1666
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,080
so it's embarrassing that it took us
 

1667
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,070
so it's embarrassing that it took us
this long to focus on it or the

1668
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
this long to focus on it or the
 

1669
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,470
this long to focus on it or the
uh it's embarrassing that the model

1670
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
uh it's embarrassing that the model
 

1671
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,310
uh it's embarrassing that the model
organisms have been taken over

1672
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
organisms have been taken over
 

1673
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,630
organisms have been taken over
because of the power of human genetics

1674
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:52,640
because of the power of human genetics
 

1675
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,750
because of the power of human genetics
that right now

1676
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:53,760
that right now
 

1677
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,590
that right now
it's actually simpler to figure out the

1678
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
it's actually simpler to figure out the
 

1679
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,269
it's actually simpler to figure out the
phenotype of something

1680
00:27:57,269 --> 00:27:57,279

1681
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,389

1685
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,029

than by going back to any of the other

1686
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:03,039
than by going back to any of the other
 

1687
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,029
than by going back to any of the other
species and the reason for that is that

1688
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,039
species and the reason for that is that
 

1689
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,630
species and the reason for that is that
if you look at the natural variation

1690
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,640
if you look at the natural variation
 

1691
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,230
if you look at the natural variation
that happens in a population of 7

1692
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,240
that happens in a population of 7
 

1693
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,510
that happens in a population of 7
billion

1694
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:09,520

1695
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,669

you basically have a mutation in almost

1696
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679
you basically have a mutation in almost
 

1697
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,269
you basically have a mutation in almost
every nucleotide

1698
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
every nucleotide
 

1699
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,510
every nucleotide
so every nucleotide you want to perturb

1700
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,520
so every nucleotide you want to perturb
 

1701
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,549
so every nucleotide you want to perturb
you can go find

1702
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
you can go find
 

1703
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,029
you can go find
a living breathing human being and go

1704
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
a living breathing human being and go
 

1705
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,389
a living breathing human being and go
test the function of that nucleotide by

1706
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399
test the function of that nucleotide by
 

1707
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,590
test the function of that nucleotide by
sort of searching the database and

1708
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:21,600
sort of searching the database and
 

1709
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,470
sort of searching the database and
finding that person

1710
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,480
finding that person

00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
yeah exactly i i mean do you do you feel
 

1721

yeah exactly i i mean do you do you feel
on a small tangent is there something of

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,350
on a small tangent is there something of

these
 

1729
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,149
these
model organisms that you miss that we

would have uh would be looking at deeper
 

1735
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,830
would have uh would be looking at deeper
so

1736
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
so
 

1737
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,990
so
directed perturbation of course so i

1738
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
directed perturbation of course so i
 

1739
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,190
directed perturbation of course so i
think the place where

1740
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,200
think the place where
 

1741
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,430
think the place where
the the place where humans are still

1742
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:53,440
the the place where humans are still
 

1743
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,269
the the place where humans are still
lagging is the fact that in an animal

1747
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,470

knock out this gene completely

1748
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
knock out this gene completely
 

1749
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,909
knock out this gene completely
and let me knock out these three genes

1750
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
and let me knock out these three genes
 

1751
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,669
and let me knock out these three genes
completely and i said the moment you get

1752
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
completely and i said the moment you get
 

1753
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,190
completely and i said the moment you get
into combinatorics it's something you

1754
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,200
into combinatorics it's something you
 

1755
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,950
into combinatorics it's something you
can't do in the human because there just

1756
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:04,960
can't do in the human because there just
 

1757
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,070
can't do in the human because there just
simply aren't enough humans on the

1758
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,080
simply aren't enough humans on the
 

1759
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,789
simply aren't enough humans on the
planet and again let me be honest

1760
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
planet and again let me be honest
 

1761
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,630
planet and again let me be honest
we haven't sequenced all seven billion

1762
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,640
we haven't sequenced all seven billion
 

1763
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,990
we haven't sequenced all seven billion
people it's not like we have

1764
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
people it's not like we have
 

1765
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,510
people it's not like we have
every mutation but we know that there's

1766
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,520
every mutation but we know that there's
 

1767
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,590
every mutation but we know that there's
a carrier out there so if you look at

1768
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
a carrier out there so if you look at
 

1769
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,549
a carrier out there so if you look at
the trend

1770
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:16,559
the trend
 

1771
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,909

00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:20,159
genetics has progressed we can now
 

1775
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,269
genetics has progressed we can now
find thousands of genes involved

1776
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
find thousands of genes involved
 

1777
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,110
find thousands of genes involved
in human cognition in human psychology

00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320
uniquely learned turns out there's a
 

1785
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,389
uniquely learned turns out there's a
genetic basis to a lot of that

1786
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
genetic basis to a lot of that
 

1787

so the uh you know the

1788
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:38,159
so the uh you know the
 

1789
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,870
so the uh you know the

a long time you know in the end it's
just a bunch of chemical reactions

1808
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
just a bunch of chemical reactions
 

1809
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,710
just a bunch of chemical reactions
happening in your brain

1810
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
happening in your brain
 

1811
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,470
happening in your brain
and the particular abundance of

1812
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
and the particular abundance of
 

1813
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,149
and the particular abundance of
receptors that you have

1814
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:04,159
receptors that you have
 

1815
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,070
receptors that you have
this day based on what you ate yesterday

1816
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
this day based on what you ate yesterday
 

1817
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,389
this day based on what you ate yesterday
or that you have been wired with

1818
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
or that you have been wired with
 

1819
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,789

1823
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,389

1833
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,590
slices so how much uh on that point how
much freedom do you think we have

1834
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
much freedom do you think we have
 

1835
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,110
much freedom do you think we have
to escape the the constraints of

1836
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
to escape the the constraints of
 

1837
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,430
to escape the the constraints of
our genome you're making it sound like

1838
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
our genome you're making it sound like
 

1839
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,950
our genome you're making it sound like
more and more we're discovering that our

1840
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:32,960
more and more we're discovering that our
 

1841
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,029
more and more we're discovering that our
genome is actually has the

1842
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:35,039
genome is actually has the
 

1843
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,029
genome is actually has the
a lot of the story already encoded into

1844
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:37,039
a lot of the story already encoded into
 

1845
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,669
a lot of the story already encoded into
it how much freedom do we have

1846
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:39,679
it how much freedom do we have
 

1847
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,710
it how much freedom do we have
i uh so so

1848
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
i uh so so
 

1849
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,470
i uh so so
let me let me describe what that freedom

1850
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
let me let me describe what that freedom
 

1851
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,389
let me let me describe what that freedom
would look like that freedom would be

1852
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
would look like that freedom would be
 

1853
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,830
would look like that freedom would be
my saying oh i'm gonna resist the urge

1854
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:49,840
my saying oh i'm gonna resist the urge
 

1855
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,510
my saying oh i'm gonna resist the urge
to eat that apple

1856
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
to eat that apple
 

1857
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,950
to eat that apple
because i choose not to but

1858
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
because i choose not to but
 

1859
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,870
because i choose not to but
there are chemical receptors that made

1860
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
there are chemical receptors that made
 

1861
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,269
there are chemical receptors that made
me not resist the urge

1862
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
me not resist the urge
 

1863
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,669
me not resist the urge
to prove my individuality and my free

1864
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:01,679
to prove my individuality and my free
 

1865
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,470
to prove my individuality and my free
will by resisting the apple so then

1866
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
will by resisting the apple so then
 

1867
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,470
will by resisting the apple so then
the next question is well maybe now i'll

1868
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:06,480
the next question is well maybe now i'll
 

1869
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,230
the next question is well maybe now i'll
resist the urge to resist the apple and

1870
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
resist the urge to resist the apple and
 

1871
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,590
resist the urge to resist the apple and
i'll go for the chocolate instead to

1872
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:09,600
i'll go for the chocolate instead to
 

1873
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,590
i'll go for the chocolate instead to
prove my individuality but then

1874
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
prove my individuality but then
 

1875
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,909
prove my individuality but then
what about those other receptors that

1876
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
what about those other receptors that
 

1877
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,590
what about those other receptors that
you know

1878
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,600
you know
 

1879
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,750
you know
that that might be all encoded in there

1880
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
that that might be all encoded in there
 

1881
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,350
that that might be all encoded in there
so it's kicking the bucket down the road

1882
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
so it's kicking the bucket down the road
 

1883
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,070
so it's kicking the bucket down the road
and basically saying well your choice

1884
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,080
and basically saying well your choice
 

1885
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,310
and basically saying well your choice
will may have actually been driven by

1886
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
will may have actually been driven by
 

1887
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,909
will may have actually been driven by
other things that you actually are not

1888
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:25,919
other things that you actually are not
 

1889
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,750
other things that you actually are not
choosing

1890
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
choosing
 

1891
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,950
choosing
so that's why it's very hard to answer

1892
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:28,960
so that's why it's very hard to answer
 

1893
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,549
so that's why it's very hard to answer
that question well it's hard to know

1894
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:30,559
that question well it's hard to know
 

1895
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,310
that question well it's hard to know
what to do with that i mean if uh if the

1896
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,320
what to do with that i mean if uh if the
 

1897
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,750
what to do with that i mean if uh if the
genome has

1898
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:35,760

 

1899
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,789

if there's not much freedom it's uh

1900
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:38,799
if there's not much freedom it's uh
 

1901
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,110
if there's not much freedom it's uh
it's the butterfly effect it's basically

1902
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
it's the butterfly effect it's basically
 

1903
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,950
it's the butterfly effect it's basically
that in the short term

1904
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:42,960
that in the short term
 

1905
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,590
that in the short term
you can predict something extremely well

1906
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
you can predict something extremely well
 

1907
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,950
you can predict something extremely well
by knowing the current state of the

1908
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:46,960
by knowing the current state of the
 

1909
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,070
by knowing the current state of the
system

1910
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,080
system
 

1911
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,310
system
but a few steps down it's very hard to

1912
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
but a few steps down it's very hard to
 

1913
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,310
but a few steps down it's very hard to
predict based on the current knowledge

1914
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
predict based on the current knowledge
 

1915
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,110
predict based on the current knowledge
is that because the system is truly free

1916
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120
is that because the system is truly free
 

1917
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,470
is that because the system is truly free
when i look at weather patterns i can

1918
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
when i look at weather patterns i can
 

1919
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,750
when i look at weather patterns i can
predict the next 10 days

1920
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,760
predict the next 10 days
 

1921
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,350
predict the next 10 days
is it because the weather it has a lot

1922
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
is it because the weather it has a lot
 

1923
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,350
is it because the weather it has a lot
of freedom and after 10 days

1924
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,360
of freedom and after 10 days
 

1925
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,830
of freedom and after 10 days
it chooses to do something else or is it

1926
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:03,840
it chooses to do something else or is it
 

1927
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,509
it chooses to do something else or is it
because in fact the system is fully

1928
00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:05,519
because in fact the system is fully
 

1929
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,269
because in fact the system is fully
deterministic

1930
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279
deterministic
 

1931
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,190
deterministic
and there's just a slightly different

1932
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:09,200
and there's just a slightly different
 

1933
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,029
and there's just a slightly different
magnetic feel of the earth slightly more

1934
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
magnetic feel of the earth slightly more
 

1935
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,710
magnetic feel of the earth slightly more
energy arriving from the sun a slightly

1936
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:12,720
energy arriving from the sun a slightly
 

1937
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,950
energy arriving from the sun a slightly
different spin of the gravitational pull

1938
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:14,960
different spin of the gravitational pull
 

1939
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,909
different spin of the gravitational pull
of jupiter

1940
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:15,919
of jupiter
 

1941
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,669
of jupiter
that is now causing you know all kinds

1942
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:17,679
that is now causing you know all kinds
 

1943
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,070
that is now causing you know all kinds
of tides and slight deviation of the

1944
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
of tides and slight deviation of the
 

1945
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,990
of tides and slight deviation of the
moon etc maybe all of that can be fully

1946
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,000
moon etc maybe all of that can be fully
 

1947
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,870
moon etc maybe all of that can be fully
modeled

1948
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:22,880
modeled
 

1949
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,750
modeled
maybe the fact that china is emitting a

1950
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
maybe the fact that china is emitting a
 

1951
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,190
maybe the fact that china is emitting a
little more carbon today

1952
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
little more carbon today
 

1953
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,710
little more carbon today
is actually going to affect the weather

1954
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
is actually going to affect the weather
 

1955
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,430
is actually going to affect the weather
in you know egypt in three weeks

1956
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
in you know egypt in three weeks
 

1957
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,750
in you know egypt in three weeks
and all of that could be fully modeled

1958
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,760
and all of that could be fully modeled
 

1959
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,029
and all of that could be fully modeled
in the same way

1960

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,710
now you know i model everything about
you

1968
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
you
 

1969
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,549
you
the question is can i predict your next

1970
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:44,559
the question is can i predict your next
 

1971
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,310
the question is can i predict your next
step probably

1972
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,320
step probably
 

1973
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,549
step probably
but at how far and if it's a little

1974
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
but at how far and if it's a little
 

1975
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,350
but at how far and if it's a little
further

1976
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:49,360
further
 

1977
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,509
further
is that because of stochasticity and

1978
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
is that because of stochasticity and
 

1979
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,630
is that because of stochasticity and
sort of chaos

1980
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,640
sort of chaos
 

1981
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,950
sort of chaos
properties of unpredictability of beyond

1982
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
properties of unpredictability of beyond
 

1983
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,990
properties of unpredictability of beyond
a certain level

1984
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,000
a certain level
 

1985
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,549
a certain level
or was that actually true free will yeah

1986
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:58,559
or was that actually true free will yeah
 

1987
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,190
or was that actually true free will yeah
then yeah

1988
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
then yeah
 

1989
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,789
then yeah
so the number of variables might might

1990
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
so the number of variables might might
 

1991
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,789
so the number of variables might might
be so you might need to uh build an

1992
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:02,799
be so you might need to uh build an
 

1993
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,750
be so you might need to uh build an
entire universe

1994
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:03,760
entire universe
 

1995
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,710
entire universe
to uh to be able to simulate a human and

1996
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:06,720
to uh to be able to simulate a human and
 

1997
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,149
to uh to be able to simulate a human and
then maybe that human will be fully

1998
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:08,159
then maybe that human will be fully
 

1999
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,269
then maybe that human will be fully
simulatable

2000
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:09,279
simulatable
 

2001
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,830
simulatable
but maybe aspects of free will will

2002
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:11,840
but maybe aspects of free will will
 

2003
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,110
but maybe aspects of free will will
exist and where's that free will coming

2004
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,120
exist and where's that free will coming
 

2005
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,310
exist and where's that free will coming
from it's still coming from the same

2006
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,320
from it's still coming from the same
 

2007
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,870
from it's still coming from the same
neurons

2008
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:14,880
neurons
 

2009
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,710
neurons
or maybe from a spirit inhabiting these

2010
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
or maybe from a spirit inhabiting these
 

2011
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,230
or maybe from a spirit inhabiting these
neurons but again

2012
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,240
neurons but again
 

2013
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,669
neurons but again
you know it's very difficult empirically

2014
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
you know it's very difficult empirically
 

2015
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,590
you know it's very difficult empirically
to sort of evaluate where does free will

2016
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,600
to sort of evaluate where does free will
 

2017
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,470
to sort of evaluate where does free will
begin

2018
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
begin
 

2019
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,909
begin
and sort of chemical reactions and

2020
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:23,919
and sort of chemical reactions and
 

2021
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,630
and sort of chemical reactions and
electric signals and you know and

2022
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:26,640
electric signals and you know and
 

2023
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,389
electric signals and you know and
so on that's on that topic let me ask

2024
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:28,399
so on that's on that topic let me ask
 

2025
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,389
so on that's on that topic let me ask
the most absurd question

2026
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:30,399
the most absurd question
 

2027
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,430
the most absurd question
uh that uh most mit faculty role their

2028
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,440
uh that uh most mit faculty role their
 

2029
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,350
uh that uh most mit faculty role their
eyes on but uh

2030
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,360
eyes on but uh
 

2031
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,870
eyes on but uh
do what do you think about the

2032
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
do what do you think about the
 

2033
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,710
do what do you think about the
simulation hypothesis and the idea that

2034
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:38,720
simulation hypothesis and the idea that
 

2035
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,070
simulation hypothesis and the idea that
we live in a simulation

2036
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,080
we live in a simulation
 

2037
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,830
we live in a simulation
i think it's complete bs

2038
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:43,840

 

2039
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,830

okay there's no empirical evidence no

2040
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
okay there's no empirical evidence no
 

2041
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,269
okay there's no empirical evidence no
it's not absolutely not

2042
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:47,279
it's not absolutely not
 

2043
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,710
it's not absolutely not
not in terms of empirical evidence or

2044
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:48,720
not in terms of empirical evidence or
 

2045
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,950
not in terms of empirical evidence or
not but uh in terms of a

2046
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
not but uh in terms of a
 

2047
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,029
not but uh in terms of a
thought experiment does it help you

2048
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
thought experiment does it help you
 

2049
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,710
thought experiment does it help you
think about the universe

2050
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
think about the universe
 

2051
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,590
think about the universe
i mean so if you look at the genome it's

2052
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
i mean so if you look at the genome it's
 

2053
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,590
i mean so if you look at the genome it's
encoding a lot of the information that

2054
00:33:59,590 --> 00:33:59,600
encoding a lot of the information that
 

2055
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,950
encoding a lot of the information that
is required to create some of the

2056
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:00,960
is required to create some of the
 

2057
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,789
is required to create some of the
beautiful human complexity that we see

2058
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:02,799
beautiful human complexity that we see
 

2059
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,070
beautiful human complexity that we see
around us

2060
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,080
around us
 

2061
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,990
around us
it's an interesting thought experiment

2062
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,000
it's an interesting thought experiment
 

2063
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,750
it's an interesting thought experiment
how much

2064
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:07,760
how much
 

2065
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,790
how much
you know uh parameters do we need to um

2066
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
you know uh parameters do we need to um
 

2067
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,430
you know uh parameters do we need to um
have in order to model some you know

2068
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:13,440
have in order to model some you know
 

2069
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:13,829
have in order to model some you know
this

2070
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
this
 

2071
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,829
this
full human experience like if we were to

2072
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:15,839
full human experience like if we were to
 

2073
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,030
full human experience like if we were to
build a video game

2074
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,040
build a video game
 

2075
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,349
build a video game
yeah how hard it would be to build a

2076
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:19,359
yeah how hard it would be to build a
 

2077
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,510
yeah how hard it would be to build a
video game that's like convincing enough

2078
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
video game that's like convincing enough
 

2079
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,869
video game that's like convincing enough
and fun enough and you know uh

2080
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:24,879
and fun enough and you know uh
 

2081
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,430
and fun enough and you know uh
it has consistent laws of physics all

2082
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
it has consistent laws of physics all
 

2083
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,230
it has consistent laws of physics all
that stuff

2084
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,240
that stuff
 

2085
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,750
that stuff
it's not interesting to use the stock

2086
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:29,760
it's not interesting to use the stock
 

2087
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,710
it's not interesting to use the stock
experiment i i mean it's cute

2088
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
experiment i i mean it's cute
 

2089
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,190
experiment i i mean it's cute
but you know it's all comes razor i mean

2090
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,200
but you know it's all comes razor i mean
 

2091
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,149
but you know it's all comes razor i mean
what's what's more

2092
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:36,159
what's what's more
 

2093
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,750
what's what's more
realistic the fact that you're actually

2094
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:37,760
realistic the fact that you're actually
 

2095
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,270
realistic the fact that you're actually
a machine or that you're you know a

2096
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,280
a machine or that you're you know a
 

2097
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,310
a machine or that you're you know a
person what's what's

2098
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
person what's what's
 

2099
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,069
person what's what's
you know the fact that all of my

2100
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
you know the fact that all of my
 

2101
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,230
you know the fact that all of my
experiences exist inside the chemical

2102
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,240
experiences exist inside the chemical
 

2103
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,510
experiences exist inside the chemical
molecules that i have

2104
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
molecules that i have
 

2105
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,750
molecules that i have
or that somebody's actually you know

2106
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:47,760
or that somebody's actually you know
 

2107
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,790
or that somebody's actually you know
simulating all that i

2108
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:48,800
simulating all that i
 

2109
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,950
simulating all that i
mean well you did refer to humans as a

2110
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:50,960
mean well you did refer to humans as a
 

2111
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,470
mean well you did refer to humans as a
digital computer earlier so

2112
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:52,480
digital computer earlier so
 

2113
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,389
digital computer earlier so
of course of course but that's not kind

2114
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:54,399
of course of course but that's not kind
 

2115
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,829
of course of course but that's not kind
of a machine right i know

2116
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:55,839
of a machine right i know
 

2117
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,589
of a machine right i know
i know but i i think

2118
00:34:59,589 --> 00:34:59,599
i know but i i think
 

2119
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,069
i know but i i think
the probability of all that is nil and

2120
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:02,079
the probability of all that is nil and
 

2121
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,910
the probability of all that is nil and
let the machines wake me up and just

2122
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:03,920
let the machines wake me up and just
 

2123
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,349
let the machines wake me up and just
terminate me now if it's not

2124
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:07,359

 

2125
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,190

i challenge your machines they're gonna

2126
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,200
i challenge your machines they're gonna
 

2127
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,630
i challenge your machines they're gonna
they're gonna wait a little bit

2128
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:10,640
they're gonna wait a little bit
 

2129
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,550
they're gonna wait a little bit
to see what you're gonna do next it's

2130
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
to see what you're gonna do next it's
 

2131
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,630
to see what you're gonna do next it's
fun it's fun to watch

2132
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:14,640
fun it's fun to watch
 

2133
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,750
fun it's fun to watch
especially the clever humans what's the

2134
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:17,760
especially the clever humans what's the
 

2135
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,430
especially the clever humans what's the
difference to you between the way

2136
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,440
difference to you between the way
 

2137

so you also have roots and your work

2142
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,880
so you also have roots and your work
 

2143
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,430
so you also have roots and your work
would you say you're when you introduce

the human genome health disease
you know and then the whole gamut of how

2246
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,200
you know and then the whole gamut of how
 

2247
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,870
you know and then the whole gamut of how
our brain works how our body works and

2248
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:10,880
our brain works how our body works and
 

2249

so the dream there's not an equivalent
 

2255
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,630
so the dream there's not an equivalent
sort of uh

2256

sort of uh
 

2257
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,870
sort of uh
complementary dream of understanding

humans
 

2271
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,910
humans
it's an interesting question it's a

00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920
it's an interesting question it's a
 

2273
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,230
it's an interesting question it's a
fascinating question so

2274
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,240
fascinating question so
 

2275
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,870
fascinating question so
understanding the human brain is

2276
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:37,880
understanding the human brain is
 

2277
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,710
understanding the human brain is
undoubtedly coupled to how do we make

2278
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
undoubtedly coupled to how do we make
 

2279
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,150
undoubtedly coupled to how do we make
better ai

2280
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,160
better ai
 

2281
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,270
better ai
because so much of ai has in fact been

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,349
till we have you know all of these
amazing progress

2292
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:55,359
amazing progress
 

2293
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,470
amazing progress
that we've seen with uh

2294
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:58,480
that we've seen with uh
 

2295
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,310
that we've seen with uh
you know deep belief networks and uh

2296
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:02,320
you know deep belief networks and uh

you know all of these advances in go
 

2299
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,870
you know all of these advances in go
and chess in image synthesis and deep

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,910
in you name it and but but the
underlying architecture is very much

2306
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:15,920
underlying architecture is very much
 

2307
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,870
underlying architecture is very much
inspired

2308
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:16,880
inspired
 

2309
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,950
inspired
by the human brain which actually pauses

2310
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
by the human brain which actually pauses
 

2311
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,710
by the human brain which actually pauses
a very very interesting question

2312
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:22,720

 

2313
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,829

why are neural networks performing so

2314
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:25,839
why are neural networks performing so
 

2315
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:27,109
why are neural networks performing so
well

2316
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:27,119
well
 

2317
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,109
well
and they perform amazingly well is it

2318
00:38:29,109 --> 00:38:29,119
and they perform amazingly well is it
 

2319
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,230
and they perform amazingly well is it
because they can simulate

2320
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:30,240
because they can simulate
 

2321
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,510
because they can simulate
any possible function and the answer is

2322
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:33,520
any possible function and the answer is
 

2323
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,589
any possible function and the answer is
no no they simulate a very small number

2324
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:35,599
no no they simulate a very small number
 

2325
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,109
no no they simulate a very small number
of functions

2326
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
of functions
 

2327
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,470
of functions
is it because they can simulate every

2328
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:38,480
is it because they can simulate every
 

2329
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,390
is it because they can simulate every
possible function in the universe

2330
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:40,400
possible function in the universe
 

2331
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,589
possible function in the universe
and that's where it gets interesting the

2332
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:41,599
and that's where it gets interesting the
 

2333
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,589
and that's where it gets interesting the
answer is actually yeah a little closer

2334
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:43,599
answer is actually yeah a little closer
 

2335
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,630
answer is actually yeah a little closer
to that

2336
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
to that
 

2337
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,750
to that
and here's where it gets really fun uh

2338
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:47,760
and here's where it gets really fun uh
 

2339
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,630
and here's where it gets really fun uh
if you look at human brain and human

2340
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:50,640
if you look at human brain and human
 

2341
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,589
if you look at human brain and human
cognition

2342
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:51,599

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:06,720
and if you look at our senses
 

2355
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,950
and if you look at our senses
what do they perceive they perceive

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:08,960
what do they perceive they perceive
 

2357
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,230
what do they perceive they perceive
different you know

00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,280
physics that like there's a lot of
 

2597
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,950
physics that like there's a lot of
physics out there that we're just blind

physics out there that we're just blind

to completely oblivious to it
 

2601
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,109
to completely oblivious to it
yeah and yet they're permeating us all

2602
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:29,119
yeah and yet they're permeating us all
 

2603
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,390
yeah and yet they're permeating us all
the time yes it might be right in front

2604
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:30,400
the time yes it might be right in front
 

2605
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,190
the time yes it might be right in front
of us

2606

so so when you're thinking about

2608
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,040
so so when you're thinking about
 

2609
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,309
so so when you're thinking about

premonitions
 

2611
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,109
premonitions
yeah yeah a lot of that is ascertainment

2612
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
yeah yeah a lot of that is ascertainment
 

2613
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,790
yeah yeah a lot of that is ascertainment
bias like yeah every you know every now

2614
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
bias like yeah every you know every now
 

2615
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,069
bias like yeah every you know every now
and then you're like oh i remember

2616
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:40,079
and then you're like oh i remember
 

2617
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,230
and then you're like oh i remember
my friend and then my friend doesn't

2618
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:42,240
my friend and then my friend doesn't
 

2619
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,750
my friend and then my friend doesn't
appear and i'll forget that i remember

2620
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:43,760
appear and i'll forget that i remember
 

2621
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,190
appear and i'll forget that i remember
my friend but every now and then my

2622
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
my friend but every now and then my
 

2623
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,550
my friend but every now and then my
friend will actually appear i'm like oh

2624
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:46,560
friend will actually appear i'm like oh
 

2625
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,109
friend will actually appear i'm like oh
my god

2626
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:47,119
my god
 

2627
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,390
my god
i thought about you a minute ago you

2628
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:48,400
i thought about you a minute ago you
 

2629
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,150
i thought about you a minute ago you
just called me that's amazing

2630
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
just called me that's amazing
 

2631
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,069
just called me that's amazing
so you know some of that is this but

2632
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
so you know some of that is this but
 

2633
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,510
so you know some of that is this but
some of that might be that

2634
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
some of that might be that
 

2635
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,950
some of that might be that
there are within our brain

2636
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:56,960
there are within our brain
 

2637
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,870
there are within our brain
sensors for waves that we emit

2638
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:00,880
sensors for waves that we emit
 

2639
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,910
sensors for waves that we emit
that we're not even aware of and this

2640
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
that we're not even aware of and this
 

2641
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,309
that we're not even aware of and this
whole

2642
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:04,319
whole
 

2643
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,950
whole
concept of when i hug my children

2644
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:06,960
concept of when i hug my children
 

2645
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,950
concept of when i hug my children
there's such an emotional

2646
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:08,960
there's such an emotional
 

2647
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,150
there's such an emotional
transfer there that we don't comprehend

2648
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,160
transfer there that we don't comprehend
 

2649
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,069
transfer there that we don't comprehend
i mean sure yeah of course we're all

2650
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:14,079
i mean sure yeah of course we're all
 

2651
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,589
i mean sure yeah of course we're all
like hardwired for all kinds of

2652
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:15,599
like hardwired for all kinds of
 

2653
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,270
like hardwired for all kinds of
touchy-feely things between parents and

2654
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
touchy-feely things between parents and
 

2655
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,790
touchy-feely things between parents and
kids it's beautiful between partners

2656
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:18,800
kids it's beautiful between partners
 

2657
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,550
kids it's beautiful between partners
it's beautiful etc

2658
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
it's beautiful etc
 

2659
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,870
it's beautiful etc
but then there are intangible aspects

2660
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:24,880
but then there are intangible aspects
 

2661
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,069
but then there are intangible aspects
of human communication that i don't

2662
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:28,079
of human communication that i don't
 

2663
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:28,950
of human communication that i don't
think it's

2664
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:28,960
think it's
 

2665
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,790
think it's
unfathomable that our brain has actually

2666
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:30,800
unfathomable that our brain has actually
 

2667
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,630
unfathomable that our brain has actually
evolved ways and sensors for it

2668
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,640
evolved ways and sensors for it
 

2669
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,230
evolved ways and sensors for it
that we just don't capture we don't

2670
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,240
that we just don't capture we don't
 

2671
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,510
that we just don't capture we don't
understand the function of the vast

2672
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:35,520
understand the function of the vast
 

2673
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,069
understand the function of the vast
majority

2674
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:36,079
majority
 

2675
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,270
majority
of our neurons and maybe our brain is

2676
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,280
of our neurons and maybe our brain is
 

2677
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,510
of our neurons and maybe our brain is
already sensing it but even worse

2678
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,520
already sensing it but even worse
 

2679
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,829
already sensing it but even worse
maybe our brain is not sensing it at all

2680
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839
maybe our brain is not sensing it at all
 

2681
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,630
maybe our brain is not sensing it at all
and we're in

2682
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:44,640
and we're in
 

2683
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,150
and we're in
oblivious to this until we build a

2684
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
oblivious to this until we build a
 

2685
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,589
oblivious to this until we build a
machine that suddenly is able to sort of

2686
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:47,599
machine that suddenly is able to sort of
 

2687
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,309
machine that suddenly is able to sort of
capture

2688
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:48,319
capture
 

2689
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,589
capture
so much more of what's happening in the

2690
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:49,599
so much more of what's happening in the
 

2691
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,430
so much more of what's happening in the
natural world so what you're saying

2692
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
natural world so what you're saying
 

2693
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,950
natural world so what you're saying
is we're going physics is going to

2694
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:52,960
is we're going physics is going to
 

2695
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,309
is we're going physics is going to
discover a sensor for love

2696
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:56,319
discover a sensor for love
 

2697
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,589
discover a sensor for love
for and maybe maybe dogs are off scale

2698
00:44:59,589 --> 00:44:59,599
for and maybe maybe dogs are off scale
 

2699
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,349
for and maybe maybe dogs are off scale
for that

2700
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:01,359
for that
 

2701
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,790
for that
and we've been oh you know we've been

2702
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
and we've been oh you know we've been
 

2703
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,150
and we've been oh you know we've been
oblivious to it the whole time because

2704
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:04,160
oblivious to it the whole time because
 

2705
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,670
oblivious to it the whole time because
we didn't have the right answer yeah

2706
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,680
we didn't have the right answer yeah
 

2707
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,950
we didn't have the right answer yeah
and now you're gonna have a little wrist

2708
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:06,960
and now you're gonna have a little wrist
 

2709
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,550
and now you're gonna have a little wrist
that says oh my god i feel all this love

2710
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:08,560
that says oh my god i feel all this love
 

2711
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,510
that says oh my god i feel all this love
in the house

2712
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:09,520
in the house
 

2713
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,790
in the house
i see i sense a disturbance in the force

2714
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:12,800
i see i sense a disturbance in the force
 

2715
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,950
i see i sense a disturbance in the force
all around us and dogs and cats will

2716
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:14,960
all around us and dogs and cats will
 

2717
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,829
all around us and dogs and cats will
have zero none

2718
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:16,839
have zero none
 

2719
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,990
have zero none
none

2720
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,000

 

2721
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,270

but let's take a step back to

2722
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,280
but let's take a step back to
 

2723
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,670
but let's take a step back to
our unfortunately one of the 400 topics

2724
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
our unfortunately one of the 400 topics
 

2725
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,650
our unfortunately one of the 400 topics
that we had actually planned

2726
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:26,660
that we had actually planned
 

2727
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,510
that we had actually planned
[Laughter]

2728
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
[Laughter]
 

2729
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,390
[Laughter]
but to our sad time in 2020 when we only

2730
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
but to our sad time in 2020 when we only
 

2731
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,790
but to our sad time in 2020 when we only
have

2732
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:32,800
have
 

2733
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,990
have
just a few sensors and uh very primitive

2734
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,000
just a few sensors and uh very primitive
 

2735
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,910
just a few sensors and uh very primitive
early computers so in your

2736
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:39,920
early computers so in your
 

2737
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,750
early computers so in your
you you have a foot in computer science

2738
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
you you have a foot in computer science
 

2739
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,349
you you have a foot in computer science
and a floating biology

2740
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:43,359
and a floating biology
 

2741
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,710
and a floating biology
in your sense how do

2742
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720
in your sense how do
 

2743
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,230
in your sense how do
computers represent information

2744
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,240
computers represent information
 

2745
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,230
computers represent information
differently than like the genome or

2746
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,240
differently than like the genome or
 

2747
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,230
differently than like the genome or
biological systems

2748
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,240
biological systems
 

2749
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,710
biological systems
so first of all let me uh let me uh

2750
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:54,720
so first of all let me uh let me uh
 

2751
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,430
so first of all let me uh let me uh
correct

2752
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:55,440
correct
 

2753
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,230
correct
that no we're in an amazing time in 2020

2754
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:00,240
that no we're in an amazing time in 2020
 

2755
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,790
that no we're in an amazing time in 2020
computer science is totally awesome and

2756
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:02,800
computer science is totally awesome and
 

2757
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,309
computer science is totally awesome and
physics is totally awesome and we have

2758
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:04,319
physics is totally awesome and we have
 

2759
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:04,870
physics is totally awesome and we have
understood

2760
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:04,880
understood
 

2761
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,430
understood
so much of the natural world than ever

2762
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
so much of the natural world than ever
 

2763
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,470
so much of the natural world than ever
before

2764
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:08,480
before
 

2765
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,510
before
so i am extremely grateful

2766
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
so i am extremely grateful
 

2767
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,230
so i am extremely grateful
and feeling extremely lucky to be living

2768
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:14,240
and feeling extremely lucky to be living
 

2769
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,069
and feeling extremely lucky to be living
in the time that we are

2770
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:16,079
in the time that we are
 

2771
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,230
in the time that we are
because you know first of all who knows

2772
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
because you know first of all who knows
 

2773
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,010
because you know first of all who knows
when the asteroid will hit

2774
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:20,020
when the asteroid will hit
 

2775
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,750
when the asteroid will hit
[Laughter]

2776
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:21,760
[Laughter]
 

2777
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,190
[Laughter]
and second um you know of all times

2778
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,200
and second um you know of all times
 

2779
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,670
and second um you know of all times
in humanity this is probably the best

2780
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:27,680
in humanity this is probably the best
 

2781
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,150
in humanity this is probably the best
time to be a human being and this might

2782
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,160
time to be a human being and this might
 

2783
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,510
time to be a human being and this might
actually be the best place to be a human

2784
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:31,520
actually be the best place to be a human
 

2785
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,670
actually be the best place to be a human
being so anyway you know for for anyone

2786
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:33,680
being so anyway you know for for anyone
 

2787
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,190
being so anyway you know for for anyone
who loves science this is this is it

2788
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,200
who loves science this is this is it
 

2789
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,870
who loves science this is this is it
this is awesome it's a great time

2790
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:36,880
this is awesome it's a great time
 

2791
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,270
this is awesome it's a great time
at the same time just a swift comment

2792
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280
at the same time just a swift comment
 

2793
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,390
at the same time just a swift comment
all i meant

2794
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:40,400
all i meant
 

2795
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,630
all i meant
is that uh if we look several hundred

2796
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
is that uh if we look several hundred
 

2797
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,150
is that uh if we look several hundred
years from now and we

2798
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:44,160
years from now and we
 

2799
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,190
years from now and we
end up somehow not uh destroying the uh

2800
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,200
end up somehow not uh destroying the uh
 

2801
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,470
end up somehow not uh destroying the uh
ourselves yeah

2802
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:48,480
ourselves yeah
 

2803
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,910
ourselves yeah
people will probably look back at this

2804
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:49,920
people will probably look back at this
 

2805
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,510
people will probably look back at this
time in computer science

2806
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:51,520
time in computer science
 

2807
00:46:51,520 --> 00:47:00,630
time in computer science
and uh at your work of minos at mit

2808
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:00,640

 

2809
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,069

yeah even the papers i wrote 10 years
 

2831
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,230
yeah even the papers i wrote 10 years
ago they were awesome at the time

stuff we've done in the past but you
 

2841
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,829
stuff we've done in the past but you
know there's just

2842
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:27,839
know there's just
 

2843
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,349
know there's just
this sense of excitement about what

2844
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:29,359
this sense of excitement about what
 

2845

this sense of excitement about what
you're working on now

2846
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,040
you're working on now
 

2847
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,270
you're working on now
that as soon as a paper is submitted

2848
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:33,280
that as soon as a paper is submitted
 

2849
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,309
that as soon as a paper is submitted
it's like ugh

2850
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
it's like ugh
 

2851
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,390
it's like ugh
it's old like you know i can't talk

2852
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,400
it's old like you know i can't talk
 

2853
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,910
it's old like you know i can't talk
about that anymore at the same time

2854
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:37,920
about that anymore at the same time
 

2855
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,630
about that anymore at the same time
you're not

2856

00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319
you probably are not going to be able to
 

2859
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,549
you probably are not going to be able to
predict what are the most

2860
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:42,559
predict what are the most
 

2861
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,589
predict what are the most
uh impactful papers and ideas when

2862
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:45,599
uh impactful papers and ideas when
 

2863
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,349
uh impactful papers and ideas when
people look back 200 years from now at

2864
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359
people look back 200 years from now at
 

2865
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,549
people look back 200 years from now at
your work what

2866
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:48,559
your work what
 

2867
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,870
your work what
would be the most exciting papers and it

2868
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
would be the most exciting papers and it
 

2869
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,630
would be the most exciting papers and it
may very well be not the thing that you

2870
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:52,640
may very well be not the thing that you
 

2871
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,150
may very well be not the thing that you
expected

2872
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:54,160
expected
 

2873
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,190
expected
or yeah the things you got awards for

2874
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
or yeah the things you got awards for
 

2875
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,950
or yeah the things you got awards for
or you know this might be true in some

2876
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:58,960
or you know this might be true in some
 

2877
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,870
or you know this might be true in some
fields i don't know i feel slightly

2878
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:00,880
fields i don't know i feel slightly
 

2879
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,630
fields i don't know i feel slightly
differently about it in our field i feel

2880
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
differently about it in our field i feel
 

2881
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,270
differently about it in our field i feel
that

2882
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:03,280
that
 

2883
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,710
that
i kind of know what what are the

2884
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:04,720
i kind of know what what are the
 

2885
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,950
i kind of know what what are the
important ones and there's a very big

2886
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:06,960
important ones and there's a very big
 

2887
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,390
important ones and there's a very big
difference between what the press picks

2888
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,400
difference between what the press picks
 

2889
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,109
difference between what the press picks
up on

2890
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:09,119
up on
 

2891
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,630
up on
and what's actually fundamentally

2892
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,640
and what's actually fundamentally
 

2893
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,069
and what's actually fundamentally
important for the field and i think for

2894
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:12,079
important for the field and i think for
 

2895
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,589
important for the field and i think for
the fundamentally important ones we kind

2896
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:13,599
the fundamentally important ones we kind
 

2897
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,510
the fundamentally important ones we kind
of have a pretty good idea what they are

2898
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:15,520
of have a pretty good idea what they are
 

2899
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,670
of have a pretty good idea what they are
and it's hard to sometimes get the press

2900
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:17,680
and it's hard to sometimes get the press
 

2901
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,069
and it's hard to sometimes get the press
excited about the fundamental advances

2902
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:20,079
excited about the fundamental advances
 

2903
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,589
excited about the fundamental advances
but you know we we take what we get

2904
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:23,599
but you know we we take what we get
 

2905
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,990
but you know we we take what we get
and celebrate what we get and sometimes

2906
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
and celebrate what we get and sometimes
 

2907
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,510
and celebrate what we get and sometimes
you know one of our papers which was in

2908
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:27,520
you know one of our papers which was in
 

2909
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,470
you know one of our papers which was in
a minor journal

2910
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:28,480
a minor journal
 

2911
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,710
a minor journal
made the front page of reddit and

2912
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
made the front page of reddit and
 

2913
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,230
made the front page of reddit and
suddenly had like hundreds of thousands

2914
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
suddenly had like hundreds of thousands
 

2915
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,349
suddenly had like hundreds of thousands
of views

2916
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:33,359
of views
 

2917
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,950
of views
even though it wasn't a minor journal

2918
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
even though it wasn't a minor journal
 

2919
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,470
even though it wasn't a minor journal
because you know somebody pitched it the

2920
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:36,480
because you know somebody pitched it the
 

2921
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,829
because you know somebody pitched it the
right way that it suddenly caught

2922
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:37,839
right way that it suddenly caught
 

2923
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,270
right way that it suddenly caught
everybody's attention

2924
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:39,280
everybody's attention
 

2925
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,950
everybody's attention
whereas other papers that are sort of

2926
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:40,960
whereas other papers that are sort of
 

2927
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,950
whereas other papers that are sort of
truly fundamental you know we have a

2928
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:42,960
truly fundamental you know we have a
 

2929
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,630
truly fundamental you know we have a
hard time getting the editors even

2930
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:44,640
hard time getting the editors even
 

2931
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,069
hard time getting the editors even
excited about them

2932
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
excited about them
 

2933
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,910
excited about them
when so many hundreds of people are

2934
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,920
when so many hundreds of people are
 

2935
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,589
when so many hundreds of people are
already using the results and building

2936
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:49,599
already using the results and building
 

2937
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,870
already using the results and building
upon them

2938
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:50,880
upon them
 

2939
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,750
upon them
so i do i do appreciate that there's a

2940
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:53,760
so i do i do appreciate that there's a
 

2941
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,950
so i do i do appreciate that there's a
discrepancy between

2942
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960
discrepancy between
 

2943
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,430
discrepancy between
the perception and the perceived success

2944
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:57,440
the perception and the perceived success
 

2945
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,030
the perception and the perceived success
and the awards that you get for various

2946
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,040
and the awards that you get for various
 

2947
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,309
and the awards that you get for various
papers but i think that

2948
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:00,319
papers but i think that
 

2949
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,470
papers but i think that
fundamentally and know that you know

2950
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:02,480
fundamentally and know that you know
 

2951
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,430
fundamentally and know that you know
some people i'm

2952
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:03,440
some people i'm
 

2953
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,589
some people i'm
so so so when you're writing that you're

2954
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:05,599
so so so when you're writing that you're
 

2955
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,790
so so so when you're writing that you're
most proud

2956
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:06,800
most proud
 

2957
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,270
most proud
you know you just you trapped yourself

2958
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:09,280
you know you just you trapped yourself
 

2959
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,390
you know you just you trapped yourself
no no no no i mean

2960
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:10,400
no no no no i mean
 

2961
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,549
no no no no i mean
is there a line of work that you you

2962
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:12,559
is there a line of work that you you
 

2963
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,430
is there a line of work that you you
have a sense

2964
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:13,440
have a sense
 

2965
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,549
have a sense
uh is really powerful that you've done

2966
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:16,559
uh is really powerful that you've done
 

2967
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,270
uh is really powerful that you've done
today you've done so much work in so

2968
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,280
today you've done so much work in so
 

2969
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,349
today you've done so much work in so
many directions which is interesting

2970
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:21,359
many directions which is interesting
 

2971
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,190
many directions which is interesting
um is there something where you you

2972
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200
um is there something where you you
 

2973
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,270
um is there something where you you
think is quite special

2974
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:25,280
think is quite special
 

2975
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,630
think is quite special
i i mean it's like asking me to say

2976
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
i i mean it's like asking me to say
 

2977
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,390
i i mean it's like asking me to say
which of my three children i love best

2978
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:30,400
which of my three children i love best
 

2979
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,069
which of my three children i love best
i mean

2980
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:34,079

 

2981
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,670

exactly so i mean and it's such a

2982
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:37,680
exactly so i mean and it's such a
 

2983
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,950
exactly so i mean and it's such a
give me question that it's so so

2984
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:40,960
give me question that it's so so
 

2985
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,670
give me question that it's so so
difficult not to brag about the awesome

2986
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
difficult not to brag about the awesome
 

2987
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:43,990
difficult not to brag about the awesome
work

2988
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
work
 

2989
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,309
work
that my team and my students have done

2990
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:46,319
that my team and my students have done
 

2991
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,109
that my team and my students have done
um

2992
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:47,119
um
 

2993
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,190
um
and i'll i'll just mention a few of the

2994
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,200
and i'll i'll just mention a few of the
 

2995
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,109
and i'll i'll just mention a few of the
top of my head i mean

2996
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
top of my head i mean
 

2997
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,030
top of my head i mean
basically there's a few landmark papers

2998
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
basically there's a few landmark papers
 

2999
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,549
basically there's a few landmark papers
that i think have shaped

3000
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:54,559
that i think have shaped
 

3001
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,790
that i think have shaped
my scientific path and

3002
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:58,800
my scientific path and
 

3003
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,390
my scientific path and
you know i like to somehow describe it

3004
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:00,400
you know i like to somehow describe it
 

3005
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,950
you know i like to somehow describe it
as a linear continuation of one thing

3006
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:02,960
as a linear continuation of one thing
 

3007
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,470
as a linear continuation of one thing
led to another led to another led to

3008
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:04,480
led to another led to another led to
 

3009
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,349
led to another led to another led to
another

3010
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:05,359
another
 

3011
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:11,030
another
and you know it kind of all started with

3012
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040

 

3013
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,710

skip skip skip skip skip let me try to

3014
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:12,720
skip skip skip skip skip let me try to
 

3015
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,190
skip skip skip skip skip let me try to
start somewhere in the middle

3016
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,200
start somewhere in the middle
 

3017
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,630
start somewhere in the middle
so my first phd paper was

3018
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:18,640
so my first phd paper was
 

3019
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,549
so my first phd paper was
uh the first comparative analysis of

3020
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:20,559
uh the first comparative analysis of
 

3021
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,750
uh the first comparative analysis of
multiple species

3022
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:21,760
multiple species
 

3023
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,990
multiple species
so multiple complete genomes so for the

3024
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,000
so multiple complete genomes so for the
 

3025
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,150
so multiple complete genomes so for the
first time we we basically con

3026
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:26,160
first time we we basically con
 

3027
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,710
first time we we basically con
developed the concept of genome-wide

3028
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:28,720
developed the concept of genome-wide
 

3029
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,549
developed the concept of genome-wide
evolutionary signatures the fact that

3030
00:50:30,549 --> 00:50:30,559
evolutionary signatures the fact that
 

3031
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,870
evolutionary signatures the fact that
you could look across the entire genome

3032
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:32,880
you could look across the entire genome
 

3033
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,589
you could look across the entire genome
and understand how things evolve

3034
00:50:35,589 --> 00:50:35,599
and understand how things evolve
 

3035
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,150
and understand how things evolve
and from these signatures of evolution

3036
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
and from these signatures of evolution
 

3037
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,589
and from these signatures of evolution
you could go back

3038
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
you could go back
 

3039
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,630
you could go back
and study any one region and say that's

3040
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
and study any one region and say that's
 

3041
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:42,950
and study any one region and say that's
a

3042
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:42,960
a
 

3043
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,510
a
protein coding gene that's an rna gene

3044
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:45,520
protein coding gene that's an rna gene
 

3045
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,190
protein coding gene that's an rna gene
that's a regulatory motif

3046
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:47,200
that's a regulatory motif
 

3047
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,430
that's a regulatory motif
that's a you know binding site and so

3048
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
that's a you know binding site and so
 

3049
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,950
that's a you know binding site and so
forth so

3050
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960
forth so
 

3051
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,870
forth so
sorry so comparing different different

3052
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880
sorry so comparing different different
 

3053
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,150
sorry so comparing different different
species

3054
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,160
species
 

3055
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,230
species
of the same so so i think human mouse

3056
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,240
of the same so so i think human mouse
 

3057
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,910
of the same so so i think human mouse
rat and dog

3058
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:57,920
rat and dog
 

3059
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,270
rat and dog
you know they're all animals they're all

3060
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,280
you know they're all animals they're all
 

3061
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,950
you know they're all animals they're all
mammals they're all performing

3062
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
mammals they're all performing
 

3063
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,870
mammals they're all performing
similar functions with their heart with

3064
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:02,880
similar functions with their heart with
 

3065
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,829
similar functions with their heart with
their brain with their lungs etc etc

3066
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:05,839
their brain with their lungs etc etc
 

3067
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:08,230
their brain with their lungs etc etc
so there's many functional elements that

3068
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:08,240
so there's many functional elements that
 

3069
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,589
so there's many functional elements that
make us uniquely

3070
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
make us uniquely
 

3071
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,549
make us uniquely
mammalian and those mammalian elements

3072
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:12,559
mammalian and those mammalian elements
 

3073
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,710
mammalian and those mammalian elements
are actually conserved

3074
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
are actually conserved
 

3075
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,109
are actually conserved
99 of our genome does not code for

we frankly didn't know what it does
 

3085
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,710
we frankly didn't know what it does
until we started doing these comparative

3086
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:26,720
until we started doing these comparative
 

3087
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,990
until we started doing these comparative
genomic studies

3088
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:28,000
genomic studies
 

3089
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,710
genomic studies
so basically these series of papers in

3090
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:30,720
so basically these series of papers in
 

3091
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,990
so basically these series of papers in
in my career

3092
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:32,000
in my career
 

3093
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,910
in my career
have basically first developed that

3094
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:33,920
have basically first developed that
 

3095
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,990
have basically first developed that
concept of evolutionary signatures and

3096
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:36,000
concept of evolutionary signatures and
 

3097
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,349
concept of evolutionary signatures and
then apply them to yeast

3098
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:37,359
then apply them to yeast
 

3099
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,430
then apply them to yeast
apply them to flies apply them to four

3100
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:39,440
apply them to flies apply them to four
 

3101
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,750
apply them to flies apply them to four
mammals apply them to 17 fungi apply

3102
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
mammals apply them to 17 fungi apply
 

3103
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,670
mammals apply them to 17 fungi apply
them to 12 drosophila species

3104
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,680
them to 12 drosophila species
 

3105
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,589
them to 12 drosophila species
apply them to them 29 mammals and now

3106
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:45,599
apply them to them 29 mammals and now
 

3107
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:46,710
apply them to them 29 mammals and now
200 mammals

3108
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:46,720
200 mammals
 

3109
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,069
200 mammals
so sorry so can we so the evolutionary

3110
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
so sorry so can we so the evolutionary
 

3111
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:50,950
so sorry so can we so the evolutionary
signatures this

3112
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
signatures this
 

3113
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,670
signatures this
seems like a such a fascinating idea uh

3114
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,680
seems like a such a fascinating idea uh
 

3115
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,230
seems like a such a fascinating idea uh
and we're probably gonna linger in your

3116
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
and we're probably gonna linger in your
 

3117
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,910
and we're probably gonna linger in your
early phd work for two hours but uh

3118
00:51:59,910 --> 00:51:59,920
early phd work for two hours but uh
 

3119
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,670
early phd work for two hours but uh
what is how can you reveal something

3120
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:03,680
what is how can you reveal something
 

3121
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,349
what is how can you reveal something
interesting about the genome by looking

3122
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359
interesting about the genome by looking
 

3123
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,790
interesting about the genome by looking
at the uh

3124
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:06,800
at the uh
 

3125
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,990
at the uh
multiple multiple species

3126
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:10,000
multiple multiple species
 

3127
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,190
multiple multiple species
and looking at the evolutionary

3128
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:11,200
and looking at the evolutionary
 

3129
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,030
and looking at the evolutionary
signatures yeah like so

3130
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:13,040
signatures yeah like so
 

3131
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,870
signatures yeah like so
so um you basically

3132
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:16,880
so um you basically
 

3133
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,790
so um you basically
uh align the matching regions

3134
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:20,800
uh align the matching regions
 

3135
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,150
uh align the matching regions
so everything evolved from a common

3136
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
so everything evolved from a common
 

3137
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,910
so everything evolved from a common
ancestor way way back

3138
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:23,920
ancestor way way back
 

3139
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,510
ancestor way way back
and mammals evolved from a common

3140
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:25,520
and mammals evolved from a common
 

3141
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,829
and mammals evolved from a common
ancestor about 60 million years back

3142
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:27,839
ancestor about 60 million years back
 

3143
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,190
ancestor about 60 million years back
so after you know the

3144
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
so after you know the
 

3145
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,230
so after you know the
meteor that killed off the dinosaurs

3146
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:34,240
meteor that killed off the dinosaurs
 

3147
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,430
meteor that killed off the dinosaurs
landed a legend near machu picchu

3148
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,440
landed a legend near machu picchu
 

3149
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,150
landed a legend near machu picchu
we know the crater it didn't allegedly

3150
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,160
we know the crater it didn't allegedly
 

3151
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,589
we know the crater it didn't allegedly
land

3152
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:41,599
land
 

3153
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,109
land
that was the aliens okay no just

3154
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,119
that was the aliens okay no just
 

3155
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,630
that was the aliens okay no just
slightly north of machu picchu

3156
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:44,640
slightly north of machu picchu
 

3157
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,309
slightly north of machu picchu
in the gulf of mexico there's a giant

3158
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,319
in the gulf of mexico there's a giant
 

3159
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,030
in the gulf of mexico there's a giant
hole that that meteorite by the way

3160
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:49,040
hole that that meteorite by the way
 

3161
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,270
hole that that meteorite by the way
sorry is that uh definitive to people

3162
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:51,280
sorry is that uh definitive to people
 

3163
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,870
sorry is that uh definitive to people
have people um

3164
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:52,880
have people um
 

3165
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,790
have people um
um conclusively uh figured out what

3166
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:56,800
um conclusively uh figured out what
 

3167
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,750
um conclusively uh figured out what
killed the dinosaurs i think so so it

3168
00:52:59,750 --> 00:52:59,760
killed the dinosaurs i think so so it
 

3169
00:52:59,760 --> 00:52:59,990
killed the dinosaurs i think so so it
was

3170
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,000
was
 

3171
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,309
was
media well you know for volcanic

3172
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:02,319
media well you know for volcanic
 

3173
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:03,430
media well you know for volcanic
activity

3174
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:03,440
activity
 

3175
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,790
activity
all kinds of other stuff is coinciding

3176
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:06,800
all kinds of other stuff is coinciding
 

3177
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,829
all kinds of other stuff is coinciding
but the meteor is pretty unique and we

3178
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:09,839
but the meteor is pretty unique and we
 

3179
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,109
but the meteor is pretty unique and we
know how terrifying

3180
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:11,119
know how terrifying
 

3181
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,069
know how terrifying
i wouldn't if i we still have a lot of

3182
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:14,079
i wouldn't if i we still have a lot of
 

3183
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,430
i wouldn't if i we still have a lot of
20 20 left so if i

3184
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,440
20 20 left so if i
 

3185
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,190
20 20 left so if i
think no no but think about it this way

3186
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:17,200
think no no but think about it this way
 

3187
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,990
think no no but think about it this way
so the the dinosaurs ruled the earth

3188
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000
so the the dinosaurs ruled the earth
 

3189
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,470
so the the dinosaurs ruled the earth
for 175 million years

3190
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:24,480
for 175 million years
 

3191
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,990
for 175 million years
we humans have been around for

3192
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
we humans have been around for
 

3193
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,069
we humans have been around for
what less than one million years if

3194
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:30,079
what less than one million years if
 

3195
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,270
what less than one million years if
you're super generous about what you

3196
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
you're super generous about what you
 

3197
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,870
you're super generous about what you
call humans

3198
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:32,880
call humans
 

3199
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,069
call humans
and you include gems basically so

3200
00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:36,079
and you include gems basically so
 

3201
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,589
and you include gems basically so
so uh we are just getting warmed up

3202
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599
so uh we are just getting warmed up
 

3203
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,510
so uh we are just getting warmed up
and you know we've ruled the planet much

3204
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,520
and you know we've ruled the planet much
 

3205
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,590
and you know we've ruled the planet much
more ruthlessly than tyrannosaurus rex

3206
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:43,600
more ruthlessly than tyrannosaurus rex
 

3207
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,150
more ruthlessly than tyrannosaurus rex
[Laughter]

3208
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:46,160
[Laughter]
 

3209
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,990
[Laughter]
t-rex had much less of an environmental

3210
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
t-rex had much less of an environmental
 

3211
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,589
t-rex had much less of an environmental
impact than we did yeah

3212
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:49,599
impact than we did yeah
 

3213
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,950
impact than we did yeah
and um if you if you give us another 154

3214
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:52,960
and um if you if you give us another 154
 

3215
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,069
and um if you if you give us another 154
million years

3216
00:53:54,069 --> 00:53:54,079
million years
 

3217
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,790
million years
you know humans will look very different

3218
00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:56,800
you know humans will look very different
 

3219
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,230
you know humans will look very different
if we make it that far

3220
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
if we make it that far
 

3221
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,510
if we make it that far
so i think dinosaurs basically are

3222
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:01,520
so i think dinosaurs basically are
 

3223
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,069
so i think dinosaurs basically are
much more of life history on earth than

3224
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
much more of life history on earth than
 

3225
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:04,950
much more of life history on earth than
we are

3226
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:04,960
we are
 

3227
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,950
we are
in all respects but look at the bright

3228
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:06,960
in all respects but look at the bright
 

3229
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,630
in all respects but look at the bright
side when they were killed off

3230
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:08,640
side when they were killed off
 

3231
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,870
side when they were killed off
another life form emerged mammals and

3232
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:10,880
another life form emerged mammals and
 

3233
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,309
another life form emerged mammals and
that's that whole

3234
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:12,319
that's that whole
 

3235
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,710
that's that whole
the evolutionary uh branching that's

3236
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:14,720
the evolutionary uh branching that's
 

3237
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,630
the evolutionary uh branching that's
happened so you you kind of have

3238
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:16,640
happened so you you kind of have
 

3239
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,829
happened so you you kind of have
uh when you have these evolutionary

3240
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:17,839
uh when you have these evolutionary
 

3241
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,150
uh when you have these evolutionary
signatures you see is there

3242
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,160
signatures you see is there
 

3243
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,069
signatures you see is there
basically a map of how the genome

3244
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:22,079
basically a map of how the genome
 

3245
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,069
basically a map of how the genome
changed yeah exactly exactly so now

3246
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:24,079
changed yeah exactly exactly so now
 

3247
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,069
changed yeah exactly exactly so now
you can go back to this early mammal

3248
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:26,079
you can go back to this early mammal
 

3249
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,670
you can go back to this early mammal
that was hiding in caves

3250
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:27,680
that was hiding in caves
 

3251
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,750
that was hiding in caves
and you can basically ask what happened

3252
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:29,760
and you can basically ask what happened
 

3253
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,510
and you can basically ask what happened
after the dinosaurs were wiped out a ton

3254
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
after the dinosaurs were wiped out a ton
 

3255
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,990
after the dinosaurs were wiped out a ton
of evolutionary niches opened up

3256
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,000
of evolutionary niches opened up
 

3257
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,589
of evolutionary niches opened up
and the mammals started populating all

3258
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:35,599
and the mammals started populating all
 

3259
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,430
and the mammals started populating all
of these niches

3260
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:37,440
of these niches
 

3261
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,630
of these niches
and in that diversification

3262
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
and in that diversification
 

3263
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,270
and in that diversification

so you can take the genomes of all these

3282
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:03,680
so you can take the genomes of all these
 

3283
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,349
so you can take the genomes of all these
species and align them on top of each

00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:14,799
is that when you do that when you line
 

3295
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,190
is that when you do that when you line
up species on top of each other

3296
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:17,200
up species on top of each other
 

3297
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,870
up species on top of each other
you can see that within protein coding

3298
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:18,880
you can see that within protein coding
 

3299
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,270
you can see that within protein coding
genes there's a particular pattern of

so so yeah so there's a lot of encoding

3382
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:52,960
so so yeah so there's a lot of encoding
 

3383
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,789
so so yeah so there's a lot of encoding
for the same kind of function yeah so

3384
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:54,799
for the same kind of function yeah so
 

3385
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,589
for the same kind of function yeah so
so you now have this mapping between all

3386
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:57,599
so you now have this mapping between all
 

3387
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,670
so you now have this mapping between all
of the set of functions that could all

00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
what evolutionary signatures does is
 

3397
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,030
what evolutionary signatures does is
that it basically looks at the shape

3398
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:09,040
that it basically looks at the shape
 

3399
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,349
that it basically looks at the shape
of that distribution of sequences that

3400
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:11,359
of that distribution of sequences that
 

3401
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,150
of that distribution of sequences that
all encode

3402
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
all encode
 

3403
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,309
all encode
the same thing and based on that shape

3404
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:14,319
the same thing and based on that shape
 

3405
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,829
the same thing and based on that shape
you can basically say ooh

3406
00:57:15,829 --> 00:57:15,839
you can basically say ooh
 

3407
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,910
you can basically say ooh
proteins have a very different shape

3408
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
proteins have a very different shape
 

3409
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,750
proteins have a very different shape
than rna structures

3410
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:19,760
than rna structures
 

3411
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,829
than rna structures
than regulator motifs etc so just by

3412
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:21,839
than regulator motifs etc so just by
 

3413
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:22,950
than regulator motifs etc so just by
scanning a sequence

3414
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:22,960
scanning a sequence
 

3415
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,950
scanning a sequence
ignoring the sequence and just looking

3416
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:24,960
ignoring the sequence and just looking
 

3417
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,630
ignoring the sequence and just looking
at the patterns of change

3418
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
at the patterns of change
 

3419
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,710
at the patterns of change
i'm like wow this thing is evolving like

3420
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,720
i'm like wow this thing is evolving like
 

3421
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,789
i'm like wow this thing is evolving like
a protein and that thing is evolving

3422
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:30,799
a protein and that thing is evolving
 

3423
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,109
a protein and that thing is evolving
like a motif and that thing is evolving

3424
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
like a motif and that thing is evolving
 

3425
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,789
like a motif and that thing is evolving
so that's exactly what we just did for

3426
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:34,799
so that's exactly what we just did for
 

3427
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:35,510
so that's exactly what we just did for
covid

3428

covid
 

3429
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,349
covid
so our paper that we posted about our

3430
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
so our paper that we posted about our
 

3431
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:38,950
so our paper that we posted about our
archive about coronavirus

3432
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:38,960
archive about coronavirus
 

3433
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,230
archive about coronavirus
basically took this concept of

3434
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,240
basically took this concept of
 

3435
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,870
basically took this concept of
evolutionary signatures and applied it

3436
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
evolutionary signatures and applied it
 

3437
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,910
evolutionary signatures and applied it
on the sarsko v2 genome that is

3438
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:45,920
on the sarsko v2 genome that is
 

3439
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,150
on the sarsko v2 genome that is
responsible for the carbon-19 pandemic

3440
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:48,160
responsible for the carbon-19 pandemic
 

3441
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,910
responsible for the carbon-19 pandemic
uh and comparing it to 44 cerbicovirus

3442
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:51,920
uh and comparing it to 44 cerbicovirus
 

3443
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,030
uh and comparing it to 44 cerbicovirus
species so this is

3444
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:53,040
species so this is
 

3445
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,150
species so this is
the beta word did you just use cervical

3446
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:56,160
the beta word did you just use cervical
 

3447
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,349
the beta word did you just use cervical
sarbic virus sars related beta

3448
00:57:59,349 --> 00:57:59,359
sarbic virus sars related beta
 

3449
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,670
sarbic virus sars related beta
corona virus it's a port ponto so that

3450
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,680
corona virus it's a port ponto so that
 

3451
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,109
corona virus it's a port ponto so that
one family of viruses

3452
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:03,119
one family of viruses
 

3453
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,109
one family of viruses
yeah so it was that family by the way we

3454
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:05,119
yeah so it was that family by the way we
 

3455
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,789
yeah so it was that family by the way we
have 44 species

3456
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:06,799
have 44 species
 

3457
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,910
have 44 species
that or 24 species in the fam yeah virus

3458
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:09,920
that or 24 species in the fam yeah virus
 

3459
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,030
that or 24 species in the fam yeah virus
is a clever

3460
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,040
is a clever
 

3461
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,190
is a clever
no no but but there's just 44 and again

3462
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
no no but but there's just 44 and again
 

3463
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,549
no no but but there's just 44 and again
we don't call them species

3464
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,559
we don't call them species
 

3465
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,390
we don't call them species
in in viruses we call them strange but

3466
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:16,400
in in viruses we call them strange but
 

3467
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,150
in in viruses we call them strange but
anyway there's 44 strains

3468
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:18,160
anyway there's 44 strains
 

3469
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,630
anyway there's 44 strains
and that's a tiny little subset of you

3470
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:20,640
and that's a tiny little subset of you
 

3471
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,390
and that's a tiny little subset of you
know maybe another 50 strains that are

3472
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:22,400
know maybe another 50 strains that are
 

3473
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,470
know maybe another 50 strains that are
just far too distantly related

3474
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:24,480
just far too distantly related
 

3475
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,990
just far too distantly related
most of those only infect bats

3476
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,000
most of those only infect bats
 

3477
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,030
most of those only infect bats
as the host and a subset of only four or

3478
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:31,040
as the host and a subset of only four or
 

3479
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:31,750
as the host and a subset of only four or
five

3480
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:31,760
five
 

3481
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,470
five
have ever infected humans and we

3482
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:34,480
have ever infected humans and we
 

3483
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,910
have ever infected humans and we
basically took all of those and we

3484
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:35,920
basically took all of those and we
 

3485
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,710
basically took all of those and we
aligned them

3486
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
aligned them
 

3487
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,230
aligned them
in the same exact way that we've aligned

3488
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:38,240
in the same exact way that we've aligned
 

3489
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,069
in the same exact way that we've aligned
mammals and then we looked at

3490
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:40,079
mammals and then we looked at
 

3491
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,030
mammals and then we looked at
what proteins are you know which of the

3492
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:43,040
what proteins are you know which of the
 

3493
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,950
what proteins are you know which of the
currently hypothesized genes

3494
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:44,960
currently hypothesized genes
 

3495
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,990
currently hypothesized genes
for the coronavirus genome are in fact

3496
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,000
for the coronavirus genome are in fact
 

3497
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,349
for the coronavirus genome are in fact
evolving like proteins and which ones

3498
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:49,359
evolving like proteins and which ones
 

3499
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,150
evolving like proteins and which ones
are not

3500
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,160
are not
 

3501
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,349
are not
and what we found is that orf10 the last

3502
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:53,359
and what we found is that orf10 the last
 

3503
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:53,829
and what we found is that orf10 the last
little

3504
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:53,839
little
 

3505
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,270
little
open reading frame the last little gene

3506
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:55,280
open reading frame the last little gene
 

3507
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,870
open reading frame the last little gene
in the genome is bogus

3508
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:56,880
in the genome is bogus
 

3509
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,829
in the genome is bogus
that's not a protein at all what is it

3510
00:58:59,829 --> 00:58:59,839
that's not a protein at all what is it
 

3511
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:01,829
that's not a protein at all what is it
it's an rna structure

3512
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:01,839
it's an rna structure
 

3513
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,910
it's an rna structure
that doesn't have a it doesn't get

3514
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:03,920
that doesn't have a it doesn't get
 

3515
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,670
that doesn't have a it doesn't get
translated into amino acids

3516
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:05,680
translated into amino acids
 

3517
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,349
translated into amino acids
and that's so it's important to narrow

3518
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:07,359
and that's so it's important to narrow
 

3519
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,069
and that's so it's important to narrow
down to basically discover what's useful

3520
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:10,079
down to basically discover what's useful
 

3521
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:10,789
down to basically discover what's useful
and what's not

3522
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:10,799
and what's not
 

3523
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,390
and what's not
exactly basically what are what is even

3524
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:12,400
exactly basically what are what is even
 

3525
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,150
exactly basically what are what is even
the set of genes the other thing that

3526
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:14,160
the set of genes the other thing that
 

3527
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,589
the set of genes the other thing that
these evolutionary signatures showed is

3528
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:15,599
these evolutionary signatures showed is
 

3529
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:15,990
these evolutionary signatures showed is
that

3530
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
that
 

3531
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,510
that
within or 3a lies a tiny little

3532
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:19,520
within or 3a lies a tiny little
 

3533
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,670
within or 3a lies a tiny little
additional gene encoded within the other

3534
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,680
additional gene encoded within the other
 

3535
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:22,630
additional gene encoded within the other
gene

3536
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:22,640
gene
 

3537
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,630
gene
so you can translate a dna sequence in

3538
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:24,640
so you can translate a dna sequence in
 

3539
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,789
so you can translate a dna sequence in
three different reading frames

3540
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:26,799
three different reading frames
 

3541
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,789
three different reading frames
if you start in the first one it's you

3542
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:28,799
if you start in the first one it's you
 

3543
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,470
if you start in the first one it's you
know atg et cetera if you start on the

3544
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:30,480
know atg et cetera if you start on the
 

3545
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,750
know atg et cetera if you start on the
second it's tgc

3546
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:31,760
second it's tgc
 

3547
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,190
second it's tgc
etc and with there's a there's a gene

3548
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:35,200
etc and with there's a there's a gene
 

3549
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,549
etc and with there's a there's a gene
within a gene

3550
00:59:36,549 --> 00:59:36,559
within a gene
 

3551
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:37,990
within a gene
so there's a whole other protein that we

3552
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,000
so there's a whole other protein that we
 

3553
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,390
so there's a whole other protein that we
didn't know about that might be super

3554
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:40,400
didn't know about that might be super
 

3555
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,109
didn't know about that might be super
important

3556
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:41,119
important
 

3557
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,470
important
so we don't even know the building

3558
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:42,480
so we don't even know the building
 

3559
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,589
so we don't even know the building
blocks of sarsko v2

3560
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:45,599
blocks of sarsko v2
 

3561
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,510
blocks of sarsko v2
so if we want to understand coronavirus

3562
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
so if we want to understand coronavirus
 

3563
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,270
so if we want to understand coronavirus
biology and eventually find it

3564
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,280
biology and eventually find it
 

3565
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,390
biology and eventually find it
successfully

3566
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
successfully
 

3567
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,910
successfully
we need to even have the set of genes

3568
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:51,920
we need to even have the set of genes
 

3569
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,589
we need to even have the set of genes
and and these evolutionary signatures

3570
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:53,599
and and these evolutionary signatures
 

3571
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:56,150
and and these evolutionary signatures
that are developed in my phd work we

3572
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:56,160
that are developed in my phd work we
 

3573
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:56,630
that are developed in my phd work we
just

3574
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:56,640
just
 

3575
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,309
just
recently used you know what let's uh

3576
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319
recently used you know what let's uh
 

3577
00:59:58,319 --> 00:59:59,750
recently used you know what let's uh
let's run with that tangent for a little

3578
00:59:59,750 --> 00:59:59,760
let's run with that tangent for a little
 

3579
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,230
let's run with that tangent for a little
bit

3580
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
bit
 

3581
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,069
bit
if it's okay uh is uh can we talk about

3582
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:04,079
if it's okay uh is uh can we talk about
 

3583
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:07,829
if it's okay uh is uh can we talk about
uh the the kovic 19 a little bit more

3584
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:07,839
uh the the kovic 19 a little bit more
 

3585
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:10,789
uh the the kovic 19 a little bit more
like how what's your sense about the the

3586
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:10,799
like how what's your sense about the the
 

3587
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:11,990
like how what's your sense about the the

what are the big open problems and and
also

3600
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:22,960
also
 

3601
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,230
also
you know you you kind of said it's

3602
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:24,240
you know you you kind of said it's
 

3603
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,870
you know you you kind of said it's
important to understand what are the

3604
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:26,880
important to understand what are the
 

3605
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,309
important to understand what are the
like the the important proteins and

3606
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:30,319
like the the important proteins and
 

3607
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:34,069
like the the important proteins and
like why is that important

3608
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:34,079

 

3609
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,430

so what else does the

01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:37,440
so what else does the
 

3611
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,510
so what else does the
comparison of these species tell us what

3612
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:39,520
comparison of these species tell us what
 

3613
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,710
comparison of these species tell us what
it tells us is

3614
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:40,720
it tells us is
 

3615
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,430
it tells us is
how fast are things evolving it tells us

3616
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
how fast are things evolving it tells us
 

3617
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,069
how fast are things evolving it tells us
about

01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,079
about
 

3619
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,789
about
at what level is the acceleration or

3620
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:46,799
at what level is the acceleration or
 

3621
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,230
at what level is the acceleration or
deceleration pedal

3622
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
deceleration pedal
 

3623
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,789
deceleration pedal
set for every one of these proteins so

3624
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:50,799
set for every one of these proteins so
 

3625
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:54,069
set for every one of these proteins so
the genome has you know 30 some genes

3626
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
the genome has you know 30 some genes
 

3627
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,470
the genome has you know 30 some genes
some genes evolve super super fast

3628
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:56,480
some genes evolve super super fast
 

3629
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,349
some genes evolve super super fast
others evolve

3630
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
others evolve
 

3631
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,430
others evolve
super super slow if you look at the

3632
01:00:59,430 --> 01:00:59,440
super super slow if you look at the
 

3633
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,870
super super slow if you look at the
polymerase gene that basically

3634
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:00,880
polymerase gene that basically
 

3635
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,309
polymerase gene that basically
replicates the genome that's a super

3636
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:02,319
replicates the genome that's a super
 

3637
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,069
replicates the genome that's a super
slow evolving one

3638
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:04,079
slow evolving one
 

3639
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,349
slow evolving one
if you look at the nuclear capsid

3640
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:05,359
if you look at the nuclear capsid
 

3641
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,510
if you look at the nuclear capsid
protein that's also super

3642
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:07,520
protein that's also super
 

3643
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,230
protein that's also super
slow evolving if you look at the spike

3644
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:10,240
slow evolving if you look at the spike
 

3645
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,349
slow evolving if you look at the spike
one protein

3646
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:11,359
one protein
 

3647
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,270
one protein
this is the part of the spike protein

3648
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:13,280
this is the part of the spike protein
 

3649
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,589
this is the part of the spike protein
that actually touches the h2 receptor

3650
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:15,599
that actually touches the h2 receptor
 

3651
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,750
that actually touches the h2 receptor
and then enables the virus to attach

3652
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:19,760
and then enables the virus to attach
 

3653
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,910
and then enables the virus to attach
to your cells that's the thing that

3654
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:21,920
to your cells that's the thing that
 

3655
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:22,789
to your cells that's the thing that
gives it that

3656
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
gives it that
 

3657
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,470
gives it that
that visual yeah the corona look

3658
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:24,480
that visual yeah the corona look
 

3659
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,910
that visual yeah the corona look
basically the coronal look yeah

3660
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:25,920
basically the coronal look yeah
 

3661
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,510
basically the coronal look yeah
so basically the spike protein sticks

3662
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
so basically the spike protein sticks
 

3663
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,430
so basically the spike protein sticks
out of the virus and there's a first

3664
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:29,440
out of the virus and there's a first
 

3665
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,309
out of the virus and there's a first
part of the protein

3666
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:30,319
part of the protein
 

3667
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,670
part of the protein
s1 which basically attaches to the h2

3668
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:33,680
s1 which basically attaches to the h2
 

3669
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,470
s1 which basically attaches to the h2
receptor

3670
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:34,480
receptor
 

3671
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,150
receptor
and then s2 is the latch that sort of

3672
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:38,160
and then s2 is the latch that sort of
 

3673
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,309
and then s2 is the latch that sort of
pushes and channels the fusion of the

3674
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:40,319
pushes and channels the fusion of the
 

3675
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,309
pushes and channels the fusion of the
membranes and then the incorporation

3676
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:42,319
membranes and then the incorporation
 

3677
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:46,150
membranes and then the incorporation
of the um viral rna

3678
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,160
of the um viral rna
 

3679
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,589
of the um viral rna
inside our cells which then gets

3680
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:47,599
inside our cells which then gets
 

3681
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:50,470
inside our cells which then gets
translated into all of these 30 proteins

3682
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:50,480
translated into all of these 30 proteins
 

3683
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,430
translated into all of these 30 proteins
so the s1 protein is evolving

3684
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:54,440
so the s1 protein is evolving
 

3685
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:57,430
so the s1 protein is evolving
ridiculously fast so if you look at

3686
01:01:57,430 --> 01:01:57,440
ridiculously fast so if you look at
 

3687
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,789
ridiculously fast so if you look at
the stop professor's gas pedal the gas

3688
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:00,799
the stop professor's gas pedal the gas
 

3689
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,510
the stop professor's gas pedal the gas
pedal is all the way down

3690
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
pedal is all the way down
 

3691
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,390
pedal is all the way down
or 8 is also evolving super fast and or

3692
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
or 8 is also evolving super fast and or
 

3693
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,829
or 8 is also evolving super fast and or
six is evolving super fast we have no

3694
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
six is evolving super fast we have no
 

3695
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:08,789
six is evolving super fast we have no
idea what they do

3696
01:02:08,789 --> 01:02:08,799
idea what they do
 

3697
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:11,270
idea what they do
we have some idea but nowhere near what

3698
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,280
we have some idea but nowhere near what
 

3699
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,230
we have some idea but nowhere near what
s1 is

3700
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
s1 is
 

3701
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,230
s1 is
so what the isn't that terrifying that

3702
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,240
so what the isn't that terrifying that
 

3703
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,829
so what the isn't that terrifying that
s1 is evol that means

3704
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:15,839
s1 is evol that means
 

3705
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:17,990
s1 is evol that means
that's a really useful function and if

3706
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,000
that's a really useful function and if
 

3707
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,589
that's a really useful function and if
it's evolving fast

3708
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:19,599
it's evolving fast
 

3709
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,029
it's evolving fast
doesn't that mean new strains could be

3710
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:21,039
doesn't that mean new strains could be
 

3711
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,710
doesn't that mean new strains could be
created or it does something that means

3712
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:22,720
created or it does something that means
 

3713
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,309
created or it does something that means
that it's searching for

3714
01:02:24,309 --> 01:02:24,319
that it's searching for
 

3715
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:26,710
that it's searching for
how to match how to best match the host

3716
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:26,720
how to match how to best match the host
 

3717
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,910
how to match how to best match the host
so basically anything

3718
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:27,920
so basically anything
 

3719
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,670
so basically anything
in in general in evolution if you look

3720
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
in in general in evolution if you look
 

3721
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,349
in in general in evolution if you look
at genomes anything that's contacting

3722
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
at genomes anything that's contacting
 

3723
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:32,390
at genomes anything that's contacting
the environment

3724
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:32,400
the environment
 

3725
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,069
the environment
is evolving much faster than anything

3726
01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:34,079
is evolving much faster than anything
 

3727
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,750
is evolving much faster than anything
that's internal and the reason is that

3728
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:35,760
that's internal and the reason is that
 

3729
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,270
that's internal and the reason is that
the environment changes

3730
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:37,280
the environment changes
 

3731
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,390
the environment changes
so if you look at um the evolution of

3732
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:40,400
so if you look at um the evolution of
 

3733
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,390
so if you look at um the evolution of
these cervical viruses

3734
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:42,400
these cervical viruses
 

3735
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,549
these cervical viruses
the s1 protein has evolved very rapidly

3736
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:44,559
the s1 protein has evolved very rapidly
 

3737
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,309
the s1 protein has evolved very rapidly
because it's attaching to different

3738
01:02:46,309 --> 01:02:46,319
because it's attaching to different
 

3739
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,549
because it's attaching to different
hosts each time we think of them as bats

3740
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:48,559
hosts each time we think of them as bats
 

3741
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,630
hosts each time we think of them as bats
but there's thousands of species of bats

3742
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:50,640
but there's thousands of species of bats
 

3743
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:52,150
but there's thousands of species of bats
and to go from one species of bat to

3744
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160
and to go from one species of bat to
 

3745
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,270
and to go from one species of bat to
another species of bat you have to

3746
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:53,280
another species of bat you have to
 

3747
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,390
another species of bat you have to
adjust

3748
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:54,400
adjust
 

3749
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,309
adjust
one to the new ace2 receptor that you're

3750
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:56,319
one to the new ace2 receptor that you're
 

3751
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,230
one to the new ace2 receptor that you're
going to be facing in that new species

3752
01:02:58,230 --> 01:02:58,240
going to be facing in that new species
 

3753
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,230
going to be facing in that new species
sorry quick tangent yeah is it

3754
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:00,240
sorry quick tangent yeah is it
 

3755
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:01,349
sorry quick tangent yeah is it
fascinating to you

3756
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:01,359
fascinating to you
 

3757
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,069
fascinating to you
that viruses are doing this i mean it

3758
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
that viruses are doing this i mean it
 

3759
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,670
that viruses are doing this i mean it
feels like they're this intelligent

3760
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:05,680
feels like they're this intelligent
 

3761
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,950
feels like they're this intelligent
organism

3762
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:06,960
organism
 

3763
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,990
organism
i mean is it like does that give you

3764
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:10,000
i mean is it like does that give you
 

3765
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,430
i mean is it like does that give you
pause how

3766
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:11,440
pause how
 

3767
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,470
pause how
incredible it is that they're the the

3768
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:14,480
incredible it is that they're the the
 

3769
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,910
incredible it is that they're the the
evolutionary dynamics that you're

3770
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:15,920
evolutionary dynamics that you're
 

3771
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,990
evolutionary dynamics that you're
describing is actually happening

3772
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:18,000
describing is actually happening
 

3773
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,150
describing is actually happening
and they're freaking out figuring out

3774
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:20,160
and they're freaking out figuring out
 

3775
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,309
and they're freaking out figuring out
how to jump from bass to humans

3776
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:22,319
how to jump from bass to humans
 

3777
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,549
how to jump from bass to humans
all in this distributed fashion and then

3778
01:03:24,549 --> 01:03:24,559
all in this distributed fashion and then
 

3779
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,230
all in this distributed fashion and then
most of us don't even say they're alive

3780
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:26,240
most of us don't even say they're alive
 

3781
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,829
most of us don't even say they're alive
or intelligent whatever

3782
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
or intelligent whatever
 

3783
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:30,069
or intelligent whatever
so intelligence is in the eye of the

3784
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:30,079
so intelligence is in the eye of the
 

3785
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,109
so intelligence is in the eye of the
beholder

3786
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:31,119
beholder
 

3787
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,829
beholder
you know stupid is a stupid dose as

3788
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
you know stupid is a stupid dose as
 

3789
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,190
you know stupid is a stupid dose as
forest gum would say yes and

3790
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:35,200
forest gum would say yes and
 

3791
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,950
forest gum would say yes and
intelligence is as intelligent does so

3792
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:36,960
intelligence is as intelligent does so
 

3793
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,470
intelligence is as intelligent does so
basically if the virus is

3794
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:38,480
basically if the virus is
 

3795
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,910
basically if the virus is
finding solutions that we think of as

3796
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:39,920
finding solutions that we think of as
 

3797
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,510
finding solutions that we think of as
intelligent yeah it's probably

3798
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,520
intelligent yeah it's probably
 

3799
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,230
intelligent yeah it's probably
intelligent

3800
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
intelligent
 

3801
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,349
intelligent
but that's again in the eye of the

3802
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:43,359
but that's again in the eye of the
 

3803
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,190
but that's again in the eye of the
beholder do you think viruses are

3804
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
beholder do you think viruses are
 

3805
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:45,829
beholder do you think viruses are
intelligent

3806
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
intelligent
 

3807
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,270
intelligent
of course not really no

3808
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:49,280
of course not really no
 

3809
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,950
of course not really no
because so incredible so remember

3810
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:50,960
because so incredible so remember
 

3811
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,069
because so incredible so remember
remember when i was talking about the

3812
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:52,079
remember when i was talking about the
 

3813
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,510
remember when i was talking about the
two components of evolution

3814
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,520
two components of evolution
 

3815
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,150
two components of evolution
one is the stupid mutation yeah which is

3816
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
one is the stupid mutation yeah which is
 

3817
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,029
one is the stupid mutation yeah which is
completely blind

3818
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
completely blind
 

3819
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,349
completely blind
and the other one is the super smart

3820
01:03:59,349 --> 01:03:59,359
and the other one is the super smart
 

3821
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:00,150
and the other one is the super smart
selection

3822
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,160
selection
 

3823
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,190
selection
which is ruthless so

3824
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:03,200
which is ruthless so
 

3825
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,029
which is ruthless so
it's not viruses who are smart it's this

3826
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:05,039
it's not viruses who are smart it's this
 

3827
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,710
it's not viruses who are smart it's this
component of evolution that's smart

3828
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
component of evolution that's smart
 

3829
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,789
component of evolution that's smart
so it's evolution that that sort of

3830
01:04:08,789 --> 01:04:08,799
so it's evolution that that sort of
 

3831
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,309
so it's evolution that that sort of
appears smart

3832
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:10,319
appears smart
 

3833
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:13,990
appears smart
and how is that happening by huge

3834
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,000
and how is that happening by huge
 

3835
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,750
and how is that happening by huge
parallel search across thousands of

3836
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:17,760
parallel search across thousands of
 

3837
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,710
parallel search across thousands of
you know parallel infections throughout

3838
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:20,720
you know parallel infections throughout
 

3839
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,589
you know parallel infections throughout
the world right now

3840
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
the world right now
 

3841
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,950
the world right now
yes but so to perfect on that so yes so

3842
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:24,960
yes but so to perfect on that so yes so
 

3843
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,510
yes but so to perfect on that so yes so
then the

3844
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520
then the
 

3845
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,549
then the
the intelligence is in the mechanism but

3846
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
the intelligence is in the mechanism but
 

3847
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,750
the intelligence is in the mechanism but
then uh by that argument uh viruses

3848
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:31,760
then uh by that argument uh viruses
 

3849
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:32,950
then uh by that argument uh viruses
would be more intelligent because

3850
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960
would be more intelligent because
 

3851
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,630
would be more intelligent because
there's just more of them

3852
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:34,640
there's just more of them
 

3853
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,670
there's just more of them
so the search they're basically the the

3854
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:37,680
so the search they're basically the the
 

3855
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,309
so the search they're basically the the
brute force

3856
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:38,319
brute force
 

3857
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,230
brute force
search that's happening with viruses

3858
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:40,240
search that's happening with viruses
 

3859
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,670
search that's happening with viruses
because there's so many more of them

3860
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:41,680
because there's so many more of them
 

3861
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,270
because there's so many more of them
than humans

3862
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:43,280
than humans
 

3863
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,470
than humans
then they're taken as a whole are more

3864
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:46,480
then they're taken as a whole are more
 

3865
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,430
then they're taken as a whole are more
intelligent

3866
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,440
intelligent
 

3867
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,230
intelligent
i mean so you don't think it's possible

3868
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:50,240
i mean so you don't think it's possible
 

3869
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:50,789
i mean so you don't think it's possible
that

3870
01:04:50,789 --> 01:04:50,799
that
 

3871
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,910
that
i i mean who runs would we even be here

3872
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:53,920
i i mean who runs would we even be here
 

3873
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,510
i i mean who runs would we even be here
with if viruses weren't

3874
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:55,520
with if viruses weren't
 

3875
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,029
with if viruses weren't
i mean who runs this thing so

3876
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,039
i mean who runs this thing so
 

3877
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:01,190
i mean who runs this thing so
survivors so let me answer yeah let me

3878
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:01,200
survivors so let me answer yeah let me
 

3879
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,470
survivors so let me answer yeah let me
answer your your question

3880
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:02,480
answer your your question
 

3881
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,190
answer your your question
um so um

3882
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,200
um so um
 

3883
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,950
um so um
we would not be here if it wasn't for

3884
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:08,960
we would not be here if it wasn't for
 

3885
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,390
we would not be here if it wasn't for
viruses yes

3886
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:10,400
viruses yes
 

3887
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,910
viruses yes
and part of the reason is that if you

3888
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:11,920
and part of the reason is that if you
 

3889
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,430
and part of the reason is that if you
look at mammalian evolution

3890
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:13,440
look at mammalian evolution
 

3891
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,910
look at mammalian evolution
early on in this mammalian radiation

3892
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:15,920
early on in this mammalian radiation
 

3893
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,270
early on in this mammalian radiation
that basically happened after the death

3894
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:17,280
that basically happened after the death
 

3895
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,549
that basically happened after the death
of the dinosaurs

3896
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:18,559
of the dinosaurs
 

3897
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,109
of the dinosaurs
is that some of the viruses that we had

3898
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
is that some of the viruses that we had
 

3899
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,789
is that some of the viruses that we had
in our genome

3900
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
in our genome
 

3901
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,069
in our genome
spread throughout our genome and created

3902
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
spread throughout our genome and created
 

3903
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,390
spread throughout our genome and created
binding sites for new classes of

3904
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:28,400
binding sites for new classes of
 

3905
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,230
binding sites for new classes of
regulatory proteins

3906
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:30,240
regulatory proteins
 

3907
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,470
regulatory proteins
and these binding sites that landed all

3908
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:32,480
and these binding sites that landed all
 

3909
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,270
and these binding sites that landed all
over our genome

3910
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:33,280
over our genome
 

3911
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,510
over our genome
are now control elements that basically

3912
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
are now control elements that basically
 

3913
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,710
are now control elements that basically

control our genes
 

3915
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,510
control our genes
and sort of help the complexity of the

3916
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:39,520
and sort of help the complexity of the
 

3917
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,309
and sort of help the complexity of the
circuitry

3918
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:40,319
circuitry
 

3919
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:43,510
circuitry
of mammalian genomes so you know

3920
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
of mammalian genomes so you know
 

3921
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,829
of mammalian genomes so you know
everything's co-evolution and we're

3922
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:45,839
everything's co-evolution and we're
 

3923
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:46,789
everything's co-evolution and we're
working together

3924
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:46,799
working together
 

3925
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,589
working together
yeah but and yet you saw

3926
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:51,599

 

3927
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,870

they just don't care they don't care

3928
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:54,880
they just don't care they don't care
 

3929
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,390
they just don't care they don't care
another thing oh is the virus trying to

3930
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,400
another thing oh is the virus trying to
 

3931
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,549
another thing oh is the virus trying to
kill us no it's not the virus is not

3932
01:05:58,549 --> 01:05:58,559
kill us no it's not the virus is not
 

3933
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,510
kill us no it's not the virus is not
trying to kill you it's true

3934
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
trying to kill you it's true
 

3935
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,109
trying to kill you it's true
it's not it's actually actively trying

3936
01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:01,119
it's not it's actually actively trying
 

3937
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:02,710
it's not it's actually actively trying
to not kill you

3938
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:02,720
to not kill you
 

3939
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,829
to not kill you
so when you get infected if you die

3940
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:05,839
so when you get infected if you die
 

3941
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,309
so when you get infected if you die
palmer i killed him is what the reaction

3942
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:08,319
palmer i killed him is what the reaction
 

3943
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:09,670
palmer i killed him is what the reaction
of the virus will be why because that

3944
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:09,680
of the virus will be why because that
 

3945
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,990
of the virus will be why because that
virus won't spread

3946
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:12,000
virus won't spread
 

3947
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,829
virus won't spread
many people have a misconception of oh

3948
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:13,839
many people have a misconception of oh
 

3949
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,029
many people have a misconception of oh
viruses are smart or

3950
01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:15,039
viruses are smart or
 

3951
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,470
viruses are smart or
oh viruses are mean they don't care

3952
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:18,480
oh viruses are mean they don't care
 

3953
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,789
oh viruses are mean they don't care
it like you have to clean yourself of

3954
01:06:20,789 --> 01:06:20,799
it like you have to clean yourself of
 

3955
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,309
it like you have to clean yourself of
any kind of anthropomorphism

3956
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:22,319
any kind of anthropomorphism
 

3957
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:25,349
any kind of anthropomorphism
out there i don't know oh yes

3958
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:25,359
out there i don't know oh yes
 

3959
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:28,150
out there i don't know oh yes
so there's a there's a sense when taken

3960
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,160
so there's a there's a sense when taken
 

3961
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:31,589
so there's a there's a sense when taken
as a whole that there's

3962
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:31,599

 

3963
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,430

it's in a eye of the beholder stupid is

3964
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:33,440
it's in a eye of the beholder stupid is
 

3965
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,109
it's in a eye of the beholder stupid is
a stupid does intelligent injustice

3966
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:35,119
a stupid does intelligent injustice
 

3967
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:35,829
a stupid does intelligent injustice
intelligence does

3968
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839
intelligence does
 

3969
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,670
intelligence does
so if you want to call them intelligent

3970
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:37,680
so if you want to call them intelligent
 

3971
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,109
so if you want to call them intelligent
that's fine then because

3972
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:39,119
that's fine then because
 

3973
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,549
that's fine then because
and the end result is that they're

3974
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:40,559
and the end result is that they're
 

3975
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,309
and the end result is that they're
finding amazing solutions

3976
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:42,319
finding amazing solutions
 

3977
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,230
finding amazing solutions
right i mean i mean but they're all

3978
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:44,240
right i mean i mean but they're all
 

3979
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,829
right i mean i mean but they're all
they're so dumb about it they're just

3980
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
they're so dumb about it they're just
 

3981
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,190
they're so dumb about it they're just
doing dumb they don't care they're not

3982
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:47,200
doing dumb they don't care they're not
 

3983
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,549
doing dumb they don't care they're not
dumb and they're not interested

3984
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:48,559
dumb and they're not interested
 

3985
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,630
dumb and they're not interested
they don't care they care the care word

3986
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
they don't care they care the care word
 

3987
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,910
they don't care they care the care word
is really interesting exactly i mean

3988
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:51,920
is really interesting exactly i mean
 

3989
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,430
is really interesting exactly i mean
there could be an argument that they're

3990
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
there could be an argument that they're
 

3991
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,309
there could be an argument that they're
conscious

3992
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
conscious
 

3993
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,150
conscious
they're just dividing they're not

3994
01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:56,160
they're just dividing they're not
 

3995
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,589
they're just dividing they're not
they're just dividing

3996
01:06:57,589 --> 01:06:57,599
they're just dividing
 

3997
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,630
they're just dividing
they're just a little entity which

3998
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:00,640
they're just a little entity which
 

3999
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,789
they're just a little entity which
happens to be dividing and spreading it

4000
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:02,799
happens to be dividing and spreading it
 

4001
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,109
happens to be dividing and spreading it
does doesn't want to kill us in fact it

4002
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:05,119
does doesn't want to kill us in fact it
 

4003
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,309
does doesn't want to kill us in fact it
prefers not to kill us

4004
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:06,319
prefers not to kill us
 

4005
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,470
prefers not to kill us
it just wants to spread and when i say

4006
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:08,480
it just wants to spread and when i say
 

4007
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,029
it just wants to spread and when i say
once again i'm anthropomorphizing

4008
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:11,039
once again i'm anthropomorphizing
 

4009
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,990
once again i'm anthropomorphizing
but it's just that if you have two

4010
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,000
but it's just that if you have two
 

4011
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,670
but it's just that if you have two
versions of a virus one acquires a

4012
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:15,680
versions of a virus one acquires a
 

4013
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,270
versions of a virus one acquires a
mutation that spreads more

4014
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:17,280
mutation that spreads more
 

4015
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,029
mutation that spreads more
that's going to spread more one acquires

4016
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:19,039
that's going to spread more one acquires
 

4017
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,390
that's going to spread more one acquires
a mutation that's pressed less that's

4018
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,400
a mutation that's pressed less that's
 

4019
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,109
a mutation that's pressed less that's
going to be lost

4020
01:07:21,109 --> 01:07:21,119
going to be lost
 

4021
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,190
going to be lost
yes one acquires a mutation that enters

4022
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:23,200
yes one acquires a mutation that enters
 

4023
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,950
yes one acquires a mutation that enters
faster that's going to be kept

4024
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:24,960
faster that's going to be kept
 

4025
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,309
faster that's going to be kept
one requires a mutation that kills you

4026
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:26,319
one requires a mutation that kills you
 

4027
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,390
one requires a mutation that kills you
right away it's going to be lost

4028
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:28,400
right away it's going to be lost
 

4029
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,190
right away it's going to be lost
so over evolutionary time the viruses

4030
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:31,200
so over evolutionary time the viruses
 

4031
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,630
so over evolutionary time the viruses
that spread super well

4032
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,640
that spread super well
 

4033
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,230
that spread super well
but don't kill the host are the ones

4034
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:34,240
but don't kill the host are the ones
 

4035
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,150
but don't kill the host are the ones
that are going to survive

4036
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:36,160
that are going to survive
 

4037
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,630
that are going to survive
yeah but so you see you brilliantly

4038
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:38,640
yeah but so you see you brilliantly
 

4039
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,470
yeah but so you see you brilliantly
describe the basic mechanisms of how it

4040
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:40,480
describe the basic mechanisms of how it
 

4041
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,990
describe the basic mechanisms of how it
all happens but when you zoom out

4042
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,000
all happens but when you zoom out
 

4043
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,910
all happens but when you zoom out
and you see the uh you know the entirety

4044
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:45,920
and you see the uh you know the entirety
 

4045
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,829
and you see the uh you know the entirety
of viruses maybe across

4046
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:47,839
of viruses maybe across
 

4047
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,549
of viruses maybe across
different strains of viruses it seems

4048
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559
different strains of viruses it seems
 

4049
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,309
different strains of viruses it seems
like a living organism

4050
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:52,319
like a living organism
 

4051
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,630

01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,149
one protein from each rna molecule they
don't make two they make one

4074
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
don't make two they make one
 

4075
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,910
don't make two they make one
we are hardwired to make only one

4076
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:21,920
we are hardwired to make only one
 

4077
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,749
we are hardwired to make only one
protein from every rna molecule

4078
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:23,759
protein from every rna molecule
 

4079
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:26,149
protein from every rna molecule
and yet this virus goes in throws in a

4080
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:26,159
and yet this virus goes in throws in a
 

4081
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:28,630
and yet this virus goes in throws in a
single messenger rna

4082
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
single messenger rna
 

4083
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,390
single messenger rna
just like any messenger rna we have tens

4084
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:30,400
just like any messenger rna we have tens
 

4085
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,390
just like any messenger rna we have tens
of thousands of messenger rnas in our

4086
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:32,400
of thousands of messenger rnas in our
 

4087
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,990
of thousands of messenger rnas in our
cells in any one time

4088
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:34,000
cells in any one time
 

4089
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,550
cells in any one time
in every one of our cells it throws in

4090
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:36,560
in every one of our cells it throws in
 

4091
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,430
in every one of our cells it throws in
one rna

4092
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,440
one rna
 

4093
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,470
one rna
and that rna is so

4094
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:40,480
and that rna is so
 

4095
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,990
and that rna is so
i'm going to use your word here not my

4096
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
i'm going to use your word here not my
 

4097
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,590
i'm going to use your word here not my
word intelligent

4098
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,600
word intelligent
 

4099
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,910
word intelligent
yeah that it hijacks the entire

4100
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:45,920
yeah that it hijacks the entire
 

4101
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,110
yeah that it hijacks the entire
machinery of

4102
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:47,120
machinery of
 

4103
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,470
machinery of
your human cell yeah it basically

4104
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:50,480
your human cell yeah it basically
 

4105
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:53,669
your human cell yeah it basically
has at the beginning a giant open

4106
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:53,679
has at the beginning a giant open
 

4107
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:54,390
has at the beginning a giant open
reading frame

4108
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:54,400
reading frame
 

4109
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,910
reading frame
that's a giant protein that gets

4110
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:55,920
that's a giant protein that gets
 

4111
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,269
that's a giant protein that gets
translated two-thirds of that rna

4112
01:08:59,269 --> 01:08:59,279
translated two-thirds of that rna
 

4113
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,149
translated two-thirds of that rna
make a single giant protein that single

4114
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:02,159
make a single giant protein that single
 

4115
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:02,789
make a single giant protein that single
protein

4116
01:09:02,789 --> 01:09:02,799
protein
 

4117
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:04,229
protein
is basically what a human cell would

4118
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:04,239
is basically what a human cell would
 

4119
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:06,229
is basically what a human cell would
make it's like oh here's a start codon

4120
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
make it's like oh here's a start codon
 

4121
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,590
make it's like oh here's a start codon
i'm going to start translating here

4122
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:07,600
i'm going to start translating here
 

4123
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,870
i'm going to start translating here
human cells are kind of dumb i'm sorry

4124
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
human cells are kind of dumb i'm sorry
 

4125
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,789
human cells are kind of dumb i'm sorry
again this is

4126
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:10,799
again this is
 

4127
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,390
again this is
not the word that we normally use but

4128
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:12,400
not the word that we normally use but
 

4129
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,829
not the word that we normally use but
the human cell basically is oh this is

4130
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:13,839
the human cell basically is oh this is
 

4131
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,829
the human cell basically is oh this is
an rna it must be mine let me translate

4132
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:15,839
an rna it must be mine let me translate
 

4133
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,510
an rna it must be mine let me translate
and it starts translating it and then

4134
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:17,520
and it starts translating it and then
 

4135
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,110
and it starts translating it and then
you're in trouble why

4136
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:19,120
you're in trouble why
 

4137
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,390
you're in trouble why
because that one protein as it's growing

4138
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400
because that one protein as it's growing
 

4139
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,669
because that one protein as it's growing
gets cleaved into about 20 different

4140
01:09:25,669 --> 01:09:25,679
gets cleaved into about 20 different
 

4141
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,030
gets cleaved into about 20 different
peptides

4142
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:27,040
peptides
 

4143
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,829
peptides
the first peptide and the second peptide

4144
01:09:29,829 --> 01:09:29,839
the first peptide and the second peptide
 

4145
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:30,149
the first peptide and the second peptide
start

4146
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:30,159
start
 

4147
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:31,749
start
interacting and the third one and the

4148
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:31,759
interacting and the third one and the
 

4149
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,349
interacting and the third one and the
fourth one and they

4150
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:33,359
fourth one and they
 

4151
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,749
fourth one and they
shut off the ribosome of the whole cell

4152
01:09:37,749 --> 01:09:37,759
shut off the ribosome of the whole cell
 

4153
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,870
shut off the ribosome of the whole cell
to not translate human

4154
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:40,880
to not translate human
 

4155
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,309
to not translate human
rnas anymore so the virus basically

4156
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:44,319
rnas anymore so the virus basically
 

4157
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,189
rnas anymore so the virus basically
hijacks

4158
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:45,199
hijacks
 

4159
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:48,550
hijacks
your cells and it cuts it cleaves every

4160
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:48,560
your cells and it cuts it cleaves every
 

4161
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,630
your cells and it cuts it cleaves every
one of your human rnas

4162
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:50,640
one of your human rnas
 

4163
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,149
one of your human rnas
to basically say to the ribosome don't

4164
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:52,159
to basically say to the ribosome don't
 

4165
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:53,829
to basically say to the ribosome don't
translate this one junk don't look at

4166
01:09:53,829 --> 01:09:53,839
translate this one junk don't look at
 

4167
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,110
translate this one junk don't look at
this one junk

4168
01:09:55,110 --> 01:09:55,120
this one junk
 

4169
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,630
this one junk
and it only spares its own rnas

4170
01:09:58,630 --> 01:09:58,640
and it only spares its own rnas
 

4171
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,070
and it only spares its own rnas
because they have a particular mark that

4172
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:00,080
because they have a particular mark that
 

4173
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,870
because they have a particular mark that
it spares then all of the ribosomes that

4174
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:02,880
it spares then all of the ribosomes that
 

4175
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,229
it spares then all of the ribosomes that
normally make protein

4176
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:04,239
normally make protein
 

4177
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,870
normally make protein
in your human cells are now only able to

4178
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:06,880
in your human cells are now only able to
 

4179
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,830
in your human cells are now only able to
translate

4180
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:07,840
translate
 

4181
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,990
translate
viral rnas and make more and more and

4182
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,000
viral rnas and make more and more and
 

4183
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,350
viral rnas and make more and more and
more and more of them

4184
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:11,360
more and more of them
 

4185
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,830
more and more of them
that's the first 20 proteins in fact

4186
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:13,840
that's the first 20 proteins in fact
 

4187
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,189
that's the first 20 proteins in fact
halfway down about

4188
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:15,199
halfway down about
 

4189
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,830
halfway down about
protein 11 between you know 11 and 12

4190
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:17,840
protein 11 between you know 11 and 12
 

4191
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,750
protein 11 between you know 11 and 12
you basically have a translational

4192
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:19,760
you basically have a translational
 

4193
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,229
you basically have a translational
slippage where the ribosome skips

4194
01:10:22,229 --> 01:10:22,239
slippage where the ribosome skips
 

4195
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,270
slippage where the ribosome skips
reading frame

4196
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:23,280
reading frame
 

4197
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,870
reading frame
and it translates from one reading frame

4198
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:24,880
and it translates from one reading frame
 

4199
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,070
and it translates from one reading frame
to another reading frame that means that

4200
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:26,080
to another reading frame that means that
 

4201
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,350
to another reading frame that means that
about half of them are going to be

4202
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,360
about half of them are going to be
 

4203
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,630
about half of them are going to be
translated from 1 to

4204
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:28,640
translated from 1 to
 

4205
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,390
translated from 1 to
11 and the other half are going to be

4206
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:30,400
11 and the other half are going to be
 

4207
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,149
11 and the other half are going to be
translated from 12 to 16.

4208
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:32,159
translated from 12 to 16.
 

4209
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:36,470
translated from 12 to 16.
wow it's gorgeous and then

4210
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:36,480
wow it's gorgeous and then
 

4211
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,550
wow it's gorgeous and then
then you're done then that mrna will

4212
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,560
then you're done then that mrna will
 

4213
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,550
then you're done then that mrna will
never translate elastin proteins but

4214
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:40,560
never translate elastin proteins but
 

4215
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,550
never translate elastin proteins but
spike is the one right after that one so

4216
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,560
spike is the one right after that one so
 

4217
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,030
spike is the one right after that one so
how does spike even get translated

4218
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,040
how does spike even get translated
 

4219
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,310
how does spike even get translated
this positive strand rna virus has a

4220
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:48,320
this positive strand rna virus has a
 

4221
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,910
this positive strand rna virus has a
reverse transcriptase

4222
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:49,920
reverse transcriptase
 

4223
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,510
reverse transcriptase
which is an rna-based reverse

4224
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:51,520
which is an rna-based reverse
 

4225
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,750
which is an rna-based reverse
transcriptase so from the rna on the

4226
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:53,760
transcriptase so from the rna on the
 

4227
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,350
transcriptase so from the rna on the
positive strand it makes an rna of the

4228
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:55,360
positive strand it makes an rna of the
 

4229
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,870
positive strand it makes an rna of the
negative strand

4230
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,880
negative strand
 

4231
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,189
negative strand
and in between every single one of these

4232
01:10:59,189 --> 01:10:59,199
and in between every single one of these
 

4233
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,950
and in between every single one of these
genes these open reading frames

4234
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:00,960
genes these open reading frames
 

4235
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,709
genes these open reading frames
there's a little signal aac gca or

4236
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:04,719
there's a little signal aac gca or
 

4237
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:05,430
there's a little signal aac gca or
something like that

01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:05,440
something like that
 

4239
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,750
something like that
that basically loops over to the

01:11:23,590 --> 01:11:23,600
these negative strand rnas now make
 

4261
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,189
these negative strand rnas now make
positive strand rnas

positive strand rnas
 

4263
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,350
positive strand rnas
that then look to the human whole cell

4264
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,360
that then look to the human whole cell
 

4265
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,790
that then look to the human whole cell
just like any other

just like any other
 

4267
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,630
just like any other
human mrna it's like oh great i'm going

have the cleaving that the virus has now

4272
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:33,840
have the cleaving that the virus has now
 

4273
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,229
have the cleaving that the virus has now
put on all your human genes

4274
01:11:36,229 --> 01:11:36,239
put on all your human genes
 

4275
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:38,630
put on all your human genes
and then you've lost the battle that

4276
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:38,640
and then you've lost the battle that
 

4277
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,110
and then you've lost the battle that
cell is now only making proteins for the

virus
 

4281
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,430
virus
that will then create the spike protein

4282
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:45,440
that will then create the spike protein
 

4283
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,110
that will then create the spike protein
the envelope protein the membrane

protein the nucleocapsid protein that
 

4287
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,470
protein the nucleocapsid protein that
will package up the rna

4288
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:50,480
will package up the rna
 

4289
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,470
will package up the rna
and then sort of create new viral

4290
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
and then sort of create new viral
 

4291
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:53,750
and then sort of create new viral
envelopes

envelopes
 

4293
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,470
envelopes
and these will then be secreted out of

4294
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
and these will then be secreted out of
 

4295
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,669
and these will then be secreted out of
that cell

4296
01:11:57,669 --> 01:11:57,679
that cell
 

4297
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,590
that cell
in new little packages that will then

4298
01:11:59,590 --> 01:11:59,600
in new little packages that will then
 

4299
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,030
in new little packages that will then
infect the rest of the cells and repeat

4300
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:01,040
infect the rest of the cells and repeat
 

4301
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:01,990
infect the rest of the cells and repeat
the whole process

4302
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:02,000
the whole process
 

4303
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,390
the whole process
beautiful right it's hard not to

4304
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:04,400
beautiful right it's hard not to
 

4305
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,229
beautiful right it's hard not to
anthropomorphize it

4306
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
anthropomorphize it
 

4307
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,950
anthropomorphize it
oh but it's so gorgeous so there is a

4308
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:08,960
oh but it's so gorgeous so there is a
 

4309
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,070
oh but it's so gorgeous so there is a
beauty to it

4310
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:10,080
beauty to it
 

4311
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,910
beauty to it
is there is it is it terrifying to you

4312
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:13,920
is there is it is it terrifying to you
 

4313
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,830
is there is it is it terrifying to you
so this is something that has happened

4314
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:15,840
so this is something that has happened
 

4315
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,070
so this is something that has happened
throughout history humans have been

4316
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,080
throughout history humans have been
 

4317
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,790
throughout history humans have been
nearly wiped out over and over and over

4318
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:20,800
nearly wiped out over and over and over
 

4319
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,189
nearly wiped out over and over and over
again and yet never fully wiped out

4320
01:12:23,189 --> 01:12:23,199
again and yet never fully wiped out
 

4321
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,110
again and yet never fully wiped out
so i'm yeah i'm not concerned about the

4322
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,120
so i'm yeah i'm not concerned about the
 

4323
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,350
so i'm yeah i'm not concerned about the
human race i'm not even concerned about

4324
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:27,360
human race i'm not even concerned about
 

4325
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,709
human race i'm not even concerned about
you know the impact on sort of our

4326
01:12:30,709 --> 01:12:30,719
you know the impact on sort of our
 

4327
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,750
you know the impact on sort of our
our survival as a species um

4328
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:33,760
our survival as a species um
 

4329
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,229
our survival as a species um
this is absolutely something i mean you

4330
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
this is absolutely something i mean you
 

4331
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:36,790
this is absolutely something i mean you
know

4332
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:36,800
know
 

4333
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,870
know
human life is so invaluable and every

4334
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
human life is so invaluable and every
 

4335
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,310
human life is so invaluable and every
one of us is so invaluable but if you

4336
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:40,320
one of us is so invaluable but if you
 

4337
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,030
one of us is so invaluable but if you
think of it

4338
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,040
think of it
 

4339
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,870
think of it
as sort of is this the end of our

4340
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:42,880
as sort of is this the end of our
 

4341
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,070
as sort of is this the end of our
species

4342
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:44,080
species
 

4343
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,270
species
by by no means basically so so let me

4344
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:47,280
by by no means basically so so let me
 

4345
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:47,990
by by no means basically so so let me
explain

4346
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:48,000
explain
 

4347
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,229
explain
the black death killed what 30 of europe

4348
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:52,239
the black death killed what 30 of europe
 

4349
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:56,229
the black death killed what 30 of europe
that has left a tremendous imprint

4350
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
that has left a tremendous imprint
 

4351
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:59,430
that has left a tremendous imprint
uh you know a huge hole a horrendous

4352
01:12:59,430 --> 01:12:59,440
uh you know a huge hole a horrendous
 

4353
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,229
uh you know a huge hole a horrendous
hole

4354
01:13:00,229 --> 01:13:00,239
hole
 

4355
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:04,630
hole
in the genetic makeup of humans

4356
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:04,640
in the genetic makeup of humans
 

4357
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,910
in the genetic makeup of humans
there's been series of wiping out of

4358
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:07,920
there's been series of wiping out of
 

4359
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,189
there's been series of wiping out of
huge fractions of entire species or just

4360
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:11,199
huge fractions of entire species or just
 

4361
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:13,110
huge fractions of entire species or just
entire species all together

4362
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:13,120
entire species all together
 

4363
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,229
entire species all together
and that has a consequence on

4364
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:16,239
and that has a consequence on
 

4365
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:19,510
and that has a consequence on
the human immune repertoire

4366
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:19,520
the human immune repertoire
 

4367
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,189
the human immune repertoire
if you look at how europe was shaped

4368
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:23,199
if you look at how europe was shaped
 

4369
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,070
if you look at how europe was shaped
and how africa was shaped by malaria for

4370
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080
and how africa was shaped by malaria for
 

4371
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,189
and how africa was shaped by malaria for
example

4372
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:27,199
example
 

4373
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:28,790
example
all the individuals that carry a

4374
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:28,800
all the individuals that carry a
 

4375
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,669
all the individuals that carry a
mutation that protected from malaria

4376
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
mutation that protected from malaria
 

4377
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,750
mutation that protected from malaria
were able to survive much more and if

4378
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:33,760
were able to survive much more and if
 

4379
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,030
were able to survive much more and if
you look at the frequency

4380
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:35,040
you look at the frequency
 

4381
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,870
you look at the frequency
of sickle cell disease and the frequency

4382
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:36,880
of sickle cell disease and the frequency
 

4383
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,149
of sickle cell disease and the frequency
of malaria

4384
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:38,159
of malaria
 

4385
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,229
of malaria
the maps are actually showing the same

4386
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:40,239
the maps are actually showing the same
 

4387
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,870
the maps are actually showing the same
pattern the same imprint on africa

4388
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:42,880
pattern the same imprint on africa
 

4389
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,149
pattern the same imprint on africa
and that basically led people to

4390
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:44,159
and that basically led people to
 

4391
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:45,590
and that basically led people to
hypothesize that the reason why sickle

4392
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:45,600
hypothesize that the reason why sickle
 

4393
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,669
hypothesize that the reason why sickle
cell disease is so much more frequent

4394
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
cell disease is so much more frequent
 

4395
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,149
cell disease is so much more frequent
in americans of african descent is

4396
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:50,159
in americans of african descent is
 

4397
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,709
in americans of african descent is
because there was selection in africa

4398
01:13:52,709 --> 01:13:52,719
because there was selection in africa
 

4399
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:56,550
because there was selection in africa
against malaria leading to sickle cell

4400
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:56,560
against malaria leading to sickle cell
 

4401
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,149
against malaria leading to sickle cell
because when the cells sickle malaria is

4402
01:13:58,149 --> 01:13:58,159
because when the cells sickle malaria is
 

4403
01:13:58,159 --> 01:13:58,950
because when the cells sickle malaria is
not able to

4404
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:58,960
not able to
 

4405
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,790
not able to
you know replicate inside your cells as

4406
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:00,800
you know replicate inside your cells as
 

4407
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,390
you know replicate inside your cells as
well and therefore you protect against

4408
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:02,400
well and therefore you protect against
 

4409
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,030
well and therefore you protect against
that

4410
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,040
that
 

4411
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,590
that
so if you look at human disease all of

4412
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:05,600
so if you look at human disease all of
 

4413
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,430
so if you look at human disease all of
the genetic associations that we do

4414
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:07,440
the genetic associations that we do
 

4415
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:10,950
the genetic associations that we do
with human disease you basically see

4416
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:10,960
with human disease you basically see
 

4417
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,390
with human disease you basically see
the imprint of these

4418
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
the imprint of these
 

4419
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,470
the imprint of these
waves of selection killing off

4420
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
waves of selection killing off
 

4421
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,310
waves of selection killing off
gazillions of humans

4422
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:18,320
gazillions of humans
 

4423
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,350
gazillions of humans
and there's so many immune

4424
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:21,360
and there's so many immune
 

4425
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,510
and there's so many immune
processes that are coming up as

4426
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:23,520
processes that are coming up as
 

4427
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,709
processes that are coming up as
associated with so many different

4428
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:24,719
associated with so many different
 

4429
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:25,830
associated with so many different
diseases

4430
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:25,840
diseases
 

4431
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,669
diseases
the reason for that is similar to what i

4432
01:14:27,669 --> 01:14:27,679
the reason for that is similar to what i
 

4433
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,270
the reason for that is similar to what i
was describing earlier where the

4434
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:29,280
was describing earlier where the
 

4435
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,310
was describing earlier where the
outward facing proteins evolve much more

4436
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:32,320
outward facing proteins evolve much more
 

4437
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,590
outward facing proteins evolve much more
rapidly

4438
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:33,600
rapidly
 

4439
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,790
rapidly
because the environment is always

4440
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
because the environment is always
 

4441
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,630
because the environment is always
changing but what's really interesting

4442
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:36,640
changing but what's really interesting
 

4443
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,310
changing but what's really interesting
the human genome is that we have

4444
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,320
the human genome is that we have
 

4445
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,390
the human genome is that we have
co-opted many of these immune genes to

4446
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:40,400
co-opted many of these immune genes to
 

4447
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,310
co-opted many of these immune genes to
carry out non-immune functions

4448
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:42,320
carry out non-immune functions
 

4449
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,950
carry out non-immune functions
for example in our brain we use immune

4450
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:44,960
for example in our brain we use immune
 

4451
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,910
for example in our brain we use immune

01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,030
the u.s will get attacked together and
stop the virus from

4528
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
stop the virus from
 

4529
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,229
stop the virus from
spreading further but if it doesn't it's

4530
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:02,239
spreading further but if it doesn't it's
 

4531
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:03,430
spreading further but if it doesn't it's
having an imprint

genetic repertoires
 

4537
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:08,630
genetic repertoires
so if you look at now the genetic

4538
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:08,640
so if you look at now the genetic
 

4539
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,110
so if you look at now the genetic
associations of blood type

4540
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:11,120
associations of blood type
 

4541
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,830
associations of blood type
and immune function cells etc there's

4542
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:13,840
and immune function cells etc there's
 

4543
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,590
and immune function cells etc there's
actually association genetic variation

4544
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:15,600
actually association genetic variation
 

4545
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,950
actually association genetic variation
that basically says how much more likely

4546
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:16,960
that basically says how much more likely
 

4547
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,390
that basically says how much more likely

01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:30,560
and uh selection
 

4559
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,950
and uh selection
is ruthless and it's brutal and it only

4560
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:32,960
is ruthless and it's brutal and it only
 

4561
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,310
is ruthless and it's brutal and it only
comes with a lot of killing

4562
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
comes with a lot of killing
 

4563
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,430
comes with a lot of killing
but this is the way that viruses and

4564
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:37,440
but this is the way that viruses and
 

4565
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,030
but this is the way that viruses and
environments have shaped the human

4566
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:39,040
environments have shaped the human
 

4567
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,149
environments have shaped the human
genome basically when you go through

4568
01:16:40,149 --> 01:16:40,159
genome basically when you go through
 

4569
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:41,350
genome basically when you go through
periods of famine

4570
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:41,360
periods of famine
 

4571
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,830
periods of famine
you select for particular genes and

4572
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:43,840
you select for particular genes and
 

4573
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,790
you select for particular genes and
what's left

4574
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:44,800
what's left
 

4575
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,189
what's left
is not necessarily better it's just

4576
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:47,199
is not necessarily better it's just
 

4577
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,950
is not necessarily better it's just
whatever survived

4578
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:48,960
whatever survived
 

4579
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,270
whatever survived
and it may have been the surviving one

4580
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:51,280
and it may have been the surviving one
 

4581
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,950
and it may have been the surviving one
back then not because it was better

4582
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:52,960
back then not because it was better
 

4583
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,870
back then not because it was better
maybe the ones that ran slower survived

4584
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
maybe the ones that ran slower survived
 

4585
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,630
maybe the ones that ran slower survived
i mean you know again not necessarily

4586
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:56,640
i mean you know again not necessarily
 

4587
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,270
i mean you know again not necessarily
better

4588
01:16:57,270 --> 01:16:57,280
better
 

4589
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,669
better
but the surviving ones are basically the

4590
01:16:59,669 --> 01:16:59,679
but the surviving ones are basically the
 

4591
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:00,470
but the surviving ones are basically the
ones that then

4592
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
ones that then
 

4593
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,430
ones that then
are shaped for any kind of subsequent

4594
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:03,440
are shaped for any kind of subsequent
 

4595
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,709
are shaped for any kind of subsequent

4599
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,149

but if you look at

4600
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
but if you look at
 

4601
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,950
but if you look at
for example obesity obesity was selected

4602
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:10,960
for example obesity obesity was selected
 

4603
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,590
for example obesity obesity was selected
for

4604
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:11,600
for
 

4605
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,189
for
basically the genes that now predisposes

4606
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199
basically the genes that now predisposes
 

4607
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,430
basically the genes that now predisposes
to obesity were at two percent frequency

4608
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:15,440
to obesity were at two percent frequency
 

4609
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,550
to obesity were at two percent frequency
in africa

4610
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
in africa
 

4611
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,270
in africa
they rose to 44 frequency in europe wow

4612
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,280
they rose to 44 frequency in europe wow
 

4613
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,229
they rose to 44 frequency in europe wow
that's fascinating

4614
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:20,239
that's fascinating
 

4615
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,669
that's fascinating
because you basically went through the

4616
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:21,679
because you basically went through the
 

4617
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:23,910
because you basically went through the
ice ages and there was a scarcity of

4618
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:23,920
ice ages and there was a scarcity of
 

4619
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,550
ice ages and there was a scarcity of
food

4620
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:24,560
food
 

4621
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,070
food
so you know there was a selection to

4622
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:26,080
so you know there was a selection to
 

4623
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,070
so you know there was a selection to
being able to store every single

4624
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,080
being able to store every single
 

4625
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,669
being able to store every single
calorie you consume eventually

4626
01:17:31,669 --> 01:17:31,679
calorie you consume eventually
 

4627
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,390
calorie you consume eventually
environment changes so the better allele

4628
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,400
environment changes so the better allele
 

4629
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,270
environment changes so the better allele
which was the

4630
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
which was the
 

4631
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,110
which was the
fat storing allele became the worst

4632
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:37,120
fat storing allele became the worst
 

4633
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,709
fat storing allele became the worst
allele because it's

4634
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:38,719
allele because it's
 

4635
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:40,870
allele because it's
the fat storing allele it still has the

4636
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:40,880
the fat storing allele it still has the
 

4637
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,390
the fat storing allele it still has the
same function

4638
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:42,400
same function
 

4639
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,470
same function
so if you look at my genome speaking of

4640
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:44,480
so if you look at my genome speaking of
 

4641
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,590
so if you look at my genome speaking of
mom calling

4642
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:45,600
mom calling
 

4643
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,149
mom calling
mom gave me a bad copy of that gene

4644
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:48,159
mom gave me a bad copy of that gene
 

4645
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,830
mom gave me a bad copy of that gene
these fto locus

4646
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:49,840
these fto locus
 

4647
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:52,550
these fto locus
basically has to do with the obesity or

4648
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:52,560
basically has to do with the obesity or
 

4649
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,350
basically has to do with the obesity or
the obesity

4650
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:53,360
the obesity
 

4651
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,270
the obesity
yeah i basically now have a bad copy

4652
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:55,280
yeah i basically now have a bad copy
 

4653
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,110
yeah i basically now have a bad copy
from mom that makes me more likely to be

4654
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,120
from mom that makes me more likely to be
 

4655
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:58,790
from mom that makes me more likely to be
obese and i also

4656
01:17:58,790 --> 01:17:58,800
obese and i also
 

4657
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,550
obese and i also
also have a bad copy from dad that makes

4658
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:00,560
also have a bad copy from dad that makes
 

4659
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,669
also have a bad copy from dad that makes
me more likely to be obese i'm

4660
01:18:01,669 --> 01:18:01,679
me more likely to be obese i'm
 

4661
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,270
me more likely to be obese i'm

homozygous
 

4663
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,390
homozygous
and that's the allele

4664
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:06,400
and that's the allele
 

4665
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,910
and that's the allele
it's still the minor allele but it's at

4666
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:07,920
it's still the minor allele but it's at
 

4667
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,669
it's still the minor allele but it's at

even though it started at 2
 

4673
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:16,470
even though it started at 2
it was an awesome allele to have 100

4674
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:16,480
it was an awesome allele to have 100
 

4675
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,430
it was an awesome allele to have 100

01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:20,239
right now it's pretty terrible so the
 

4679
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:23,510
right now it's pretty terrible so the
other concept is that diversity matters

we'd be in trouble you need diversity

4686
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:31,840
we'd be in trouble you need diversity
 

4687
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,750
we'd be in trouble you need diversity
you need artists and you need musicians

4688
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
you need artists and you need musicians
 

4689
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,510
you need artists and you need musicians
and you need mathematicians and you need

01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:35,520
and you need mathematicians and you need
 

4691
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,229
and you need mathematicians and you need
you know politicians yes even those and

01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:38,239
you know politicians yes even those and
 

4693
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:38,950
you know politicians yes even those and
you need like

4694
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:38,960
you need like
 

4695
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,870
you need like
it's not it's not get crazy enough but

4696
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:40,880
it's not it's not get crazy enough but
 

4697
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,430
it's not it's not get crazy enough but
so because then if uh virus comes along

4698
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:43,440
so because then if uh virus comes along
 

4699
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,149
so because then if uh virus comes along
or whatever

4700
01:18:44,149 --> 01:18:44,159
or whatever
 

4701
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:46,630
or whatever
exactly exactly so no there's two

4702
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:46,640
exactly exactly so no there's two
 

4703
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,669
exactly exactly so no there's two
reasons number one

4704
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:47,679
reasons number one
 

4705
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,830
reasons number one
you want diversity and immune repertoire

4706
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:49,840
you want diversity and immune repertoire
 

4707
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,830
you want diversity and immune repertoire
and we have built in diversity

4708
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840
and we have built in diversity
 

4709
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,750
and we have built in diversity
so basically they're they are the most

4710
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:53,760
so basically they're they are the most
 

4711
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,030
so basically they're they are the most
diverse basically if you look at our

4712
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:55,040
diverse basically if you look at our
 

4713
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,630
diverse basically if you look at our
immune system there's layers and layers

4714
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:56,640
immune system there's layers and layers
 

4715
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,750
immune system there's layers and layers
of diversity

4716
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:57,760
of diversity
 

4717
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,110
of diversity
like the way that you create your cells

4718
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:01,120
like the way that you create your cells
 

4719
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,110
like the way that you create your cells
generates diversity because of the

4720
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
generates diversity because of the
 

4721
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,310
generates diversity because of the
selection for the

4722
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
selection for the
 

4723
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,990
selection for the
vdj recombination that basically

4724
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,000
vdj recombination that basically
 

4725
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,910
vdj recombination that basically
eventually leads to a huge number of

4726
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:07,920
eventually leads to a huge number of
 

4727
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,709
eventually leads to a huge number of
repertoires

4728
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:08,719
repertoires
 

4729
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,310
repertoires
but that's only one small component of

4730
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,320
but that's only one small component of
 

4731
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:12,149
but that's only one small component of
diversity the blood type is another one

4732
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:12,159
diversity the blood type is another one
 

4733
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:13,790
diversity the blood type is another one
the major histogram

4734
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:13,800
the major histogram
 

4735
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,830
the major histogram
histocompatibility complex the hla

4736
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:15,840
histocompatibility complex the hla
 

4737
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,030
histocompatibility complex the hla
alleles are

4738
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:17,040
alleles are
 

4739
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:19,270
alleles are
you know another source of diversity so

4740
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:19,280
you know another source of diversity so
 

4741
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,030
you know another source of diversity so
the immune system of humans

4742
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:21,040
the immune system of humans
 

4743
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,310
the immune system of humans
is by nature incredibly diverse

4744
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,320
is by nature incredibly diverse
 

4745
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,390
is by nature incredibly diverse
and that basically leads to resilience

4746
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:26,400
and that basically leads to resilience
 

4747
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,750
and that basically leads to resilience
so basically what i'm saying that

4748
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:27,760
so basically what i'm saying that
 

4749
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,390
so basically what i'm saying that
i don't worry for the human species

4750
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
i don't worry for the human species
 

4751
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,070
i don't worry for the human species
because we are so diverse

4752
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:32,080
because we are so diverse
 

4753
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,430
because we are so diverse
immunologically

4754
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:33,440
immunologically
 

4755
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,830
immunologically
we are likely to be very resilient

4756
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:35,840
we are likely to be very resilient
 

4757
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,630
we are likely to be very resilient
against

4758
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:36,640
against
 

4759
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,189
against
so many different attacks like this

4760
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:39,199
so many different attacks like this
 

4761
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,870
so many different attacks like this
current virus so you're saying

4762
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:40,880
current virus so you're saying
 

4763
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,950
current virus so you're saying
natural pandemics may not be something

4764
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:42,960
natural pandemics may not be something
 

4765
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,550
natural pandemics may not be something
that you're really afraid of

4766
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:44,560
that you're really afraid of
 

4767
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,669
that you're really afraid of
because of the diversity in our

4768
01:19:47,669 --> 01:19:47,679
because of the diversity in our
 

4769
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,390
because of the diversity in our
genetic makeup what about engineered

4770
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
genetic makeup what about engineered
 

4771
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,270
genetic makeup what about engineered
pandemics

4772
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:51,280
pandemics
 

4773
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:55,030
pandemics
do you have fears of us messing

4774
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:55,040
do you have fears of us messing
 

4775
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,390
do you have fears of us messing
with the makeup of viruses or well yeah

4776
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:58,400
with the makeup of viruses or well yeah
 

4777
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,990
with the makeup of viruses or well yeah
let's say with the makeup of viruses to

4778
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,000
let's say with the makeup of viruses to
 

4779
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,669
let's say with the makeup of viruses to
create something that we can't control

4780
01:20:01,669 --> 01:20:01,679
create something that we can't control
 

4781
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:03,669
create something that we can't control
and we'd be much more destructive

4782
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:03,679
and we'd be much more destructive
 

4783
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,149
and we'd be much more destructive
than it would come about naturally

4784
01:20:06,149 --> 01:20:06,159
than it would come about naturally
 

4785
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:07,270
than it would come about naturally
remember how we were talking about how

4786
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,280
remember how we were talking about how
 

4787
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,870
remember how we were talking about how
smart evolution is

4788
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:08,880
smart evolution is
 

4789
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,590
smart evolution is
humans are much dumber so you mean like

4790
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:11,600
humans are much dumber so you mean like
 

4791
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,030
humans are much dumber so you mean like
human scientists yeah

4792
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,040
human scientists yeah
 

4793
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,030
human scientists yeah
humans humans just humans overall yeah

4794
01:20:17,030 --> 01:20:17,040
humans humans just humans overall yeah
 

4795
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,430
humans humans just humans overall yeah
but i mean even you know the sort of

4796
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:19,440
but i mean even you know the sort of
 

4797
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,629
but i mean even you know the sort of
synthetic biologists

4798
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:20,639
synthetic biologists
 

4799
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,750
synthetic biologists
um you know basically

4800
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:23,760
um you know basically
 

4801
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,270
um you know basically
if you were to create a you know

4802
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:27,280
if you were to create a you know
 

4803
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,550
if you were to create a you know
virus like sars that will kill other

4804
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:30,560
virus like sars that will kill other
 

4805
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,990
virus like sars that will kill other
people you would probably stars

4806
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:32,000
people you would probably stars
 

4807
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,590
people you would probably stars
start with stars so whoever

4808
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
start with stars so whoever
 

4809
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,310
start with stars so whoever
you know would like to design such a

4810
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:38,320
you know would like to design such a
 

4811
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,310
you know would like to design such a
thing would basically start with stars

4812
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,320
thing would basically start with stars
 

4813
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:43,510
thing would basically start with stars
tree or at least some relative of stars

4814
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:43,520
tree or at least some relative of stars
 

4815
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,629
tree or at least some relative of stars
the source genome for the current virus

4816
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:46,639
the source genome for the current virus
 

4817
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,229
the source genome for the current virus
was something completely different it

4818
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:48,239
was something completely different it
 

4819
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,669
was something completely different it
was something that has never infected

4820
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:49,679
was something that has never infected
 

4821
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:50,550
was something that has never infected
humans

4822
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:50,560
humans
 

4823
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,830
humans
no one in their right mind would have

4824
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:51,840
no one in their right mind would have
 

4825
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,590
no one in their right mind would have
started there oh but when you say source

4826
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:53,600
started there oh but when you say source
 

4827
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,870
started there oh but when you say source
is like the nearest

4828
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:54,880
is like the nearest
 

4829
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,950
is like the nearest
the nearest relative relative he's in a

4830
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:56,960
the nearest relative relative he's in a
 

4831
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,709
the nearest relative relative he's in a
whole other branch

4832
01:20:58,709 --> 01:20:58,719
whole other branch
 

4833
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,550
whole other branch
no species of which has ever infected

4834
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:00,560
no species of which has ever infected
 

4835
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,470
no species of which has ever infected
humans in that branch

4836
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:02,480
humans in that branch
 

4837
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,350
humans in that branch
so you know let's put this to rest this

4838
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,360
so you know let's put this to rest this
 

4839
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,470
so you know let's put this to rest this
was not designed

4840
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:06,480
was not designed
 

4841
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,629
was not designed
by someone to kill off the human race so

4842
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:08,639
by someone to kill off the human race so
 

4843
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,070
by someone to kill off the human race so
you don't you don't believe it was

4844
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:10,080
you don't you don't believe it was
 

4845
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,910
you don't you don't believe it was
engineered

4846
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:11,920
engineered
 

4847
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,629
engineered
the likely yeah the the path to

4848
01:21:14,629 --> 01:21:14,639
the likely yeah the the path to
 

4849
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,390
the likely yeah the the path to
engineering a deadly virus would not

4850
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
engineering a deadly virus would not
 

4851
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:16,870
engineering a deadly virus would not
come

4852
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:16,880
come
 

4853
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,070
come
from this strain that got it that was

4854
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,080
from this strain that got it that was
 

4855
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:20,709
from this strain that got it that was
used

4856
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:20,719
used
 

4857
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,990
used
uh moreover there's been various

4858
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:24,000
uh moreover there's been various
 

4859
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:27,990
uh moreover there's been various
um claims of haha this was mixed and

4860
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:28,000
um claims of haha this was mixed and
 

4861
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,110
um claims of haha this was mixed and
matched in lab

4862
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:29,120
matched in lab
 

4863
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,870
matched in lab
because the s1 protein has three

4864
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:30,880
because the s1 protein has three
 

4865
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,030
because the s1 protein has three
different components each of which has a

4866
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:33,040
different components each of which has a
 

4867
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,550
different components each of which has a
different evolutionary tree

4868
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:34,560
different evolutionary tree
 

4869
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,550
different evolutionary tree
so you know a lot of popular press

4870
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:36,560
so you know a lot of popular press
 

4871
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,910
so you know a lot of popular press
basically said aha

4872
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:37,920
basically said aha
 

4873
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,510
basically said aha
this came from pangolin and this came

4874
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
this came from pangolin and this came
 

4875
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,790
this came from pangolin and this came
from you know all kinds of other species

4876
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:42,800
from you know all kinds of other species
 

4877
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,709
from you know all kinds of other species
this is what has been happening

4878
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:44,719
this is what has been happening
 

4879
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,629
this is what has been happening
throughout the coronavirus tree

4880
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:46,639
throughout the coronavirus tree
 

4881
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,470
throughout the coronavirus tree
so basically the s1 protein has been

4882
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
so basically the s1 protein has been
 

4883
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,229
so basically the s1 protein has been
recombining across species all the time

4884
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
recombining across species all the time
 

4885
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,189
recombining across species all the time
remember when i was talking about the

4886
01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:51,199
remember when i was talking about the
 

4887
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,790
remember when i was talking about the
positive strand the negative strands sub

4888
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
positive strand the negative strands sub
 

4889
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,229
positive strand the negative strands sub
genomic rnas

4890
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:54,239
genomic rnas
 

4891
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,910
genomic rnas
these can actually recombine and if you

4892
01:21:55,910 --> 01:21:55,920
these can actually recombine and if you
 

4893
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,590
these can actually recombine and if you
have two different viruses infecting the

4894
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:57,600
have two different viruses infecting the
 

4895
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,310
have two different viruses infecting the
same cell

4896
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:58,320
same cell
 

4897
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,830
same cell
they can actually mix and match between

4898
01:21:59,830 --> 01:21:59,840
they can actually mix and match between
 

4899
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:00,790
they can actually mix and match between
the positive strand and the negative

4900
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:00,800
the positive strand and the negative
 

4901
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,229
the positive strand and the negative
strand and basically create

4902
01:22:02,229 --> 01:22:02,239
strand and basically create
 

4903
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:04,470
strand and basically create
a new hybrid virus with recombination

4904
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:04,480
a new hybrid virus with recombination
 

4905
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,550
a new hybrid virus with recombination
that now has the s1 from one

4906
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:06,560
that now has the s1 from one
 

4907
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,550
that now has the s1 from one
and the rest of the genome from another

4908
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:08,560
and the rest of the genome from another
 

4909
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,830
and the rest of the genome from another
and this is something that happens a lot

4910
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:09,840
and this is something that happens a lot
 

4911
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,709
and this is something that happens a lot
in s1 you know

4912
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:10,719
in s1 you know
 

4913
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:12,709
in s1 you know
fade etc and that's something that's

4914
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:12,719
fade etc and that's something that's
 

4915
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:13,830
fade etc and that's something that's
true of the whole training

4916
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:13,840
true of the whole training
 

4917
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,750
true of the whole training
for the whole family exactly viruses so

4918
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:15,760
for the whole family exactly viruses so
 

4919
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,189
for the whole family exactly viruses so
it's not like someone has been

4920
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:17,199
it's not like someone has been
 

4921
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,350
it's not like someone has been
messing with this for millions of years

4922
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,360
messing with this for millions of years
 

4923
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,709
messing with this for millions of years
and you know changing

4924
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:20,719
and you know changing
 

4925
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,550
and you know changing
this happens naturally that's again

4926
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:22,560
this happens naturally that's again
 

4927
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,390
this happens naturally that's again
beautiful that that somehow happens that

4928
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:24,400
beautiful that that somehow happens that
 

4929
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:25,750
beautiful that that somehow happens that
they recombine in the

4930
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:25,760
they recombine in the
 

4931
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,350
they recombine in the
so two different strands can affect the

4932
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
so two different strands can affect the
 

4933
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,390
so two different strands can affect the
body and recombine

4934
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400

 

4935
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,390

so all of this actually magic happens

4936
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:32,400
so all of this actually magic happens
 

4937
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,590
so all of this actually magic happens
inside uh

4938
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:33,600
inside uh
 

4939
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,510
inside uh
hosts like all like yeah yeah that way

4940
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:37,520
hosts like all like yeah yeah that way
 

4941
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,510
hosts like all like yeah yeah that way
that's why classification wise virus is

4942
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:39,520
that's why classification wise virus is
 

4943
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,629
that's why classification wise virus is
not thought to be alive

4944
01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:40,639
not thought to be alive
 

4945
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:41,990
not thought to be alive
because it doesn't self-replicate it's

4946
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000
because it doesn't self-replicate it's
 

4947
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,590
because it doesn't self-replicate it's
not autonomous it's something that

4948
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:43,600
not autonomous it's something that
 

4949
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:44,310
not autonomous it's something that
enters

4950
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:44,320
enters
 

4951
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:47,350
enters
a living cell and then co-opts it to

4952
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:47,360
a living cell and then co-opts it to
 

4953
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,709
a living cell and then co-opts it to
basically make it its own

4954
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:48,719
basically make it its own
 

4955
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,790
basically make it its own
but by itself people ask me how do we

4956
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:50,800
but by itself people ask me how do we
 

4957
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,550
but by itself people ask me how do we
kill this bastard i'm like you stop it

4958
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:52,560
kill this bastard i'm like you stop it
 

4959
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,070
kill this bastard i'm like you stop it
from replicating

4960
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:54,080
from replicating
 

4961
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,110
from replicating
it's not like a bacterium that will just

4962
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:57,120
it's not like a bacterium that will just
 

4963
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:01,030
it's not like a bacterium that will just
live in a you know puddle or something

4964
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:01,040
live in a you know puddle or something
 

4965
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:03,590
live in a you know puddle or something
it's a virus viruses don't live without

4966
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:03,600
it's a virus viruses don't live without
 

4967
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,550
it's a virus viruses don't live without
their host

4968
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
their host
 

4969
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,149
their host
and they only live in their house for

4970
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:06,159
and they only live in their house for
 

4971
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,390
and they only live in their house for
very little time so if you stop it from

4972
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:08,400
very little time so if you stop it from
 

4973
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,030
very little time so if you stop it from
replicating

4974
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
replicating
 

4975
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,430
replicating
it'll stop from spreading i mean it's

4976
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:11,440
it'll stop from spreading i mean it's
 

4977
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,270
it'll stop from spreading i mean it's
not like hiv which can stay dormant for

4978
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:13,280
not like hiv which can stay dormant for
 

4979
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,950
not like hiv which can stay dormant for
a long time basically coronaviruses just

4980
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:14,960
a long time basically coronaviruses just
 

4981
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,229
a long time basically coronaviruses just
don't do that they're not integrating

4982
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:16,239
don't do that they're not integrating
 

4983
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:17,910
don't do that they're not integrating
genomes there are any genomes

4984
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:17,920
genomes there are any genomes
 

4985
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,550
genomes there are any genomes
so if it's not expressed it degrades rna

4986
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:20,560
so if it's not expressed it degrades rna
 

4987
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:21,110
so if it's not expressed it degrades rna
degrades

4988
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:21,120
degrades
 

4989
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,669
degrades
it doesn't just stick around well let me

4990
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:23,679
it doesn't just stick around well let me
 

4991
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,669
it doesn't just stick around well let me
ask also um

4992
01:23:25,669 --> 01:23:25,679
ask also um
 

4993
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:27,270
ask also um
about the immune system you mentioned a

4994
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:27,280
about the immune system you mentioned a
 

4995
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,590
about the immune system you mentioned a
lot of people kind of ask

4996
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:29,600
lot of people kind of ask
 

4997
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,629
lot of people kind of ask
you know um how can we strengthen the

4998
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:32,639
you know um how can we strengthen the
 

4999
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:33,990
you know um how can we strengthen the
immune system

5000
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:34,000
immune system
 

5001
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,390
immune system
to respond to this particular virus but

5002
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:36,400
to respond to this particular virus but
 

5003
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,590
to respond to this particular virus but
the viruses in general

5004
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:37,600
the viruses in general
 

5005
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,950
the viruses in general
do you have from a biological

5006
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:38,960
do you have from a biological
 

5007
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,510
do you have from a biological
perspective thoughts on what we can do

5008
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:41,520
perspective thoughts on what we can do
 

5009
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,790
perspective thoughts on what we can do
as humans

5010
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:42,800
as humans
 

5011
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,189
as humans
uh too if you look at our traits across

5012
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:45,199
uh too if you look at our traits across
 

5013
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:46,550
uh too if you look at our traits across
different countries

5014
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:46,560
different countries
 

5015
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,629
different countries
people with less vaccination have been

5016
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
people with less vaccination have been
 

5017
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:49,590
people with less vaccination have been
dying more

5018
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:49,600
dying more
 

5019
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,350
dying more
if you look at north italy the

5020
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,360
if you look at north italy the
 

5021
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,629
if you look at north italy the
vaccination rates are

5022
01:23:52,629 --> 01:23:52,639
vaccination rates are
 

5023
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,350
vaccination rates are
abysmal there and a lot of people have

5024
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:55,360
abysmal there and a lot of people have
 

5025
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,950
abysmal there and a lot of people have
been dying if you look at greece

5026
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:56,960
been dying if you look at greece
 

5027
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,110
been dying if you look at greece
very good vaccination rates almost no

5028
01:23:59,110 --> 01:23:59,120
very good vaccination rates almost no
 

5029
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,229
very good vaccination rates almost no
one has been dying

5030
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:00,239
one has been dying
 

5031
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,430
one has been dying
so yes there's a policy component

5032
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:03,440
so yes there's a policy component
 

5033
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,149
so yes there's a policy component
so italy reacted very slowly greece

5034
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
so italy reacted very slowly greece
 

5035
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,350
so italy reacted very slowly greece
reacted very fast

5036
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:07,360
reacted very fast
 

5037
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,590
reacted very fast
so yeah many fewer people died in greece

5038
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:09,600
so yeah many fewer people died in greece
 

5039
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,870
so yeah many fewer people died in greece
but there might actually be

5040
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:10,880
but there might actually be
 

5041
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,990
but there might actually be
a component of genetic immune repertoire

5042
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:14,000
a component of genetic immune repertoire
 

5043
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,310
a component of genetic immune repertoire
basically how did people die off you

5044
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:16,320
basically how did people die off you
 

5045
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,990
basically how did people die off you
know in the history

5046
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:18,000
know in the history
 

5047
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,270
know in the history
of the greek population versus the

5048
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:19,280
of the greek population versus the
 

5049
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,149
of the greek population versus the
italian population there's a

5050
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:22,159
italian population there's a
 

5051
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,790
italian population there's a
that's interesting to think about uh and

5052
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
that's interesting to think about uh and
 

5053
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,910
that's interesting to think about uh and
then there's a component

5054
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:25,920
then there's a component
 

5055
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,470
then there's a component
of what vaccinations did you have as a

5056
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:28,480
of what vaccinations did you have as a
 

5057
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,790
of what vaccinations did you have as a
kid and what are the off-target effects

5058
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,800
kid and what are the off-target effects
 

5059
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,310
kid and what are the off-target effects
of those vaccinations

5060
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:32,320
of those vaccinations
 

5061
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,229
of those vaccinations
so basically a vaccination can have two

5062
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:34,239
so basically a vaccination can have two
 

5063
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,830
so basically a vaccination can have two
components one is

5064
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:35,840
components one is
 

5065
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,830
components one is
training your your immune system against

5066
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:37,840
training your your immune system against
 

5067
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:39,350
training your your immune system against
that specific insult

5068
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:39,360
that specific insult
 

5069
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,430
that specific insult
the second one is boosting up your

5070
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:41,440
the second one is boosting up your
 

5071
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,870
the second one is boosting up your
immune system for all kinds of other

5072
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:42,880
immune system for all kinds of other
 

5073
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,550
immune system for all kinds of other
things

5074
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
things
 

5075
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,229
things
if you look at allergies northern europe

01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
if you look at allergies northern europe
 

5077
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,550
if you look at allergies northern europe
super clean environments tons of

5078
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:50,560
super clean environments tons of

01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,030
kinds of dirt and stuff
tons of viruses there tons of bacteria

5100
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,040
tons of viruses there tons of bacteria
 

5101
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,629
tons of viruses there tons of bacteria
there you know my immune system was

5102
01:25:10,629 --> 01:25:10,639
there you know my immune system was
 

5103
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:11,430
there you know my immune system was
built up

5104
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:11,440
built up
 

5105
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:15,270
built up
so the more you protect your immune

5106
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:15,280
so the more you protect your immune
 

5107
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,629
so the more you protect your immune
system from exposure

5108
01:25:16,629 --> 01:25:16,639
system from exposure
 

5109
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:18,709
system from exposure
the less opportunity it has to learn

5110
01:25:18,709 --> 01:25:18,719
the less opportunity it has to learn
 

5111
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,629
the less opportunity it has to learn
about non-self

5112
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:20,639
about non-self
 

5113
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,189
about non-self
repertoire in a way that prepares it for

5114
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:23,199
repertoire in a way that prepares it for
 

5115
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:24,229
repertoire in a way that prepares it for
the next insult

5116

something we could do
 

5135
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,709
something we could do
to strengthen our immune system in 2020

5136
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:44,719
to strengthen our immune system in 2020
 

5137

and there's a huge line for pill so
 

5161
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,510
and there's a huge line for pill so
we're looking basically for magic

5162
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:13,520
we're looking basically for magic
 

5163
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:14,870
we're looking basically for magic
bullets for sort of

5164
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:14,880
bullets for sort of
 

5165
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:17,510
bullets for sort of
ways that we can you know beat cancer

5166
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:17,520
ways that we can you know beat cancer
 

5167
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,950
ways that we can you know beat cancer
and beat coronavirus and beat this and

5168
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:18,960
and beat coronavirus and beat this and
 

5169
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,310
and beat coronavirus and beat this and
beat that and it turns out that the

5170
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:20,320
beat that and it turns out that the
 

5171
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,030
beat that and it turns out that the
window with

5172
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:21,040
window with
 

5173
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:23,750

i mean you're like really for my brain
 

5185
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,830
i mean you're like really for my brain
neurodegeneration

5186
01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:34,840
neurodegeneration
 

5187
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:37,990
neurodegeneration
absolutely if you look at cancer

5188
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:38,000
absolutely if you look at cancer
 

5189
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,790
absolutely if you look at cancer
exercise and nutrition if you look at

5190
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:40,800
exercise and nutrition if you look at
 

5191
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,310
exercise and nutrition if you look at
coronavirus

5192
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:42,320
coronavirus
 

5193
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,550
coronavirus
exercise and nutrition every single

5194
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:44,560
exercise and nutrition every single

aspect of human health
 

5197
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,910
aspect of human health
gets improved and one of the studies

5198
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:47,920
gets improved and one of the studies
 

5199
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,430
gets improved and one of the studies
we're doing now is basically looking at

5200
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:49,440
we're doing now is basically looking at
 

5201
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:49,750
we're doing now is basically looking at
what

5202
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:49,760
what
 

5203
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,950
what
are the effects of diet and exercise

5204
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:52,960
are the effects of diet and exercise
 

5205
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,430
are the effects of diet and exercise
how similar are they to each other we're

5206
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:55,440
how similar are they to each other we're
 

5207
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,110
how similar are they to each other we're
basically taking

5208
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:57,120
basically taking
 

5209
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,110
basically taking
diet intervention and exercise

we're just starting now basically is
 

5257
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,870
we're just starting now basically is
there is the hope there uh

5258

there is the hope there uh
 

5259
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,990
there is the hope there uh
to understand the effect on

to understand the effect on
 

5261
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,750
to understand the effect on
uh so like the effect on the immune

5262
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:53,760
uh so like the effect on the immune
 

5263
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,430
uh so like the effect on the immune
system on the immune system the effect

01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,560
digestion is actually happening by
 

5375
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,629
digestion is actually happening by
species that are not human inside you

5376
01:29:40,629 --> 01:29:40,639
species that are not human inside you
 

5377
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,070
species that are not human inside you
you have more non-human cells and you

5378
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:42,080
you have more non-human cells and you
 

5379
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:42,950
you have more non-human cells and you
have human cells

5380
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:42,960
have human cells
 

5381
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,629
have human cells
you're basically a giant bag of bacteria

5382
01:29:46,629 --> 01:29:46,639
you're basically a giant bag of bacteria
 

5383
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,390
you're basically a giant bag of bacteria
with a few human cells along

5384
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:50,400

 

5385
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,030

and those do not necessarily have to do

5386
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:53,040
and those do not necessarily have to do
 

5387
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,870
and those do not necessarily have to do
with your genetic makeup

5388
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:54,880
with your genetic makeup
 

5389
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:56,629
with your genetic makeup
they interact with your genetic makeup

5390
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:56,639
they interact with your genetic makeup
 

5391
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:57,990
they interact with your genetic makeup
they interact with your ruby genome they

5392
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:58,000
they interact with your ruby genome they
 

5393
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,590
they interact with your ruby genome they
interact with your nutrition they

5394
01:29:59,590 --> 01:29:59,600
interact with your nutrition they
 

5395
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,270
interact with your nutrition they
interact with your environment

5396
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:01,280
interact with your environment
 

5397
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,470
interact with your environment
they're you know basically

5398
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:04,480
they're you know basically
 

5399
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,950
they're you know basically
an additional source of variation so

5400
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:06,960
an additional source of variation so
 

5401
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:07,990
an additional source of variation so
when you're thinking about sort of

5402
01:30:07,990 --> 01:30:08,000
when you're thinking about sort of
 

5403
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,990
when you're thinking about sort of
personalized nutritional advice

5404
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,000
personalized nutritional advice
 

5405
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,750
personalized nutritional advice
part of that is actually how do you

5406
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:11,760
part of that is actually how do you
 

5407
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,510
part of that is actually how do you
match your microbiome

5408
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:13,520
match your microbiome
 

5409
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,830
match your microbiome
and part of that is how do we match your

5410
01:30:15,830 --> 01:30:15,840
and part of that is how do we match your
 

5411
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,030
and part of that is how do we match your
genetics

5412
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:17,040
genetics
 

5413
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,550
genetics
but again you know this is a very

5414
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:18,560
but again you know this is a very
 

5415
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,790
but again you know this is a very
diverse set of um

5416
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:20,800
diverse set of um
 

5417
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,950
diverse set of um
you know contributors and the effect

5418
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:22,960
you know contributors and the effect
 

5419
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:23,990
you know contributors and the effect
sizes are not

5420
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:24,000
sizes are not
 

5421
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,910
sizes are not
enormous so i think the science for that

5422
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:25,920
enormous so i think the science for that
 

5423
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,750
enormous so i think the science for that
is not fully developed yet

5424
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:27,760
is not fully developed yet
 

5425
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,590
is not fully developed yet
speaking of dyes because i've wrestled

5426
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:29,600
speaking of dyes because i've wrestled
 

5427
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:31,270
speaking of dyes because i've wrestled
in combat sports with sports my whole

5428
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:31,280
in combat sports with sports my whole
 

5429
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:31,910
in combat sports with sports my whole
life or

5430
01:30:31,910 --> 01:30:31,920
life or
 

5431
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,510

weight matters so you have to cut and

5432
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:33,520
weight matters so you have to cut and
 

5433
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,270
weight matters so you have to cut and
all that stuff

5434
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:35,280
all that stuff
 

5435
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,590
all that stuff
one thing i've learned a lot about my

5436
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:37,600
one thing i've learned a lot about my
 

5437
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:38,629
one thing i've learned a lot about my
body and

5438
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639
body and
 

5439
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,390
body and
which seems to be i think true about

5440
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:40,400
which seems to be i think true about
 

5441
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,310
which seems to be i think true about
other people's bodies is that

5442
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:42,320
other people's bodies is that
 

5443
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,270
other people's bodies is that
you can adjust to a lot of things that's

5444
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:45,280
you can adjust to a lot of things that's
 

5445
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,550
you can adjust to a lot of things that's
the miraculous thing about this

5446
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:46,560
the miraculous thing about this
 

5447
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,229
the miraculous thing about this
biological system

5448
01:30:48,229 --> 01:30:48,239
biological system
 

5449
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:51,270
biological system
is um like i fast

5450
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:51,280
is um like i fast
 

5451
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,070
is um like i fast
often i used to eat like five six times

5452
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:54,080
often i used to eat like five six times
 

5453
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,950
often i used to eat like five six times
a day

5454
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:54,960
a day
 

5455
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,310
a day
and thought that was absolutely

5456
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:56,320
and thought that was absolutely
 

5457
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,310
and thought that was absolutely
necessary how could you not eat that

5458
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,320
necessary how could you not eat that
 

5459
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,030
necessary how could you not eat that
often

5460
01:30:59,030 --> 01:30:59,040
often
 

5461
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,430
often
and then when i started fasting your

5462
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:01,440
and then when i started fasting your
 

5463
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:02,629
and then when i started fasting your
body adjusts to that

5464
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:02,639
body adjusts to that
 

5465
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:04,470
body adjusts to that
and you learn how to not eat you know

5466
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:04,480
and you learn how to not eat you know
 

5467
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,830
and you learn how to not eat you know
and it's it was

5468
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:05,840
and it's it was
 

5469
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,750
and it's it was
uh if you just give it a chance for a

5470
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:07,760
uh if you just give it a chance for a
 

5471
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,030
uh if you just give it a chance for a
few weeks actually

5472
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,040
few weeks actually
 

5473
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,550
few weeks actually
over a period of a few weeks your body

5474
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:10,560
over a period of a few weeks your body
 

5475
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,070
over a period of a few weeks your body
can adjust to anything yeah and that's a

5476
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:12,080
can adjust to anything yeah and that's a
 

5477
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,990
can adjust to anything yeah and that's a
miraculous that's such a beautiful thing

5478
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,000
miraculous that's such a beautiful thing
 

5479
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,430
miraculous that's such a beautiful thing
so i'm a computer scientist

5480
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:15,440
so i'm a computer scientist
 

5481
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,189
so i'm a computer scientist
and i've basically gone through periods

5482
01:31:17,189 --> 01:31:17,199
and i've basically gone through periods
 

5483
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:19,590
and i've basically gone through periods
of 24 hours without eating or stopping

5484
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600
of 24 hours without eating or stopping
 

5485
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,990
of 24 hours without eating or stopping
and you know then i'm like oh must eat

5486
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:22,000
and you know then i'm like oh must eat
 

5487
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,910
and you know then i'm like oh must eat
and i eat a ton i used to order two

5488
01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:23,920
and i eat a ton i used to order two
 

5489
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,510
and i eat a ton i used to order two
pizzas just with my brother and

5490
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:25,520
pizzas just with my brother and
 

5491
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,709
pizzas just with my brother and
you know like so i i've gone through

5492
01:31:28,709 --> 01:31:28,719
you know like so i i've gone through
 

5493
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:30,070
you know like so i i've gone through
these extremes as well and i've gone the

5494
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:30,080
these extremes as well and i've gone the
 

5495
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:30,470
these extremes as well and i've gone the
whole

5496
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:30,480
whole
 

5497
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,950
whole
intermittent fasting thing so i can

5498
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:32,960
intermittent fasting thing so i can
 

5499
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,470
intermittent fasting thing so i can
sympathize with you both on the seven

5500
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:34,480
sympathize with you both on the seven
 

5501
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,110
sympathize with you both on the seven
meals a day

5502
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:35,120
meals a day
 

5503
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:39,270
meals a day
to the zero meals a day um so i think

5504
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:39,280
to the zero meals a day um so i think
 

5505
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,590
to the zero meals a day um so i think
when i say everything in moderation i i

5506
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:41,600
when i say everything in moderation i i
 

5507
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:42,470
when i say everything in moderation i i
actually

5508
01:31:42,470 --> 01:31:42,480
actually
 

5509
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,310
actually
think your body responds interestingly

5510
01:31:44,310 --> 01:31:44,320
think your body responds interestingly
 

5511
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,430
think your body responds interestingly
to these different changes in diet

5512
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:47,440
to these different changes in diet
 

5513
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,110
to these different changes in diet
i think part of the reason why we lose

5514
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:49,120
i think part of the reason why we lose
 

5515
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:51,189
i think part of the reason why we lose
weight with pretty much every kind of

5516
01:31:51,189 --> 01:31:51,199
weight with pretty much every kind of
 

5517
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:52,870
weight with pretty much every kind of
change in behavior is because

5518
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:52,880
change in behavior is because
 

5519
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,830
change in behavior is because
our epigenome and the set of proteins

5520
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:55,840
our epigenome and the set of proteins
 

5521
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,430
our epigenome and the set of proteins
and enzymes that are expressed

5522
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
and enzymes that are expressed
 

5523
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,229
and enzymes that are expressed
and our microbiome are not well suited

5524
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:00,239
and our microbiome are not well suited
 

5525
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,910
and our microbiome are not well suited
to that nutritional source

5526
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:01,920
to that nutritional source
 

5527
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,830
to that nutritional source
and therefore they will not be able to

5528
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:03,840
and therefore they will not be able to
 

5529
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,750
and therefore they will not be able to
sort of catch everything that you

5530
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:05,760
sort of catch everything that you
 

5531
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,510
sort of catch everything that you
give them and then you know a lot of

5532
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:07,520
give them and then you know a lot of
 

5533
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,030
give them and then you know a lot of
that will go undigested

5534
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:09,040
that will go undigested
 

5535
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,629
that will go undigested
and that basically means that your body

5536
01:32:10,629 --> 01:32:10,639
and that basically means that your body
 

5537
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:12,629
and that basically means that your body
can then you know lose weight in the

5538
01:32:12,629 --> 01:32:12,639
can then you know lose weight in the
 

5539
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:13,590
can then you know lose weight in the
short term but very

5540
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:13,600
short term but very
 

5541
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,990
short term but very
quickly will adjust to that new normal

5542
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:16,000
quickly will adjust to that new normal
 

5543
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,430
quickly will adjust to that new normal
and then we'll be able to sort of

5544
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:17,440
and then we'll be able to sort of
 

5545
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,910
and then we'll be able to sort of
perhaps gain a lot of weight yeah from

5546
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:19,920
perhaps gain a lot of weight yeah from
 

5547
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:20,950
perhaps gain a lot of weight yeah from
the diet so

5548
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:20,960
the diet so
 

5549
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,750
the diet so
anyway i mean there's also studies in um

5550
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:23,760
anyway i mean there's also studies in um
 

5551
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,110
anyway i mean there's also studies in um
factories where basically

5552
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:25,120
factories where basically
 

5553
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,350
factories where basically
people you know dim the lights and then

5554
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:27,360
people you know dim the lights and then
 

5555
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,390
people you know dim the lights and then
suddenly everybody started working

5556
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:28,400
suddenly everybody started working
 

5557
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,070
suddenly everybody started working
better it was like wow that's amazing

5558
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,080
better it was like wow that's amazing
 

5559
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,070
better it was like wow that's amazing
three weeks later they made the lights a

5560
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:32,080
three weeks later they made the lights a
 

5561
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,350
three weeks later they made the lights a
little brighter everybody started

5562
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:33,360
little brighter everybody started
 

5563
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:35,270
little brighter everybody started
working better

5564
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:35,280
working better
 

5565
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:38,229
working better
so any kind of intervention has a

5566
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:38,239
so any kind of intervention has a
 

5567
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:40,470
so any kind of intervention has a
placebo effect of wow now i'm healthier

5568
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:40,480
placebo effect of wow now i'm healthier
 

5569
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:41,669
placebo effect of wow now i'm healthier
and i'm going to be running more often

5570
01:32:41,669 --> 01:32:41,679
and i'm going to be running more often
 

5571
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:43,430
and i'm going to be running more often
etc so it's very hard to uncouple

5572
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:43,440
etc so it's very hard to uncouple
 

5573
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,189
etc so it's very hard to uncouple
the placebo effect of wow i'm doing

5574
01:32:45,189 --> 01:32:45,199
the placebo effect of wow i'm doing
 

5575
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,030
the placebo effect of wow i'm doing
something to intervene on my diet

5576
01:32:47,030 --> 01:32:47,040
something to intervene on my diet
 

5577
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,510
something to intervene on my diet
from the wow this is actually the right

5578
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:49,520
from the wow this is actually the right
 

5579
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,229
from the wow this is actually the right
thing for me

5580
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
thing for me
 

5581
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,830
thing for me
so you know yeah from the perspective

5582
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:51,840
so you know yeah from the perspective
 

5583
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,629
so you know yeah from the perspective
from nutrition science psychology

5584
01:32:54,629 --> 01:32:54,639
from nutrition science psychology
 

5585
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:56,070
from nutrition science psychology
both things i'm interested in especially

5586
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:56,080
both things i'm interested in especially
 

5587
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,070
both things i'm interested in especially
psychology it seems that

5588
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:58,080
psychology it seems that
 

5589
01:32:58,080 --> 01:32:59,910
psychology it seems that
it's extremely difficult to do good

5590
01:32:59,910 --> 01:32:59,920
it's extremely difficult to do good
 

5591
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:01,189
it's extremely difficult to do good
science

5592
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:01,199
science
 

5593
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,430
science
because uh there's so many variables

5594
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:03,440
because uh there's so many variables
 

5595
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,510
because uh there's so many variables
involved it's so difficult to control

5596
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:05,520
involved it's so difficult to control
 

5597
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,470
involved it's so difficult to control
the variables

5598
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:06,480
the variables
 

5599
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,070
the variables
so difficult to do sufficiently

5600
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,080
so difficult to do sufficiently
 

5601
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,990
so difficult to do sufficiently
large-scale experiments

5602
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
large-scale experiments
 

5603
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,149
large-scale experiments
uh both sort of in terms of number of

5604
01:33:12,149 --> 01:33:12,159
uh both sort of in terms of number of
 

5605
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:13,590
uh both sort of in terms of number of
subjects and

5606
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:13,600
subjects and
 

5607
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,229
subjects and
temporal like how long you do the study

5608
01:33:16,229 --> 01:33:16,239
temporal like how long you do the study
 

5609
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:16,950
temporal like how long you do the study
for

5610
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:16,960
for
 

5611
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,750
for
that uh it just seems like it's not even

5612
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:19,760
that uh it just seems like it's not even
 

5613
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:20,709
that uh it just seems like it's not even
a real science

5614
01:33:20,709 --> 01:33:20,719
a real science
 

5615
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:22,950
a real science
for now like nutrition science i want to

5616
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:22,960
for now like nutrition science i want to
 

5617
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,950
for now like nutrition science i want to
jump into the whole placebo effect for a

5618
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:24,960
jump into the whole placebo effect for a
 

5619
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:25,750
jump into the whole placebo effect for a
little bit here

5620
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:25,760
little bit here
 

5621
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,709
little bit here
and basically talk about the

5622
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:28,719
and basically talk about the
 

5623
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,149
and basically talk about the
implications of that

5624
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:30,159
implications of that
 

5625
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,830
implications of that
if i give you a sugar pill and tell you

5626
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
if i give you a sugar pill and tell you
 

5627
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,310
if i give you a sugar pill and tell you
it's a sugar pill

5628
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:34,320
it's a sugar pill
 

5629
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,830
it's a sugar pill
you won't get any better but if i tell

5630
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:35,840
you won't get any better but if i tell
 

5631
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,590
you won't get any better but if i tell
you sugar appeal and tell you and

5632
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:37,600
you sugar appeal and tell you and
 

5633
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,830
you sugar appeal and tell you and
i tell you wow this is an amazing drug

5634
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:39,840
i tell you wow this is an amazing drug
 

5635
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,229
i tell you wow this is an amazing drug
it actually will stop your cancer

5636
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,239
it actually will stop your cancer
 

5637
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,550
it actually will stop your cancer
your cash will actually stop with much

5638
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:44,560
your cash will actually stop with much
 

5639
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,149
your cash will actually stop with much
higher probability

5640
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
higher probability
 

5641
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:47,669
higher probability
what does that mean that's so amazing

5642
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:47,679
what does that mean that's so amazing
 

5643
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:49,270
what does that mean that's so amazing
that means that if i can trick your

5644
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:49,280
that means that if i can trick your
 

5645
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:51,750
that means that if i can trick your
brain into thinking that i'm healing you

5646
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:51,760
brain into thinking that i'm healing you
 

5647
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,350
brain into thinking that i'm healing you
your brain will basically figure out a

5648
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,360
your brain will basically figure out a
 

5649
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,990
your brain will basically figure out a
way to heal itself to heal the body

5650
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
way to heal itself to heal the body
 

5651
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,470
way to heal itself to heal the body
and that tells us that there's so much

5652
01:33:58,470 --> 01:33:58,480
and that tells us that there's so much
 

5653
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,910
and that tells us that there's so much
that we don't understand

5654
01:33:59,910 --> 01:33:59,920
that we don't understand
 

5655
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,950
that we don't understand
in the interplay between our cognition

5656
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:02,960
in the interplay between our cognition
 

5657
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,709
in the interplay between our cognition
and our biology that if we were able to

5658
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:06,719
and our biology that if we were able to
 

5659
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,470
and our biology that if we were able to
better harvest

5660
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:08,480
better harvest
 

5661
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,189
better harvest
the power of our brain to sort of you

5662
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:11,199
the power of our brain to sort of you
 

5663
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:11,510
the power of our brain to sort of you
know

5664
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:11,520
know
 

5665
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,870
know
impact the body through the placebo

5666
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880
impact the body through the placebo
 

5667
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:14,950
impact the body through the placebo
effect we would be

5668
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:14,960
effect we would be
 

5669
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,310
effect we would be
so much better in so many different

5670
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:16,320
so much better in so many different
 

5671
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,790
so much better in so many different
things just by tricking yourself into

5672
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:18,800
things just by tricking yourself into
 

5673
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,229
things just by tricking yourself into
thinking that you're doing better you're

5674
01:34:20,229 --> 01:34:20,239
thinking that you're doing better you're
 

5675
01:34:20,239 --> 01:34:21,430
thinking that you're doing better you're
actually doing better

5676
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:21,440
actually doing better
 

5677
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,709
actually doing better
so there's something to be said about

5678
01:34:22,709 --> 01:34:22,719
so there's something to be said about
 

5679
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:24,950
so there's something to be said about
sort of positive thinking about optimism

5680
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:24,960
sort of positive thinking about optimism
 

5681
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,070
sort of positive thinking about optimism
about sort of

5682
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:26,080
about sort of
 

5683
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,910
about sort of
you know just getting your

5684
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:29,920
you know just getting your
 

5685
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,990
you know just getting your
brain and your mind into the right

5686
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:32,000
brain and your mind into the right
 

5687
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,270
brain and your mind into the right
mindset

5688
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:33,280
mindset
 

5689
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,669
mindset
that helps your body and helps your

5690
01:34:35,669 --> 01:34:35,679
that helps your body and helps your
 

5691
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:37,030
that helps your body and helps your
entire biology

5692
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:37,040
entire biology
 

5693
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,470
entire biology
yeah from a science perspective that's

5694
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:38,480
yeah from a science perspective that's
 

5695
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,149
yeah from a science perspective that's
just fascinating i

5696
01:34:40,149 --> 01:34:40,159
just fascinating i
 

5697
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:41,910
just fascinating i
obviously most things about the brain is

5698
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:41,920
obviously most things about the brain is
 

5699
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,750
obviously most things about the brain is
a total mystery for now

5700
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:43,760
a total mystery for now
 

5701
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,470
a total mystery for now
but that's a fascinating interplay that

5702
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:46,480
but that's a fascinating interplay that
 

5703
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,590
but that's a fascinating interplay that
the brain

5704
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:47,600
the brain
 

5705
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:50,790
the brain
yeah that the brain can reduce

5706
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:50,800
yeah that the brain can reduce
 

5707
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,310
yeah that the brain can reduce
uh the brain can help cure cancer as a

5708
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:54,320
uh the brain can help cure cancer as a
 

5709
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,149
uh the brain can help cure cancer as a
i don't even know what to do with that i

5710
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:56,159
i don't even know what to do with that i
 

5711
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:57,990
i don't even know what to do with that i
mean the way to think about that is the

5712
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,000
mean the way to think about that is the
 

5713
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,350
mean the way to think about that is the
following

5714
01:34:59,350 --> 01:34:59,360
following
 

5715
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,109
following
the converse of the equation is

5716
01:35:01,109 --> 01:35:01,119
the converse of the equation is
 

5717
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:02,229
the converse of the equation is
something that we are much more

5718
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:02,239
something that we are much more
 

5719
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:03,350
something that we are much more
comfortable with

5720
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:03,360
comfortable with
 

5721
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,709
comfortable with
like oh if you're stressed then

5722
01:35:06,709 --> 01:35:06,719
like oh if you're stressed then
 

5723
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:08,950
like oh if you're stressed then
your heart right might rise and all

5724
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:08,960
your heart right might rise and all
 

5725
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,550
your heart right might rise and all
kinds of sort of toxins might be

5726
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:10,560
kinds of sort of toxins might be
 

5727
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,590
kinds of sort of toxins might be
released and

5728
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:11,600
released and
 

5729
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,189
released and
that can have a detrimental effect in

5730
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:13,199
that can have a detrimental effect in
 

5731
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,030
that can have a detrimental effect in
your body etc

5732
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:15,040
your body etc
 

5733
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:17,270
your body etc
so maybe it's easier to understand your

5734
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:17,280
so maybe it's easier to understand your
 

5735
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,629
so maybe it's easier to understand your
body

5736
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:18,639
body
 

5737
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:21,590
body
healing from your mind by your mind is

5738
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:21,600
healing from your mind by your mind is
 

5739
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,109
healing from your mind by your mind is
not killing your body

5740
01:35:23,109 --> 01:35:23,119
not killing your body
 

5741
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:25,030
not killing your body
or at least it's killing it less so i

5742
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:25,040
or at least it's killing it less so i
 

5743
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,149
or at least it's killing it less so i
think the you know

5744
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:26,159
think the you know
 

5745
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,470
think the you know
that aspect of the stress equation is a

5746
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:28,480
that aspect of the stress equation is a
 

5747
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,590
that aspect of the stress equation is a
little easier

5748
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:29,600
little easier
 

5749
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,910
little easier
for most of us to conceptualize but then

5750
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:31,920
for most of us to conceptualize but then
 

5751
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,189
for most of us to conceptualize but then
the healing part

5752
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:33,199
the healing part
 

5753
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,030
the healing part
is you know perhaps the same pathways

5754
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
is you know perhaps the same pathways
 

5755
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,550
is you know perhaps the same pathways
perhaps different pathways but again

5756
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:36,560
perhaps different pathways but again
 

5757
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,470
perhaps different pathways but again
something that is totally untapped

5758
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:38,480
something that is totally untapped
 

5759
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,709
something that is totally untapped
scientifically i think we try to bring

5760
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:40,719
scientifically i think we try to bring
 

5761
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,709
scientifically i think we try to bring
this question up a couple of times

5762
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
this question up a couple of times
 

5763
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:45,430
this question up a couple of times
but let's return to it again is what do

5764
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:45,440
but let's return to it again is what do
 

5765
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:46,709
but let's return to it again is what do
you think is the difference between the

5766
01:35:46,709 --> 01:35:46,719
you think is the difference between the
 

5767
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:48,070
you think is the difference between the
way a computer

5768
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:48,080
way a computer
 

5769
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,550
way a computer
represents information the human genome

5770
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:50,560
represents information the human genome
 

5771
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,470
represents information the human genome
represents and stores information

5772
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:52,480
represents and stores information
 

5773
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,030
represents and stores information
like what and maybe broadly what is the

5774
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:55,040
like what and maybe broadly what is the
 

5775
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,470
like what and maybe broadly what is the
difference between

5776
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:56,480
difference between
 

5777
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:57,990
difference between
how you think about computers and how

5778
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:58,000
how you think about computers and how
 

5779
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,229
how you think about computers and how
you think about biological systems

5780
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:00,239
you think about biological systems
 

5781
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:01,990
you think about biological systems
so i made a very provocative claim

5782
01:36:01,990 --> 01:36:02,000
so i made a very provocative claim
 

5783
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,229
so i made a very provocative claim
earlier that we are a digital computer

5784
01:36:04,229 --> 01:36:04,239
earlier that we are a digital computer
 

5785
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:05,990
earlier that we are a digital computer
like that at the core lies a digital

5786
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:06,000
like that at the core lies a digital
 

5787
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,910
like that at the core lies a digital
code and that's true in many ways but

5788
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:07,920
code and that's true in many ways but
 

5789
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,830
code and that's true in many ways but
surrounding that digital core there's a

5790
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840
surrounding that digital core there's a
 

5791
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,270
surrounding that digital core there's a
huge amount of analog

5792
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:11,280
huge amount of analog
 

5793
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,109
huge amount of analog
if you look at our brain it's not really

5794
01:36:13,109 --> 01:36:13,119
if you look at our brain it's not really
 

5795
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:15,030
if you look at our brain it's not really
digital if you look at our sort of

5796
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:15,040
digital if you look at our sort of
 

5797
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,870
digital if you look at our sort of
rna and all of that stuff inside our

5798
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:16,880
rna and all of that stuff inside our
 

5799
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:18,629
rna and all of that stuff inside our
cell it's not really digital it's really

5800
01:36:18,629 --> 01:36:18,639
cell it's not really digital it's really
 

5801
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:22,149
cell it's not really digital it's really
analog in many ways but let's start with

5802
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:22,159
analog in many ways but let's start with
 

5803
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:23,669
analog in many ways but let's start with
the code and then we'll expand

5804
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
the code and then we'll expand
 

5805
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:26,550
the code and then we'll expand
to the rest so the code itself is

5806
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:26,560
to the rest so the code itself is
 

5807
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,750
to the rest so the code itself is
digital

5808
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:27,760
digital
 

5809
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:29,270
digital
so there's genes you can think of the

5810
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:29,280
so there's genes you can think of the
 

5811
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,109
so there's genes you can think of the
genes as i don't know the

5812
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:31,119
genes as i don't know the
 

5813
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:33,189
genes as i don't know the
procedures the functions inside your

5814
01:36:33,189 --> 01:36:33,199
procedures the functions inside your
 

5815
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:34,629
procedures the functions inside your
language and then

5816
01:36:34,629 --> 01:36:34,639
language and then
 

5817
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,149
language and then
somehow you have to turn these functions

5818
01:36:36,149 --> 01:36:36,159
somehow you have to turn these functions
 

5819
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:37,669
somehow you have to turn these functions
on how do you call a gene how do you

5820
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:37,679
on how do you call a gene how do you
 

5821
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:39,750
on how do you call a gene how do you
call that function the way that you

5822
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:39,760
call that function the way that you
 

5823
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:40,950
call that function the way that you
would do it in old

5824
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:40,960
would do it in old
 

5825
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,189
would do it in old
programming languages is go to address

5826
01:36:43,189 --> 01:36:43,199
programming languages is go to address
 

5827
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:44,870
programming languages is go to address
whatever in your memory and then you

5828
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:44,880
whatever in your memory and then you
 

5829
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,229
whatever in your memory and then you
start running from there

5830
01:36:46,229 --> 01:36:46,239
start running from there
 

5831
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,310
start running from there
and you know modern programming

5832
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:48,320
and you know modern programming
 

5833
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,229
and you know modern programming
languages have encapsulated this into

5834
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:50,239
languages have encapsulated this into
 

5835
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:51,910
languages have encapsulated this into
functions and objects and all of that

5836
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:51,920
functions and objects and all of that
 

5837
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,669
functions and objects and all of that
and it's nice and cute but in the end

5838
01:36:53,669 --> 01:36:53,679
and it's nice and cute but in the end
 

5839
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:54,390
and it's nice and cute but in the end
deep down

5840
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:54,400
deep down
 

5841
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,910
deep down
there's still an assembly code that says

5842
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:55,920
there's still an assembly code that says
 

5843
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,070
there's still an assembly code that says
go to that instruction and it runs that

5844
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:58,080
go to that instruction and it runs that
 

5845
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,590
go to that instruction and it runs that
instruction

5846
01:36:59,590 --> 01:36:59,600
instruction
 

5847
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,070
instruction
if you look at the human genome and you

5848
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:02,080
if you look at the human genome and you
 

5849
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,510
if you look at the human genome and you
know the genome of pretty much

5850
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:03,520
know the genome of pretty much
 

5851
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:06,709
know the genome of pretty much
most species out there it's

5852
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:06,719
most species out there it's

01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,790
most species out there it's
there's no go-to function you just don't

01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:08,800
there's no go-to function you just don't
 

5855
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:09,750
there's no go-to function you just don't
start

01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:09,760
start
 

5857
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,830
start
in you know transcribing in position

5858
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:11,840

and the polymerase and all of that thing
 

5947
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,830
and the polymerase and all of that thing
which will first transcribe and then

01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:03,440
hugely messy and that's something that
 

6023
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,950
hugely messy and that's something that
we as computer scientists

6024
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:04,960
we as computer scientists
 

6025
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,790
we as computer scientists
don't embrace we like to have clean code

6026
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:08,800
don't embrace we like to have clean code
 

6027
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,030
don't embrace we like to have clean code
you know as like in engineering they

6028
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:11,040
you know as like in engineering they
 

6029
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,629
you know as like in engineering they
teach you about compartmentalization

6030
01:40:12,629 --> 01:40:12,639
teach you about compartmentalization
 

6031
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,709
teach you about compartmentalization
about sort of separating functions about

6032
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:14,719
about sort of separating functions about
 

6033
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:17,750
about sort of separating functions about
modularity about hierarchical design

6034
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:17,760
modularity about hierarchical design
 

6035
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,470
modularity about hierarchical design
none of that applies in bio testing

6036
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:19,480
none of that applies in bio testing
 

6037
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,350
none of that applies in bio testing
[Laughter]

6038
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:21,360
[Laughter]
 

6039
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,430
[Laughter]
testing sure yeah biology does plenty of

6040
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:23,440
testing sure yeah biology does plenty of
 

6041
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,470
testing sure yeah biology does plenty of
that but

6042
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:24,480
that but
 

6043
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,790
that but
i mean through evolutionary exploration

6044
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:26,800
i mean through evolutionary exploration
 

6045
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,629
i mean through evolutionary exploration
but um

6046
01:40:28,629 --> 01:40:28,639
but um
 

6047
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:32,070
but um
if you look at biological systems first

6048
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:32,080
if you look at biological systems first
 

6049
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:34,790
if you look at biological systems first
they are robust and then they specialize

6050
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:34,800
they are robust and then they specialize
 

6051
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,550
they are robust and then they specialize
to become anything else

6052
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:36,560
to become anything else
 

6053
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,790
to become anything else
and if you look at viruses the reason

6054
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:38,800
and if you look at viruses the reason
 

6055
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:40,229
and if you look at viruses the reason
why they're so

6056
01:40:40,229 --> 01:40:40,239
why they're so
 

6057
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:42,310
why they're so
elegant when you look at the design of

6058
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:42,320
elegant when you look at the design of
 

6059
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:43,430
elegant when you look at the design of
this you know

6060
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:43,440
this you know
 

6061
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,629
this you know
genome it seems so elegant and

6062
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:46,639
genome it seems so elegant and
 

6063
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:48,310
genome it seems so elegant and
the reason for that is that it's been

6064
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:48,320
the reason for that is that it's been
 

6065
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:49,669
the reason for that is that it's been
stripped down

6066
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:49,679
stripped down
 

6067
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:52,070
stripped down
from something much larger because of

6068
01:40:52,070 --> 01:40:52,080
from something much larger because of
 

6069
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,830
from something much larger because of
the pressure to keep it compact

6070
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:53,840
the pressure to keep it compact
 

6071
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,310
the pressure to keep it compact
so many compact genomes out there have

6072
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:56,320
so many compact genomes out there have
 

6073
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,550
so many compact genomes out there have
ancestors that were much larger

6074
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:58,560
ancestors that were much larger
 

6075
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,870
ancestors that were much larger
you don't start small and become big you

6076
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:00,880
you don't start small and become big you
 

6077
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,310
you don't start small and become big you
go through a loop of

6078
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:02,320
go through a loop of
 

6079
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,950
go through a loop of
add a bunch of stuff increase complexity

6080
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:04,960
add a bunch of stuff increase complexity
 

6081
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:05,669
add a bunch of stuff increase complexity
and then

6082
01:41:05,669 --> 01:41:05,679
and then
 

6083
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:08,470
and then
you know slim it down and one of my

6084
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:08,480
you know slim it down and one of my
 

6085
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,310
you know slim it down and one of my
early papers was in fact

6086
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:10,320
early papers was in fact
 

6087
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,550
early papers was in fact
on genome duplication one of the things

6088
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:12,560
on genome duplication one of the things
 

6089
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,470
on genome duplication one of the things
we found is that baker's yeast which is

6090
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:14,480
we found is that baker's yeast which is
 

6091
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,109
we found is that baker's yeast which is
the

6092
01:41:15,109 --> 01:41:15,119
the
 

6093
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:17,109
the
you know yeast that you use to make

6094
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:17,119
you know yeast that you use to make
 

6095
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:18,390
you know yeast that you use to make
bread but also the yeast that you use to

6096
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:18,400
bread but also the yeast that you use to
 

6097
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:19,270
bread but also the yeast that you use to
make wine

6098
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:19,280
make wine
 

6099
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,790
make wine
which is basically the dominant species

6100
01:41:20,790 --> 01:41:20,800
which is basically the dominant species
 

6101
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,390
which is basically the dominant species
when you go in the fields of tuscany and

6102
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:22,400
when you go in the fields of tuscany and
 

6103
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,830
when you go in the fields of tuscany and
you say you know what's out there

6104
01:41:23,830 --> 01:41:23,840
you say you know what's out there
 

6105
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,149
you say you know what's out there
it's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae

6106
01:41:26,149 --> 01:41:26,159
it's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae
 

6107
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:27,790
it's basically saccharomyces cerevisiae
or the way my italian friends say

6108
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:27,800
or the way my italian friends say
 

6109
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,830
or the way my italian friends say
saccharomyces

6110
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:30,840

 

6111
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:34,390

so um uh which means what

6112
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:34,400
so um uh which means what
 

6113
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,550
so um uh which means what
oh sakura okay i'm sorry i'm i'm greek

6114
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:36,560
oh sakura okay i'm sorry i'm i'm greek
 

6115
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,910
oh sakura okay i'm sorry i'm i'm greek
so yeah zacharo

6116
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:37,920
so yeah zacharo
 

6117
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,310
so yeah zacharo
mickeys zacharo is sugar minky's is

6118
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:40,320
mickeys zacharo is sugar minky's is
 

6119
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,030
mickeys zacharo is sugar minky's is
fungus

6120
01:41:41,030 --> 01:41:41,040
fungus
 

6121
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,470
fungus
yes cerevisiae cerveza beer

6122
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:44,480
yes cerevisiae cerveza beer
 

6123
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,189
yes cerevisiae cerveza beer
so so it means the sugar fungus of beer

6124
01:41:47,189 --> 01:41:47,199
so so it means the sugar fungus of beer
 

6125
01:41:47,199 --> 01:41:47,750
so so it means the sugar fungus of beer
yeah

6126
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:47,760
yeah
 

6127
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,030
yeah
you know less less sounding to the

6128
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:51,040
you know less less sounding to the
 

6129
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,750
you know less less sounding to the
still poetic yeah so anyway uh

6130
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
still poetic yeah so anyway uh
 

6131
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,350
still poetic yeah so anyway uh
saccharomyces cerevisiae basically the

6132
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,360
saccharomyces cerevisiae basically the
 

6133
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,030
saccharomyces cerevisiae basically the
major baker's yeast out there

6134
01:41:57,030 --> 01:41:57,040
major baker's yeast out there
 

6135
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,950
major baker's yeast out there
is the descendant of a whole genome

6136
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:58,960
is the descendant of a whole genome
 

6137
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,390
is the descendant of a whole genome
duplication

6138
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:00,400
duplication
 

6139
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:01,590
duplication
why would a whole genuine duplication

6140
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:01,600
why would a whole genuine duplication
 

6141
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:04,390
why would a whole genuine duplication
even happen when it happened

6142
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:04,400
even happen when it happened
 

6143
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:07,430
even happen when it happened
is coinciding with about 100 million

6144
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:07,440
is coinciding with about 100 million
 

6145
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:08,229
is coinciding with about 100 million
years ago

6146
01:42:08,229 --> 01:42:08,239
years ago
 

6147
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:11,270
years ago
and the emergence of

6148
01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:11,280
and the emergence of
 

6149
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:14,310
and the emergence of
fruit-bearing plants

6150
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:14,320
fruit-bearing plants
 

6151
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:16,629
fruit-bearing plants
why fruit-bearing plants because animals

6152
01:42:16,629 --> 01:42:16,639
why fruit-bearing plants because animals
 

6153
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:17,750
why fruit-bearing plants because animals
would eat

6154
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:17,760
would eat
 

6155
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:21,510
would eat
the fruit and would walk around and poop

6156
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:21,520
the fruit and would walk around and poop
 

6157
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,229
the fruit and would walk around and poop
huge amounts of nutrients along with a

6158
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:24,239
huge amounts of nutrients along with a
 

6159
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:24,950
huge amounts of nutrients along with a
seed

6160
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:24,960
seed
 

6161
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:27,270
seed
for the plants to spread before that

6162
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:27,280
for the plants to spread before that
 

6163
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,470
for the plants to spread before that
plants were not spreading through

6164
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:28,480
plants were not spreading through
 

6165
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,390
plants were not spreading through
animals they were spreading through wind

6166
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:30,400
animals they were spreading through wind
 

6167
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,390
animals they were spreading through wind
and all kinds of other ways but

6168
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:32,400
and all kinds of other ways but
 

6169
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,270
and all kinds of other ways but
basically the moment you have

6170
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:33,280
basically the moment you have
 

6171
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,470
basically the moment you have
fruit-bearing plants

6172
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:34,480
fruit-bearing plants
 

6173
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:37,590
fruit-bearing plants
the the the these plants are basically

6174
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:37,600
the the the these plants are basically
 

6175
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,350
the the the these plants are basically
creating this abundance of sugar in the

6176
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:39,360
creating this abundance of sugar in the
 

6177
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,350
creating this abundance of sugar in the
environment so there's an evolutionary

6178
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:41,360
environment so there's an evolutionary
 

6179
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,870
environment so there's an evolutionary
niche that gets created

6180
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:42,880
niche that gets created
 

6181
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,229
niche that gets created
and in that evolutionary niche you

6182
01:42:44,229 --> 01:42:44,239
and in that evolutionary niche you
 

6183
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,790
and in that evolutionary niche you
basically have enough sugar

6184
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:46,800
basically have enough sugar
 

6185
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,950
basically have enough sugar
that a whole genome duplication which

6186
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:48,960
that a whole genome duplication which
 

6187
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,189
that a whole genome duplication which
initially is a very messy event

6188
01:42:51,189 --> 01:42:51,199
initially is a very messy event
 

6189
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:54,709
initially is a very messy event
allows you to then you know relieve some

6190
01:42:54,709 --> 01:42:54,719
allows you to then you know relieve some
 

6191
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,070
allows you to then you know relieve some
of that complexity

6192
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:56,080
of that complexity
 

6193
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,030
of that complexity
so to pause what does genome duplication

6194
01:42:59,030 --> 01:42:59,040
so to pause what does genome duplication
 

6195
01:42:59,040 --> 01:42:59,590
so to pause what does genome duplication
mean

6196
01:42:59,590 --> 01:42:59,600
mean
 

6197
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,189
mean
that basically means that instead of

6198
01:43:01,189 --> 01:43:01,199
that basically means that instead of
 

6199
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:03,189
that basically means that instead of
having eight chromosomes

6200
01:43:03,189 --> 01:43:03,199
having eight chromosomes
 

6201
01:43:03,199 --> 01:43:06,390
having eight chromosomes
you can now have 16 chromosomes

6202
01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:06,400
you can now have 16 chromosomes
 

6203
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:09,590
you can now have 16 chromosomes
so but with the duplication at first

6204
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:09,600
so but with the duplication at first
 

6205
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,470
so but with the duplication at first
when you have

6206
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:10,480
when you have
 

6207
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,430
when you have
six when you go to 16 you're not using

6208
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:13,440
six when you go to 16 you're not using
 

6209
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:13,830
six when you go to 16 you're not using
that

6210
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:13,840
that
 

6211
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,149
that
oh yeah you are yeah so basically from

6212
01:43:16,149 --> 01:43:16,159
oh yeah you are yeah so basically from
 

6213
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:17,350
oh yeah you are yeah so basically from
one day to the next

6214
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:17,360
one day to the next
 

6215
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:18,629
one day to the next
you went from having eight chromosomes

6216
01:43:18,629 --> 01:43:18,639
you went from having eight chromosomes
 

6217
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:20,390
you went from having eight chromosomes
to having 16 chromosomes

6218
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:20,400
to having 16 chromosomes
 

6219
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,310
to having 16 chromosomes
probably a non-disjunction event during

6220
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:22,320
probably a non-disjunction event during
 

6221
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,149
probably a non-disjunction event during
a duplication during a division

6222
01:43:24,149 --> 01:43:24,159
a duplication during a division
 

6223
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:26,229
a duplication during a division
so you basically divide the cell instead

6224
01:43:26,229 --> 01:43:26,239
so you basically divide the cell instead
 

6225
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,910
so you basically divide the cell instead
of half the genome going this way and

6226
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:27,920
of half the genome going this way and
 

6227
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,109
of half the genome going this way and
half the genome going the other way

6228
01:43:29,109 --> 01:43:29,119
half the genome going the other way
 

6229
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:29,510
half the genome going the other way
after

6230
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:29,520
after
 

6231
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,189
after
duplication of the genome you basically

6232
01:43:31,189 --> 01:43:31,199
duplication of the genome you basically
 

6233
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:33,030
duplication of the genome you basically
have all of it going to one cell

6234
01:43:33,030 --> 01:43:33,040
have all of it going to one cell
 

6235
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,270
have all of it going to one cell
and then there's a sufficient messiness

6236
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:35,280
and then there's a sufficient messiness
 

6237
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,430
and then there's a sufficient messiness
there that you end up with

6238
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:37,440
there that you end up with
 

6239
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,270
there that you end up with
slight differences that make most of

6240
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:39,280
slight differences that make most of
 

6241
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:42,310
slight differences that make most of
these chromosomes be actually preserved

6242
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:42,320
these chromosomes be actually preserved
 

6243
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,070
these chromosomes be actually preserved
it's a long story short but it's a big

6244
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,080
it's a long story short but it's a big
 

6245
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,669
it's a long story short but it's a big
upgrade right so that's

6246
01:43:45,669 --> 01:43:45,679
upgrade right so that's
 

6247
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:47,669
upgrade right so that's
not necessarily because what happens

6248
01:43:47,669 --> 01:43:47,679
not necessarily because what happens
 

6249
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,270
not necessarily because what happens
immediately thereafter is that you start

6250
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:49,280
immediately thereafter is that you start
 

6251
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,390
immediately thereafter is that you start
massively losing

6252
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
massively losing
 

6253
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,870
massively losing
tons of those duplicated genes so ninety

6254
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:52,880
tons of those duplicated genes so ninety
 

6255
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,229
tons of those duplicated genes so ninety
percent of those genes were actually

6256
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:54,239
percent of those genes were actually
 

6257
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:55,510
percent of those genes were actually
lost

6258
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:55,520
lost
 

6259
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,149
lost
very rapidly after holding duplication

6260
01:43:58,149 --> 01:43:58,159
very rapidly after holding duplication
 

6261
01:43:58,159 --> 01:43:59,830
very rapidly after holding duplication
and the reason for that is that

6262
01:43:59,830 --> 01:43:59,840
and the reason for that is that
 

6263
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,950
and the reason for that is that
biology is not intelligent it's just

6264
01:44:02,950 --> 01:44:02,960
biology is not intelligent it's just
 

6265
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,470
biology is not intelligent it's just
ruthless selection random mutation

6266
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:06,480
ruthless selection random mutation
 

6267
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,310
ruthless selection random mutation
so the ruthless selection basically

6268
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:08,320
so the ruthless selection basically
 

6269
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,669
so the ruthless selection basically
means that as soon as one of the random

6270
01:44:09,669 --> 01:44:09,679
means that as soon as one of the random
 

6271
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,430
means that as soon as one of the random
mutations hit one gene

6272
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
mutations hit one gene
 

6273
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,030
mutations hit one gene
ruthless selection just kills off that

6274
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:13,040
ruthless selection just kills off that
 

6275
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,030
ruthless selection just kills off that
gene it's just you know

6276
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:15,040
gene it's just you know
 

6277
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:17,910
gene it's just you know
you you know if you have a pressure to

6278
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:17,920
you you know if you have a pressure to
 

6279
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,510
you you know if you have a pressure to
maintain a small compact genome

6280
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:19,520
maintain a small compact genome
 

6281
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,430
maintain a small compact genome
you will very rapidly lose the second

6282
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,440
you will very rapidly lose the second
 

6283
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,870
you will very rapidly lose the second
copy of most of your genes

6284
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:22,880
copy of most of your genes
 

6285
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,030
copy of most of your genes
and a small number 10 were kept in two

6286
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:25,040
and a small number 10 were kept in two
 

6287
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,430
and a small number 10 were kept in two
copies and those had to do a lot with

6288
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:27,440
copies and those had to do a lot with
 

6289
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:30,229
copies and those had to do a lot with
environment adaptation with the speed of

6290
01:44:30,229 --> 01:44:30,239
environment adaptation with the speed of
 

6291
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:31,109
environment adaptation with the speed of
replication

6292
01:44:31,109 --> 01:44:31,119
replication
 

6293
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:32,870
replication
with the speed of translation and with

6294
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:32,880
with the speed of translation and with
 

6295
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,310
with the speed of translation and with
sugar processing

6296
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:34,320
sugar processing
 

6297
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,149
sugar processing
so i'm making a long story short to

6298
01:44:36,149 --> 01:44:36,159
so i'm making a long story short to
 

6299
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:37,590
so i'm making a long story short to
basically say that evolution is

6300
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:37,600
basically say that evolution is
 

6301
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:40,790
basically say that evolution is
messy the only way like so so

6302
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:40,800
messy the only way like so so
 

6303
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,229
messy the only way like so so
you know the example that i was giving

6304
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:42,239
you know the example that i was giving
 

6305
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,070
you know the example that i was giving
of messing with 20

6306
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:44,080
of messing with 20
 

6307
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,390
of messing with 20
of your bits in your computer totally

6308
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:46,400
of your bits in your computer totally
 

6309
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,270
of your bits in your computer totally
bogus

6310
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,280
bogus
 

6311
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:49,030
bogus
duplicating all your functions and just

6312
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:49,040
duplicating all your functions and just
 

6313
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,629
duplicating all your functions and just
throwing them out there in the same

6314
01:44:50,629 --> 01:44:50,639
throwing them out there in the same
 

6315
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:52,870
throwing them out there in the same
you know function just totally bogus

6316
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:52,880
you know function just totally bogus
 

6317
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,070
you know function just totally bogus
like this would never work in an

6318
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,080
like this would never work in an
 

6319
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,189
like this would never work in an
engineer system

6320
01:44:55,189 --> 01:44:55,199
engineer system
 

6321
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,990
engineer system
but biological systems because of this

6322
01:44:57,990 --> 01:44:58,000
but biological systems because of this
 

6323
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,669
but biological systems because of this
content-based indexing and because of

6324
01:44:59,669 --> 01:44:59,679
content-based indexing and because of
 

6325
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:00,229
content-based indexing and because of
this

6326
01:45:00,229 --> 01:45:00,239
this
 

6327
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:03,189
this
modularity that comes from the fact that

6328
01:45:03,189 --> 01:45:03,199
modularity that comes from the fact that
 

6329
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:04,950
modularity that comes from the fact that
the gene is controlled by a series of

6330
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:04,960
the gene is controlled by a series of
 

6331
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:06,550
the gene is controlled by a series of
tags and now if you need this gene in

6332
01:45:06,550 --> 01:45:06,560
tags and now if you need this gene in
 

6333
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,590
tags and now if you need this gene in
another

6334
01:45:07,590 --> 01:45:07,600
another
 

6335
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:09,990
another
setting you just add some more tags that

6336
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:10,000
setting you just add some more tags that
 

6337
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,430
setting you just add some more tags that
will basically turn it on

6338
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:11,440
will basically turn it on
 

6339
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:13,510
will basically turn it on
also in those settings so this gene is

6340
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:13,520
also in those settings so this gene is
 

6341
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,109
also in those settings so this gene is
now pressured

6342
01:45:15,109 --> 01:45:15,119
now pressured
 

6343
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:17,990
now pressured
to to do two different functions and it

6344
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:18,000
to to do two different functions and it
 

6345
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,830
to to do two different functions and it
builds up complexity

6346
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:19,840
builds up complexity
 

6347
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,669
builds up complexity
i see a whole term duplication and gene

6348
01:45:21,669 --> 01:45:21,679
i see a whole term duplication and gene
 

6349
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:23,189
i see a whole term duplication and gene
duplication in general as a way to

6350
01:45:23,189 --> 01:45:23,199
duplication in general as a way to
 

6351
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:24,550
duplication in general as a way to
relieve that complexity

6352
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:24,560
relieve that complexity
 

6353
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,070
relieve that complexity
so you have this gradual buildup of

6354
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:26,080
so you have this gradual buildup of
 

6355
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,830
so you have this gradual buildup of
complexity as functions get

6356
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:27,840
complexity as functions get
 

6357
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,910
complexity as functions get
past get sort of added on to the

6358
01:45:29,910 --> 01:45:29,920
past get sort of added on to the
 

6359
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,030
past get sort of added on to the
existing genes

6360
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:31,040
existing genes
 

6361
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,270
existing genes
and then boom you duplicate your your

6362
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:33,280
and then boom you duplicate your your
 

6363
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,310
and then boom you duplicate your your
workforce

6364
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:34,320
workforce
 

6365
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,870
workforce
and you now have two copies of this gene

6366
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:36,880
and you now have two copies of this gene
 

6367
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,790
and you now have two copies of this gene
one will probably specialize to do one

6368
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:38,800
one will probably specialize to do one
 

6369
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,149
one will probably specialize to do one
and the other one will specialize to do

6370
01:45:40,149 --> 01:45:40,159
and the other one will specialize to do
 

6371
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:41,430
and the other one will specialize to do
the other or one will maintain the

6372
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:41,440
the other or one will maintain the
 

6373
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:42,790
the other or one will maintain the
ancestral function the other one will

6374
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:42,800
ancestral function the other one will
 

6375
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,430
ancestral function the other one will
sort of

6376
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:43,440
sort of
 

6377
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,229
sort of
be free to evolve and specialize while

6378
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:46,239
be free to evolve and specialize while
 

6379
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:47,750
be free to evolve and specialize while
losing the ancestral functions

6380
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:47,760
losing the ancestral functions
 

6381
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,669
losing the ancestral functions
and so forth so that's how genomes

6382
01:45:49,669 --> 01:45:49,679
and so forth so that's how genomes
 

6383
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:50,870
and so forth so that's how genomes
evolve they're they're just

6384
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:50,880
evolve they're they're just
 

6385
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:54,070
evolve they're they're just
messy things but they're extremely fault

6386
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:54,080
messy things but they're extremely fault
 

6387
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:54,709
messy things but they're extremely fault
tolerant

6388
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
tolerant
 

6389
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:57,910
tolerant
and they're extremely able to deal with

6390
01:45:57,910 --> 01:45:57,920
and they're extremely able to deal with
 

6391
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,430
and they're extremely able to deal with
mutations because that's

6392
01:45:59,430 --> 01:45:59,440
mutations because that's
 

6393
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,870
mutations because that's
the very way that you generate new

6394
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:02,880
the very way that you generate new
 

6395
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,590
the very way that you generate new
functions so new functionalization comes

6396
01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:05,600
functions so new functionalization comes
 

6397
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:06,149
functions so new functionalization comes
from

6398
01:46:06,149 --> 01:46:06,159
from
 

6399
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:08,229
from
the very thing that breaks it so even in

6400
01:46:08,229 --> 01:46:08,239
the very thing that breaks it so even in
 

6401
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:09,189
the very thing that breaks it so even in
the current pandemic

6402
01:46:09,189 --> 01:46:09,199
the current pandemic
 

6403
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:10,870
the current pandemic
many people are asking me which

6404
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:10,880
many people are asking me which
 

6405
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:12,629
many people are asking me which
mutations matter the most

6406
01:46:12,629 --> 01:46:12,639
mutations matter the most
 

6407
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:15,030
mutations matter the most
and what i tell them is well we can

6408
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:15,040
and what i tell them is well we can
 

6409
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:16,550
and what i tell them is well we can
study the evolutionary dynamics of the

6410
01:46:16,550 --> 01:46:16,560
study the evolutionary dynamics of the
 

6411
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:17,430
study the evolutionary dynamics of the
current genome

6412
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:17,440
current genome
 

6413
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:21,590
current genome
to then understand which mutations have

6414
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:21,600
to then understand which mutations have
 

6415
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,790
to then understand which mutations have
previously happened or not and

6416
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:24,800
previously happened or not and
 

6417
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,109
previously happened or not and
which mutations happen in genes that

6418
01:46:27,109 --> 01:46:27,119
which mutations happen in genes that
 

6419
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:29,030
which mutations happen in genes that
evolve rapidly or not

6420
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,040
evolve rapidly or not
 

6421
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:30,310
evolve rapidly or not
and one of the things we found for

6422
01:46:30,310 --> 01:46:30,320
and one of the things we found for
 

6423
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,709
and one of the things we found for
example is that

6424
01:46:32,709 --> 01:46:32,719
example is that
 

6425
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,390
example is that
the genes that evolved rapidly in the

6426
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:34,400
the genes that evolved rapidly in the
 

6427
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,390
the genes that evolved rapidly in the
past are still evolving rapidly now in

6428
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:36,400
past are still evolving rapidly now in
 

6429
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:37,669
past are still evolving rapidly now in
the current pandemic

6430
01:46:37,669 --> 01:46:37,679
the current pandemic
 

6431
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:39,350
the current pandemic
the genes have evolved slowly in the

6432
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:39,360
the genes have evolved slowly in the
 

6433
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,030
the genes have evolved slowly in the
past are still evolving slowly

6434
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,040
past are still evolving slowly
 

6435
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,109
past are still evolving slowly
which means that they're useful which

6436
01:46:43,109 --> 01:46:43,119
which means that they're useful which
 

6437
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:44,070
which means that they're useful which
means that they're

6438
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,080
means that they're
 

6439
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,229
means that they're
under the same evolutionary pressures

6440
01:46:46,229 --> 01:46:46,239
under the same evolutionary pressures
 

6441
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:47,189
under the same evolutionary pressures
but then the question

6442
01:46:47,189 --> 01:46:47,199
but then the question
 

6443
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:50,390
but then the question
is what happens in specific mutations

6444
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:50,400
is what happens in specific mutations
 

6445
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,270
is what happens in specific mutations
so if you look at the d614 gene mutation

6446
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:53,280
so if you look at the d614 gene mutation
 

6447
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,709
so if you look at the d614 gene mutation
that's been all over the news so

6448
01:46:54,709 --> 01:46:54,719
that's been all over the news so
 

6449
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,350
that's been all over the news so
in position 614 in the amino acids and

6450
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:57,360
in position 614 in the amino acids and
 

6451
01:46:57,360 --> 01:46:58,310
in position 614 in the amino acids and
harvest 14

6452
01:46:58,310 --> 01:46:58,320
harvest 14
 

6453
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:01,510
harvest 14
of the s protein there's a

6454
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:01,520
of the s protein there's a
 

6455
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:04,149
of the s protein there's a
d to g mutation that that sort of has

6456
01:47:04,149 --> 01:47:04,159
d to g mutation that that sort of has
 

6457
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:05,189
d to g mutation that that sort of has
creeped over

6458
01:47:05,189 --> 01:47:05,199
creeped over
 

6459
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:08,870
creeped over
the population mutation

6460
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:08,880
the population mutation
 

6461
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,070
the population mutation
we found out through my work disrupts a

6462
01:47:12,070 --> 01:47:12,080
we found out through my work disrupts a
 

6463
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,990
we found out through my work disrupts a
perfectly conserved nucleotide position

6464
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:14,000
perfectly conserved nucleotide position
 

6465
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,669
perfectly conserved nucleotide position
that has never been changed in the

6466
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:15,679
that has never been changed in the
 

6467
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:16,629
that has never been changed in the
history of

6468
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:16,639
history of
 

6469
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,390
history of
millions of years of equivalent

6470
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:18,400
millions of years of equivalent
 

6471
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,390
millions of years of equivalent
mammalian evolution

6472
01:47:20,390 --> 01:47:20,400
mammalian evolution
 

6473
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,669
mammalian evolution
of these viruses that basically means

6474
01:47:23,669 --> 01:47:23,679
of these viruses that basically means
 

6475
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:25,910
of these viruses that basically means
that it's a completely new adaptation

6476
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:25,920
that it's a completely new adaptation
 

6477
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,109
that it's a completely new adaptation
to human and that mutation has now gone

6478
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:29,119
to human and that mutation has now gone
 

6479
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:29,830
to human and that mutation has now gone
from

6480
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:29,840
from
 

6481
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,229
from
one percent frequency to 90 frequency in

6482
01:47:32,229 --> 01:47:32,239
one percent frequency to 90 frequency in
 

6483
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:33,750
one percent frequency to 90 frequency in
almost all outbreaks

6484
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:33,760
almost all outbreaks
 

6485
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,830
almost all outbreaks
so this mutation i like how you say in

6486
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:35,840
so this mutation i like how you say in
 

6487
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,149
so this mutation i like how you say in
the mu the

6488
01:47:37,149 --> 01:47:37,159
the mu the
 

6489
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:40,550
the mu the
416 what was it okay yes 6 on 14 sorry

6490
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:40,560
416 what was it okay yes 6 on 14 sorry
 

6491
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:41,990
416 what was it okay yes 6 on 14 sorry
614 right that

6492
01:47:41,990 --> 01:47:42,000
614 right that
 

6493
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,669
614 right that
d614g dc so so literally

6494
01:47:45,669 --> 01:47:45,679
d614g dc so so literally
 

6495
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:47,430
d614g dc so so literally
so what you're saying is it's like a

6496
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:47,440
so what you're saying is it's like a
 

6497
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:48,709
so what you're saying is it's like a
chess move yeah so

6498
01:47:48,709 --> 01:47:48,719
chess move yeah so
 

6499
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:50,550
chess move yeah so
it's just mutated one letter to another

6500
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:50,560
it's just mutated one letter to another
 

6501
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,870
it's just mutated one letter to another
exactly and that hasn't happened before

6502
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:52,880
exactly and that hasn't happened before
 

6503
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,470
exactly and that hasn't happened before
yeah and and this somehow this mutation

6504
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:56,480
yeah and and this somehow this mutation
 

6505
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,669
yeah and and this somehow this mutation
is really useful

6506
01:47:57,669 --> 01:47:57,679
is really useful
 

6507
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,990
is really useful
uh it's really useful in the current

6508
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:00,000
uh it's really useful in the current
 

6509
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,910
uh it's really useful in the current
environment of the genome

6510
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:01,920
environment of the genome
 

6511
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,950
environment of the genome
which is moving from human to human when

6512
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:04,960
which is moving from human to human when
 

6513
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,709
which is moving from human to human when
it was moving from bad to bad

6514
01:48:06,709 --> 01:48:06,719
it was moving from bad to bad
 

6515
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:08,550
it was moving from bad to bad
it couldn't care less for that mutation

6516
01:48:08,550 --> 01:48:08,560
it couldn't care less for that mutation
 

6517
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,149
it couldn't care less for that mutation
but it's environment specific so now

6518
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:10,159
but it's environment specific so now
 

6519
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:11,750
but it's environment specific so now
that it's moving from human to human

6520
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:11,760
that it's moving from human to human
 

6521
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:14,950
that it's moving from human to human
whoo-hoo it's moving way better like by

6522
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:14,960
whoo-hoo it's moving way better like by
 

6523
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:17,189
whoo-hoo it's moving way better like by
orders of magnetism what do you okay so

6524
01:48:17,189 --> 01:48:17,199
orders of magnetism what do you okay so
 

6525
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,550
orders of magnetism what do you okay so
so you're like tracking this

6526
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:18,560
so you're like tracking this
 

6527
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,550
so you're like tracking this
evolutionary dynamics

6528
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:20,560
evolutionary dynamics
 

6529
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:23,270
evolutionary dynamics
which is fascinating but what do you do

6530
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:23,280
which is fascinating but what do you do
 

6531
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,070
which is fascinating but what do you do
with that

6532
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:24,080
with that
 

6533
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,830
with that
so what does that mean what does this

6534
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:25,840
so what does that mean what does this
 

6535
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,430
so what does that mean what does this
mean what do you make

6536
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:27,440
mean what do you make
 

6537
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,750
mean what do you make
what do you make of this mutation in uh

6538
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:29,760
what do you make of this mutation in uh
 

6539
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,510
what do you make of this mutation in uh
trying to anticipate i guess

6540
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:31,520
trying to anticipate i guess
 

6541
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:33,590
trying to anticipate i guess
is is the is one of the things you're

6542
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:33,600
is is the is one of the things you're
 

6543
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,189
is is the is one of the things you're
trying to do is anticipate

6544
01:48:35,189 --> 01:48:35,199
trying to do is anticipate
 

6545
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,750
trying to do is anticipate
where how this unrolls into the future

6546
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:37,760
where how this unrolls into the future
 

6547
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,629
where how this unrolls into the future
this this

6548
01:48:38,629 --> 01:48:38,639
this this
 

6549
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,229
this this
evolutionary dynamics such a great

6550
01:48:40,229 --> 01:48:40,239
evolutionary dynamics such a great
 

6551
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:41,910
evolutionary dynamics such a great
question so so there's there's two

6552
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:41,920
question so so there's there's two
 

6553
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:42,790
question so so there's there's two
things

6554
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:42,800
things
 

6555
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,629
things
remember when i was saying earlier

6556
01:48:44,629 --> 01:48:44,639
remember when i was saying earlier
 

6557
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:46,229
remember when i was saying earlier
mutation is the path

6558
01:48:46,229 --> 01:48:46,239
mutation is the path
 

6559
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:48,149
mutation is the path
to new things but also the path to break

6560
01:48:48,149 --> 01:48:48,159
to new things but also the path to break
 

6561
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:49,750
to new things but also the path to break
old things

6562
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:49,760
old things
 

6563
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:52,950
old things
so what we know is that this position

6564
01:48:52,950 --> 01:48:52,960
so what we know is that this position
 

6565
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:54,790
so what we know is that this position
was extremely preserved

6566
01:48:54,790 --> 01:48:54,800
was extremely preserved
 

6567
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,109
was extremely preserved
through gazillions of mutations that

6568
01:48:57,109 --> 01:48:57,119
through gazillions of mutations that
 

6569
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:58,709
through gazillions of mutations that
mutation was never tolerated when it was

6570
01:48:58,709 --> 01:48:58,719
mutation was never tolerated when it was
 

6571
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:00,070
mutation was never tolerated when it was
moving from best to bats

6572
01:49:00,070 --> 01:49:00,080
moving from best to bats
 

6573
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,109
moving from best to bats
so that basically means that that

6574
01:49:01,109 --> 01:49:01,119
so that basically means that that
 

6575
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:03,030
so that basically means that that
contain that position is extremely

6576
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,040
contain that position is extremely
 

6577
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:03,990
contain that position is extremely
important

6578
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,000
important
 

6579
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,750
important
in the function of that protein that's

6580
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:05,760
in the function of that protein that's
 

6581
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,510
in the function of that protein that's
the first thing it tells the second one

6582
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:07,520
the first thing it tells the second one
 

6583
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:08,149
the first thing it tells the second one
is that

6584
01:49:08,149 --> 01:49:08,159
is that
 

6585
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:11,590
is that
that position was very well suited to

6586
01:49:11,590 --> 01:49:11,600
that position was very well suited to
 

6587
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:13,109
that position was very well suited to
bat transmission but now

6588
01:49:13,109 --> 01:49:13,119
bat transmission but now
 

6589
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:14,629
bat transmission but now
is not well suited to human transmission

6590
01:49:14,629 --> 01:49:14,639
is not well suited to human transmission
 

6591
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,709
is not well suited to human transmission
so it got rid of it and it now has a new

6592
01:49:16,709 --> 01:49:16,719
so it got rid of it and it now has a new
 

6593
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:17,350
so it got rid of it and it now has a new
version

6594
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:17,360
version
 

6595
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:20,149
version
of that amino acid that basically makes

6596
01:49:20,149 --> 01:49:20,159
of that amino acid that basically makes
 

6597
01:49:20,159 --> 01:49:22,070
of that amino acid that basically makes
it much easier to transmit from human to

6598
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:22,080
it much easier to transmit from human to
 

6599
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:22,709
it much easier to transmit from human to
human

6600
01:49:22,709 --> 01:49:22,719
human
 

6601
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:25,910
human
so in terms of the

6602
01:49:25,910 --> 01:49:25,920
so in terms of the
 

6603
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,390
so in terms of the
evolutionary history teaching us about

6604
01:49:28,390 --> 01:49:28,400
evolutionary history teaching us about
 

6605
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,750
evolutionary history teaching us about
the future

6606
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:29,760
the future
 

6607
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,990
the future
it basically tells us here's the regions

6608
01:49:31,990 --> 01:49:32,000
it basically tells us here's the regions
 

6609
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,430
it basically tells us here's the regions
that are

6610
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:33,440
that are
 

6611
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,510
that are
currently mutating here's the regions

6612
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:35,520
currently mutating here's the regions
 

6613
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,030
currently mutating here's the regions
that are most likely to imitate going

6614
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:37,040
that are most likely to imitate going
 

6615
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:37,830
that are most likely to imitate going
forward

6616
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:37,840
forward
 

6617
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,910
forward
as you're building a vaccine here's what

6618
01:49:39,910 --> 01:49:39,920
as you're building a vaccine here's what
 

6619
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:41,669
as you're building a vaccine here's what
you should be focusing on

6620
01:49:41,669 --> 01:49:41,679
you should be focusing on
 

6621
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:43,589
you should be focusing on
in terms of the most stable regions that

6622
01:49:43,589 --> 01:49:43,599
in terms of the most stable regions that
 

6623
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,430
in terms of the most stable regions that
are the least likely to mutate

6624
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:45,440
are the least likely to mutate
 

6625
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,070
are the least likely to mutate
or here's the newly evolved functions

6626
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,080
or here's the newly evolved functions
 

6627
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,229
or here's the newly evolved functions
that are most likely to be important

6628
01:49:50,229 --> 01:49:50,239
that are most likely to be important
 

6629
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:53,910
that are most likely to be important
because they've overcome this local

6630
01:49:53,910 --> 01:49:53,920
because they've overcome this local
 

6631
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,709
because they've overcome this local
maximum that it had reached in the in

6632
01:49:56,709 --> 01:49:56,719
maximum that it had reached in the in
 

6633
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:57,990
maximum that it had reached in the in
the

6634
01:49:57,990 --> 01:49:58,000
the
 

6635
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,390
the
bat transmission so anyway it's a

6636
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:00,400
bat transmission so anyway it's a
 

6637
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,229
bat transmission so anyway it's a
tangent to basically say that

6638
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:02,239
tangent to basically say that
 

6639
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:04,550
tangent to basically say that
evolution works in messy ways and the

6640
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:04,560
evolution works in messy ways and the
 

6641
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,270
evolution works in messy ways and the
thing that

6642
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:05,280
thing that
 

6643
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:09,030
thing that
you would break is the

6644
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:09,040
you would break is the
 

6645
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,790
you would break is the
thing that actually allows you to first

6646
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:10,800
thing that actually allows you to first
 

6647
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,149
thing that actually allows you to first
go through a lull

6648
01:50:12,149 --> 01:50:12,159
go through a lull
 

6649
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:15,189
go through a lull
and then reaching new local maximum

6650
01:50:15,189 --> 01:50:15,199
and then reaching new local maximum
 

6651
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:17,750
and then reaching new local maximum
and i often like to say that if

6652
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:17,760
and i often like to say that if
 

6653
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:18,870
and i often like to say that if
engineers

6654
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:18,880
engineers
 

6655
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,350
engineers
had basically designed evolution we

6656
01:50:21,350 --> 01:50:21,360
had basically designed evolution we
 

6657
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:22,790
had basically designed evolution we
would still be

6658
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:22,800
would still be
 

6659
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:26,629
would still be
perfectly replicating bacteria

6660
01:50:26,629 --> 01:50:26,639

 

6661
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:28,550

because it's by making the bacterium

6662
01:50:28,550 --> 01:50:28,560
because it's by making the bacterium
 

6663
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,950
because it's by making the bacterium
worse that you allow evolution to reach

6664
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:30,960
worse that you allow evolution to reach
 

6665
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:31,510
worse that you allow evolution to reach
a new

6666
01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:31,520
a new
 

6667
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:34,470
a new
optimum that's just a pause on that

6668
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:34,480
optimum that's just a pause on that
 

6669
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,790
optimum that's just a pause on that
that's so profound

6670
01:50:36,790 --> 01:50:36,800
that's so profound
 

6671
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,870
that's so profound
the the that's so profound for the

one way to see that in a sad
 

6847
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,229
one way to see that in a sad
so this one is beautiful the sad thing

6848

so this one is beautiful the sad thing
 

6849
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:50,629
so this one is beautiful the sad thing
is thinking about the trillions

01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:55,189
is thinking about the trillions
of organisms that died to create that

of organisms that died to create that
 

6853
01:53:55,199 --> 01:53:57,030
of organisms that died to create that
you mean on the evolutionary path and

6854
01:53:57,030 --> 01:53:57,040
you mean on the evolutionary path and
 

6855
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:59,430
you mean on the evolutionary path and
the evolutionary path to humans

6856
01:53:59,430 --> 01:53:59,440
the evolutionary path to humans
 

6857
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:02,310
the evolutionary path to humans
that's crazy there's two descendants of

just take the whole set of neurons and

01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,350
just take the whole set of neurons and
throw them away i mean throw them to the

throw them away i mean throw them to the

the ambiguity of language perhaps
 

6929
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,950
the ambiguity of language perhaps
might be the secret to creativity

01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:47,440
say
 

6957
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:49,510
say
let me repeat what you just said in a

01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:49,520
let me repeat what you just said in a
 

6959
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,430
let me repeat what you just said in a
different way and i sort of go on and

6960
01:55:51,430 --> 01:55:51,440
different way and i sort of go on and
 

6961
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:52,310
different way and i sort of go on and
brainstorm

6962
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:52,320
brainstorm

01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,550
brainstorm
with what they were saying but by the

with what they were saying but by the
 

6965
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:55,830
with what they were saying but by the
third time

6966

third time
 

6967
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,910
third time
it's not what they were saying at all

6968
01:55:57,910 --> 01:55:57,920
it's not what they were saying at all
 

6969
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,350
it's not what they were saying at all
and when they pick up what i'm saying

6970
01:55:59,350 --> 01:55:59,360
and when they pick up what i'm saying
 

6971
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,149
and when they pick up what i'm saying
you're like oh

6972
01:56:00,149 --> 01:56:00,159
you're like oh
 

6973
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:03,189
you're like oh
well now they they've sort of learned

6974
01:56:03,189 --> 01:56:03,199
well now they they've sort of learned
 

6975
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:04,550
well now they they've sort of learned
something very different from what i was

6976
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:04,560
something very different from what i was
 

6977
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:07,270
something very different from what i was
saying and that is the same kind of

6978
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:07,280
saying and that is the same kind of
 

6979
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,430
saying and that is the same kind of
messiness that i'm describing in the

01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:09,440
messiness that i'm describing in the

genome itself
 

6983
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,589
genome itself
it's sort of embracing the messiness and

6984
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:13,599
it's sort of embracing the messiness and
 

6985
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:15,270
it's sort of embracing the messiness and
that's a feature not a book

that's a feature not a book
 

6987
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,109
that's a feature not a book
exactly and in the same way when you're

6988
01:56:17,109 --> 01:56:17,119
exactly and in the same way when you're
 

6989
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:18,390
exactly and in the same way when you're

that will allow us to sort of be more
creative perhaps or

you have to embrace the breaking you
have to embrace the

01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,550
have to embrace the
you know how do we get out of these

7010
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:36,560
you know how do we get out of these
 

7011
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,030
you know how do we get out of these
local optima and a lot of the

7012
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:39,040
local optima and a lot of the
 

7013
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,750
local optima and a lot of the
design paradigms that have made deep

these lstm models and the
 

7027
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:57,270
these lstm models and the
you know sort of feed forward loops that

7028
01:56:57,270 --> 01:56:57,280
you know sort of feed forward loops that
 

7029
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,189
you know sort of feed forward loops that
you know sort of jump through layers of

7030
01:56:59,189 --> 01:56:59,199
you know sort of jump through layers of
 

7031
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:00,790
you know sort of jump through layers of
a convolutional neural network

7032
01:57:00,790 --> 01:57:00,800
a convolutional neural network
 

7033
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:04,070
a convolutional neural network
all of these things are basically ways

7034
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:04,080
all of these things are basically ways
 

7035
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,589
all of these things are basically ways
to push you out of this local

7036
01:57:05,589 --> 01:57:05,599
to push you out of this local
 

7037
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:08,390
to push you out of this local
maxima and that's sort of what evolution

7038
01:57:08,390 --> 01:57:08,400
maxima and that's sort of what evolution
 

7039
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,750

01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:09,760
does that's what language does that's

01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:09,990
does that's what language does that's
what

7042
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,000
what
 

7043
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,149
what
conversation and brainstorming does

7044
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:12,159
conversation and brainstorming does
 

7045
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:13,990
conversation and brainstorming does
that's what our brain does

7046
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:14,000
that's what our brain does
 

7047
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,310
that's what our brain does
so you know this design paradigm is

7048
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:16,320
so you know this design paradigm is
 

7049
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:18,149
so you know this design paradigm is
something that's pervasive

7050
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:18,159
something that's pervasive
 

7051

01:57:27,589 --> 01:57:27,599
you know whatever signal we're trying to
 

7061
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:28,390
you know whatever signal we're trying to
emit

7062
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:28,400
emit
 

7063
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:31,270

as opposed to let all hell breaks loose

7064
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:31,280
as opposed to let all hell breaks loose
 

7065
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:32,629
as opposed to let all hell breaks loose
because that's the way that's the path

7066
01:57:32,629 --> 01:57:32,639
because that's the way that's the path
 

7067
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:33,830
because that's the way that's the path
of paradise

7068
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:33,840
of paradise
 

7069
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,229
of paradise
the path to paradise yeah i mean it's

7070
01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:36,239
the path to paradise yeah i mean it's
 

7071
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:38,149
the path to paradise yeah i mean it's
difficult to know how to teach that and

7072
01:57:38,149 --> 01:57:38,159
difficult to know how to teach that and
 

7073
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:41,030
difficult to know how to teach that and
uh what to do with it i mean it's um

7074
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:41,040
uh what to do with it i mean it's um
 

7075
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,189
uh what to do with it i mean it's um
it's difficult to know how to build up a

01:57:43,189 --> 01:57:43,199
it's difficult to know how to build up a

around messiness you i mean

7080
01:57:48,629 --> 01:57:48,639
around messiness you i mean
 

7081
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:50,950
around messiness you i mean
it's not all messiness we need we need

7082
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:50,960
it's not all messiness we need we need
 

7083
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,709
it's not all messiness we need we need
some cleanness and going back to the

7084
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
some cleanness and going back to the
 

7085
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,070
some cleanness and going back to the
example with mars

example with mars
 

7087
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,350
example with mars
that's probably the place where i want

7088
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:55,360
that's probably the place where i want
 

7089
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,430
that's probably the place where i want
to sort of moderate

to sort of moderate
 

7091
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,030
to sort of moderate
error as much as possible and sort of

control the environment as much as
 

7095
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:01,589
control the environment as much as

01:58:01,589 --> 01:58:01,599
possible but if you're trying to
 

7097
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:02,950
possible but if you're trying to
repopulate mars

7098
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:02,960
repopulate mars
 

7099
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:04,830
repopulate mars
well maybe messiness is a good thing

7100
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:04,840
well maybe messiness is a good thing
 

7101
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:06,310
well maybe messiness is a good thing
then

7102
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:06,320
then
 

7103
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,629
then
on that uh you quick you quickly

7104
01:58:08,629 --> 01:58:08,639
on that uh you quick you quickly
 

7105
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:10,229
on that uh you quick you quickly
mentioned this in terms of

line of thinking do you think this is uh

7132
01:58:40,310 --> 01:58:40,320
line of thinking do you think this is uh
 

7133
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,950
line of thinking do you think this is uh
possible to bridge the gap between our

and the messy biological systems
 

7139
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:52,310
and the messy biological systems
my answer would be absolutely we

7140
01:58:52,310 --> 01:58:52,320
my answer would be absolutely we
 

7141
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:53,910
my answer would be absolutely we
you know there's no doubt that we can

7142
01:58:53,910 --> 01:58:53,920
you know there's no doubt that we can
 

7143
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,589
you know there's no doubt that we can
understand more and more about what goes

7144
01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:55,599
understand more and more about what goes
 

7145
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:57,109
understand more and more about what goes
on in the brain

7146
01:58:57,109 --> 01:58:57,119
on in the brain
 

7147
01:58:57,119 --> 01:59:00,229
on in the brain
and we can sort of train the brain

7148
01:59:00,229 --> 01:59:00,239
and we can sort of train the brain
 

7149
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:01,510
and we can sort of train the brain
i mean i don't know if you remember the

7150
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:01,520
i mean i don't know if you remember the
 

7151
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,589
i mean i don't know if you remember the
palm pilot

7152
01:59:03,589 --> 01:59:03,599
palm pilot
 

7153
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:05,589
palm pilot
yeah palm pilot yeah remember this whole

7154
01:59:05,589 --> 01:59:05,599
yeah palm pilot yeah remember this whole
 

7155
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:08,470
yeah palm pilot yeah remember this whole
sort of alphabet that they had created

7156
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:08,480
sort of alphabet that they had created
 

7157
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:11,030
sort of alphabet that they had created
am i thinking of the same thing um it's

7158
01:59:11,030 --> 01:59:11,040
am i thinking of the same thing um it's
 

7159
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:13,189
am i thinking of the same thing um it's
basically you had you had a little pen

7160
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:13,199
basically you had you had a little pen
 

7161
01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:16,070
basically you had you had a little pen
and for every character you had a little

7162
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:16,080
and for every character you had a little
 

7163
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:16,870
and for every character you had a little
scribble

7164
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:16,880
scribble
 

7165
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,709
scribble
that was unique that the machine could

7166
01:59:18,709 --> 01:59:18,719
that was unique that the machine could
 

7167
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:20,390
that was unique that the machine could
understand and that

7168
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:20,400
understand and that
 

7169
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,870
understand and that
instead of trying the machine trying to

7170
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:22,880
instead of trying the machine trying to
 

7171
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,390
instead of trying the machine trying to
teach the machine to recognize human

7172
01:59:24,390 --> 01:59:24,400
teach the machine to recognize human
 

7173
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:25,189
teach the machine to recognize human
characters

7174
01:59:25,189 --> 01:59:25,199
characters
 

7175
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:27,189
characters
you had basically they figured out that

7176
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:27,199
you had basically they figured out that
 

7177
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:28,310
you had basically they figured out that
it's better and easier

7178
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,320
it's better and easier
 

7179
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:31,350
it's better and easier
to train humans to create human-like

7180
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:31,360
to train humans to create human-like
 

7181
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:33,109
to train humans to create human-like
characters that the machine is better at

7182
01:59:33,109 --> 01:59:33,119
characters that the machine is better at
 

7183
01:59:33,119 --> 01:59:36,390
characters that the machine is better at
recognizing so

7184
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:36,400
recognizing so
 

7185
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,310
recognizing so
in the same way i think what will happen

7186
01:59:38,310 --> 01:59:38,320
in the same way i think what will happen
 

7187
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:40,790
in the same way i think what will happen
is that humans will be trained to be

7188
01:59:40,790 --> 01:59:40,800
is that humans will be trained to be
 

7189
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,830
is that humans will be trained to be
able to create

7190
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:41,840
able to create
 

7191
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,830
able to create
the mind pattern that the machine will

7192
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:43,840
the mind pattern that the machine will
 

7193
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,109
the mind pattern that the machine will
respond to

7194
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:45,119
respond to
 

7195
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:46,790
respond to
before the machine truly comprehends our

7196
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:46,800
before the machine truly comprehends our
 

7197
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:48,470
before the machine truly comprehends our
thoughts so the

7198
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:48,480
thoughts so the
 

7199
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:50,790
thoughts so the
first human brain interfaces will be

7200
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:50,800
first human brain interfaces will be
 

7201
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,629
first human brain interfaces will be
tricking humans to speak the machine

7202
01:59:52,629 --> 01:59:52,639
tricking humans to speak the machine
 

7203
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:53,510
tricking humans to speak the machine
language

7204
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:53,520
language
 

7205
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,669
language
where with the right set of electrodes i

7206
01:59:55,669 --> 01:59:55,679
where with the right set of electrodes i
 

7207
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:57,270
where with the right set of electrodes i
can sort of trick my brain into doing

7208
01:59:57,270 --> 01:59:57,280
can sort of trick my brain into doing
 

7209
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:57,750
can sort of trick my brain into doing
this

7210
01:59:57,750 --> 01:59:57,760
this
 

7211
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:59,109
this
and this is the same way that many

7212
01:59:59,109 --> 01:59:59,119
and this is the same way that many
 

7213
01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:01,430
and this is the same way that many
people teach like learn to control

7214
02:00:01,430 --> 02:00:01,440
people teach like learn to control
 

7215
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:02,870
people teach like learn to control
artificial limbs

7216
02:00:02,870 --> 02:00:02,880
artificial limbs
 

7217
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,550
artificial limbs
you basically try a bunch of stuff and

7218
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:04,560
you basically try a bunch of stuff and
 

7219
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:05,990
you basically try a bunch of stuff and
eventually you figure out how your limbs

7220
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:06,000
eventually you figure out how your limbs
 

7221
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:06,790
eventually you figure out how your limbs
work

7222
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:06,800
work
 

7223
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,310
work
that might not be very different from

7224
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:08,320
that might not be very different from
 

7225
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:10,629
that might not be very different from
how humans learn to use their

7226
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:10,639
how humans learn to use their
 

7227
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:12,950
how humans learn to use their
natural limbs when they first grow up

7228
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:12,960
natural limbs when they first grow up
 

7229
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,390
natural limbs when they first grow up
basically you have these

7230
02:00:14,390 --> 02:00:14,400
basically you have these
 

7231
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,669
basically you have these
you know neoteny period of

7232
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:17,679
you know neoteny period of
 

7233
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:20,550
you know neoteny period of
you know this puddle of soup inside your

7234
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:20,560
you know this puddle of soup inside your
 

7235
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,270
you know this puddle of soup inside your
brain

7236
02:00:21,270 --> 02:00:21,280
brain
 

7237
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:22,709
brain
trying to figure out how to even make

7238
02:00:22,709 --> 02:00:22,719
trying to figure out how to even make
 

7239
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:25,430
trying to figure out how to even make
your own connections before you're born

7240
02:00:25,430 --> 02:00:25,440
your own connections before you're born
 

7241
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:29,109
your own connections before you're born
and then learning sounds in utero of

7242
02:00:29,109 --> 02:00:29,119
and then learning sounds in utero of
 

7243
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:32,709
and then learning sounds in utero of
you know all kinds of echoes and

7244
02:00:32,709 --> 02:00:32,719
you know all kinds of echoes and
 

7245
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:35,270
you know all kinds of echoes and
you know eventually getting out in the

7246
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:35,280
you know eventually getting out in the
 

7247
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:35,990
you know eventually getting out in the
real world and

7248
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:36,000
real world and
 

7249
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:37,510
real world and
i don't know if you've seen newborns but

7250
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:37,520
i don't know if you've seen newborns but
 

7251
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:39,750
i don't know if you've seen newborns but
they just stare around a lot

7252
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:39,760
they just stare around a lot
 

7253
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:41,750
they just stare around a lot
you know one way to think about this as

7254
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:41,760
you know one way to think about this as
 

7255
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:43,270
you know one way to think about this as
a machine learning person is oh they're

7256
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:43,280
a machine learning person is oh they're
 

7257
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:45,990
a machine learning person is oh they're
just training their edge detectors

7258
02:00:45,990 --> 02:00:46,000
just training their edge detectors
 

7259
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,589
just training their edge detectors
and eventually they figure out how to

7260
02:00:47,589 --> 02:00:47,599
and eventually they figure out how to
 

7261
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:48,950
and eventually they figure out how to
train their edge detectors they work

7262
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:48,960
train their edge detectors they work
 

7263
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,229
train their edge detectors they work
through the second layer of the visual

7264
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:50,239
through the second layer of the visual
 

7265
02:00:50,239 --> 02:00:52,830
through the second layer of the visual
cortex and the third layer and so forth

7266
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:52,840
cortex and the third layer and so forth
 

7267
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:56,629
cortex and the third layer and so forth
and you basically have this

7268
02:00:56,629 --> 02:00:56,639
and you basically have this
 

7269
02:00:56,639 --> 02:00:59,270
and you basically have this
um learning how to control your limbs

7270
02:00:59,270 --> 02:00:59,280
um learning how to control your limbs
 

7271
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,950
um learning how to control your limbs
that probably comes at the same time

7272
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:00,960
that probably comes at the same time
 

7273
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,629
that probably comes at the same time
you're sort of you know throwing random

7274
02:01:02,629 --> 02:01:02,639
you're sort of you know throwing random
 

7275
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:04,629
you're sort of you know throwing random
things there and you realize that oh wow

7276
02:01:04,629 --> 02:01:04,639
things there and you realize that oh wow
 

7277
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:05,990
things there and you realize that oh wow
when i do this thing

7278
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:06,000
when i do this thing
 

7279
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,790
when i do this thing
my limb moves let's do the following

7280
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:08,800
my limb moves let's do the following
 

7281
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:11,750
my limb moves let's do the following
experiment take a breath

7282
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:11,760

 

7283
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,750

what muscles did you flex now take

7284
02:01:13,750 --> 02:01:13,760
what muscles did you flex now take
 

7285
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:15,430
what muscles did you flex now take
another breath and think what muscles do

7286
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:15,440
another breath and think what muscles do
 

7287
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,629
another breath and think what muscles do
i flex

7288
02:01:16,629 --> 02:01:16,639
i flex
 

7289
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:17,830
i flex
the first thing that you're thinking

7290
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:17,840
the first thing that you're thinking
 

7291
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,830
the first thing that you're thinking
when you're taking a breath

7292
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:19,840
when you're taking a breath
 

7293
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,310
when you're taking a breath
is the impact that he has on your lungs

7294
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:22,320
is the impact that he has on your lungs
 

7295
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,589
is the impact that he has on your lungs
you're like oh i'm now going to increase

7296
02:01:23,589 --> 02:01:23,599
you're like oh i'm now going to increase
 

7297
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:24,950
you're like oh i'm now going to increase
my lungs or i'm not going to bring air

7298
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:24,960
my lungs or i'm not going to bring air
 

7299
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,270
my lungs or i'm not going to bring air
in

7300
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:25,280
in
 

7301
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:26,629
in
but what you're actually doing is just

7302
02:01:26,629 --> 02:01:26,639
but what you're actually doing is just
 

7303
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:29,109
but what you're actually doing is just
changing your diaphragm yeah

7304
02:01:29,109 --> 02:01:29,119
changing your diaphragm yeah
 

7305
02:01:29,119 --> 02:01:32,229
changing your diaphragm yeah
that's not conscious of course you never

7306
02:01:32,229 --> 02:01:32,239
that's not conscious of course you never
 

7307
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:34,070
that's not conscious of course you never
think of the diaphragm as a thing

7308
02:01:34,070 --> 02:01:34,080
think of the diaphragm as a thing
 

7309
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,709
think of the diaphragm as a thing
yeah and why is that that's probably the

7310
02:01:36,709 --> 02:01:36,719
yeah and why is that that's probably the
 

7311
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:38,470
yeah and why is that that's probably the
same reason why i think of moving my

7312
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:38,480
same reason why i think of moving my
 

7313
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,390
same reason why i think of moving my
finger when i actually move my finger

7314
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:40,400
finger when i actually move my finger
 

7315
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,910
finger when i actually move my finger
i think of the effect instead of

7316
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:41,920
i think of the effect instead of
 

7317
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,350
i think of the effect instead of
actually thinking of whatever muscle is

7318
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:43,360
actually thinking of whatever muscle is
 

7319
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,149
actually thinking of whatever muscle is
twitching

7320
02:01:44,149 --> 02:01:44,159
twitching
 

7321
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:46,390
twitching
that actually causes my finger to move

7322
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:46,400
that actually causes my finger to move
 

7323
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:48,310
that actually causes my finger to move
so we basically in our first years of

7324
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:48,320
so we basically in our first years of
 

7325
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:49,270
so we basically in our first years of
life

7326
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:49,280
life
 

7327
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,310
life
build up this massive lookup table

7328
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:52,320
build up this massive lookup table
 

7329
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:55,270
build up this massive lookup table
between whatever neuronal firing we do

7330
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:55,280
between whatever neuronal firing we do
 

7331
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,510
between whatever neuronal firing we do
and whatever action happens

7332
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:57,520
and whatever action happens
 

7333
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:00,790
and whatever action happens
in our body that we control

7334
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:00,800
in our body that we control
 

7335
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,830
in our body that we control
if you have a kid grow up with a third

7336
02:02:02,830 --> 02:02:02,840
if you have a kid grow up with a third
 

7337
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:04,229
if you have a kid grow up with a third
limb

7338
02:02:04,229 --> 02:02:04,239
limb
 

7339
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:05,430
limb
i'm sure they'll figure out how to

7340
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:05,440
i'm sure they'll figure out how to
 

7341
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,510
i'm sure they'll figure out how to
control them probably at the same rate

7342
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:07,520
control them probably at the same rate
 

7343
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:09,350
control them probably at the same rate
as their natural limbs

7344
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:09,360
as their natural limbs
 

7345
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:12,070
as their natural limbs
and uh a lot of the work would be done

7346
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:12,080
and uh a lot of the work would be done
 

7347
02:02:12,080 --> 02:02:12,870
and uh a lot of the work would be done
by the

7348
02:02:12,870 --> 02:02:12,880
by the
 

7349
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:15,589
by the
so if the third limb is the computer you

7350
02:02:15,589 --> 02:02:15,599
so if the third limb is the computer you
 

7351
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:17,350
so if the third limb is the computer you
kind of have a

7352
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:17,360
kind of have a
 

7353
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:20,790
kind of have a
uh not a faith but a thought that

7354
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:20,800
uh not a faith but a thought that
 

7355
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:23,830
uh not a faith but a thought that
um the brain might be able to figure out

7356
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:23,840
um the brain might be able to figure out
 

7357
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:25,589
um the brain might be able to figure out
like if the plasticity would come from

7358
02:02:25,589 --> 02:02:25,599
like if the plasticity would come from
 

7359
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:27,430
like if the plasticity would come from
the brain yeah like the brain would be

7360
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:27,440
the brain yeah like the brain would be
 

7361
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:29,030
the brain yeah like the brain would be
cleverer than the machine at first when

7362
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:29,040
cleverer than the machine at first when
 

7363
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:30,310
cleverer than the machine at first when
i talk about a third limb that's exactly

7364
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:30,320
i talk about a third limb that's exactly
 

7365
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:30,790
i talk about a third limb that's exactly
what i'm saying

7366
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:30,800
what i'm saying
 

7367
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,790
what i'm saying
an artificial limb that basically just

7368
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:32,800
an artificial limb that basically just
 

7369
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,790
an artificial limb that basically just
controls your mouse while you're typing

7370
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:34,800
controls your mouse while you're typing
 

7371
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,790
controls your mouse while you're typing
you know perfectly natural thing i mean

7372
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:36,800
you know perfectly natural thing i mean
 

7373
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:40,229
you know perfectly natural thing i mean
again you know in a few hundred years

7374
02:02:40,229 --> 02:02:40,239
again you know in a few hundred years
 

7375
02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:42,950
again you know in a few hundred years
maybe sooner than that but but basically

7376
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:42,960
maybe sooner than that but but basically
 

7377
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:43,910
maybe sooner than that but but basically
there's

7378
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:43,920
there's
 

7379
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:46,149
there's
as long as the machine is consistent in

7380
02:02:46,149 --> 02:02:46,159
as long as the machine is consistent in
 

7381
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:47,669
as long as the machine is consistent in
the way that it will respond

7382
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:47,679
the way that it will respond
 

7383
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:50,149
the way that it will respond
to your brain impulses you'll figure out

7384
02:02:50,149 --> 02:02:50,159
to your brain impulses you'll figure out
 

7385
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:51,589
to your brain impulses you'll figure out
how to control that

7386
02:02:51,589 --> 02:02:51,599
how to control that
 

7387
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:52,709
how to control that
and you could play tennis with your

7388
02:02:52,709 --> 02:02:52,719
and you could play tennis with your
 

7389
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:55,030
and you could play tennis with your
third limb and

7390
02:02:55,030 --> 02:02:55,040
third limb and
 

7391
02:02:55,040 --> 02:02:58,070
third limb and
let me go back to consistency people who

7392
02:02:58,070 --> 02:02:58,080
let me go back to consistency people who
 

7393
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:59,430
let me go back to consistency people who
have

7394
02:02:59,430 --> 02:02:59,440
have
 

7395
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:01,990
have
dramatic accidents that basically take

7396
02:03:01,990 --> 02:03:02,000
dramatic accidents that basically take
 

7397
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,830
dramatic accidents that basically take
out a whole chunk of their brain

7398
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:03,840
out a whole chunk of their brain
 

7399
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:06,470
out a whole chunk of their brain
can be taught to co-opt other parts of

7400
02:03:06,470 --> 02:03:06,480
can be taught to co-opt other parts of
 

7401
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:08,390
can be taught to co-opt other parts of
the brain to then control that part

7402
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:08,400
the brain to then control that part
 

7403
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:09,990
the brain to then control that part
you can basically build up that tissue

7404
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,000
you can basically build up that tissue
 

7405
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,550
you can basically build up that tissue
again and eventually train your body

7406
02:03:12,550 --> 02:03:12,560
again and eventually train your body
 

7407
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:14,310
again and eventually train your body
how to walk again and how to read again

7408
02:03:14,310 --> 02:03:14,320
how to walk again and how to read again
 

7409
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,750
how to walk again and how to read again
and how to play again and how to think

7410
02:03:15,750 --> 02:03:15,760
and how to play again and how to think
 

7411
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:18,070
and how to play again and how to think
again how to speak a language again etc

7412
02:03:18,070 --> 02:03:18,080
again how to speak a language again etc
 

7413
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:19,669
again how to speak a language again etc
so there's a massive amount of

7414
02:03:19,669 --> 02:03:19,679
so there's a massive amount of
 

7415
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:21,189
so there's a massive amount of
malleability

7416
02:03:21,189 --> 02:03:21,199
malleability
 

7417
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:24,390
malleability
that happens you know naturally in

7418
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:24,400
that happens you know naturally in
 

7419
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,629
that happens you know naturally in
our way of controlling our body our

7420
02:03:26,629 --> 02:03:26,639
our way of controlling our body our
 

7421
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:27,750
our way of controlling our body our
brain or

7422
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:27,760
brain or
 

7423
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:32,550
brain or
thoughts or vocal cords or limbs etc and

7424
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:32,560
thoughts or vocal cords or limbs etc and
 

7425
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:35,589
thoughts or vocal cords or limbs etc and
human machine interfaces are inevitable

7426
02:03:35,589 --> 02:03:35,599
human machine interfaces are inevitable
 

7427
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:36,950
human machine interfaces are inevitable
if we sort of figure out how to read

7428
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:36,960
if we sort of figure out how to read
 

7429
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:39,270
if we sort of figure out how to read
these electric impulses

7430
02:03:39,270 --> 02:03:39,280
these electric impulses
 

7431
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:41,270
these electric impulses
but the resolution at which we can

7432
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:41,280
but the resolution at which we can
 

7433
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,350
but the resolution at which we can
understand human thought

7434
02:03:43,350 --> 02:03:43,360
understand human thought
 

7435
02:03:43,360 --> 02:03:46,550
understand human thought
right now is nil is ridiculous

7436
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:46,560
right now is nil is ridiculous
 

7437
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,189
right now is nil is ridiculous
so how are human thoughts encoded it's

7438
02:03:49,189 --> 02:03:49,199
so how are human thoughts encoded it's
 

7439
02:03:49,199 --> 02:03:50,709
so how are human thoughts encoded it's
basically combinations

7440
02:03:50,709 --> 02:03:50,719
basically combinations
 

7441
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:54,229
basically combinations
of neurons that co-fire and these create

7442
02:03:54,229 --> 02:03:54,239
of neurons that co-fire and these create
 

7443
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:55,030
of neurons that co-fire and these create
these things called

7444
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:55,040
these things called
 

7445
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:57,189
these things called
engrams that eventually form memories

7446
02:03:57,189 --> 02:03:57,199
engrams that eventually form memories
 

7447
02:03:57,199 --> 02:03:58,870
engrams that eventually form memories
and so so forth

7448
02:03:58,870 --> 02:03:58,880
and so so forth
 

7449
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:01,910
and so so forth
we know nothing of all that stuff

7450
02:04:01,910 --> 02:04:01,920
we know nothing of all that stuff
 

7451
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,189
we know nothing of all that stuff
so before we can actually read into your

7452
02:04:05,189 --> 02:04:05,199
so before we can actually read into your
 

7453
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:06,550
so before we can actually read into your
brain that you want to build a program

7454
02:04:06,550 --> 02:04:06,560
brain that you want to build a program
 

7455
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:08,790
brain that you want to build a program
that does this anytime it's on that

7456
02:04:08,790 --> 02:04:08,800
that does this anytime it's on that
 

7457
02:04:08,800 --> 02:04:11,990
that does this anytime it's on that
we need a lot of neuroscience well so

7458
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:12,000
we need a lot of neuroscience well so
 

7459
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,750
we need a lot of neuroscience well so
uh to push back on that do you think

7460
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:13,760
uh to push back on that do you think
 

7461
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,109
uh to push back on that do you think
it's possible that

7462
02:04:15,109 --> 02:04:15,119
it's possible that
 

7463
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:17,990
it's possible that
without understanding the functionally

02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,189
without understanding the functionally
about the brain or the from the

psychology whichever level of the brain
 

7471
02:04:23,199 --> 02:04:24,790
psychology whichever level of the brain
will look at do you think if we just

7472
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:24,800
will look at do you think if we just
 

7473
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:25,910
will look at do you think if we just
connect

7474
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:25,920
connect
 

7475
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:28,390
connect
connect them just like per your previous

7476
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:28,400
connect them just like per your previous
 

7477
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,030
connect them just like per your previous
point

7478
02:04:29,030 --> 02:04:29,040
point
 

7479
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:30,709
point
if we just have a high enough resolution

7480
02:04:30,709 --> 02:04:30,719
if we just have a high enough resolution
 

7481
02:04:30,719 --> 02:04:32,069
if we just have a high enough resolution
between connection between

02:04:34,629 --> 02:04:34,639
uh wikipedia and your brain the brain
 

7485
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:35,990
uh wikipedia and your brain the brain
will just figure it out

7486
02:04:35,990 --> 02:04:36,000
will just figure it out
 

7487
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,470
will just figure it out
with us understanding um because that's

7488
02:04:38,470 --> 02:04:38,480
with us understanding um because that's
 

7489
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:39,030
with us understanding um because that's
one of the

7490
02:04:39,030 --> 02:04:39,040
one of the
 

7491
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,790
one of the
innovations of neural link is they're

02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:40,800
innovations of neural link is they're
 

7493
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,870
innovations of neural link is they're
increasing the number of

7494
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:42,880
increasing the number of
 

7495
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,709
increasing the number of
connections to the brain to like several

thousand which before was
 

7499
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:48,229
thousand which before was
you know in the dozens or whatever

7500
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:48,239
you know in the dozens or whatever
 

7501
02:04:48,239 --> 02:04:50,830
you know in the dozens or whatever
you're still off by a few orders of

7502
02:04:50,830 --> 02:04:50,840
you're still off by a few orders of
 

7503

7505
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:56,709

right but the the thing is the hope is

7506
02:04:56,709 --> 02:04:56,719
right but the the thing is the hope is
 

7507
02:04:56,719 --> 02:04:58,149
right but the the thing is the hope is
if you increase that number more and

7508
02:04:58,149 --> 02:04:58,159
if you increase that number more and
 

7509
02:04:58,159 --> 02:04:58,709
if you increase that number more and
more and more

7510
02:04:58,709 --> 02:04:58,719
more and more
 

7511
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:00,149
more and more
maybe you don't need to understand

7512
02:05:00,149 --> 02:05:00,159
maybe you don't need to understand
 

7513
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,550
maybe you don't need to understand
anything about the actual

7514
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:02,560
anything about the actual
 

7515
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:04,550
anything about the actual

how human thought is represented in the
 

7517
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:05,589
how human thought is represented in the
brain you could just

7518
02:05:05,589 --> 02:05:05,599
brain you could just
 

7519
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:07,910
brain you could just
let it let it figure it out by itself

7520
02:05:07,910 --> 02:05:07,920
let it let it figure it out by itself
 

7521

let it let it figure it out by itself
well uh cannery is waking up and saying

7522
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:09,679
well uh cannery is waking up and saying
 

7523
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:10,629
well uh cannery is waking up and saying
i know

7524
02:05:10,629 --> 02:05:10,639
i know
 

7525
02:05:10,639 --> 02:05:13,669
i know
yeah exactly exactly so

7526
02:05:13,669 --> 02:05:13,679
yeah exactly exactly so
 

7527
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:15,589
yeah exactly exactly so
yeah sure you don't have faith in the

7528
02:05:15,589 --> 02:05:15,599
yeah sure you don't have faith in the
 

7529
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:18,229
yeah sure you don't have faith in the
plasticity of the brain to that degree

7530
02:05:18,229 --> 02:05:18,239
plasticity of the brain to that degree
 

7531
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:19,910
plasticity of the brain to that degree
it's not about brain plasticity it's

7532
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:19,920
it's not about brain plasticity it's
 

7533
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:21,830
it's not about brain plasticity it's
about the input aspect

7534
02:05:21,830 --> 02:05:21,840
about the input aspect
 

7535
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,669
about the input aspect
basically i think on the output aspect

7536
02:05:23,669 --> 02:05:23,679
basically i think on the output aspect
 

7537
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:24,950
basically i think on the output aspect
being able to control a machine

7538
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:24,960
being able to control a machine
 

7539
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,390
being able to control a machine
is something that you can probably train

7540
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:26,400
is something that you can probably train
 

7541
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:28,310
is something that you can probably train
your neural impulses

7542
02:05:28,310 --> 02:05:28,320
your neural impulses
 

7543
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:30,870
your neural impulses
that you're sending out to sort of match

7544
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:30,880
that you're sending out to sort of match
 

7545
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:31,510
that you're sending out to sort of match
whatever

7546
02:05:31,510 --> 02:05:31,520
whatever
 

7547
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,350
whatever
response you see in the environment if

7548
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:33,360
response you see in the environment if
 

7549
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:35,189
response you see in the environment if
this thing moved every single time i

7550
02:05:35,189 --> 02:05:35,199
this thing moved every single time i
 

7551
02:05:35,199 --> 02:05:36,390
this thing moved every single time i
thought a particular thought

7552
02:05:36,390 --> 02:05:36,400
thought a particular thought
 

7553
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:37,990
thought a particular thought
then i could figure out i could hack my

7554
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:38,000
then i could figure out i could hack my
 

7555
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,149
then i could figure out i could hack my
way into moving this thing with just a

7556
02:05:40,149 --> 02:05:40,159
way into moving this thing with just a
 

7557
02:05:40,159 --> 02:05:41,830
way into moving this thing with just a
series of thoughts i could think

7558
02:05:41,830 --> 02:05:41,840
series of thoughts i could think
 

7559
02:05:41,840 --> 02:05:45,750
series of thoughts i could think
guitar piano tennis ball

7560
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:45,760
guitar piano tennis ball
 

7561
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:47,589
guitar piano tennis ball
and then this thing would be moving and

7562
02:05:47,589 --> 02:05:47,599
and then this thing would be moving and
 

7563
02:05:47,599 --> 02:05:49,270
and then this thing would be moving and
then you know i would just have the

7564
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:49,280
then you know i would just have the
 

7565
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:50,069
then you know i would just have the
series of

7566
02:05:50,069 --> 02:05:50,079
series of
 

7567
02:05:50,079 --> 02:05:51,910
series of
thoughts that would sort of result in

7568
02:05:51,910 --> 02:05:51,920
thoughts that would sort of result in
 

7569
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:53,189
thoughts that would sort of result in
the impulses that will move this thing

7570
02:05:53,189 --> 02:05:53,199
the impulses that will move this thing
 

7571
02:05:53,199 --> 02:05:54,149
the impulses that will move this thing
the way that i want it and then

7572
02:05:54,149 --> 02:05:54,159
the way that i want it and then
 

7573
02:05:54,159 --> 02:05:55,589
the way that i want it and then
eventually it'll become natural because

7574
02:05:55,589 --> 02:05:55,599
eventually it'll become natural because
 

7575
02:05:55,599 --> 02:05:56,950
eventually it'll become natural because
i won't even think about it

7576
02:05:56,950 --> 02:05:56,960
i won't even think about it
 

7577
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:58,629
i won't even think about it
um i mean the same way that we control

7578
02:05:58,629 --> 02:05:58,639
um i mean the same way that we control
 

7579
02:05:58,639 --> 02:06:00,069
um i mean the same way that we control
our limbs in a very natural way

7580
02:06:00,069 --> 02:06:00,079
our limbs in a very natural way
 

7581
02:06:00,079 --> 02:06:02,069
our limbs in a very natural way
but babies don't do that babies have to

figure it out
 

7585
02:06:03,119 --> 02:06:04,709
figure it out
and you know some of it is hard-coded

7586
02:06:04,709 --> 02:06:04,719
and you know some of it is hard-coded
 

7587
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:06,709
and you know some of it is hard-coded
but some of that is actually learned

02:06:06,709 --> 02:06:06,719
but some of that is actually learned
 

7589
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:09,350
but some of that is actually learned
based on the whatever soup of neurons

02:06:09,350 --> 02:06:09,360
based on the whatever soup of neurons
 

7591
02:06:09,360 --> 02:06:11,430
based on the whatever soup of neurons
you ended up with whatever connections

02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:11,440
you ended up with whatever connections
 

7593
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:13,990
you ended up with whatever connections
you pruned them to and eventually you

7594
02:06:13,990 --> 02:06:14,000
you pruned them to and eventually you

02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,030
you pruned them to and eventually you

yeah

7814
02:10:10,229 --> 02:10:10,239
and rebuilding it back up i have three
 

7815
02:10:10,239 --> 02:10:11,189
and rebuilding it back up i have three
kids

7816
02:10:11,189 --> 02:10:11,199
kids
 

7817
02:10:11,199 --> 02:10:14,470
kids
and the way that i teach them greek is

7818
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:14,480
and the way that i teach them greek is
 

7819
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:16,149
and the way that i teach them greek is
the same way that you know the

7820
02:10:16,149 --> 02:10:16,159
the same way that you know the
 

7821
02:10:16,159 --> 02:10:17,510
the same way that you know the
documentary i was mentioning earlier

7822
02:10:17,510 --> 02:10:17,520
documentary i was mentioning earlier
 

7823
02:10:17,520 --> 02:10:19,189
documentary i was mentioning earlier
about sort of understanding the deep

7824
02:10:19,189 --> 02:10:19,199
about sort of understanding the deep
 

7825
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:19,669
about sort of understanding the deep
roots

7826
02:10:19,669 --> 02:10:19,679
roots
 

7827
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:23,830
roots
of all of these you know words um

7828
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:23,840
of all of these you know words um
 

7829
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:27,109
of all of these you know words um
and it's very

7830
02:10:27,109 --> 02:10:27,119
and it's very
 

7831
02:10:27,119 --> 02:10:30,069
and it's very
it's very interesting that every single

7832
02:10:30,069 --> 02:10:30,079
it's very interesting that every single
 

7833
02:10:30,079 --> 02:10:31,830
it's very interesting that every single
time i hear a new word that i've never

7834
02:10:31,830 --> 02:10:31,840
time i hear a new word that i've never
 

7835
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:32,870
time i hear a new word that i've never
heard before

7836
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:32,880
heard before
 

7837
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:34,310
heard before
i go and figure out the etymology of

7838
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:34,320
i go and figure out the etymology of
 

7839
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:35,270
i go and figure out the etymology of
that word because i will never

7840
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:35,280
that word because i will never
 

7841
02:10:35,280 --> 02:10:36,629
that word because i will never
appreciate that word

7842
02:10:36,629 --> 02:10:36,639
appreciate that word
 

7843
02:10:36,639 --> 02:10:37,990
appreciate that word
without understanding how it was

7844
02:10:37,990 --> 02:10:38,000
without understanding how it was
 

7845
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,069
without understanding how it was
initially formed

7846
02:10:40,069 --> 02:10:40,079
initially formed
 

7847
02:10:40,079 --> 02:10:41,990
initially formed
interesting but how does that help

7848
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:42,000
interesting but how does that help
 

7849
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,350
interesting but how does that help
because that's that's not the full

7850
02:10:43,350 --> 02:10:43,360
because that's that's not the full
 

7851
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:43,990
because that's that's not the full
picture

7852
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,000
picture
 

7853
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,189
picture
no no of course of course but what i'm

7854
02:10:45,189 --> 02:10:45,199
no no of course of course but what i'm
 

7855
02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:47,030
no no of course of course but what i'm
trying to say is that knowing the

7856
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:47,040
trying to say is that knowing the
 

7857
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:48,310
trying to say is that knowing the
components

7858
02:10:48,310 --> 02:10:48,320
components
 

7859
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:50,950
components
teaches you about the context of the

7860
02:10:50,950 --> 02:10:50,960
teaches you about the context of the
 

7861
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:52,149
teaches you about the context of the
formation of that word

7862
02:10:52,149 --> 02:10:52,159
formation of that word
 

7863
02:10:52,159 --> 02:10:53,990
formation of that word
and sort of the original usage of that

7864
02:10:53,990 --> 02:10:54,000
and sort of the original usage of that
 

7865
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,390
and sort of the original usage of that
word and then of course the word takes

7866
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:56,400
word and then of course the word takes
 

7867
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:57,270
word and then of course the word takes
new meaning

7868
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:57,280
new meaning
 

7869
02:10:57,280 --> 02:11:00,790
new meaning
as you create it you know from its parts

7870
02:11:00,790 --> 02:11:00,800
as you create it you know from its parts
 

7871
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:03,990
as you create it you know from its parts
and that meaning then gets augmented

7872
02:11:03,990 --> 02:11:04,000
and that meaning then gets augmented
 

7873
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,870
and that meaning then gets augmented
and two synonyms that that sort of have

7874
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:06,880
and two synonyms that that sort of have
 

7875
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,990
and two synonyms that that sort of have
different roots

7876
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:08,000
different roots
 

7877
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,350
different roots
will actually have implications that

7878
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:09,360
will actually have implications that
 

7879
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:11,350
will actually have implications that
carry a lot of that baggage

7880
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:11,360
carry a lot of that baggage
 

7881
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,350
carry a lot of that baggage
of the historical provenance of these

7882
02:11:13,350 --> 02:11:13,360
of the historical provenance of these
 

7883
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,589
of the historical provenance of these
words so before working on genome

7884
02:11:15,589 --> 02:11:15,599
words so before working on genome
 

7885
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:16,629
words so before working on genome
evolution

7886
02:11:16,629 --> 02:11:16,639
evolution
 

7887
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:19,830
evolution
my passion was evolution of language

7888
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:19,840
my passion was evolution of language
 

7889
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:22,629
my passion was evolution of language
and sort of tracing cognates across

7890
02:11:22,629 --> 02:11:22,639
and sort of tracing cognates across
 

7891
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:24,629
and sort of tracing cognates across
different languages

7892
02:11:24,629 --> 02:11:24,639
different languages
 

7893
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:27,830
different languages
through their etymologies and that's

7894
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:27,840
through their etymologies and that's
 

7895
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:29,910
through their etymologies and that's
fascinating that there's parallels

7896
02:11:29,910 --> 02:11:29,920
fascinating that there's parallels
 

7897
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,550
fascinating that there's parallels
between i mean

7898
02:11:30,550 --> 02:11:30,560
between i mean
 

7899
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:32,950
between i mean
of course the idea that there's

7900
02:11:32,950 --> 02:11:32,960
of course the idea that there's
 

7901
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:36,830
of course the idea that there's
evolutionary dynamics to our language

7902
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:36,840
evolutionary dynamics to our language
 

7903
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:39,669
evolutionary dynamics to our language
yeah every single word that you

7904
02:11:39,669 --> 02:11:39,679
yeah every single word that you
 

7905
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:42,790
yeah every single word that you
utter parallels parallels what does

7906
02:11:42,790 --> 02:11:42,800
utter parallels parallels what does
 

7907
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:43,830
utter parallels parallels what does
parallels mean

7908
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:43,840
parallels mean
 

7909
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:46,629
parallels mean
para means side by side alleles from

7910
02:11:46,629 --> 02:11:46,639
para means side by side alleles from
 

7911
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:47,430
para means side by side alleles from
alleles

7912
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:47,440
alleles
 

7913
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:50,709
alleles
which means identical twins parallels

7914
02:11:50,709 --> 02:11:50,719
which means identical twins parallels
 

7915
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:53,750
which means identical twins parallels
i mean name any word and there's so much

7916
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:53,760
i mean name any word and there's so much
 

7917
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:54,310
i mean name any word and there's so much
baggage

7918
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:54,320
baggage
 

7919
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:57,669
baggage
so much beauty in how that word came to

7920
02:11:57,669 --> 02:11:57,679
so much beauty in how that word came to
 

7921
02:11:57,679 --> 02:11:59,990
so much beauty in how that word came to
be and how this word took a new meaning

7922
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:00,000
be and how this word took a new meaning
 

7923
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,430
be and how this word took a new meaning
than the sum of its parts

7924
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:03,440

 

7925
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,270

yeah and that and those and they're just

7926
02:12:05,270 --> 02:12:05,280
yeah and that and those and they're just
 

7927
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:06,870
yeah and that and those and they're just
they're just words they don't have any

7928
02:12:06,870 --> 02:12:06,880
they're just words they don't have any
 

7929
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:07,750
they're just words they don't have any
physical

7930
02:12:07,750 --> 02:12:07,760
physical
 

7931
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:10,310
physical
exactly and now you take your words and

7932
02:12:10,310 --> 02:12:10,320
exactly and now you take your words and
 

7933
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:11,350
exactly and now you take your words and
you weave them

7934
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:11,360
you weave them
 

7935
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:14,750
you weave them
into a sentence the emotional

7936
02:12:14,750 --> 02:12:14,760
into a sentence the emotional
 

7937
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:18,069
into a sentence the emotional
invocations of that weaving are

7938
02:12:18,069 --> 02:12:18,079
invocations of that weaving are
 

7939
02:12:18,079 --> 02:12:20,390
invocations of that weaving are
fathomless and they're all all of those

7940
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:20,400
fathomless and they're all all of those
 

7941
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:22,310
fathomless and they're all all of those
emotions

7942
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:22,320
emotions
 

7943
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:25,430
emotions
all live in our in the brains of humans

7944
02:12:25,430 --> 02:12:25,440
all live in our in the brains of humans
 

7945

no seriously you have to embrace this

7948
02:12:30,390 --> 02:12:30,400
no seriously you have to embrace this
 

7949
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:32,390
no seriously you have to embrace this

concept of the eye of the beholder
 

7951
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:35,669
concept of the eye of the beholder
it's it's the the conceptualization that

it's it's the the conceptualization that
 

7953

it's it's the the conceptualization that
nothing takes meaning with one person

nothing takes meaning with one person

every single you know if you look at the

02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,189
every single you know if you look at the

and the meaning of the words that i'm
telling you

8008

telling you
 

8009
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:33,109
telling you
is empty until it reaches you and it

8010
02:13:33,109 --> 02:13:33,119
is empty until it reaches you and it
 

8011
02:13:33,119 --> 02:13:34,950
is empty until it reaches you and it
affects you in a very different way

affects you in a very different way
 

8013
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,470
affects you in a very different way
then it affects whoever's listening to

8014
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:36,480
then it affects whoever's listening to
 

8015
02:13:36,480 --> 02:13:38,390
then it affects whoever's listening to
this conversation now

8016
02:13:38,390 --> 02:13:38,400
this conversation now
 

8017
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:40,310
this conversation now
because of the emotional baggage that

8018
02:13:40,310 --> 02:13:40,320
because of the emotional baggage that
 

8019
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:42,069
because of the emotional baggage that
i've grown up with that you've grown up

8020
02:13:42,069 --> 02:13:42,079
i've grown up with that you've grown up
 

8021
02:13:42,079 --> 02:13:44,229
i've grown up with that you've grown up
with and that they've grown up with yeah

8022
02:13:44,229 --> 02:13:44,239
with and that they've grown up with yeah
 

8023
02:13:44,239 --> 02:13:46,470
with and that they've grown up with yeah
and that's i think the magic of

8024
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:46,480
and that's i think the magic of
 

8025
02:13:46,480 --> 02:13:47,750
and that's i think the magic of
translation

8026
02:13:47,750 --> 02:13:47,760
translation
 

8027
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:51,109
translation
if you start thinking of translation as

8028
02:13:51,109 --> 02:13:51,119
if you start thinking of translation as
 

8029
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:54,229
if you start thinking of translation as
just simply capturing that emotional

8030
02:13:54,229 --> 02:13:54,239
just simply capturing that emotional
 

8031
02:13:54,239 --> 02:13:57,589
just simply capturing that emotional
set of reactions that you have that you

8032
02:13:57,589 --> 02:13:57,599
set of reactions that you have that you
 

8033
02:13:57,599 --> 02:13:59,189
set of reactions that you have that you
evoke

8034
02:13:59,189 --> 02:13:59,199
evoke
 

8035
02:13:59,199 --> 02:14:01,030
evoke
you need a different set of words to

8036
02:14:01,030 --> 02:14:01,040
you need a different set of words to
 

8037
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:02,870
you need a different set of words to
evoke that same set of reactions to a

8038
02:14:02,870 --> 02:14:02,880
evoke that same set of reactions to a
 

8039
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:04,149
evoke that same set of reactions to a
french person

8040
02:14:04,149 --> 02:14:04,159
french person
 

8041
02:14:04,159 --> 02:14:06,229
french person
than to a russian person because of the

8042
02:14:06,229 --> 02:14:06,239
than to a russian person because of the
 

8043
02:14:06,239 --> 02:14:07,910
than to a russian person because of the
baggage of the culture that we grew up

8044
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:07,920
baggage of the culture that we grew up
 

8045
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:08,229
baggage of the culture that we grew up
in

in
 

8047
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:11,270
in
yeah i mean there's so so basically you

8048
02:14:11,270 --> 02:14:11,280
yeah i mean there's so so basically you
 

8049
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:11,990
yeah i mean there's so so basically you
shouldn't find

8050
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:12,000
shouldn't find
 

8051
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,069
shouldn't find
the best word sometimes it's a

the best word sometimes it's a
 

8053
02:14:14,079 --> 02:14:15,910
the best word sometimes it's a
completely different sentence structure

8054
02:14:15,910 --> 02:14:15,920
completely different sentence structure
 

8055
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:18,149
completely different sentence structure
that you will need

8056
02:14:18,149 --> 02:14:18,159
that you will need
 

8057
02:14:18,159 --> 02:14:21,830
that you will need
matched to the cultural context

8058
02:14:21,830 --> 02:14:21,840
matched to the cultural context
 

8059
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,350

of the target audience that you have

8060
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:23,360
of the target audience that you have
 

8061
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:25,189
of the target audience that you have
yeah the it's i mean

8062
02:14:25,189 --> 02:14:25,199
yeah the it's i mean
 

8063
02:14:25,199 --> 02:14:27,109
yeah the it's i mean
you're just i usually don't think about

8064
02:14:27,109 --> 02:14:27,119
you're just i usually don't think about
 

8065
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:28,229
you're just i usually don't think about
this but right now

this but right now
 

8067
02:14:28,239 --> 02:14:30,470
this but right now
there's this feeling as a reminder that

8068
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,480
there's this feeling as a reminder that
 

8069
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,229
there's this feeling as a reminder that
it's just you and i talking

but there's several hundred thousand
 

8073
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:35,990
but there's several hundred thousand
people will listen to this

8074
02:14:35,990 --> 02:14:36,000
people will listen to this
 

8075
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,830
people will listen to this
there's some guy in russia right now

8076
02:14:38,830 --> 02:14:38,840
there's some guy in russia right now

uh like in moscow listening to us

8080
02:14:43,669 --> 02:14:43,679
uh like in moscow listening to us
 

8081
02:14:43,679 --> 02:14:45,669
uh like in moscow listening to us
and there's somebody in india i

8082
02:14:45,669 --> 02:14:45,679
and there's somebody in india i
 

8083
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:47,270
and there's somebody in india i
guarantee you there's somebody in china

8084
02:14:47,270 --> 02:14:47,280
guarantee you there's somebody in china
 

8085
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:49,350
guarantee you there's somebody in china
and south america there's somebody

8086
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:49,360
and south america there's somebody
 

8087
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:52,870
and south america there's somebody
in texas and and they all have different

8088
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:52,880
in texas and and they all have different
 

8089
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:54,709
in texas and and they all have different
emotional baggage they probably got

emotional baggage they probably got
angry earlier on about the whole

8092
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:56,560
angry earlier on about the whole
 

8093
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:58,790
angry earlier on about the whole
discussion about coronavirus and

8094
02:14:58,790 --> 02:14:58,800
discussion about coronavirus and
 

8095
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:02,550
discussion about coronavirus and
uh about some aspect of it uh yeah it's

8096
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:02,560
uh about some aspect of it uh yeah it's
 

8097
02:15:02,560 --> 02:15:05,030
uh about some aspect of it uh yeah it's
and there's that network effect yeah

8098
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:05,040
and there's that network effect yeah
 

8099
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:05,669
and there's that network effect yeah
yeah

8100
02:15:05,669 --> 02:15:05,679
yeah
 

8101
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:08,149
yeah
that's uh it's a beautiful thing and and

8102
02:15:08,149 --> 02:15:08,159
that's uh it's a beautiful thing and and
 

8103
02:15:08,159 --> 02:15:10,550
that's uh it's a beautiful thing and and
this lateral transfer of information

8104
02:15:10,550 --> 02:15:10,560
this lateral transfer of information
 

8105
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:11,990
this lateral transfer of information
that's what makes the collective

8106
02:15:11,990 --> 02:15:12,000
that's what makes the collective
 

8107
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,750
that's what makes the collective

quote-unquote genome
of humanity so unique from any other

8110
02:15:17,109 --> 02:15:17,119
of humanity so unique from any other

02:15:17,119 --> 02:15:19,830
of humanity so unique from any other
species

8112
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:19,840

 

8113
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:22,229

so you somehow miraculously wrapped it

8114
02:15:22,229 --> 02:15:22,239
so you somehow miraculously wrapped it
 

8115
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,149
so you somehow miraculously wrapped it
back to the very beginning

8116
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:24,159
back to the very beginning
 

8117
02:15:24,159 --> 02:15:26,229
back to the very beginning
of when we were talking about the human

8118
02:15:26,229 --> 02:15:26,239
of when we were talking about the human
 

8119
02:15:26,239 --> 02:15:28,950
of when we were talking about the human
the beauty of the human genome

8120
02:15:28,950 --> 02:15:28,960
the beauty of the human genome
 

8121
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:31,669
the beauty of the human genome
so i think this is the right time unless

8122
02:15:31,669 --> 02:15:31,679
so i think this is the right time unless
 

8123
02:15:31,679 --> 02:15:32,790
so i think this is the right time unless
we want to go for

8124
02:15:32,790 --> 02:15:32,800
we want to go for
 

8125
02:15:32,800 --> 02:15:34,870
we want to go for
a six to eight hour conversation we're

8126
02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:34,880
a six to eight hour conversation we're
 

8127
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,390
a six to eight hour conversation we're
gonna have to talk again but

8128
02:15:36,390 --> 02:15:36,400
gonna have to talk again but
 

8129
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:39,270
gonna have to talk again but
i think for now to wrap it up um this is

8130
02:15:39,270 --> 02:15:39,280
i think for now to wrap it up um this is
 

8131
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:41,030
i think for now to wrap it up um this is
the right time to talk about

8132
02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:41,040
the right time to talk about
 

8133
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:44,069
the right time to talk about
the uh the biggest most ridiculous

8134
02:15:44,069 --> 02:15:44,079
the uh the biggest most ridiculous
 

8135
02:15:44,079 --> 02:15:44,870
the uh the biggest most ridiculous
question of all

8136
02:15:44,870 --> 02:15:44,880

8630
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:07,280
seeing that progression between them
 

8631
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:10,550
seeing that progression between them
the complexity of the language growing

8632
02:25:10,550 --> 02:25:10,560
the complexity of the language growing
 

8633
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:13,910
the complexity of the language growing
as more neural connections are formed

8634
02:25:13,910 --> 02:25:13,920
as more neural connections are formed
 

8635
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:16,710
as more neural connections are formed
to to realize that the hardware is

8636
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:16,720
to to realize that the hardware is
 

8637
02:25:16,720 --> 02:25:18,389
to to realize that the hardware is
getting rearranged

8638
02:25:18,389 --> 02:25:18,399
getting rearranged
 

8639
02:25:18,399 --> 02:25:20,710
getting rearranged
as their software is getting implemented

8640
02:25:20,710 --> 02:25:20,720
as their software is getting implemented
 

8641
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:22,550
as their software is getting implemented
on that hardware

8642
02:25:22,550 --> 02:25:22,560
on that hardware
 

8643
02:25:22,560 --> 02:25:24,469
on that hardware
that their frontal cortex continues to

8644
02:25:24,469 --> 02:25:24,479
that their frontal cortex continues to
 

8645
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:27,830
that their frontal cortex continues to
grow for another 10 years

8646
02:25:27,830 --> 02:25:27,840
grow for another 10 years
 

8647
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:29,030
grow for another 10 years
these neuronal connections are

8648
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:29,040
these neuronal connections are
 

8649
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:30,630
these neuronal connections are
continuing to form new neurons that

8650
02:25:30,630 --> 02:25:30,640
continuing to form new neurons that
 

8651
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:31,510
continuing to form new neurons that
actually get

8652
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:31,520
actually get
 

8653
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:35,270
actually get
replicated and formed and it's it's just

8654
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:35,280
replicated and formed and it's it's just
 

8655
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:38,950
replicated and formed and it's it's just
incredible that we have this not just

8656
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:38,960
incredible that we have this not just
 

8657
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:40,630
incredible that we have this not just
you grow the hardware for 30 years and

8658
02:25:40,630 --> 02:25:40,640
you grow the hardware for 30 years and
 

8659
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:42,790
you grow the hardware for 30 years and
then you feed it all of the knowledge no

8660
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:42,800
then you feed it all of the knowledge no
 

8661
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:45,270
then you feed it all of the knowledge no
no the knowledge is fed throughout and

8662
02:25:45,270 --> 02:25:45,280
no the knowledge is fed throughout and
 

8663
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:47,190
no the knowledge is fed throughout and
is shaping these neural connections as

02:25:47,190 --> 02:25:47,200
is shaping these neural connections as
 

8665
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:48,469
is shaping these neural connections as
they're forming

8666

8673
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:56,230
own blood or from an adopted child is
the most beautiful thing you can do as a
