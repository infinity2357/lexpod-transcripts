00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:54,660
high school and right after you wrote a
 

41
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,110
high school and right after you wrote a
draft of a chemistry textbook I saw that

42
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
draft of a chemistry textbook I saw that
 

43
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,520
draft of a chemistry textbook I saw that
that covers everything from basic

44
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:58,530
that covers everything from basic
 

45
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,229
that covers everything from basic
structure of the atom to quantum

46
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
structure of the atom to quantum
 

47
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,020
structure of the atom to quantum
mechanics so it's clear you have an

48
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,030
mechanics so it's clear you have an
 

49
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,530
mechanics so it's clear you have an
intuition and a passion for both the

50
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:05,540
intuition and a passion for both the
 

51
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,750
intuition and a passion for both the
physical world with chemistry and now

52
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:08,760
physical world with chemistry and now
 

53
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,649

robotics to the digital world with AI

54
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:12,659
robotics to the digital world with AI
 

55
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,600
robotics to the digital world with AI
deep learning reinforcement learning so

56
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:14,610
deep learning reinforcement learning so
 

57
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,609
deep learning reinforcement learning so
on do you see the physical world in the

58
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:16,619
on do you see the physical world in the
 

59
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,950
on do you see the physical world in the
digital world is different and what do

60
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
digital world is different and what do
 

61
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,899
digital world is different and what do
you think is the gap a lot of it

62
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:20,909
you think is the gap a lot of it
 

63
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,520
you think is the gap a lot of it
actually boils down to iteration speed

64
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,530
actually boils down to iteration speed
 

65
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,200
actually boils down to iteration speed
right that I think that a lot of what

66
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,210
right that I think that a lot of what
 

67
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,999
right that I think that a lot of what
really motivates me is is building

68
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:26,009
really motivates me is is building
 

69
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,010
really motivates me is is building
things right is the I you know think

70
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:28,020
things right is the I you know think
 

71
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,510
things right is the I you know think
about mathematics for example where you

72
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
about mathematics for example where you
 

73
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,649
about mathematics for example where you
think you're really hard about a problem

74
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:30,659
think you're really hard about a problem
 

75
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,270
think you're really hard about a problem
you understand it you're right down in

76
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,280
you understand it you're right down in
 

77
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,530
you understand it you're right down in
this very obscure form that we call

78
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:33,540
this very obscure form that we call
 

79
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,160
this very obscure form that we call
proof but then this is in humanities

80
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,170
proof but then this is in humanities
 

81
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,690
proof but then this is in humanities
library right it's there forever this is

82
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:38,700
library right it's there forever this is
 

83
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,730
library right it's there forever this is
some truth that we've discovered you

84
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:40,740
some truth that we've discovered you
 

85
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,810
some truth that we've discovered you
know maybe only five people in your

86
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:41,820
know maybe only five people in your
 

87
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,340
know maybe only five people in your
field will ever read it now but somehow

88
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:43,350
field will ever read it now but somehow
 

89
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,569
field will ever read it now but somehow
you've kind of moved humanity forward

90
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:44,579
you've kind of moved humanity forward
 

91
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,760
you've kind of moved humanity forward
and so I actually used to really think

92
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:46,770
and so I actually used to really think
 

93
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,899
and so I actually used to really think
that I was going to be a mathematician

94
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:47,909
that I was going to be a mathematician
 

95
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,630
that I was going to be a mathematician
and then I actually started writing this

96
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
and then I actually started writing this
 

97
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,160
and then I actually started writing this
chemistry textbook one of my friends

98
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,170
chemistry textbook one of my friends
 

99
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,539
chemistry textbook one of my friends
told me you'll never publish it because

100
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:53,549
told me you'll never publish it because
 

101
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,929
told me you'll never publish it because
you don't have a PhD so instead I

102
00:01:55,929 --> 00:01:55,939
you don't have a PhD so instead I
 

103
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:58,310
you don't have a PhD so instead I
decided to build a website and try to

104
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
decided to build a website and try to
 

105
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,260
decided to build a website and try to
promote my ideas that way and then I

106
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,270
promote my ideas that way and then I
 

107
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,200
promote my ideas that way and then I
discovered programming and I you know

108
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,210
discovered programming and I you know
 

109
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,550
discovered programming and I you know
that in programming you think hard about

110
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
that in programming you think hard about
 

111
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,319
that in programming you think hard about
a problem you understand it you write

112
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:06,329
a problem you understand it you write
 

113
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,359
a problem you understand it you write
down in a very obscure form that we call

114
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:08,369
down in a very obscure form that we call
 

115
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,880
down in a very obscure form that we call
a program but then once again it's in

116
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:10,890
a program but then once again it's in
 

117
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,860
a program but then once again it's in
humanities library right and anyone

118
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:12,870
humanities library right and anyone
 

119
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,770
humanities library right and anyone
could get the benefit from

120
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:13,780
could get the benefit from
 

121
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,960
could get the benefit from
and the scalability is massive and so I

122
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:15,970
and the scalability is massive and so I
 

123
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,490
and the scalability is massive and so I
think that the thing that really appeals

124
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:17,500
think that the thing that really appeals
 

125
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,320
think that the thing that really appeals
to me about the digital world is that

126
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,330
to me about the digital world is that
 

127
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,270
to me about the digital world is that
you can have this this this insane

128
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
you can have this this this insane
 

129
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
you can have this this this insane
leverage right a single individual with

130
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,290
leverage right a single individual with
 

131
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,170
leverage right a single individual with
an idea is able to affect the entire

132
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:25,180
an idea is able to affect the entire
 

133
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,120
an idea is able to affect the entire
planet and that's something I think is

134
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,130
planet and that's something I think is
 

135
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,770
planet and that's something I think is
really hard to do if you're moving

136
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:28,780
really hard to do if you're moving
 

137
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,370
really hard to do if you're moving
around physical atoms but you said

138
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:31,380
around physical atoms but you said
 

139
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,720
around physical atoms but you said
mathematics so if you look at the the

140
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:33,730
mathematics so if you look at the the
 

141
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,060
mathematics so if you look at the the
what thing you know over here our mind

142
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,070
what thing you know over here our mind
 

143
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,870
what thing you know over here our mind
do you ultimately see it as just math is

144
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:39,880
do you ultimately see it as just math is
 

145
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,120
do you ultimately see it as just math is
just information processing or is there

146
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,130
just information processing or is there
 

147
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,490
just information processing or is there
some other magic as you've seen if

148
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:44,500
some other magic as you've seen if
 

149
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,810
some other magic as you've seen if
you've seen through biology and

150
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:45,820
you've seen through biology and
 

151
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,490
you've seen through biology and
chemistry and so on I think it's really

152
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:47,500
chemistry and so on I think it's really
 

153
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,080
chemistry and so on I think it's really
interesting to think about humans is

154
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,090
interesting to think about humans is
 

155
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,810
interesting to think about humans is
just information processing systems and

156
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:50,820
just information processing systems and
 

157
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,650
just information processing systems and
that it seems like it's actually a

158
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:52,660
that it seems like it's actually a
 

159
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,340
that it seems like it's actually a
pretty good way of describing a lot of

160
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,350
pretty good way of describing a lot of
 

161
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,420
pretty good way of describing a lot of
kind of how the world works or a lot of

162
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:57,430
kind of how the world works or a lot of
 

163
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,610
kind of how the world works or a lot of
what we're capable of to think that that

164
00:02:59,610 --> 00:02:59,620
what we're capable of to think that that
 

165
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,199
what we're capable of to think that that
you know again if you just look at

166
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:01,209
you know again if you just look at
 

167
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,780
you know again if you just look at
technological innovations over time that

168
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:03,790
technological innovations over time that
 

169
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,310
technological innovations over time that
in some ways the most transformative

170
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,320
in some ways the most transformative
 

171
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,600
in some ways the most transformative
innovation that we've had it has been

172
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:06,610
innovation that we've had it has been
 

173
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,370
innovation that we've had it has been
the computer right in some ways the

174
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:08,380
the computer right in some ways the
 

175
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,440
the computer right in some ways the
internet you know that what is the right

176
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:10,450
internet you know that what is the right
 

177
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,940
internet you know that what is the right
the Internet is not about these physical

178
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:11,950
the Internet is not about these physical
 

179
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,190
the Internet is not about these physical
cables it's about the fact that I am

180
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:14,200
cables it's about the fact that I am
 

181
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,750
cables it's about the fact that I am
suddenly able to instantly communicate

182
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
suddenly able to instantly communicate
 

183
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,640
suddenly able to instantly communicate
with any other human on the planet I'm

184
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:17,650
with any other human on the planet I'm
 

185
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,350
with any other human on the planet I'm
able to retrieve any piece of knowledge

186
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
able to retrieve any piece of knowledge
 

187
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,420
able to retrieve any piece of knowledge
that in some ways the human race has

188
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:21,430
that in some ways the human race has
 

189
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,990
that in some ways the human race has
ever had and that those are these insane

190
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,000
ever had and that those are these insane
 

191
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,120
ever had and that those are these insane
transformations do you see the our

192
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,130
transformations do you see the our
 

193
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,130
transformations do you see the our
society as a whole the collective as

194
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:29,140
society as a whole the collective as
 

195
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,289
society as a whole the collective as
another extension of the intelligence of

196
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:31,299
another extension of the intelligence of
 

197
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:33,000
another extension of the intelligence of
the human being so if you look at the

198
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,010
the human being so if you look at the
 

199
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,380
the human being so if you look at the
human being is an information processing

200
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,390
human being is an information processing
 

201
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,920
human being is an information processing
system

202
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:34,930
system
 

203
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,060
system
you mentioned the internet then

204
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,070
you mentioned the internet then
 

205
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,190
you mentioned the internet then
networking do you see us all together as

206
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,200
networking do you see us all together as
 

207
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,009
networking do you see us all together as
a civilization as a kind of intelligence

208
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:41,019
a civilization as a kind of intelligence
 

209
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,930
a civilization as a kind of intelligence
system yeah I think this is actually a

210
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:42,940
system yeah I think this is actually a
 

211
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,729
system yeah I think this is actually a
really interesting perspective to take

212
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:44,739
really interesting perspective to take
 

213
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:46,710
really interesting perspective to take
and to think about to you sort of have

214
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:46,720
and to think about to you sort of have
 

215
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,750
and to think about to you sort of have
this collective intelligence of all of

216
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:48,760
this collective intelligence of all of
 

217
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,699
this collective intelligence of all of
society the economy itself is this

218
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:50,709
society the economy itself is this
 

219
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,250
society the economy itself is this
superhuman machine that is optimizing

220
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,260
superhuman machine that is optimizing
 

221
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,560
superhuman machine that is optimizing
something right and it's all in some

222
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:55,570
something right and it's all in some
 

223
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,120
something right and it's all in some
ways a company has a will of its own

224
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,130
ways a company has a will of its own
 

225
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,530
ways a company has a will of its own
right that you have all these

226
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:58,540
right that you have all these
 

227
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,120
right that you have all these
individuals we're all pursuing their own

228
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,130
individuals we're all pursuing their own
 

229
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,289
individuals we're all pursuing their own
individual goals and thinking really

230
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:01,299
individual goals and thinking really
 

231
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,789
individual goals and thinking really
hard and thinking about the right things

232
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
hard and thinking about the right things
 

233
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,620
hard and thinking about the right things
to do but somehow the company does

234
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:04,630
to do but somehow the company does
 

235
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,199
to do but somehow the company does
something that is this emergent thing

236
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:07,209
something that is this emergent thing
 

237
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,390
something that is this emergent thing
and that is it so there's a really

238
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:09,400
and that is it so there's a really
 

239
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,280
and that is it so there's a really
useful abstraction and so I think that

240
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,290
useful abstraction and so I think that
 

241
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,750
useful abstraction and so I think that
in some ways you know we think of

242
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:12,760
in some ways you know we think of
 

243
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,789
in some ways you know we think of
ourselves as the most intelligent things

244
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
ourselves as the most intelligent things
 

245
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,170
ourselves as the most intelligent things
on the planet and the most powerful

246
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,180
on the planet and the most powerful
 

247
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,330
on the planet and the most powerful
things on the planet but there are

248
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:18,340
things on the planet but there are
 

249
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,409
things on the planet but there are
things that are bigger than us that

250
00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:19,419
things that are bigger than us that
 

251
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:20,839
things that are bigger than us that
these systems that we all contribute to

252
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:20,849
these systems that we all contribute to
 

253
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:22,950
these systems that we all contribute to
and so I think actually you know it's a

254
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
and so I think actually you know it's a
 

255
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,779
and so I think actually you know it's a
it's interesting to think about if

256
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:24,789
it's interesting to think about if
 

257
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,219
it's interesting to think about if
you've read as a guys a models

258
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:26,229
you've read as a guys a models
 

259
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,040
you've read as a guys a models
foundation

260
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,050
foundation
 

261
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,839
foundation
right that that there's this concept of

262
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:28,849
right that that there's this concept of
 

263
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,399
right that that there's this concept of
psychohistory in there which is

264
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:30,409
psychohistory in there which is
 

265
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:31,300
psychohistory in there which is
effectively this that if you have

266
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,310
effectively this that if you have
 

267
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,029
effectively this that if you have
trillions or quadrillions of beings then

268
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:34,039
trillions or quadrillions of beings then
 

269
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,710
trillions or quadrillions of beings then
maybe you could actually predict what

270
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:35,720
maybe you could actually predict what
 

271
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,779
maybe you could actually predict what
that being that that huge macro being

272
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:37,789
that being that that huge macro being
 

273
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:40,809
that being that that huge macro being
will do I and almost independent of what

274
00:04:40,809 --> 00:04:40,819
will do I and almost independent of what
 

275
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,089
will do I and almost independent of what
the individuals want I actually have a

276
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:43,099
the individuals want I actually have a
 

277
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:44,559
the individuals want I actually have a
second angle on this I think is

278
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:44,569
second angle on this I think is
 

279
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,450
second angle on this I think is
interesting which is thinking about a

280
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:46,460
interesting which is thinking about a
 

281
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,879
interesting which is thinking about a
technological determinism one thing that

282
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:48,889
technological determinism one thing that
 

283
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,559
technological determinism one thing that
I actually think a lot about with with

284
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:50,569
I actually think a lot about with with
 

285
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,330
I actually think a lot about with with
open a tie right is that we're kind of

286
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:52,340
open a tie right is that we're kind of
 

287
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,610
open a tie right is that we're kind of
coming on onto this insanely

288
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:54,620
coming on onto this insanely
 

289
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,710
coming on onto this insanely
transformational technology of general

290
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
transformational technology of general
 

291
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,969
transformational technology of general
intelligence right that will happen at

292
00:04:57,969 --> 00:04:57,979
intelligence right that will happen at
 

293
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,890
intelligence right that will happen at
some point and there's a question of how

294
00:04:59,890 --> 00:04:59,900
some point and there's a question of how
 

295
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,959
some point and there's a question of how
can you take actions that will actually

296
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:01,969
can you take actions that will actually
 

297
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,760
can you take actions that will actually
steer it to go better rather than worse

298
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:03,770
steer it to go better rather than worse
 

299
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,100
steer it to go better rather than worse
and that I think one question you need

300
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,110
and that I think one question you need
 

301
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,320
and that I think one question you need
to ask is as a scientist as an inventor

302
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,330
to ask is as a scientist as an inventor
 

303
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,930
to ask is as a scientist as an inventor
as a creator what impact can you have in

304
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:10,940
as a creator what impact can you have in
 

305
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,279
as a creator what impact can you have in
general right you look at things like

306
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:12,289
general right you look at things like
 

307
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:13,930
general right you look at things like
the telephone invented by two people in

308
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:13,940
the telephone invented by two people in
 

309
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,670
the telephone invented by two people in
the same day like what does that mean

310
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
the same day like what does that mean
 

311
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,230
the same day like what does that mean
what does that mean about the shape of

312
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:17,240
what does that mean about the shape of
 

313
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,089
what does that mean about the shape of
innovation and I think that what's going

314
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:19,099
innovation and I think that what's going
 

315
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,379
innovation and I think that what's going
on is everyone's building on the

316
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:20,389
on is everyone's building on the
 

317
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,119
on is everyone's building on the
shoulders of the same giants and so you

318
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:22,129
shoulders of the same giants and so you
 

319
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,950
shoulders of the same giants and so you
can kind of you can't really hope to

320
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:23,960
can kind of you can't really hope to
 

321
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,330
can kind of you can't really hope to
create something no one else ever would

322
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:25,340
create something no one else ever would
 

323
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,369
create something no one else ever would
you know if Einstein wasn't born someone

324
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:27,379
you know if Einstein wasn't born someone
 

325
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:28,659
you know if Einstein wasn't born someone
else would have come up with relativity

326
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:28,669
else would have come up with relativity
 

327
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,430
else would have come up with relativity
you know he changed the timeline a bit

328
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:30,440
you know he changed the timeline a bit
 

329
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,689
you know he changed the timeline a bit
right that maybe it would have taken

330
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:31,699
right that maybe it would have taken
 

331
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,670
right that maybe it would have taken
another 20 years but it wouldn't be that

332
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
another 20 years but it wouldn't be that
 

333
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,899
another 20 years but it wouldn't be that
fundamentally humanity would never

334
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:34,909
fundamentally humanity would never
 

335
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,939
fundamentally humanity would never
discover these these fundamental truths

336
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:36,949
discover these these fundamental truths
 

337
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,300
discover these these fundamental truths
so there's some kind of invisible

338
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,310
so there's some kind of invisible
 

339
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,850
so there's some kind of invisible
momentum that some people like Einstein

340
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:41,860
momentum that some people like Einstein
 

341
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,570
momentum that some people like Einstein
or open the eyes plugging into that's

342
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:45,580
or open the eyes plugging into that's
 

343
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,920
or open the eyes plugging into that's
anybody else can also plug into and

344
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:47,930
anybody else can also plug into and
 

345
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,110
anybody else can also plug into and
ultimately that wave takes us into a

346
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,120
ultimately that wave takes us into a
 

347
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,240
ultimately that wave takes us into a
certain direction that's me that's right

348
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,250
certain direction that's me that's right
 

349
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,559
certain direction that's me that's right
that's right and you know this kind of

350
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:53,569
that's right and you know this kind of
 

351
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:54,550
that's right and you know this kind of
seems to play out in a bunch of

352
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
seems to play out in a bunch of
 

353
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,200
seems to play out in a bunch of
different ways that there's some

354
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,210
different ways that there's some
 

355
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,939
different ways that there's some
exponential that is being ridden and

356
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:57,949
exponential that is being ridden and
 

357
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,740
exponential that is being ridden and
that the exponential itself which one it

358
00:05:59,740 --> 00:05:59,750
that the exponential itself which one it
 

359
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,600
that the exponential itself which one it
is changes think about Moore's law an

360
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:01,610
is changes think about Moore's law an
 

361
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,700
is changes think about Moore's law an
entire industry set its clock to it for

362
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:03,710
entire industry set its clock to it for
 

363
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,309
entire industry set its clock to it for
50 years like how can that be right how

364
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
50 years like how can that be right how
 

365
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,409
50 years like how can that be right how
is that possible and yet somehow it

366
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:08,419
is that possible and yet somehow it
 

367
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,140
is that possible and yet somehow it
happened and so I think you can't hope

368
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,150
happened and so I think you can't hope
 

369
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,490
happened and so I think you can't hope
to ever invent something that no one

370
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:12,500
to ever invent something that no one
 

371
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,110
to ever invent something that no one
else will maybe you can change the

372
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,120
else will maybe you can change the
 

373
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,420
else will maybe you can change the
timeline a little bit but if you really

374
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:16,430
timeline a little bit but if you really
 

375
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,769
timeline a little bit but if you really
want to make a difference I think that

376
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:17,779
want to make a difference I think that
 

377
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,510
want to make a difference I think that
the thing that you really have to do the

378
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
the thing that you really have to do the
 

379
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,430
the thing that you really have to do the
only real degree of freedom you have is

380
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
only real degree of freedom you have is
 

381
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,260
only real degree of freedom you have is
to set the initial conditions under

382
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,270
to set the initial conditions under
 

383
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,269
to set the initial conditions under
which a technology is born and so you

384
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:25,279
which a technology is born and so you
 

385
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,769
which a technology is born and so you
think about the internet right that

386
00:06:26,769 --> 00:06:26,779
think about the internet right that
 

387
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:27,760
think about the internet right that
there are lots of other competitors

388
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:27,770
there are lots of other competitors
 

389
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,800
there are lots of other competitors
trying to build similar things and the

390
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:29,810
trying to build similar things and the
 

391
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,499
trying to build similar things and the
internet one and that the initial

392
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:32,509
internet one and that the initial
 

393
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:34,089
internet one and that the initial
conditions where that was created by

394
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:34,099
conditions where that was created by
 

395
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,920
conditions where that was created by
this group that really valued people

396
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:35,930
this group that really valued people
 

397
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,620
this group that really valued people
being able to be you know anyone being

398
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:38,630
being able to be you know anyone being
 

399
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,820
being able to be you know anyone being
able to plug in this very academic

400
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:39,830
able to plug in this very academic
 

401
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,719
able to plug in this very academic
mindset of

402
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:40,729
mindset of
 

403
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,879
mindset of
being open and connected and I think

404
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:42,889
being open and connected and I think
 

405
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,230
being open and connected and I think
that the Internet for the next 40 years

406
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
that the Internet for the next 40 years
 

407
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,820
that the Internet for the next 40 years
really played out that way

408
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:45,830
really played out that way
 

409
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,219
really played out that way
you know maybe today things are starting

410
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:48,229
you know maybe today things are starting
 

411
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:49,989
you know maybe today things are starting
to shift in a different direction but I

412
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:49,999
to shift in a different direction but I
 

413
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,189
to shift in a different direction but I
think if those initial conditions were

414
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199
think if those initial conditions were
 

415
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,989
think if those initial conditions were
really important to determine the next

416
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:52,999
really important to determine the next
 

417
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:55,510
really important to determine the next
40 years worth of progress that's really

418
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,520
40 years worth of progress that's really
 

419
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,279
40 years worth of progress that's really
beautifully put so another example of

420
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,289
beautifully put so another example of
 

421
00:06:57,289 --> 00:06:59,290
beautifully put so another example of
that I think about you know I recently

422
00:06:59,290 --> 00:06:59,300
that I think about you know I recently
 

423
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,869
that I think about you know I recently
looked at it I looked at Wikipedia the

424
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:01,879
looked at it I looked at Wikipedia the
 

425
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,360
looked at it I looked at Wikipedia the
formation of Wikipedia and I wonder what

426
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,370
formation of Wikipedia and I wonder what
 

427
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,189
formation of Wikipedia and I wonder what
the internet would be like if Wikipedia

428
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:06,199
the internet would be like if Wikipedia
 

429
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,159
the internet would be like if Wikipedia
had ads you know there's a interesting

430
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:09,169
had ads you know there's a interesting
 

431
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:12,010
had ads you know there's a interesting
argument that why they chose not to make

432
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,020
argument that why they chose not to make
 

433
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,529
argument that why they chose not to make
it put advertisement wikipedia i think

434
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:14,539
it put advertisement wikipedia i think
 

435
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:16,899
it put advertisement wikipedia i think
it's i think wikipedia is one of the

436
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:16,909
it's i think wikipedia is one of the
 

437
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:18,249
it's i think wikipedia is one of the
greatest resources we have on the

438
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:18,259
greatest resources we have on the
 

439
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:20,290
greatest resources we have on the
internet it's extremely surprising how

440
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:20,300
internet it's extremely surprising how
 

441
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,029
internet it's extremely surprising how
well it works and how well it was able

442
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:22,039
well it works and how well it was able
 

443
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,219
well it works and how well it was able
to aggregate all this kind of good

444
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:24,229
to aggregate all this kind of good
 

445
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:26,379
to aggregate all this kind of good
information and they essentially the

446
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:26,389
information and they essentially the
 

447
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:27,579
information and they essentially the
creator of wikipedia I don't know

448
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:27,589
creator of wikipedia I don't know
 

449
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,469
creator of wikipedia I don't know
there's probably some debates there but

450
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:29,479
there's probably some debates there but
 

451
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:31,689
there's probably some debates there but
set the initial conditions and now it

452
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:31,699
set the initial conditions and now it
 

453
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,549
set the initial conditions and now it
carried it itself forward that's really

454
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:33,559
carried it itself forward that's really
 

455
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,320
carried it itself forward that's really
interesting so you're the way you're

456
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:35,330
interesting so you're the way you're
 

457
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,059
interesting so you're the way you're
thinking about AGI or artificial

458
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:37,069
thinking about AGI or artificial
 

459
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,920
thinking about AGI or artificial
intelligences you're focused on setting

460
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:38,930
intelligences you're focused on setting
 

461
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,600
intelligences you're focused on setting
the initial conditions for the for the

462
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:40,610
the initial conditions for the for the
 

463
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,730
the initial conditions for the for the
progress that's right that's powerful

464
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:42,740
progress that's right that's powerful
 

465
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,820
progress that's right that's powerful
okay so look into the future if you

466
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:45,830
okay so look into the future if you
 

467
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,879
okay so look into the future if you
create an AGI system like one that can

468
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:48,889
create an AGI system like one that can
 

469
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:50,829
create an AGI system like one that can
ace the Turing test natural language

470
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:50,839
ace the Turing test natural language
 

471
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,519
ace the Turing test natural language
what do you think would be the

472
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:53,529
what do you think would be the
 

473
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,989
what do you think would be the
interactions you would have with it what

474
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:55,999
interactions you would have with it what
 

475
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:57,339
interactions you would have with it what
do you think are the questions you would

476
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:57,349
do you think are the questions you would
 

477
00:07:57,349 --> 00:07:58,510
do you think are the questions you would
ask like what would be the first

478
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:58,520
ask like what would be the first
 

479
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,959
ask like what would be the first
question you would ask it her/him that's

480
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:01,969
question you would ask it her/him that's
 

481
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:04,149
question you would ask it her/him that's
right I think it at that point if you've

482
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:04,159
right I think it at that point if you've
 

483
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,519
right I think it at that point if you've
really built a powerful system that is

484
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:06,529
really built a powerful system that is
 

485
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:07,749
really built a powerful system that is
capable of shaping the future of

486
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
capable of shaping the future of
 

487
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,339
capable of shaping the future of
humanity the first question that you

488
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:09,349
humanity the first question that you
 

489
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:10,869
humanity the first question that you
really should ask is how do we make sure

490
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
really should ask is how do we make sure
 

491
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,029
really should ask is how do we make sure
that this plays out well and so that's

492
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
that this plays out well and so that's
 

493
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,499
that this plays out well and so that's
actually the first question that I would

494
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:14,509
actually the first question that I would
 

495
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,860
actually the first question that I would
ask a powerful AGI system is so you

496
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:17,870
ask a powerful AGI system is so you
 

497
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,480
ask a powerful AGI system is so you
wouldn't ask your colleague you wouldn't

498
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,490
wouldn't ask your colleague you wouldn't
 

499
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,549
wouldn't ask your colleague you wouldn't
ask like Ilya you would ask the AGI

500
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:21,559
ask like Ilya you would ask the AGI
 

501
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,260
ask like Ilya you would ask the AGI
system oh we've already had the

502
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:23,270
system oh we've already had the
 

503
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,730
system oh we've already had the
conversation with Ilya right and

504
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:24,740
conversation with Ilya right and
 

505
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,829
conversation with Ilya right and
everyone here and so you want as many

506
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:26,839
everyone here and so you want as many
 

507
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,139
everyone here and so you want as many
perspectives and a piece of wisdom as

508
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:29,149
perspectives and a piece of wisdom as
 

509
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,429
perspectives and a piece of wisdom as
you can for it for answering this

510
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:30,439
you can for it for answering this
 

511
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,689
you can for it for answering this
question so I don't think you

512
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:31,699
question so I don't think you
 

513
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:33,909
question so I don't think you
necessarily defer to whatever your

514
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
necessarily defer to whatever your
 

515
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,040
necessarily defer to whatever your
powerful system tells you but you use as

516
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,050
powerful system tells you but you use as
 

517
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,600
powerful system tells you but you use as
one input I like to try to figure out

518
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:37,610
one input I like to try to figure out
 

519
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,779
one input I like to try to figure out
what to do but and I guess fundamentally

520
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:40,789
what to do but and I guess fundamentally
 

521
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,370
what to do but and I guess fundamentally
what it really comes down to is if you

522
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:42,380
what it really comes down to is if you
 

523
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,110
what it really comes down to is if you
built something really powerful and you

524
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,120
built something really powerful and you
 

525
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,340
built something really powerful and you
think about think about for example the

526
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,350
think about think about for example the
 

527
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,680
think about think about for example the
creation of of shortly after the

528
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:47,690
creation of of shortly after the
 

529
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,939
creation of of shortly after the
creation of nuclear weapons right the

530
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:48,949
creation of nuclear weapons right the
 

531
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:50,590
creation of nuclear weapons right the
most important question the world was

532
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:50,600
most important question the world was
 

533
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,360
most important question the world was
what's the world order going to be like

534
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:52,370
what's the world order going to be like
 

535
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,640
what's the world order going to be like
how do we set ourselves up in

536
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:54,650
how do we set ourselves up in
 

537
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,500
how do we set ourselves up in
where we're going to be able to survive

538
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:56,510
where we're going to be able to survive
 

539
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,290
where we're going to be able to survive
this species with a GI I think the

540
00:08:59,290 --> 00:08:59,300
this species with a GI I think the
 

541
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,519
this species with a GI I think the
question is slightly different right

542
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:00,529
question is slightly different right
 

543
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:02,230
question is slightly different right
that there is a question of how do we

544
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
that there is a question of how do we
 

545
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,640
that there is a question of how do we
make sure that we don't get the negative

546
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:03,650
make sure that we don't get the negative
 

547
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,290
make sure that we don't get the negative
effects but there's also the positive

548
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:05,300
effects but there's also the positive
 

549
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,450
effects but there's also the positive
side right you imagine that you know

550
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:07,460
side right you imagine that you know
 

551
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,820
side right you imagine that you know
like like what won't AGI be like like

552
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:09,830
like like what won't AGI be like like
 

553
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,070
like like what won't AGI be like like
what will be capable of and I think that

554
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
what will be capable of and I think that
 

555
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,410
what will be capable of and I think that
one of the core reasons that an AGI can

556
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:14,420
one of the core reasons that an AGI can
 

557
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,760
one of the core reasons that an AGI can
be powerful and transformative is

558
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:15,770
be powerful and transformative is
 

559
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,470
be powerful and transformative is
actually due to technological

560
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:17,480
actually due to technological
 

561
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,180
actually due to technological
development yeah right if you have

562
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,190
development yeah right if you have
 

563
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,070
development yeah right if you have
something that's capable as capable as a

564
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,080
something that's capable as capable as a
 

565
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,900
something that's capable as capable as a
human and that it's much more scalable

566
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:22,910
human and that it's much more scalable
 

567
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,870
human and that it's much more scalable
that you absolutely want that thing to

568
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:25,880
that you absolutely want that thing to
 

569
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,190
that you absolutely want that thing to
go read the whole scientific literature

570
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
go read the whole scientific literature
 

571
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,960
go read the whole scientific literature
and think about how to create cures for

572
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:28,970
and think about how to create cures for
 

573
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,340
and think about how to create cures for
all the diseases right you want it to

574
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:30,350
all the diseases right you want it to
 

575
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,769
all the diseases right you want it to
think about how to go and build

576
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:31,779
think about how to go and build
 

577
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,970
think about how to go and build
technologies to help us create material

578
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:33,980
technologies to help us create material
 

579
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,519
technologies to help us create material
abundance and to figure out societal

580
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:36,529
abundance and to figure out societal
 

581
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,140
abundance and to figure out societal
problems that we have trouble with like

582
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,150
problems that we have trouble with like
 

583
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,370
problems that we have trouble with like
how we're supposed to clean up the

584
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,380
how we're supposed to clean up the
 

585
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,930
how we're supposed to clean up the
environment and you know maybe you want

586
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:40,940
environment and you know maybe you want
 

587
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,150
environment and you know maybe you want
this to go and invent a bunch of little

588
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:43,160
this to go and invent a bunch of little
 

589
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,769
this to go and invent a bunch of little
robots that will go out and be

590
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:44,779
robots that will go out and be
 

591
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,530
robots that will go out and be
biodegradable and turn ocean debris into

592
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:47,540
biodegradable and turn ocean debris into
 

593
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,090
biodegradable and turn ocean debris into
harmless molecules and I think that that

594
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:52,100
harmless molecules and I think that that
 

595
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,670
harmless molecules and I think that that
that positive side is something that I

596
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:54,680
that positive side is something that I
 

597
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,200
that positive side is something that I
think people miss sometimes when

598
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,210
think people miss sometimes when
 

599
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,640
think people miss sometimes when
thinking about what an AGI will be like

600
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:57,650
thinking about what an AGI will be like
 

601
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,220
thinking about what an AGI will be like
and so I think that if you have a system

602
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,230
and so I think that if you have a system
 

603
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,690
and so I think that if you have a system
that's capable of all of that you

604
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:01,700
that's capable of all of that you
 

605
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,220
that's capable of all of that you
absolutely want its advice about how do

606
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,230
absolutely want its advice about how do
 

607
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,880
absolutely want its advice about how do
I make sure that we're using your your

608
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:06,890
I make sure that we're using your your
 

609
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,170
I make sure that we're using your your
capabilities in a positive way for

610
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:08,180
capabilities in a positive way for
 

611
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,090
capabilities in a positive way for
Humanity so what do you think about that

612
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:10,100
Humanity so what do you think about that
 

613
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,420
Humanity so what do you think about that
psychology that looks at all the

614
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:13,430
psychology that looks at all the
 

615
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,070
psychology that looks at all the
different possible trajectories of an

616
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:15,080
different possible trajectories of an
 

617
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,949
different possible trajectories of an
AGI system many of which perhaps the

618
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:17,959
AGI system many of which perhaps the
 

619
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:19,660
AGI system many of which perhaps the
majority of which are positive and

620
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:19,670
majority of which are positive and
 

621
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,060
majority of which are positive and
nevertheless focuses on the negative

622
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,070
nevertheless focuses on the negative
 

623
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,010
nevertheless focuses on the negative
trajectories I mean you get to interact

624
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:24,020
trajectories I mean you get to interact
 

625
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,600
trajectories I mean you get to interact
with folks you get to think about this

626
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:25,610
with folks you get to think about this
 

627
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,050
with folks you get to think about this
maybe within yourself as well you look

628
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,060
maybe within yourself as well you look
 

629
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,420
maybe within yourself as well you look
at sam harris and so on it seems to be

630
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:31,430
at sam harris and so on it seems to be
 

631
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,490
at sam harris and so on it seems to be
sorry to put it this way but almost more

632
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:33,500
sorry to put it this way but almost more
 

633
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,019
sorry to put it this way but almost more
fun to think about the negative

634
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:35,029
fun to think about the negative
 

635
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:38,860
fun to think about the negative
possibilities whatever that's deep in

636
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:38,870
possibilities whatever that's deep in
 

637
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,090
possibilities whatever that's deep in
our psychology what do you think about

638
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:40,100
our psychology what do you think about
 

639
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,160
our psychology what do you think about
that and how do we deal with it because

640
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,170
that and how do we deal with it because
 

641
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,430
that and how do we deal with it because
we want AI to help us so I think there's

642
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
we want AI to help us so I think there's
 

643
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,730
we want AI to help us so I think there's
kind of two problems so I entailed in

644
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:48,740
kind of two problems so I entailed in
 

645
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,670
kind of two problems so I entailed in
that question the first is more of the

646
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
that question the first is more of the
 

647
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,560
that question the first is more of the
question of how can you even picture

648
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:53,570
question of how can you even picture
 

649
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,540
question of how can you even picture
what a world with a new technology will

650
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:55,550
what a world with a new technology will
 

651
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,940
what a world with a new technology will
any like now imagine were in 1950 and

652
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:57,950
any like now imagine were in 1950 and
 

653
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,060
any like now imagine were in 1950 and
I'm trying to describe Buber to someone

654
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,070

 

655
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:06,350

apps and the internet yeah I mean your

656
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,360
apps and the internet yeah I mean your
 

657
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,269
apps and the internet yeah I mean your
yeah that's that's going to be extremely

658
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:08,279
yeah that's that's going to be extremely
 

659
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:10,100
yeah that's that's going to be extremely
complicated but it's imaginable

660
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:10,110
complicated but it's imaginable
 

661
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,139
complicated but it's imaginable
it's imaginable right but and now

662
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:12,149
it's imaginable right but and now
 

663
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,600
it's imaginable right but and now
imagine being a 1950 and predicting

664
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:14,610
imagine being a 1950 and predicting
 

665
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,269
imagine being a 1950 and predicting
goober right and you need to describe

666
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:16,279
goober right and you need to describe
 

667
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,590
goober right and you need to describe
the internet you need to describe GPS

668
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:18,600
the internet you need to describe GPS
 

669
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,300
the internet you need to describe GPS
you need to describe the fact that

670
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,310
you need to describe the fact that
 

671
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,980
you need to describe the fact that
everyone's going to have this phone in

672
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:21,990
everyone's going to have this phone in
 

673
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,889
everyone's going to have this phone in
their pocket and so I think that that

674
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:24,899
their pocket and so I think that that
 

675
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:27,019
their pocket and so I think that that
just the first truth is that it is hard

676
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,029
just the first truth is that it is hard
 

677
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:28,730
just the first truth is that it is hard
to picture how a transformative

678
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:28,740
to picture how a transformative
 

679
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,340
to picture how a transformative
technology will play out in the world

680
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,350
technology will play out in the world
 

681
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,749
technology will play out in the world
we've seen that before with technologies

682
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:32,759
we've seen that before with technologies
 

683
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,850
we've seen that before with technologies
that are far less transformative than AG

684
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:34,860
that are far less transformative than AG
 

685
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,100
that are far less transformative than AG
I will be and so I think that that one

686
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,110
I will be and so I think that that one
 

687
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,960
I will be and so I think that that one
piece is that it's just even hard to

688
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:38,970
piece is that it's just even hard to
 

689
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,329
piece is that it's just even hard to
imagine and to really put yourself in a

690
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:41,339
imagine and to really put yourself in a
 

691
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,949
imagine and to really put yourself in a
world where you can predict what that

692
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
world where you can predict what that
 

693
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,480
world where you can predict what that
that positive vision would be like and

694
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,490
that positive vision would be like and
 

695
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,379
that positive vision would be like and
you know I think the second thing is

696
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:48,389
you know I think the second thing is
 

697
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:51,079
you know I think the second thing is
that it is I think it is always easier

698
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:51,089
that it is I think it is always easier
 

699
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,470
that it is I think it is always easier
to support the negative side than the

700
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
to support the negative side than the
 

701
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,759
to support the negative side than the
positive side it's always easier to

702
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:55,769
positive side it's always easier to
 

703
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:58,850
positive side it's always easier to
destroy than create and you know less

704
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:58,860
destroy than create and you know less
 

705
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,160
destroy than create and you know less
than in a physical sense and more just

706
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,170
than in a physical sense and more just
 

707
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,139
than in a physical sense and more just
in an intellectual sense right because

708
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:03,149
in an intellectual sense right because
 

709
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,329
in an intellectual sense right because
you know I think that with creating

710
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:05,339
you know I think that with creating
 

711
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:06,439
you know I think that with creating
something you need to just get a bunch

712
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:06,449
something you need to just get a bunch
 

713
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,660
something you need to just get a bunch
of things right and to destroy you just

714
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:08,670
of things right and to destroy you just
 

715
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,550
of things right and to destroy you just
need to get one thing wrong yeah and so

716
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
need to get one thing wrong yeah and so
 

717
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,050
need to get one thing wrong yeah and so
I think that that what that means is

718
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,060
I think that that what that means is
 

719
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,040
I think that that what that means is
that I think a lot of people's thinking

720
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,050
that I think a lot of people's thinking
 

721
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,990
that I think a lot of people's thinking
dead ends as soon as they see the

722
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,000
dead ends as soon as they see the
 

723
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,650
dead ends as soon as they see the
negative story but that being said I

724
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:18,660
negative story but that being said I
 

725
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,269
negative story but that being said I
actually actually have some hope right I

726
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:20,279
actually actually have some hope right I
 

727
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,059
actually actually have some hope right I
think that the the positive vision is

728
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:23,069
think that the the positive vision is
 

729
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:26,269
think that the the positive vision is
something that I think can be something

730
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:26,279
something that I think can be something
 

731
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,650
something that I think can be something
that we can we can talk about I think

732
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:27,660
that we can we can talk about I think
 

733
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,960
that we can we can talk about I think
that just simply saying this fact of

734
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:29,970
that just simply saying this fact of
 

735
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,309
that just simply saying this fact of
yeah like there's positive there's

736
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:31,319
yeah like there's positive there's
 

737
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:32,780
yeah like there's positive there's
negatives everyone likes to draw them

738
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:32,790
negatives everyone likes to draw them
 

739
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,430
negatives everyone likes to draw them
the negative people have to respond well

740
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:34,440
the negative people have to respond well
 

741
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,170
the negative people have to respond well
to that message and say huh you're right

742
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:36,180
to that message and say huh you're right
 

743
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,670
to that message and say huh you're right
there's a part of this that we're not

744
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
there's a part of this that we're not
 

745
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,319
there's a part of this that we're not
talking about not thinking about and

746
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:39,329
talking about not thinking about and
 

747
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:40,879
talking about not thinking about and
that's actually something that's that's

748
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:40,889
that's actually something that's that's
 

749
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:43,639
that's actually something that's that's
that's I think really been a key part of

750
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:43,649
that's I think really been a key part of
 

751
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:46,519
that's I think really been a key part of
how we think about AGI at open AI right

752
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:46,529
how we think about AGI at open AI right
 

753
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:47,929
how we think about AGI at open AI right
you can kind of look at it as like okay

754
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:47,939
you can kind of look at it as like okay
 

755
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:49,970
you can kind of look at it as like okay
like opening eye talks about the fact

756
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:49,980
like opening eye talks about the fact
 

757
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,439
like opening eye talks about the fact
that there are risks and yet they're

758
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:51,449
that there are risks and yet they're
 

759
00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:53,900
that there are risks and yet they're
trying to build this system like how do

760
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:53,910
trying to build this system like how do
 

761
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,329
trying to build this system like how do
you square this those two facts so do

762
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:56,339
you square this those two facts so do
 

763
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,949
you square this those two facts so do
you share the intuition that some people

764
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:57,959
you share the intuition that some people
 

765
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,220
you share the intuition that some people
have I mean from Sam Harris even Elon

766
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,230
have I mean from Sam Harris even Elon
 

767
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,269
have I mean from Sam Harris even Elon
Musk himself that it's tricky as you

768
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
Musk himself that it's tricky as you
 

769
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,670
Musk himself that it's tricky as you
develop AGI to keep it from slipping

770
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
develop AGI to keep it from slipping
 

771
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,939
develop AGI to keep it from slipping
into the existential threats into the

772
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:10,949
into the existential threats into the
 

773
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:13,120
into the existential threats into the
negative what's your intuition about how

774
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,130
negative what's your intuition about how
 

775
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,920
negative what's your intuition about how
hard is it to keep a

776
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:15,930
hard is it to keep a
 

777
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,550
hard is it to keep a
a development on the positive track and

778
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
a development on the positive track and
 

779
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,840
a development on the positive track and
you what's your intuition there to

780
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:20,850
you what's your intuition there to
 

781
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,160
you what's your intuition there to
answer the question you can really look

782
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,170
answer the question you can really look
 

783
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,380
answer the question you can really look
at how we structure open AI so we really

784
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:24,390
at how we structure open AI so we really
 

785
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,790
at how we structure open AI so we really
have three main arms

786
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:25,800
have three main arms
 

787
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,470
have three main arms
we have capabilities which is actually

788
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:27,480
we have capabilities which is actually
 

789
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,510
we have capabilities which is actually
doing the technical work and pushing

790
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:29,520
doing the technical work and pushing
 

791
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,680
doing the technical work and pushing
forward what these systems can do

792
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:30,690
forward what these systems can do
 

793
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,590
forward what these systems can do
there's safety which is working on

794
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
there's safety which is working on
 

795
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,139
there's safety which is working on
technical mechanisms to ensure that the

796
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:36,149
technical mechanisms to ensure that the
 

797
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,579
technical mechanisms to ensure that the
systems we build are lined with human

798
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:37,589
systems we build are lined with human
 

799
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,980
systems we build are lined with human
values and then there's policy which is

800
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:39,990
values and then there's policy which is
 

801
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,329
values and then there's policy which is
making sure that we have governance

802
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:41,339
making sure that we have governance
 

803
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,860
making sure that we have governance
mechanisms answering that question of

804
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:42,870
mechanisms answering that question of
 

805
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,070
mechanisms answering that question of
well whose values and so I think that

806
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,080
well whose values and so I think that
 

807
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,990
well whose values and so I think that
the technical safety one is the one that

808
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
the technical safety one is the one that
 

809
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,360
the technical safety one is the one that
people kind of talk about the most right

810
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,370
people kind of talk about the most right
 

811
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,250
people kind of talk about the most right
you talk about like think about you know

812
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:52,260
you talk about like think about you know
 

813
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,440
you talk about like think about you know
all of the dystopic AI movies a lot of

814
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:54,450
all of the dystopic AI movies a lot of
 

815
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,360
all of the dystopic AI movies a lot of
that is about not having good technical

816
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:56,370
that is about not having good technical
 

817
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,850
that is about not having good technical
safety in place and what we've been

818
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:58,860
safety in place and what we've been
 

819
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,260
safety in place and what we've been
finding is that you know I think that

820
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,270
finding is that you know I think that
 

821
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,760
finding is that you know I think that
actually a lot of people look at the

822
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:01,770
actually a lot of people look at the
 

823
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,990
actually a lot of people look at the
technical safety problem and think it's

824
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,000
technical safety problem and think it's
 

825
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,040
technical safety problem and think it's
just intractable right this question of

826
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,050
just intractable right this question of
 

827
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,389
just intractable right this question of
what do humans want how am I supposed to

828
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
what do humans want how am I supposed to
 

829
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,800
what do humans want how am I supposed to
write that down can I even write down

830
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:09,810
write that down can I even write down
 

831
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,610
write that down can I even write down
what I want no way and then they stop

832
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:13,620
what I want no way and then they stop
 

833
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,829
what I want no way and then they stop
there but the thing is we've already

834
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:15,839
there but the thing is we've already
 

835
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,800
there but the thing is we've already
built systems that are able to learn

836
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:17,810
built systems that are able to learn
 

837
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,019
built systems that are able to learn
things that humans can't specify you

838
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:21,029
things that humans can't specify you
 

839
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,880
things that humans can't specify you
know even the rules for how to recognize

840
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:22,890
know even the rules for how to recognize
 

841
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,290
know even the rules for how to recognize
if there's a cat or a dog in an image

842
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:24,300
if there's a cat or a dog in an image
 

843
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,150
if there's a cat or a dog in an image
turns out its intractable to write that

844
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
turns out its intractable to write that
 

845
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
turns out its intractable to write that
down and yet we're able to learn it and

846
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:27,930
down and yet we're able to learn it and
 

847
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,290
down and yet we're able to learn it and
that what we're seeing with systems we

848
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:30,300
that what we're seeing with systems we
 

849
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,490
that what we're seeing with systems we
build it open it yeah and there's still

850
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:31,500
build it open it yeah and there's still
 

851
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,160
build it open it yeah and there's still
an early proof of concept stage is that

852
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,170
an early proof of concept stage is that
 

853
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,260
an early proof of concept stage is that
you are able to learn human preferences

854
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,270
you are able to learn human preferences
 

855
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,610
you are able to learn human preferences
you're able to learn what humans want

856
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:37,620
you're able to learn what humans want
 

857
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,949
you're able to learn what humans want
from data and so that's kind of the core

858
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:39,959
from data and so that's kind of the core
 

859
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,690
from data and so that's kind of the core
focus for our technical safety team and

860
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:41,700
focus for our technical safety team and
 

861
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,940
focus for our technical safety team and
I think that they're actually we've had

862
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:43,950
I think that they're actually we've had
 

863
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,620
I think that they're actually we've had
some pretty encouraging updates in terms

864
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:45,630
some pretty encouraging updates in terms
 

865
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,140
some pretty encouraging updates in terms
of what we've been able to make work so

866
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,150
of what we've been able to make work so
 

867
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,940
of what we've been able to make work so
you have an intuition and a hope that

868
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:49,950
you have an intuition and a hope that
 

869
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,760
you have an intuition and a hope that
from data you know looking at the value

870
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:52,770
from data you know looking at the value
 

871
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,949
from data you know looking at the value
alignment problem from data we can build

872
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
alignment problem from data we can build
 

873
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,190
alignment problem from data we can build
systems that align with the collective

874
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:58,200
systems that align with the collective
 

875
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,190
systems that align with the collective
better angels of our nature so aligned

876
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:01,200
better angels of our nature so aligned
 

877
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,130
better angels of our nature so aligned
with the ethics and the morals of human

878
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:04,140
with the ethics and the morals of human
 

879
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,569
with the ethics and the morals of human
beings to even say this in a different

880
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:05,579
beings to even say this in a different
 

881
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,519
beings to even say this in a different
way I mean think about how do we align

882
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:07,529
way I mean think about how do we align
 

883
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:09,500
way I mean think about how do we align
in humans right think about like a human

884
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:09,510
in humans right think about like a human
 

885
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,780
in humans right think about like a human
baby can grow up to be an evil person or

886
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:11,790
baby can grow up to be an evil person or
 

887
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,060
baby can grow up to be an evil person or
a great person and a lot of that is from

888
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,070
a great person and a lot of that is from
 

889
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,920
a great person and a lot of that is from
learning from data right that you have

890
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:15,930
learning from data right that you have
 

891
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,389
learning from data right that you have
some feedback as a child is growing up

892
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:17,399
some feedback as a child is growing up
 

893
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,400
some feedback as a child is growing up
they get to see positive examples and so

894
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,410
they get to see positive examples and so
 

895
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,100
they get to see positive examples and so
I think that that just like them that

896
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,110
I think that that just like them that
 

897
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,750
I think that that just like them that
the the only example we have of a

898
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
the the only example we have of a
 

899
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,449
the the only example we have of a
general intelligence that is able to

900
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:26,459
general intelligence that is able to
 

901
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,610
general intelligence that is able to
learn from data I too

902
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:28,620
learn from data I too
 

903
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,110
learn from data I too
aligned with human values and to learn

904
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,120
aligned with human values and to learn
 

905
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,420
aligned with human values and to learn
values I think we shouldn't be surprised

906
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,430
values I think we shouldn't be surprised
 

907
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,900
values I think we shouldn't be surprised
that we can do the same sorts of

908
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:34,910
that we can do the same sorts of
 

909
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,770
that we can do the same sorts of
techniques or whether the same sort of

910
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:36,780
techniques or whether the same sort of
 

911
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,110
techniques or whether the same sort of
techniques end up being how we we saw

912
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
techniques end up being how we we saw
 

913
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,540
techniques end up being how we we saw
value alignment for AG eyes so let's go

914
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:41,550
value alignment for AG eyes so let's go
 

915
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,070
value alignment for AG eyes so let's go
even higher as I don't know if you've

916
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,080
even higher as I don't know if you've
 

917
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,770
even higher as I don't know if you've
read the book sapiens mm-hmm but there's

918
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:45,780
read the book sapiens mm-hmm but there's
 

919
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,590
read the book sapiens mm-hmm but there's
an idea that you know that as a

920
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:48,600
an idea that you know that as a
 

921
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,210
an idea that you know that as a
collective is us human beings who kind

922
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:50,220
collective is us human beings who kind
 

923
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,080
collective is us human beings who kind
of develop together and ideas that we

924
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,090
of develop together and ideas that we
 

925
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,840
of develop together and ideas that we
hold there's no in that context

926
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:56,850
hold there's no in that context
 

927
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,580
hold there's no in that context
objective truth we just kind of all

928
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:58,590
objective truth we just kind of all
 

929
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,500
objective truth we just kind of all
agree to certain ideas and hold them as

930
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:00,510
agree to certain ideas and hold them as
 

931
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,360
agree to certain ideas and hold them as
a collective if you have a sense that

932
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:02,370
a collective if you have a sense that
 

933
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,520
a collective if you have a sense that
there is in the world of good and evil

934
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:04,530
there is in the world of good and evil
 

935
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,650
there is in the world of good and evil
do you have a sense that to the first

936
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:06,660
do you have a sense that to the first
 

937
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,600
do you have a sense that to the first
approximation there are some things that

938
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:08,610
approximation there are some things that
 

939
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,090
approximation there are some things that
are good and that you could teach

940
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,100
are good and that you could teach
 

941
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,110
are good and that you could teach
systems to behave to be good so I think

942
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
systems to behave to be good so I think
 

943
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,780
systems to behave to be good so I think
that this actually blends into our third

944
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:17,790
that this actually blends into our third
 

945
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,580
that this actually blends into our third
team right which is the policy team and

946
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:19,590
team right which is the policy team and
 

947
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,070
team right which is the policy team and
this is the one the the aspect I think

948
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,080
this is the one the the aspect I think
 

949
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,930
this is the one the the aspect I think
people really talk about way less than

950
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:23,940
people really talk about way less than
 

951
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,670
people really talk about way less than
they should all right because imagine

952
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
they should all right because imagine
 

953
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,320
they should all right because imagine
that we built super-powerful systems

954
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,330
that we built super-powerful systems
 

955
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,240
that we built super-powerful systems
that we've managed to figure out all the

956
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,250
that we've managed to figure out all the
 

957
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,620
that we've managed to figure out all the
mechanisms for these things to do

958
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:30,630
mechanisms for these things to do
 

959
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,050
mechanisms for these things to do
whatever the operator wants the most

960
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,060
whatever the operator wants the most
 

961
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,820
whatever the operator wants the most
important question becomes who's the

962
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:34,830
important question becomes who's the
 

963
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,430
important question becomes who's the
operator what do they want and how is

964
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
operator what do they want and how is
 

965
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,230
operator what do they want and how is
that going to affect everyone else right

966
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:39,240
that going to affect everyone else right
 

967
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,420
that going to affect everyone else right
and and I think that this question of

968
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:41,430
and and I think that this question of
 

969
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,910
and and I think that this question of
what is good what are those values I

970
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
what is good what are those values I
 

971
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,890
what is good what are those values I
mean I think you don't even have to go

972
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:45,900
mean I think you don't even have to go
 

973
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,630
mean I think you don't even have to go
to those those very grand existential

974
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:47,640
to those those very grand existential
 

975
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,210
to those those very grand existential
places to start to realize how hard this

976
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:50,220
places to start to realize how hard this
 

977
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,400
places to start to realize how hard this
problem is you just look at different

978
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:52,410
problem is you just look at different
 

979
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,720
problem is you just look at different
countries and cultures across the world

980
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:53,730
countries and cultures across the world
 

981
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,270
countries and cultures across the world
and that there's there's a very

982
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:56,280
and that there's there's a very
 

983
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,920
and that there's there's a very
different conception of how the world

984
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:57,930
different conception of how the world
 

985
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,650
different conception of how the world
works and you know what what what kinds

986
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:00,660
works and you know what what what kinds
 

987
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,990
works and you know what what what kinds
of of ways that society wants to operate

988
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,000
of of ways that society wants to operate
 

989
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,050
of of ways that society wants to operate
and so I think that the really core

990
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,060
and so I think that the really core
 

991
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,170
and so I think that the really core
question is is is actually very concrete

992
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,180
question is is is actually very concrete
 

993
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,970
question is is is actually very concrete
um and I think it's not a question that

994
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:10,980
um and I think it's not a question that
 

995
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,130
um and I think it's not a question that
we have ready answers to right is how do

996
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,140
we have ready answers to right is how do
 

997
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,100
we have ready answers to right is how do
you have a world where all the different

998
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,110
you have a world where all the different
 

999
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,780
you have a world where all the different
countries that we have United States

1000
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:17,790
countries that we have United States
 

1001
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,530
countries that we have United States
China Russia and you know the hundreds

1002
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:21,540
China Russia and you know the hundreds
 

1003
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,360
China Russia and you know the hundreds
of other countries out there are able to

1004
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,370
of other countries out there are able to
 

1005
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,990
of other countries out there are able to
continue to not just operate in the way

1006
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,000
continue to not just operate in the way
 

1007
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,320
continue to not just operate in the way
that they see fit but in that the world

1008
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:30,330
that they see fit but in that the world
 

1009
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,260
that they see fit but in that the world
that emerges in these where you have

1010
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,270
that emerges in these where you have
 

1011
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,470
that emerges in these where you have
these very powerful systems I operating

1012
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
these very powerful systems I operating
 

1013
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,360
these very powerful systems I operating
alongside humans ends up being something

1014
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,370
alongside humans ends up being something
 

1015
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,220
alongside humans ends up being something
that empowers humans more that makes

1016
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,230
that empowers humans more that makes
 

1017
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,380
that empowers humans more that makes
like exhuming existence

1018
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,390
like exhuming existence
 

1019
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,930
like exhuming existence
be a more meaningful thing and the

1020
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:44,940
be a more meaningful thing and the
 

1021
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,390
be a more meaningful thing and the
people are happier in wealthier and able

1022
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,400
people are happier in wealthier and able
 

1023
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,220
people are happier in wealthier and able
to live more fulfilling lives it's not

1024
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,230
to live more fulfilling lives it's not
 

1025
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,660
to live more fulfilling lives it's not
nob vyas thing for how to design that

1026
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:50,670
nob vyas thing for how to design that
 

1027
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,730
nob vyas thing for how to design that
world once you have that very powerful

1028
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:52,740
world once you have that very powerful
 

1029
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,430
world once you have that very powerful
system so if we take a little step back

1030
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
system so if we take a little step back
 

1031
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,170
system so if we take a little step back
and we're having it like a fascinating

1032
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:57,180
and we're having it like a fascinating
 

1033
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,810
and we're having it like a fascinating
conversation and open eyes in many ways

1034
00:17:59,810 --> 00:17:59,820
conversation and open eyes in many ways
 

1035
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,540
conversation and open eyes in many ways
a tech leader in the world and yet we're

1036
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:02,550
a tech leader in the world and yet we're
 

1037
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,270
a tech leader in the world and yet we're
thinking about these big existential

1038
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,280
thinking about these big existential
 

1039
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,440
thinking about these big existential
questions which is fascinating really

1040
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:06,450
questions which is fascinating really
 

1041
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,450
questions which is fascinating really
important I think you're a leader in

1042
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:08,460
important I think you're a leader in
 

1043
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,040
important I think you're a leader in
that space and it's a really important

1044
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,050
that space and it's a really important
 

1045
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,410
that space and it's a really important
space of just thinking how AI affect

1046
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:12,420
space of just thinking how AI affect
 

1047
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,080
space of just thinking how AI affect
society in a big-picture view so Oscar

1048
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,090
society in a big-picture view so Oscar
 

1049
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,450
society in a big-picture view so Oscar
Wilde said we're all in the gutter but

1050
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:17,460
Wilde said we're all in the gutter but
 

1051
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,100
Wilde said we're all in the gutter but
some of us are looking at the Stars and

1052
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,110
some of us are looking at the Stars and
 

1053
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,400
some of us are looking at the Stars and
I think open air has a charter that

1054
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,410
I think open air has a charter that
 

1055
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,100
I think open air has a charter that
looks to the Stars I would say to create

1056
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,110
looks to the Stars I would say to create
 

1057
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,330
looks to the Stars I would say to create
intelligence to create general

1058
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:26,340
intelligence to create general
 

1059
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
intelligence to create general
intelligence make it beneficial safe and

1060
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:28,350
intelligence make it beneficial safe and
 

1061
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,420
intelligence make it beneficial safe and
collaborative so can you tell me how

1062
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:32,430
collaborative so can you tell me how
 

1063
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,910
collaborative so can you tell me how
that came about how a mission like that

1064
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:34,920
that came about how a mission like that
 

1065
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,220
that came about how a mission like that
and the path to creating a mission like

1066
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,230
and the path to creating a mission like
 

1067
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,770
and the path to creating a mission like
that open yeah I was founded yeah so I

1068
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:39,780
that open yeah I was founded yeah so I
 

1069
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,470
that open yeah I was founded yeah so I
think that in some ways it really boils

1070
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
think that in some ways it really boils
 

1071
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,360
think that in some ways it really boils
down to taking a look at the landscape

1072
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:44,370
down to taking a look at the landscape
 

1073
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,800
down to taking a look at the landscape
alright so if you think about the

1074
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:45,810
alright so if you think about the
 

1075
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,870
alright so if you think about the
history of AI that basically for the

1076
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:47,880
history of AI that basically for the
 

1077
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,780
history of AI that basically for the
past 60 or 70 years people have thought

1078
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:50,790
past 60 or 70 years people have thought
 

1079
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,700
past 60 or 70 years people have thought
about this goal of what could happen if

1080
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:52,710
about this goal of what could happen if
 

1081
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,040
about this goal of what could happen if
you could automate human intellectual

1082
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,050
you could automate human intellectual
 

1083
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,620
you could automate human intellectual
labor right imagine you can build a

1084
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:57,630
labor right imagine you can build a
 

1085
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,790
labor right imagine you can build a
computer system that could do that

1086
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:58,800
computer system that could do that
 

1087
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,100
computer system that could do that
what becomes possible well out of sci-fi

1088
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,110
what becomes possible well out of sci-fi
 

1089
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,230
what becomes possible well out of sci-fi
that tells stories of various dystopian

1090
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,240
that tells stories of various dystopian
 

1091
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,670
that tells stories of various dystopian
and you know increasingly you have

1092
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:04,680
and you know increasingly you have
 

1093
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,840
and you know increasingly you have
movies like heard that tell you a little

1094
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:05,850
movies like heard that tell you a little
 

1095
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,340
movies like heard that tell you a little
bit about maybe more of a little bit

1096
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:07,350
bit about maybe more of a little bit
 

1097
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,780
bit about maybe more of a little bit
utopic vision I you think about the

1098
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:10,790
utopic vision I you think about the
 

1099
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,460
utopic vision I you think about the
impacts that we've seen from being able

1100
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:13,470
impacts that we've seen from being able
 

1101
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,400
impacts that we've seen from being able
to have bicycles for our minds and

1102
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,410
to have bicycles for our minds and
 

1103
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,550
to have bicycles for our minds and
computers and that I think that the the

1104
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:19,560
computers and that I think that the the
 

1105
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,650
computers and that I think that the the
impact of computers and the Internet has

1106
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:21,660
impact of computers and the Internet has
 

1107
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,620
impact of computers and the Internet has
just far outstripped what anyone really

1108
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:24,630
just far outstripped what anyone really
 

1109
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,720
just far outstripped what anyone really
could have predicted and so I think that

1110
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:26,730
could have predicted and so I think that
 

1111
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,520
could have predicted and so I think that
it's very clear that if you can build an

1112
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:28,530
it's very clear that if you can build an
 

1113
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,980
it's very clear that if you can build an
AI it will be the most transformative

1114
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:30,990
AI it will be the most transformative
 

1115
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,600
AI it will be the most transformative
technology that humans will ever create

1116
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:32,610
technology that humans will ever create
 

1117
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,930
technology that humans will ever create
and so what it boils down to then is a

1118
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:35,940
and so what it boils down to then is a
 

1119
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,660
and so what it boils down to then is a
question of well is there a path is

1120
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:38,670
question of well is there a path is
 

1121
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,580
question of well is there a path is
there hope is there a way to build such

1122
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:40,590
there hope is there a way to build such
 

1123
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,980
there hope is there a way to build such
a system and I think that for 60 or 70

1124
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:42,990
a system and I think that for 60 or 70
 

1125
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,310
a system and I think that for 60 or 70
years that people got excited and I they

1126
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
years that people got excited and I they
 

1127
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,080
years that people got excited and I they
you know ended up not being able to

1128
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,090
you know ended up not being able to
 

1129
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,510
you know ended up not being able to
deliver on the hopes that the people I

1130
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:50,520
deliver on the hopes that the people I
 

1131
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,240
deliver on the hopes that the people I
pinned on them and I think that then you

1132
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,250
pinned on them and I think that then you
 

1133
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,800
pinned on them and I think that then you
know that after you know two to winters

1134
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:54,810
know that after you know two to winters
 

1135
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,150
know that after you know two to winters
of AI development

1136
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
of AI development
 

1137
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,010
of AI development
that people I you know I think kind of

1138
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,020
that people I you know I think kind of
 

1139
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,620
that people I you know I think kind of
almost stopped daring to dream right the

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:00,630
almost stopped daring to dream right the
 

1141
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,270
almost stopped daring to dream right the
really talking about a GI or thinking

1142
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,280
really talking about a GI or thinking
 

1143
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,850
really talking about a GI or thinking
about a GI became almost this taboo in

1144
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:04,860
about a GI became almost this taboo in
 

1145
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,310
about a GI became almost this taboo in
the community but I actually think that

1146
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:07,320
the community but I actually think that
 

1147
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,380
the community but I actually think that
people took the wrong lesson from AI

1148
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,390
people took the wrong lesson from AI
 

1149
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,510
people took the wrong lesson from AI
history and if you look back starting in

1150
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
history and if you look back starting in
 

1151
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,800
history and if you look back starting in
nineteen fifty nine is when the

1152
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:12,810
nineteen fifty nine is when the
 

1153
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,600
nineteen fifty nine is when the
perceptron was released and this is

1154
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:14,610
perceptron was released and this is
 

1155
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,280
perceptron was released and this is
basically you know one of the earliest

1156
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,290
basically you know one of the earliest
 

1157
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,470
basically you know one of the earliest
neural networks it was released to what

1159
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,420

was perceived as this massive overhype

1160
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:20,430
was perceived as this massive overhype
 

1161
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,920
was perceived as this massive overhype
so in the New York Times in nineteen

1162
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:21,930
so in the New York Times in nineteen
 

1163
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,020
so in the New York Times in nineteen
fifty-nine you have this article saying

fifty-nine you have this article saying
 

1165
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,540
fifty-nine you have this article saying
that you know the the perceptron will

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,330
languages and people at the time looked
 

1173
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,850
languages and people at the time looked
at this and said this is Jack your

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:34,860
at this and said this is Jack your
 

1175
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,050

system can't do any of that and

1176
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:36,060
system can't do any of that and
 

1177
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,490
system can't do any of that and
basically spent ten years trying to

1178
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:37,500
basically spent ten years trying to
 

1179
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,170
basically spent ten years trying to
discredit the whole perceptron direction

1180
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:39,180
discredit the whole perceptron direction
 

1181
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,510
discredit the whole perceptron direction
and succeeded and all the funding dried

1182
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,520
and succeeded and all the funding dried
 

1183
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,090
and succeeded and all the funding dried
up and you know people kind of went in

1184
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,100
up and you know people kind of went in
 

1185
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,890
up and you know people kind of went in
other directions and you know the 80s

1186
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:45,900
other directions and you know the 80s
 

1187
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,420
other directions and you know the 80s
there was a resurgence and I'd always

1188
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:47,430
there was a resurgence and I'd always
 

1189
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,430
there was a resurgence and I'd always
heard that the resurgence in the 80s was

1190
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
heard that the resurgence in the 80s was
 

1191
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,320
heard that the resurgence in the 80s was
due to the invention of back propagation

1192
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,330
due to the invention of back propagation
 

1193
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,670
due to the invention of back propagation
and these these algorithms that got

1194
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:52,680
and these these algorithms that got
 

1195
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,200
and these these algorithms that got
people excited but actually the

1196
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:54,210
people excited but actually the
 

1197
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,970
people excited but actually the
causality was due to people building

1198
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:55,980
causality was due to people building
 

1199
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,010
causality was due to people building
larger computers that you can find these

1200
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,020
larger computers that you can find these
 

1201
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,390
larger computers that you can find these
these articles from the 80s saying that

1202
00:20:59,390 --> 00:20:59,400
these articles from the 80s saying that
 

1203
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,970
these articles from the 80s saying that
the democratization of computing power

1204
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:00,980
the democratization of computing power
 

1205
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,750
the democratization of computing power
suddenly meant that you could run these

1206
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:02,760
suddenly meant that you could run these
 

1207
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,490
suddenly meant that you could run these
larger neural networks and then people

1208
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:04,500
larger neural networks and then people
 

1209
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,290
larger neural networks and then people
start to do all these amazing things the

1210
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:06,300
start to do all these amazing things the
 

1211
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,820
start to do all these amazing things the
backpropagation algorithm was invented

1212
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:07,830
backpropagation algorithm was invented
 

1213
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,500
backpropagation algorithm was invented
and you know that the the neural nets

1214
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:09,510
and you know that the the neural nets
 

1215
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,730
and you know that the the neural nets
people running were these tiny little

1216
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:10,740
people running were these tiny little
 

1217
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,160
people running were these tiny little
like 20 neuron neural nets right what

1218
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,170
like 20 neuron neural nets right what
 

1219
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,090
like 20 neuron neural nets right what
are you supposed to learn with 20

1220
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,100
are you supposed to learn with 20
 

1221
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,180
are you supposed to learn with 20
neurons and so of course they weren't

1222
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,190
neurons and so of course they weren't
 

1223
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,010
neurons and so of course they weren't
able to get great results and it really

1224
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,020
able to get great results and it really
 

1225
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,800
able to get great results and it really
wasn't until 2012 that this approach

1226
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:21,810
wasn't until 2012 that this approach
 

1227
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,780
wasn't until 2012 that this approach
that's almost the most simple natural

1228
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:23,790
that's almost the most simple natural
 

1229
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,400
that's almost the most simple natural
approach that people have come up with

1230
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,410
approach that people have come up with
 

1231
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,340
approach that people have come up with
in the 50s right in some ways even in

1232
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:28,350
in the 50s right in some ways even in
 

1233
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,440
in the 50s right in some ways even in
the 40s before there were computers with

1234
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:30,450
the 40s before there were computers with
 

1235
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,530
the 40s before there were computers with
a Pitts McCullen air and neuron suddenly

this became the best way of solving
 

1239
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,880
this became the best way of solving

00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:37,890
problems right and I think there are
 

1241
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,280

three core properties that deep learning
 

1243
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,100
three core properties that deep learning
has that I think are very worth paying

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,110
has that I think are very worth paying

00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,249
now it doesn't just mean that if we

00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,519
have answers for reasoning but I think
that the core here is that for the first

that the core here is that for the first

so much right and you start thinking

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,049
so much right and you start thinking
 

1331
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,080
so much right and you start thinking
about just like how do you have a world

1332
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,090
about just like how do you have a world
 

1333
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,940
about just like how do you have a world
where this goes well and that you need

1334
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:16,950
where this goes well and that you need
 

1335
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,289
where this goes well and that you need
to think about the practicalities of how

1336
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:18,299
to think about the practicalities of how
 

1337
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,789
to think about the practicalities of how
do you build an organization and get

1338
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:19,799
do you build an organization and get
 

1339
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,430
do you build an organization and get
together a bunch of people and resources

1340
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
together a bunch of people and resources
 

1341
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,070
together a bunch of people and resources
and to make sure that people feel

1342
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,080
and to make sure that people feel
 

1343
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,090
and to make sure that people feel
motivated and ready to do it but I think

1344
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:29,100
motivated and ready to do it but I think
 

1345
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,860
motivated and ready to do it but I think
that then you start thinking about well

1346
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:30,870
that then you start thinking about well
 

1347
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,899
that then you start thinking about well
what if we succeed and how do we make

1348
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:32,909
what if we succeed and how do we make
 

1349
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,669
what if we succeed and how do we make
sure that when we succeed that the world

1350
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:34,679
sure that when we succeed that the world
 

1351
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,560
sure that when we succeed that the world
is actually the place that we want

1352
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:36,570
is actually the place that we want
 

1353
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:39,019
is actually the place that we want
ourselves to exist then and almost in

1354
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:39,029
ourselves to exist then and almost in

00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,269

try to do our best to make sure it's
 

1369
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:58,249
try to do our best to make sure it's
going to go well and then we spent the

1370
00:23:58,249 --> 00:23:58,259
going to go well and then we spent the
 

1371
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:59,869
going to go well and then we spent the
next couple years really trying to

1372
00:23:59,869 --> 00:23:59,879
next couple years really trying to
 

1373
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,129
next couple years really trying to
figure out what does that mean how do we

1374
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:01,139
figure out what does that mean how do we
 

1375
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:01,700
figure out what does that mean how do we
do it

1376
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:01,710
do it
 

1377
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,649
do it
and you know I think that typically with

1378
00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:03,659
and you know I think that typically with
 

1379
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,399
and you know I think that typically with
a company you start out very small so

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:07,409
a company you start out very small so
 

1381
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,600
a company you start out very small so

some money you hire people you scale and
 

1391
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,090
some money you hire people you scale and
then you know down the road then the big

1392
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:17,100
then you know down the road then the big
 

1393
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,350
then you know down the road then the big

but just even creating intelligence is a
 

1423
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:56,520
but just even creating intelligence is a
much needed refreshing catalyst for the

1424
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,530
much needed refreshing catalyst for the
 

1425
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,170
much needed refreshing catalyst for the
AI community so that's that's the

1426
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,180
AI community so that's that's the
 

1427
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,800
AI community so that's that's the
starting point

1428
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:58,810
starting point
 

1429
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,130
starting point
okay so then formation of open AI was

1430
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,140
okay so then formation of open AI was
 

1431
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,990
okay so then formation of open AI was
just I just say that you know when we

1432
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
just I just say that you know when we
 

1433
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,420
just I just say that you know when we
were starting opening AI that kind of

1434
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:06,430
were starting opening AI that kind of
 

1435
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,980
were starting opening AI that kind of
the first question that we had is is it

1436
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:07,990
the first question that we had is is it
 

1437
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,770
the first question that we had is is it
too late to start a lab with a bunch of

1438
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:10,780
too late to start a lab with a bunch of
 

1439
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,620
too late to start a lab with a bunch of
the best people possible that was an

1440
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:13,630
the best people possible that was an
 

1441
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,480
the best people possible that was an
actual question so those were those that

1442
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:15,490
actual question so those were those that
 

1443
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,400
actual question so those were those that
was the core question of you know hey

1444
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,410
was the core question of you know hey
 

1445
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,350
was the core question of you know hey
there's dinner in July of 20 2015

1446
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:19,360
there's dinner in July of 20 2015
 

1447
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,520
there's dinner in July of 20 2015
and there's that was that was really

1448
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:20,530
and there's that was that was really
 

1449
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,360
and there's that was that was really
what we spent the whole time talking

1450
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,370
what we spent the whole time talking
 

1451
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,050
what we spent the whole time talking
about and you know cuz it's the you

1452
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,060
about and you know cuz it's the you
 

1453
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,970
about and you know cuz it's the you
think about kind of where AI was is that

1454
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:26,980
think about kind of where AI was is that
 

1455
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,950
think about kind of where AI was is that
it transitioned from being an academic

1456
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:28,960
it transitioned from being an academic
 

1457
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,490
it transitioned from being an academic
pursuit to an industrial pursuit and so

1458
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:32,500
pursuit to an industrial pursuit and so
 

1459
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,780
pursuit to an industrial pursuit and so
a lot of the best people were in these

1460
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:33,790
a lot of the best people were in these
 

1461
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,000
a lot of the best people were in these
big research labs and that we wanted to

1462
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,010
big research labs and that we wanted to
 

1463
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,770
big research labs and that we wanted to
start our own one that you know no

1464
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:37,780
start our own one that you know no
 

1465
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,540
start our own one that you know no
matter how much resources we could

1466
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:39,550
matter how much resources we could
 

1467
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,850
matter how much resources we could
accumulate it would be you know pale in

1468
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:41,860
accumulate it would be you know pale in
 

1469
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,620
accumulate it would be you know pale in
comparison to the big tech companies and

1470
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:43,630
comparison to the big tech companies and
 

1471
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,720
comparison to the big tech companies and
we knew that and there's a question of

1472
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:45,730
we knew that and there's a question of
 

1473
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,460
we knew that and there's a question of
are we going to be actually able to get

1474
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:47,470
are we going to be actually able to get
 

1475
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,960
are we going to be actually able to get
this thing off the ground you need

1476
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:48,970
this thing off the ground you need
 

1477
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,730
this thing off the ground you need
critical mass you can't just do you and

1478
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:50,740
critical mass you can't just do you and
 

1479
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,200
critical mass you can't just do you and
a co-founder build a product right you

1480
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,210
a co-founder build a product right you
 

1481
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,090
a co-founder build a product right you
really need to have a group of you know

1482
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,100
really need to have a group of you know
 

1483
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,450
really need to have a group of you know
five to ten people and we kind of

1484
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:57,460
five to ten people and we kind of
 

1485
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,800
five to ten people and we kind of
concluded it wasn't obviously impossible

1486
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:58,810
concluded it wasn't obviously impossible
 

1487
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,610
concluded it wasn't obviously impossible
so it seemed worth trying well you're

1488
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:02,620
so it seemed worth trying well you're
 

1489
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,980
so it seemed worth trying well you're
also dreamers so who knows right that's

1490
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:04,990
also dreamers so who knows right that's
 

1491
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,220
also dreamers so who knows right that's
right okay so speaking of that competing

1492
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,230
right okay so speaking of that competing
 

1493
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,850
right okay so speaking of that competing

about some of the some of the tricky
 

1497
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,600
about some of the some of the tricky
things as you think through this process

1498
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:15,610
things as you think through this process
 

1499
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,140
things as you think through this process
of growing of seeing how you can develop

1500
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,150
of growing of seeing how you can develop
 

1501
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,450
of growing of seeing how you can develop
these systems a task at scale that

1502
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:21,460
these systems a task at scale that
 

1503
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:24,210
these systems a task at scale that
competes so you recently recently formed

1504
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,220
competes so you recently recently formed

vehicle is trying to accomplish the
 

1527
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,749
vehicle is trying to accomplish the
mission of ensuring that artificial

general intelligence benefits everyone

1530
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:58,109
general intelligence benefits everyone
 

1531
00:26:58,109 --> 00:26:59,930
general intelligence benefits everyone
and the main way that we're trying to do

1532
00:26:59,930 --> 00:26:59,940
and the main way that we're trying to do
 

1533
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,369
and the main way that we're trying to do
that is by actually trying to build

1534
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:01,379
that is by actually trying to build
 

1535
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:03,440
that is by actually trying to build
general intelligence ourselves and make

1536
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:03,450
general intelligence ourselves and make
 

1537
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,820
general intelligence ourselves and make
sure the benefits are distributed to the

1538
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:04,830
sure the benefits are distributed to the
 

1539
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,519
sure the benefits are distributed to the
world that's the primary way we're also

1540
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:07,529
world that's the primary way we're also
 

1541
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:09,440
world that's the primary way we're also
fine if someone else does this all right

1542
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,450
fine if someone else does this all right
 

1543
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,999
fine if someone else does this all right
it doesn't have to be us if someone else

1544
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:11,009
it doesn't have to be us if someone else
 

1545
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,129
it doesn't have to be us if someone else
is going to build an AGI and make sure

1546
00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:13,139
is going to build an AGI and make sure
 

1547
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:14,869
is going to build an AGI and make sure
that the benefits don't get locked up in

1548
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:14,879
that the benefits don't get locked up in
 

1549
00:27:14,879 --> 00:27:16,940
that the benefits don't get locked up in
one company or you know one one want

1550
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:16,950
one company or you know one one want
 

1551
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,609
one company or you know one one want
with one set of people like we're

1552
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:19,619
with one set of people like we're
 

1553
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,190
with one set of people like we're
actually fine with that and so those

1554
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:22,200
actually fine with that and so those
 

1555
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,489
actually fine with that and so those
ideas are baked into our Charter which

1556
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:25,499
ideas are baked into our Charter which
 

1557
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:28,070
ideas are baked into our Charter which
is kind of the the foundational document

1558
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,080
is kind of the the foundational document
 

1559
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,440
is kind of the the foundational document
that are describes kind of our values

1560
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:30,450
that are describes kind of our values
 

1561
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,019
that are describes kind of our values
and how we operate

1562
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:32,029
and how we operate
 

1563
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:34,339
and how we operate
but it's also really baked into the

1564
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:34,349
but it's also really baked into the
 

1565
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:36,709
but it's also really baked into the
structure of open at LP and so the way

1566
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:36,719
structure of open at LP and so the way
 

1567
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:39,200
structure of open at LP and so the way
that we've set up opening ILP is that in

1568
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,210
that we've set up opening ILP is that in
 

1569
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,320
that we've set up opening ILP is that in
the case where we succeed right if we

1570
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,330
the case where we succeed right if we
 

1571
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,639
the case where we succeed right if we
actually build what we're trying to

1572
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:43,649
actually build what we're trying to
 

1573
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:46,609
actually build what we're trying to
build then investors are able to get a

1574
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:46,619
build then investors are able to get a
 

1575
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:49,279
build then investors are able to get a
return and but that return is something

1576
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:49,289
return and but that return is something
 

1577
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:51,169
return and but that return is something
that is capped and so if you think of

1578
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:51,179
that is capped and so if you think of
 

1579
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,119
that is capped and so if you think of
AGI in terms of data the value that you

1580
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:53,129
AGI in terms of data the value that you
 

1581
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,680
AGI in terms of data the value that you
could really create you're talking about

1582
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:54,690
could really create you're talking about
 

1583
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,419
could really create you're talking about
the most transformative technology ever

1584
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:56,429
the most transformative technology ever
 

1585
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:58,339
the most transformative technology ever
created it's going to create orders of

1586
00:27:58,339 --> 00:27:58,349
created it's going to create orders of
 

1587
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,499
created it's going to create orders of
magnitude more value than any existing

1588
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:00,509
magnitude more value than any existing
 

1589
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:03,919
magnitude more value than any existing
company and that all of that value will

1590
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:03,929
company and that all of that value will
 

1591
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:06,769
company and that all of that value will
be owned by the world like legally title

1592
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:06,779
be owned by the world like legally title
 

1593
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,719
be owned by the world like legally title
to the nonprofit to fulfill that mission

1594
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:08,729
to the nonprofit to fulfill that mission
 

1595
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,889
to the nonprofit to fulfill that mission
and so that's that's the structure so

1596
00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:12,899
and so that's that's the structure so
 

1597
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,639
and so that's that's the structure so
the mission is a powerful one and it's a

1598
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:15,649
the mission is a powerful one and it's a
 

1599
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:17,930
the mission is a powerful one and it's a
it's one that I think most people would

1600
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:17,940
it's one that I think most people would
 

1601
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,869
it's one that I think most people would
agree with it's how we would hope a I

1602
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:20,879
agree with it's how we would hope a I
 

1603
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:24,169
agree with it's how we would hope a I
progresses and so how do you tie

1604
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:24,179
progresses and so how do you tie
 

1605
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:25,879
progresses and so how do you tie
yourself to that mission how do you make

1606
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:25,889
yourself to that mission how do you make
 

1607
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:28,009
yourself to that mission how do you make
sure you do not deviate from that

1608
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:28,019
sure you do not deviate from that
 

1609
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,329
sure you do not deviate from that
mission that you know other incentives

1610
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:32,339
mission that you know other incentives
 

1611
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:35,479
mission that you know other incentives
that are profit driven wouldn't don't

1612
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:35,489
that are profit driven wouldn't don't
 

1613
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:37,430
that are profit driven wouldn't don't
interfere with the mission so this was

1614
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
interfere with the mission so this was
 

1615
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,109
interfere with the mission so this was
actually a really core question for us

1616
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:39,119
actually a really core question for us
 

1617
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,690
actually a really core question for us
for the past couple years because you

1618
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:41,700
for the past couple years because you
 

1619
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,799
for the past couple years because you
know I'd say that like the way that our

1620
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:42,809
know I'd say that like the way that our
 

1621
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:44,899
know I'd say that like the way that our
history went was that for the first year

1622
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:44,909
history went was that for the first year
 

1623
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:46,279
history went was that for the first year
we were getting off the ground right we

1624
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:46,289
we were getting off the ground right we
 

1625
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:48,109
we were getting off the ground right we
had this high level picture but we

1626
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:48,119
had this high level picture but we
 

1627
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:48,950
had this high level picture but we
didn't know

1628
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
didn't know
 

1629
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,200
didn't know
exactly how we wanted to accomplish it

1630
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,210
exactly how we wanted to accomplish it
 

1631
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,720
exactly how we wanted to accomplish it
and really two years ago it's when we

1632
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:53,730
and really two years ago it's when we
 

1633
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,400
and really two years ago it's when we
first started realizing in order to

1634
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,410
first started realizing in order to
 

1635
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,230
first started realizing in order to
build a GI we're just going to need to

1636
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:57,240
build a GI we're just going to need to
 

1637
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,270
build a GI we're just going to need to
raise way more money than we can as a

1638
00:28:59,270 --> 00:28:59,280
raise way more money than we can as a
 

1639
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,220
raise way more money than we can as a
nonprofit I mean you're talking many

1640
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,230
nonprofit I mean you're talking many
 

1641
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,880
nonprofit I mean you're talking many
billions of dollars and so the first

1642
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:04,890
billions of dollars and so the first
 

1643
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,440
billions of dollars and so the first
question is how are you supposed to do

1644
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:06,450
question is how are you supposed to do
 

1645
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,780
question is how are you supposed to do
that and stay true to this mission and

1646
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:08,790
that and stay true to this mission and
 

1647
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,220
that and stay true to this mission and
we looked at every legal structure out

1648
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,230
we looked at every legal structure out
 

1649
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,480
we looked at every legal structure out
there and concluded none of them were

1650
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:11,490
there and concluded none of them were
 

1651
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,460
there and concluded none of them were
quite right for what we wanted to do and

1652
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:13,470
quite right for what we wanted to do and
 

1653
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,450
quite right for what we wanted to do and
I guess it shouldn't be too surprising

1654
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:14,460
I guess it shouldn't be too surprising
 

1655
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,290
I guess it shouldn't be too surprising
if you're going to do something like

1656
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:15,300
if you're going to do something like
 

1657
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,030
if you're going to do something like
crazy unprecedented technology that

1658
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:17,040
crazy unprecedented technology that
 

1659
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,110
crazy unprecedented technology that
you're gonna have to come up with some

1660
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,120
you're gonna have to come up with some
 

1661
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,640
you're gonna have to come up with some
crazy unprecedent structure to do it in

1662
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:19,650
crazy unprecedent structure to do it in
 

1663
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,790
crazy unprecedent structure to do it in
and a lot of a lot of our conversation

1664
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:22,800
and a lot of a lot of our conversation
 

1665
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,180
and a lot of a lot of our conversation
was with people at opening I write the

1666
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,190
was with people at opening I write the
 

1667
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,440
was with people at opening I write the
people who really join because they

1668
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:27,450
people who really join because they
 

1669
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,910
people who really join because they
believe so much in this mission and

1670
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:28,920
believe so much in this mission and
 

1671
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,430
believe so much in this mission and
thinking about how do we actually raise

1672
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
thinking about how do we actually raise
 

1673
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,740
thinking about how do we actually raise
the resources to do it and also stay

1674
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:33,750
the resources to do it and also stay
 

1675
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,080
the resources to do it and also stay
true to to what we stand for and the

1676
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,090
true to to what we stand for and the
 

1677
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,580
true to to what we stand for and the
place you got to start is to really

1678
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:37,590
place you got to start is to really
 

1679
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,930
place you got to start is to really
align on what is it that we stand for

1680
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:38,940
align on what is it that we stand for
 

1681
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,700
align on what is it that we stand for
right what are those values what's

1682
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:40,710
right what are those values what's
 

1683
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,410
right what are those values what's
really important to us and so I'd say

1684
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:42,420
really important to us and so I'd say
 

1685
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,090
really important to us and so I'd say
that we spent about a year really

1686
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,100
that we spent about a year really
 

1687
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
that we spent about a year really
compiling the opening I'd charter and

1688
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,110
compiling the opening I'd charter and
 

1689
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,410
compiling the opening I'd charter and
that determines and if you even look at

1690
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:48,420
that determines and if you even look at
 

1691
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,940
that determines and if you even look at
the first the first line item in there

1692
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:49,950
the first the first line item in there
 

1693
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,530
the first the first line item in there
it says that look we expect we're gonna

1694
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:51,540
it says that look we expect we're gonna
 

1695
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,850
it says that look we expect we're gonna
have to marshal huge amounts of

1696
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:52,860
have to marshal huge amounts of
 

1697
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,070
have to marshal huge amounts of
resources but we're going to make sure

1698
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,080
resources but we're going to make sure
 

1699
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,510
resources but we're going to make sure
that we minimize conflicts of interest

1700
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:56,520
that we minimize conflicts of interest
 

1701
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,880
that we minimize conflicts of interest
with the mission and that kind of

1702
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:58,890
with the mission and that kind of
 

1703
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,160
with the mission and that kind of
aligning on all of those pieces was the

1704
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,170
aligning on all of those pieces was the
 

1705
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,370
aligning on all of those pieces was the
most important step towards figuring out

1706
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:03,380
most important step towards figuring out
 

1707
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,260
most important step towards figuring out
how do we structure a company that can

1708
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,270
how do we structure a company that can
 

1709
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,050
how do we structure a company that can
actually raise the resources to do what

1710
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,060
actually raise the resources to do what
 

1711
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,800
actually raise the resources to do what
we need to do I imagined open AI the

1712
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:12,810
we need to do I imagined open AI the
 

1713
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,290
we need to do I imagined open AI the
decision to create open ILP was a really

1714
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:15,300
decision to create open ILP was a really
 

1715
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,300
decision to create open ILP was a really
difficult one and there was a lot of

1716
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,310
difficult one and there was a lot of
 

1717
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,950
difficult one and there was a lot of
discussions as you mentioned for a year

1718
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
discussions as you mentioned for a year
 

1719
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,940
discussions as you mentioned for a year
and there was different ideas perhaps

1720
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:22,950
and there was different ideas perhaps
 

1721
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,510
and there was different ideas perhaps
detractors with an open AI sort of

1722
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:26,520
detractors with an open AI sort of
 

1723
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,980
detractors with an open AI sort of
different paths that you could have

1724
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:27,990
different paths that you could have
 

1725
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,470
different paths that you could have
taken what were those concerns what were

1726
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
taken what were those concerns what were
 

1727
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,300
taken what were those concerns what were
the different paths considered what was

1728
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,310
the different paths considered what was
 

1729
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,620
the different paths considered what was
that process of making that decision

1730
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:33,630
that process of making that decision
 

1731
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,690
that process of making that decision
like yep um but so if you look actually

1732
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:35,700
like yep um but so if you look actually
 

1733
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,910
like yep um but so if you look actually
at the opening I charter that there's

1734
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:37,920
at the opening I charter that there's
 

1735
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,220
at the opening I charter that there's
almost two paths embedded within it

1736
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:40,230
almost two paths embedded within it
 

1737
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:42,890
almost two paths embedded within it
there is we are primarily trying to

1738
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:42,900
there is we are primarily trying to
 

1739
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,830
there is we are primarily trying to
build AGI ourselves but we're also ok if

1740
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:45,840
build AGI ourselves but we're also ok if
 

1741
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,020
build AGI ourselves but we're also ok if
someone else does it and this is a weird

1742
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,030
someone else does it and this is a weird
 

1743
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,400
someone else does it and this is a weird
thing for a company it's really

1744
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,410
thing for a company it's really
 

1745
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,680
thing for a company it's really
interesting actually yeah there there is

1746
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:51,690
interesting actually yeah there there is
 

1747
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,810
interesting actually yeah there there is
an element of competition that you do

1748
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:53,820
an element of competition that you do
 

1749
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,900
an element of competition that you do
want to be the one that does it but at

1750
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:56,910
want to be the one that does it but at
 

1751
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,610
want to be the one that does it but at
the same time you're ok somebody else's

1752
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:58,620
the same time you're ok somebody else's
 

1753
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,780
the same time you're ok somebody else's
and you know we'll talk about that a

1754
00:30:59,780 --> 00:30:59,790
and you know we'll talk about that a
 

1755
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,850
and you know we'll talk about that a
little bit that trade-off that's the day

1756
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:01,860
little bit that trade-off that's the day
 

1757
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,140
little bit that trade-off that's the day
that's really interesting and I think

1758
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,150
that's really interesting and I think
 

1759
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,000
that's really interesting and I think
this was the core tension as we were

1760
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,010
this was the core tension as we were
 

1761
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,950
this was the core tension as we were
designing open an ILP and really the

1762
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:06,960
designing open an ILP and really the
 

1763
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,900
designing open an ILP and really the
opening eye strategy is how do you make

1764
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:08,910
opening eye strategy is how do you make
 

1765
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,330
opening eye strategy is how do you make
sure that both you have a shot at being

1766
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:11,340
sure that both you have a shot at being
 

1767
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,400
sure that both you have a shot at being
a primary actor which really requires

1768
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:13,410
a primary actor which really requires
 

1769
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,490
a primary actor which really requires
building an organization raising massive

1770
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:16,500
building an organization raising massive
 

1771
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,039
building an organization raising massive
resources and really having the will to

1772
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:19,049
resources and really having the will to
 

1773
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:20,750
resources and really having the will to
go and execute on some really really

1774
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:20,760
go and execute on some really really
 

1775
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,520
go and execute on some really really
hard vision all right you need to really

1776
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:22,530
hard vision all right you need to really
 

1777
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,680
hard vision all right you need to really
sign up for a long period to go and take

1778
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:24,690
sign up for a long period to go and take
 

1779
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,140
sign up for a long period to go and take
on a lot of pain and a lot of risk and

1780
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,150
on a lot of pain and a lot of risk and
 

1781
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:30,440
on a lot of pain and a lot of risk and
to do that normally you just import the

1782
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:30,450
to do that normally you just import the
 

1783
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,270
to do that normally you just import the
startup mindset right and that you think

1784
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:32,280
startup mindset right and that you think
 

1785
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,680
startup mindset right and that you think
about okay like how do we how to execute

1786
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:33,690
about okay like how do we how to execute
 

1787
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,210
about okay like how do we how to execute
everyone you give this very competitive

1788
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:35,220
everyone you give this very competitive
 

1789
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,310
everyone you give this very competitive
angle but you also have the second angle

1790
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,320
angle but you also have the second angle
 

1791
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
angle but you also have the second angle
of saying that well the true mission

1792
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:39,330
of saying that well the true mission
 

1793
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,690
of saying that well the true mission
isn't for opening high to build a GI the

1794
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:41,700
isn't for opening high to build a GI the
 

1795
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,730
isn't for opening high to build a GI the
true mission is for AGI to go well for

1796
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:43,740
true mission is for AGI to go well for
 

1797
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,760
true mission is for AGI to go well for
Humanity and so how do you take all of

1798
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:46,770
Humanity and so how do you take all of
 

1799
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,560
Humanity and so how do you take all of
those first actions and make sure you

1800
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:48,570
those first actions and make sure you
 

1801
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,560
those first actions and make sure you
don't close the door on outcomes that

1802
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:51,570
don't close the door on outcomes that
 

1803
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,659
don't close the door on outcomes that
would actually be positive in fulfill

1804
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:53,669
would actually be positive in fulfill
 

1805
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:55,430
would actually be positive in fulfill
the mission and so I think it's a very

1806
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,440
the mission and so I think it's a very
 

1807
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
the mission and so I think it's a very
delicate balance right I think that

1808
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:56,970
delicate balance right I think that
 

1809
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,330
delicate balance right I think that
going 100% one direction or the other is

1810
00:31:59,330 --> 00:31:59,340
going 100% one direction or the other is
 

1811
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,610
going 100% one direction or the other is
clearly not the correct answer and so I

1812
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:01,620
clearly not the correct answer and so I
 

1813
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,289
clearly not the correct answer and so I
think that even in terms of just how we

1814
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:03,299
think that even in terms of just how we
 

1815
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:05,060
think that even in terms of just how we
talk about opening I and think about it

1816
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,070
talk about opening I and think about it
 

1817
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,220
talk about opening I and think about it
there's just like like one thing that's

1818
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,230
there's just like like one thing that's
 

1819
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,870
there's just like like one thing that's
always in the back of my mind is to make

1820
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:08,880
always in the back of my mind is to make
 

1821
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,539
always in the back of my mind is to make
sure that we're not just saying opening

1822
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:11,549
sure that we're not just saying opening
 

1823
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:14,090
sure that we're not just saying opening
eyes goal is to build AGI right that

1824
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:14,100
eyes goal is to build AGI right that
 

1825
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,289
eyes goal is to build AGI right that
it's actually much broader than that

1826
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:15,299
it's actually much broader than that
 

1827
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,600
it's actually much broader than that
right that first of all I you know it's

1828
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:17,610
right that first of all I you know it's
 

1829
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,640
right that first of all I you know it's
not just AGI it's safe AGI that's very

1830
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:19,650
not just AGI it's safe AGI that's very
 

1831
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,159
not just AGI it's safe AGI that's very
important but secondly our goal isn't to

1832
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:22,169
important but secondly our goal isn't to
 

1833
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:23,419
important but secondly our goal isn't to
be the ones to build it our goal is to

1834
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:23,429
be the ones to build it our goal is to
 

1835
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:24,590
be the ones to build it our goal is to
make sure it goes well for the world and

1836
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:24,600
make sure it goes well for the world and
 

1837
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,419
make sure it goes well for the world and
so I think that figuring out how do you

1838
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:26,429
so I think that figuring out how do you
 

1839
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,850
so I think that figuring out how do you
balance all of those and to get people

1840
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:28,860
balance all of those and to get people
 

1841
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,980
balance all of those and to get people
to really come to the table and compile

1842
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:30,990
to really come to the table and compile
 

1843
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,669
to really come to the table and compile
the the like a single document that that

1844
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:34,679
the the like a single document that that
 

1845
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,190
the the like a single document that that
encompasses all of that wasn't trivial

1846
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,200
encompasses all of that wasn't trivial
 

1847
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,250
encompasses all of that wasn't trivial
so part of the challenge here is your

1848
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:40,260
so part of the challenge here is your
 

1849
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,100
so part of the challenge here is your
mission is I would say beautiful

1850
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,110
mission is I would say beautiful
 

1851
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,230
mission is I would say beautiful
empowering and a beacon of hope for

1852
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,240
empowering and a beacon of hope for
 

1853
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,539
empowering and a beacon of hope for
people in the research community and

1854
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:47,549
people in the research community and
 

1855
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,490
people in the research community and
just people thinking about AI so your

1856
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:49,500
just people thinking about AI so your
 

1857
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,610
just people thinking about AI so your
decisions are scrutinized more than I

1858
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:52,620
decisions are scrutinized more than I
 

1859
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,970
decisions are scrutinized more than I
think a regular profit driven company do

1860
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:55,980
think a regular profit driven company do
 

1861
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,590
think a regular profit driven company do
you feel the burden of this in the

1862
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
you feel the burden of this in the
 

1863
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,970
you feel the burden of this in the
creation of the Charter and just in the

1864
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:58,980
creation of the Charter and just in the
 

1865
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,640
creation of the Charter and just in the
way you operate yes so why do you lean

1866
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:04,650
way you operate yes so why do you lean
 

1867
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,000
way you operate yes so why do you lean
into the burden by creating such a

1868
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,010
into the burden by creating such a
 

1869
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,610
into the burden by creating such a
charter why not to keep it quiet I mean

1870
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:10,620
charter why not to keep it quiet I mean
 

1871
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,350
charter why not to keep it quiet I mean
it just boils down to the to the mission

1872
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:12,360
it just boils down to the to the mission
 

1873
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,020
it just boils down to the to the mission
right

1874
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,030
right
 

1875
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,150
right
I'm here and everyone else is here

1876
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:15,160
I'm here and everyone else is here
 

1877
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,260
I'm here and everyone else is here
because we think this is the most

1878
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,270
because we think this is the most
 

1879
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,660
because we think this is the most
important mission right dare to dream

1880
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:18,670
important mission right dare to dream
 

1881
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,970
important mission right dare to dream
all right so what do you think you can

1882
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:20,980

understand by Google that makes most of
 

1895
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,740
understand by Google that makes most of
its money from ads you can't also do

1907
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,320
in my view that affects the impact of a
company what affects the impact of the

the you know the people inside and
profit is the thing that just fuels

1914
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:05,770
profit is the thing that just fuels
 

1915
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,250

those people so what are your views

1916
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:08,260
those people so what are your views
 

1917
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,140
those people so what are your views
there yeah so I think that's a really

there yeah so I think that's a really
 

1919
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,370
there yeah so I think that's a really
good question and there's there's

1920
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:11,380
good question and there's there's
 

1921
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,990
good question and there's there's
there's some some you know real like

1922
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:13,000
there's some some you know real like
 

1923
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,880
there's some some you know real like
long-standing debates in human society

1924
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:14,890
long-standing debates in human society
 

1925
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,830
long-standing debates in human society
that are wrapped up in it the way that I

1926
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:16,840
that are wrapped up in it the way that I
 

1927
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,810
that are wrapped up in it the way that I
think about it is just think about what

1928
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:18,820
think about it is just think about what
 

1929
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,820
think about it is just think about what
what are the most impactful nonprofits

1930
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:20,830
what are the most impactful nonprofits
 

1931
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:25,169
what are the most impactful nonprofits
in the world what are the most impactful

1932
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:25,179
in the world what are the most impactful
 

1933
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,360
in the world what are the most impactful
for profits in the world right is much

1934
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,370
for profits in the world right is much
 

1935
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,370
for profits in the world right is much
easier to lists the for profits that's

1936
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:29,380
easier to lists the for profits that's
 

1937
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,750
easier to lists the for profits that's
right and I think that there's there's

1938
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:30,760
right and I think that there's there's
 

1939
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,659
right and I think that there's there's
some real truth here that the system

1940
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:33,669
some real truth here that the system
 

1941
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:35,760
some real truth here that the system
that we set up the system for kind of

1942
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:35,770
that we set up the system for kind of
 

1943
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,500
that we set up the system for kind of
how you know today's world is organized

1944
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:37,510
how you know today's world is organized
 

1945
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,470
how you know today's world is organized
is one that that really allows for huge

1946
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:40,480
is one that that really allows for huge
 

1947
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,139
is one that that really allows for huge
impact and that that you know kind of

1948
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:43,149
impact and that that you know kind of
 

1949
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,240
impact and that that you know kind of
part of that is that you need to be you

1950
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:45,250
part of that is that you need to be you
 

1951
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,000
part of that is that you need to be you
know for profits are our self-sustaining

1952
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,010
know for profits are our self-sustaining
 

1953
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,130
know for profits are our self-sustaining
and able to to kind of you know build on

1954
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:50,140
and able to to kind of you know build on
 

1955
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,780
and able to to kind of you know build on
their own momentum and I think that's a

1956
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:51,790
their own momentum and I think that's a
 

1957
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,280
their own momentum and I think that's a
really powerful thing it's something

1958
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,290
really powerful thing it's something
 

1959
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,280
really powerful thing it's something
that when it turns out that we haven't

1960
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,290
that when it turns out that we haven't
 

1961
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,170
that when it turns out that we haven't
set the guardrails correctly causes

1962
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:58,180
set the guardrails correctly causes
 

1963
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,430
set the guardrails correctly causes
problems right think about logging

1964
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
problems right think about logging
 

1965
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,140
problems right think about logging
companies that go and DeForest you know

1966
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,150
companies that go and DeForest you know
 

1967
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,090
companies that go and DeForest you know
you know the rain forest that's really

1968
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,100
you know the rain forest that's really
 

1969
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,490
you know the rain forest that's really
bad we don't want that and it's actually

1970
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:05,500
bad we don't want that and it's actually
 

1971
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,840
bad we don't want that and it's actually
really interesting to me the kind of

1972
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:06,850
really interesting to me the kind of
 

1973
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,820
really interesting to me the kind of
this this question of how do you get

1974
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:08,830
this this question of how do you get
 

1975
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,560
this this question of how do you get
positive benefits out of a for-profit

1976
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:10,570
positive benefits out of a for-profit
 

1977
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,480
positive benefits out of a for-profit
company it's actually very similar to

1978
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:12,490
company it's actually very similar to
 

1979
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,890
company it's actually very similar to
how do you get positive benefits out of

1980
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:13,900
how do you get positive benefits out of
 

1981
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,500
how do you get positive benefits out of
an AGI right that you have this like

1982
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:16,510
an AGI right that you have this like
 

1983
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,690
an AGI right that you have this like
very powerful system it's more powerful

1984
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:18,700
very powerful system it's more powerful
 

1985
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,700
very powerful system it's more powerful
than any human and it's kind of

1986
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:20,710
than any human and it's kind of
 

1987
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,140
than any human and it's kind of
autonomous in some ways you know super

1988
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,150
autonomous in some ways you know super
 

1989
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,240
autonomous in some ways you know super
human and a lot of axes and somehow you

1990
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:24,250
human and a lot of axes and somehow you
 

1991
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,890
human and a lot of axes and somehow you
have to set the guardrails to get good

1992
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:25,900
have to set the guardrails to get good
 

1993
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,050
have to set the guardrails to get good
to happen but when you do the benefits

1994
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,060
to happen but when you do the benefits
 

1995
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,650
to happen but when you do the benefits
are massive and so I think that the when

1996
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:31,660
are massive and so I think that the when
 

1997
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,150
are massive and so I think that the when
when I think about nonprofit vs.

1998
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,160
when I think about nonprofit vs.
 

1999
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,580
when I think about nonprofit vs.
for-profit I think it's just not enough

2000
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:35,590
for-profit I think it's just not enough
 

2001
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,350
for-profit I think it's just not enough
happens in nonprofits they're very pure

2002
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:37,360
happens in nonprofits they're very pure
 

2003
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
happens in nonprofits they're very pure
but it's just kind of you know it's just

2004
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,370
but it's just kind of you know it's just
 

2005
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,550
but it's just kind of you know it's just
hard to do things they're in for profits

2006
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:41,560
hard to do things they're in for profits
 

2007
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,250
hard to do things they're in for profits
in some ways like too much happens but

2008
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:44,260
in some ways like too much happens but
 

2009
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,470
in some ways like too much happens but
if if kind of shaped in the right way it

2010
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,480
if if kind of shaped in the right way it
 

2011
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,270
if if kind of shaped in the right way it
can actually be very positive and so

2012
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:48,280
can actually be very positive and so
 

2013
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,210
can actually be very positive and so
with open NLP we're picking a road in

2014
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:51,220
with open NLP we're picking a road in
 

2015
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,370
with open NLP we're picking a road in
between now the thing I think is really

2016
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:53,380
between now the thing I think is really
 

2017
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,440
between now the thing I think is really
important to recognize is that the way

2018
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,450
important to recognize is that the way
 

2019
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,480
important to recognize is that the way
that we think about opening ILP is that

2020
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:57,490
that we think about opening ILP is that
 

2021
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,060
that we think about opening ILP is that
in the world where AGI actually happens

2022
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,070
in the world where AGI actually happens
 

2023
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,560
in the world where AGI actually happens
right in a world where we are successful

2024
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,570
right in a world where we are successful
 

2025
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,400
right in a world where we are successful
we build the most transformative

2026
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:02,410
we build the most transformative
 

2027
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,380
we build the most transformative
technology ever the amount of value

2028
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:04,390
technology ever the amount of value
 

2029
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,070
technology ever the amount of value
we're going to create will be

2030
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,080
we're going to create will be
 

2031
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,430
we're going to create will be
astronomical and so then in that case

2032
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:08,440
astronomical and so then in that case
 

2033
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,330
astronomical and so then in that case
that the if it the the cap that we have

2034
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:12,340
that the if it the the cap that we have
 

2035
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,580
that the if it the the cap that we have
will be a small fraction of the value we

2036
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:14,590
will be a small fraction of the value we
 

2037
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,070
will be a small fraction of the value we
create and the amount of value that goes

2038
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,080
create and the amount of value that goes
 

2039
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,750
create and the amount of value that goes
back to investors and employees looks

2040
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:18,760
back to investors and employees looks
 

2041
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,460
back to investors and employees looks
pretty similar to what would happen in a

2042
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:20,470
pretty similar to what would happen in a
 

2043
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,360
pretty similar to what would happen in a
pretty successful startup and that's

2044
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,370
pretty successful startup and that's
 

2045
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,590
pretty successful startup and that's
really the case that we're optimizing

2046
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:25,600
really the case that we're optimizing
 

2047
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,330
really the case that we're optimizing
for right that we're thinking about in

2048
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:27,340
for right that we're thinking about in
 

2049
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,030
for right that we're thinking about in
the success case making sure that the

2050
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,040
the success case making sure that the
 

2051
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,710
the success case making sure that the
value we create doesn't get locked up

2052
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:31,720
value we create doesn't get locked up
 

2053
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,020
value we create doesn't get locked up
and I expect that in another you know

2054
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,030
and I expect that in another you know
 

2055
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,670
and I expect that in another you know
for-profit companies that it's possible

2056
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:35,680
for-profit companies that it's possible
 

2057
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,160
for-profit companies that it's possible
to do something like that I think it's

2058
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,170
to do something like that I think it's
 

2059
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,810
to do something like that I think it's
not obvious how to do it right and I

2060
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:39,820
not obvious how to do it right and I
 

2061
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,550
not obvious how to do it right and I
think that as a for-profit company you

2062
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:41,560
think that as a for-profit company you
 

2063
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,590
think that as a for-profit company you
have a lot of fiduciary duty to your

2064
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:43,600
have a lot of fiduciary duty to your
 

2065
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,820
have a lot of fiduciary duty to your
shareholders and that there are certain

2066
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:44,830
shareholders and that there are certain
 

2067
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,760
shareholders and that there are certain
decisions you just cannot make in our

2068
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:47,770
decisions you just cannot make in our
 

2069
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,340
decisions you just cannot make in our
structure we've set it up so that we

2070
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:50,350
structure we've set it up so that we
 

2071
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,810
structure we've set it up so that we
have a fiduciary duty to the Charter

2072
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:51,820
have a fiduciary duty to the Charter
 

2073
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,300
have a fiduciary duty to the Charter
that we always get to make the decision

2074
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:54,310
that we always get to make the decision
 

2075
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,940
that we always get to make the decision
that is right for the Charter rather

2076
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:56,950
that is right for the Charter rather
 

2077
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,590
that is right for the Charter rather
than even if it comes at the expense of

2078
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:58,600
than even if it comes at the expense of
 

2079
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,680
than even if it comes at the expense of
our own stakeholders and and so I think

2080
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:01,690
our own stakeholders and and so I think
 

2081
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,960
our own stakeholders and and so I think
that when I think about what's really

2082
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:03,970
that when I think about what's really
 

2083
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,830
that when I think about what's really
important it's not really about

2084
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:04,840
important it's not really about
 

2085
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,600
important it's not really about
nonprofit vs. for-profit it's really a

2086
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:06,610
nonprofit vs. for-profit it's really a
 

2087
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,260
nonprofit vs. for-profit it's really a
question of if you build a GI and you

2088
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,270
question of if you build a GI and you
 

2089
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,250
question of if you build a GI and you
kind of you know humanities now in this

2090
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:11,260
kind of you know humanities now in this
 

2091
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,970
kind of you know humanities now in this
new age who benefits whose lives are

2092
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:14,980
new age who benefits whose lives are
 

2093
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,770
new age who benefits whose lives are
better and I think that what's really

2094
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:16,780
better and I think that what's really
 

2095
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,630
better and I think that what's really
important is to have an answer that is

2096
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:18,640
important is to have an answer that is
 

2097
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,600
important is to have an answer that is
everyone yeah which is one of the core

2098
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:21,610
everyone yeah which is one of the core
 

2099
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,000
everyone yeah which is one of the core
aspects of the Charter so one concern

2100
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,010
aspects of the Charter so one concern
 

2101
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,310
aspects of the Charter so one concern
people have not just with open the eye

2102
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,320
people have not just with open the eye
 

2103
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,990
people have not just with open the eye
but with Google Facebook Amazon anybody

2104
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
but with Google Facebook Amazon anybody
 

2105
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,870
but with Google Facebook Amazon anybody
really that's that's creating impact

2106
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:33,880
really that's that's creating impact
 

2107
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,840
really that's that's creating impact
that scale is how do we avoid as your

2108
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:36,850
that scale is how do we avoid as your
 

2109
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,180
that scale is how do we avoid as your
Charter says avoid enabling the use of

2110
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,190
Charter says avoid enabling the use of
 

2111
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,829
Charter says avoid enabling the use of
or AGI to unduly concentrate power why

2112
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:43,839
or AGI to unduly concentrate power why
 

2113
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,109
or AGI to unduly concentrate power why
would not a company like open a I keep

2114
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:46,119
would not a company like open a I keep
 

2115
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,180
would not a company like open a I keep
all the power of an AGI system to itself

2116
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,190
all the power of an AGI system to itself
 

2117
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,849
all the power of an AGI system to itself
the Charter the Charter so you know how

2118
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:50,859
the Charter the Charter so you know how
 

2119
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:56,280
the Charter the Charter so you know how
does the Charter actualize itself in day

2120
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,290
does the Charter actualize itself in day
 

2121
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:59,910
does the Charter actualize itself in day
to day so I think that first to zoom out

2122
00:37:59,910 --> 00:37:59,920
to day so I think that first to zoom out
 

2123
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,319
to day so I think that first to zoom out
right there the way that we structure

2124
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:01,329
right there the way that we structure
 

2125
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:03,020
right there the way that we structure
the company is so that the the power

2126
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,030
the company is so that the the power
 

2127
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,130
the company is so that the the power
first sort of you know dictating the

2128
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,140
first sort of you know dictating the
 

2129
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,359
first sort of you know dictating the
actions that opening eye takes

2130
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:06,369
actions that opening eye takes
 

2131
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,550
actions that opening eye takes
ultimately rests with the board right

2132
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:08,560
ultimately rests with the board right
 

2133
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,220
ultimately rests with the board right
the board of the nonprofit I'm and the

2134
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:11,230
the board of the nonprofit I'm and the
 

2135
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,599
the board of the nonprofit I'm and the
board is set up in certain ways certain

2136
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:12,609
board is set up in certain ways certain
 

2137
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:13,950
board is set up in certain ways certain
certain restrictions that you can read

2138
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:13,960
certain restrictions that you can read
 

2139
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,349
certain restrictions that you can read
about in the opening hi LP blog post but

2140
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:16,359
about in the opening hi LP blog post but
 

2141
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:18,329
about in the opening hi LP blog post but
effectively the board is the is the

2142
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:18,339
effectively the board is the is the
 

2143
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:22,079
effectively the board is the is the
governing body for opening ILP and the

2144
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:22,089
governing body for opening ILP and the
 

2145
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:23,819
governing body for opening ILP and the
board has a duty to fulfill the mission

2146
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:23,829
board has a duty to fulfill the mission
 

2147
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:27,690
board has a duty to fulfill the mission
of the nonprofit and so that's kind of

2148
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:27,700
of the nonprofit and so that's kind of
 

2149
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,609
of the nonprofit and so that's kind of
how we tie how we thread all these

2150
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:29,619
how we tie how we thread all these
 

2151
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:31,470
how we tie how we thread all these
things together now there's a question

2152
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:31,480
things together now there's a question
 

2153
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,839
things together now there's a question
of so day to day how do people the

2154
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:33,849
of so day to day how do people the
 

2155
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,760
of so day to day how do people the
individuals who in some ways are the

2156
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:35,770
individuals who in some ways are the
 

2157
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,319
individuals who in some ways are the
most empowered ones ain't no the board

2158
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:37,329
most empowered ones ain't no the board
 

2159
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:38,910
most empowered ones ain't no the board
sort of gets to call the shots at the

2160
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:38,920
sort of gets to call the shots at the
 

2161
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,680
sort of gets to call the shots at the
high level but the people who are

2162
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:40,690
high level but the people who are
 

2163
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,990
high level but the people who are
actually executing are the employees the

2164
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,000
actually executing are the employees the
 

2165
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,370
actually executing are the employees the
way that people here on a day-to-day

2166
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:44,380
way that people here on a day-to-day
 

2167
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,290
way that people here on a day-to-day
basis who have the you know the the keys

2168
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:46,300
basis who have the you know the the keys
 

2169
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,440
basis who have the you know the the keys
to the technical Kingdom and their I

2170
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,450
to the technical Kingdom and their I
 

2171
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,270
to the technical Kingdom and their I
think that the answer looks a lot like

2172
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:51,280
think that the answer looks a lot like
 

2173
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,030
think that the answer looks a lot like
well how does any company's values get

2174
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,040
well how does any company's values get
 

2175
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,620
well how does any company's values get
actualized right I think that a lot of

2176
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:55,630
actualized right I think that a lot of
 

2177
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,300
actualized right I think that a lot of
that comes down to that you need people

2178
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:57,310
that comes down to that you need people
 

2179
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,220
that comes down to that you need people
who are here because they really believe

2180
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,230
who are here because they really believe
 

2181
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,400
who are here because they really believe
in that mission and they believe in the

2182
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,410
in that mission and they believe in the
 

2183
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,020
in that mission and they believe in the
Charter and that they are willing to

2184
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,030
Charter and that they are willing to
 

2185
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,540
Charter and that they are willing to
take actions that maybe are worse for

2186
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:06,550
take actions that maybe are worse for
 

2187
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,880
take actions that maybe are worse for
them but are better for the Charter and

2188
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:08,890
them but are better for the Charter and
 

2189
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,930
them but are better for the Charter and
that's something that's really baked

2190
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:09,940
that's something that's really baked
 

2191
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,120
that's something that's really baked
into the culture and honestly I think

2192
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,130
into the culture and honestly I think
 

2193
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,099
into the culture and honestly I think
it's I you know I think that that's one

2194
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:14,109
it's I you know I think that that's one
 

2195
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:15,180
it's I you know I think that that's one
of the things that we really have to

2196
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,190
of the things that we really have to
 

2197
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,390
of the things that we really have to
work to preserve as time goes on and

2198
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:18,400
work to preserve as time goes on and
 

2199
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,370
work to preserve as time goes on and
that's a really important part of how we

2200
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:20,380
that's a really important part of how we
 

2201
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,839
that's a really important part of how we
think about hiring people and bringing

2202
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:21,849
think about hiring people and bringing
 

2203
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:23,550
think about hiring people and bringing
people into opening I so there's people

2204
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:23,560
people into opening I so there's people
 

2205
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,740
people into opening I so there's people
here there's people here who could speak

2206
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:25,750
here there's people here who could speak
 

2207
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:31,109
here there's people here who could speak
up and say like hold on a second this is

2208
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:31,119
up and say like hold on a second this is
 

2209
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,170
up and say like hold on a second this is
totally against what we stand for

2210
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:33,180
totally against what we stand for
 

2211
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,579
totally against what we stand for
cultural eyes yeah yeah for sure I mean

2212
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:35,589
cultural eyes yeah yeah for sure I mean
 

2213
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:37,109
cultural eyes yeah yeah for sure I mean
I think that that we actually have I

2214
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119
I think that that we actually have I
 

2215
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,370
I think that that we actually have I
think that's like a pretty important

2216
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:38,380
think that's like a pretty important
 

2217
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,609
think that's like a pretty important
part of how we operate and how we have

2218
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:41,619
part of how we operate and how we have
 

2219
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:44,069
part of how we operate and how we have
even again with designing the Charter

2220
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:44,079
even again with designing the Charter
 

2221
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,720
even again with designing the Charter
and designing open alp in the first

2222
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:45,730
and designing open alp in the first
 

2223
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,880
and designing open alp in the first
place that there has been a lot of

2224
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:47,890
place that there has been a lot of
 

2225
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,829
place that there has been a lot of
conversation with employees here and a

2226
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:49,839
conversation with employees here and a
 

2227
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,690
conversation with employees here and a
lot of times where employees said wait a

2228
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:51,700
lot of times where employees said wait a
 

2229
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,620
lot of times where employees said wait a
second this

2230
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:52,630
second this
 

2231
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,430
second this
seems like it's coming in the wrong

2232
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:53,440
seems like it's coming in the wrong
 

2233
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,320
seems like it's coming in the wrong
direction and let's talk about it and so

2234
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,330
direction and let's talk about it and so
 

2235
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,520
direction and let's talk about it and so
I think one thing that's that's I think

2236
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:56,530
I think one thing that's that's I think
 

2237
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,290
I think one thing that's that's I think
I really and you know here's here's

2238
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:58,300
I really and you know here's here's
 

2239
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,640
I really and you know here's here's
actually one thing I think is very

2240
00:39:59,640 --> 00:39:59,650
actually one thing I think is very
 

2241
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,950
actually one thing I think is very
unique about us as a small company is

2242
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:01,960
unique about us as a small company is
 

2243
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,050
unique about us as a small company is
that if you're at a massive tech giant

2244
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:04,060
that if you're at a massive tech giant
 

2245
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,490
that if you're at a massive tech giant
that's a little bit hard for someone

2246
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:05,500
that's a little bit hard for someone
 

2247
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,050
that's a little bit hard for someone
who's aligned employee to go and talk to

2248
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:07,060
who's aligned employee to go and talk to
 

2249
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,540
who's aligned employee to go and talk to
the CEO and say I think that we're doing

2250
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:09,550
the CEO and say I think that we're doing
 

2251
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,550
the CEO and say I think that we're doing
this wrong and you know you look at

2252
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:11,560
this wrong and you know you look at
 

2253
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,100
this wrong and you know you look at
companies like Google that have had some

2254
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,110
companies like Google that have had some
 

2255
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,260
companies like Google that have had some
collective action from employees to you

2256
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,270
collective action from employees to you
 

2257
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:18,540
collective action from employees to you
know make ethical change around things

2258
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:18,550
know make ethical change around things
 

2259
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,160
know make ethical change around things
like maven and so maybe there are

2260
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,170
like maven and so maybe there are
 

2261
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,330
like maven and so maybe there are
mechanisms that other companies that

2262
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:21,340
mechanisms that other companies that
 

2263
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,850
mechanisms that other companies that
work but here super easy for anyone to

2264
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:23,860
work but here super easy for anyone to
 

2265
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,260
work but here super easy for anyone to
pull me aside to pull Sam aside to

2266
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:25,270
pull me aside to pull Sam aside to
 

2267
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,910
pull me aside to pull Sam aside to
Balilla aside and people do it all the

2268
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:26,920
Balilla aside and people do it all the
 

2269
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,830
Balilla aside and people do it all the
time one of the interesting things in

2270
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:28,840
time one of the interesting things in
 

2271
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,380
time one of the interesting things in
the Charter is this idea that it'd be

2272
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:31,390
the Charter is this idea that it'd be
 

2273
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,850
the Charter is this idea that it'd be
great if you could try to describe or

2274
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:32,860
great if you could try to describe or
 

2275
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,520
great if you could try to describe or
untangle switching from competition to

2276
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:35,530
untangle switching from competition to
 

2277
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,860
untangle switching from competition to
collaboration and late-stage AGI

2278
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:37,870
collaboration and late-stage AGI
 

2279
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,450
collaboration and late-stage AGI
development it was really interesting

2280
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:39,460
development it was really interesting
 

2281
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,520
development it was really interesting
this dance between competition and

2282
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:41,530
this dance between competition and
 

2283
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,810
this dance between competition and
collaboration how do you think about

2284
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:42,820
collaboration how do you think about
 

2285
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,970
collaboration how do you think about
that yeah assuming you can actually do

2286
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:44,980
that yeah assuming you can actually do
 

2287
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,920
that yeah assuming you can actually do
the technical side of AGI development I

2288
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:46,930
the technical side of AGI development I
 

2289
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,210
the technical side of AGI development I
think there's going to be two key

2290
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:48,220
think there's going to be two key
 

2291
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,740
think there's going to be two key
problems with figuring out how do you

2292
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:49,750
problems with figuring out how do you
 

2293
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,570
problems with figuring out how do you
actually deploy it make it go well the

2294
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:51,580
actually deploy it make it go well the
 

2295
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,570
actually deploy it make it go well the
first one of these is the run-up to

2296
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:53,580
first one of these is the run-up to
 

2297
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,000
first one of these is the run-up to
building the first AGI you look at how

2298
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,010
building the first AGI you look at how
 

2299
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,380
building the first AGI you look at how
self-driving cars are being developed

2300
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:58,390
self-driving cars are being developed
 

2301
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,960
self-driving cars are being developed
and it's a competitive race I'm the

2302
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:00,970
and it's a competitive race I'm the
 

2303
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,860
and it's a competitive race I'm the
thing that always happens in a

2304
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:01,870
thing that always happens in a
 

2305
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,180
thing that always happens in a
competitive race is that you have huge

2306
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,190
competitive race is that you have huge
 

2307
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,280
competitive race is that you have huge
amounts of pressure to get rid of safety

2308
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,290
amounts of pressure to get rid of safety
 

2309
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,740
amounts of pressure to get rid of safety
and so that's one thing we're very

2310
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:07,750
and so that's one thing we're very
 

2311
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,510
and so that's one thing we're very
concerned about right is that people

2312
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
concerned about right is that people
 

2313
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,240
concerned about right is that people
multiple teams figuring out we can

2314
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:12,250
multiple teams figuring out we can
 

2315
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,480
multiple teams figuring out we can
actually get there but you know if we

2316
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:15,490
actually get there but you know if we
 

2317
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,820
actually get there but you know if we
took the slower path that is more

2318
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:17,830
took the slower path that is more
 

2319
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,010
took the slower path that is more
guaranteed to be safe we will lose and

2320
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,020
guaranteed to be safe we will lose and
 

2321
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,960
guaranteed to be safe we will lose and
so we're going to take the fast path and

2322
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:21,970
so we're going to take the fast path and
 

2323
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:25,110
so we're going to take the fast path and
so the more that we can both ourselves

2324
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,120
so the more that we can both ourselves
 

2325
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,150
so the more that we can both ourselves
be in a position where we don't generate

2326
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:27,160
be in a position where we don't generate
 

2327
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,830
be in a position where we don't generate
that competitive race where we say if

2328
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:28,840
that competitive race where we say if
 

2329
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,020
that competitive race where we say if
the race is being run and that you know

2330
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:31,030
the race is being run and that you know
 

2331
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,760
the race is being run and that you know
someone else's is further ahead than we

2332
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:32,770
someone else's is further ahead than we
 

2333
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,890
someone else's is further ahead than we
are we're not gonna try to to leapfrog

2334
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:34,900
are we're not gonna try to to leapfrog
 

2335
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,660
are we're not gonna try to to leapfrog
we're gonna actually work with them

2336
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:36,670
we're gonna actually work with them
 

2337
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,060
we're gonna actually work with them
right we will help them succeed as long

2338
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,070
right we will help them succeed as long
 

2339
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,710
right we will help them succeed as long
as what they're trying to do is to

2340
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:40,720
as what they're trying to do is to
 

2341
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,020
as what they're trying to do is to
fulfill our mission then we're good we

2342
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,030
fulfill our mission then we're good we
 

2343
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,090
fulfill our mission then we're good we
don't have to build AGI ourselves and I

2344
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:45,100
don't have to build AGI ourselves and I
 

2345
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,840
don't have to build AGI ourselves and I
think that's a really important

2346
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:45,850
think that's a really important
 

2347
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,640
think that's a really important
commitment from us but it can't just be

2348
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:47,650
commitment from us but it can't just be
 

2349
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,650
commitment from us but it can't just be
unilateral right I think that's really

2350
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:49,660
unilateral right I think that's really
 

2351
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,540
unilateral right I think that's really
important that other players who are

2352
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:51,550
important that other players who are
 

2353
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,460
important that other players who are
serious about building AGI make similar

2354
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:53,470
serious about building AGI make similar
 

2355
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,130
serious about building AGI make similar
commitments right I think that that you

2356
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:56,140
commitments right I think that that you
 

2357
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,330
commitments right I think that that you
know again to the extent that everyone

2358
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:57,340
know again to the extent that everyone
 

2359
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,830
know again to the extent that everyone
believes that AGI should be something to

2360
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:58,840
believes that AGI should be something to
 

2361
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,660
believes that AGI should be something to
benefit everyone then it actually really

2362
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:00,670
benefit everyone then it actually really
 

2363
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,040
benefit everyone then it actually really
shouldn't matter which company builds it

2364
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,050
shouldn't matter which company builds it
 

2365
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,810
shouldn't matter which company builds it
and we should all be concerned about the

2366
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:03,820
and we should all be concerned about the
 

2367
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,730
and we should all be concerned about the
case where we just race so hard to get

2368
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:05,740
case where we just race so hard to get
 

2369
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,040
case where we just race so hard to get
there

2370
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,050
there
 

2371
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,200
there
that something goes wrong so what role

2372
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,210
that something goes wrong so what role
 

2373
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,170
that something goes wrong so what role
do you think government our favorite

2374
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:11,180
do you think government our favorite
 

2375
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,630
do you think government our favorite
entity has in setting policy and rules

2376
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:13,640
entity has in setting policy and rules
 

2377
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,410
entity has in setting policy and rules
about this domain from research to the

2378
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:17,420
about this domain from research to the
 

2379
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,710
about this domain from research to the
development to early stage to late stage

2380
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
development to early stage to late stage
 

2381
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,950
development to early stage to late stage
a a inhi development so I think that

2382
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:23,960
a a inhi development so I think that
 

2383
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,470
a a inhi development so I think that
first of all is really important the

2384
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:26,480
first of all is really important the
 

2385
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,540
first of all is really important the
government's in their right in some way

2386
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:28,550
government's in their right in some way
 

2387
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,220
government's in their right in some way
shape or form you know at the end of the

2388
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,230
shape or form you know at the end of the
 

2389
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,150
shape or form you know at the end of the
day we're talking about building

2390
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,160
day we're talking about building
 

2391
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,850
day we're talking about building
technology that will shape how the world

2392
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:33,860
technology that will shape how the world
 

2393
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,550
technology that will shape how the world
operates and that there needs to be

2394
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:36,560
operates and that there needs to be
 

2395
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,310
operates and that there needs to be
government as part of that answer and so

2396
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:39,320
government as part of that answer and so
 

2397
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,710
government as part of that answer and so
that's why we've we've we've done a

2398
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:41,720
that's why we've we've we've done a
 

2399
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,580
that's why we've we've we've done a
number of different congressional

2400
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:42,590
number of different congressional
 

2401
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:45,040
number of different congressional
testimonies we interact with a number of

2402
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,050
testimonies we interact with a number of
 

2403
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,380
testimonies we interact with a number of
different lawmakers and the you know

2404
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:47,390
different lawmakers and the you know
 

2405
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,600
different lawmakers and the you know
right now a lot of our message to them

2406
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:49,610
right now a lot of our message to them
 

2407
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:53,830
right now a lot of our message to them
is that it's not the time for regulation

2408
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:53,840
is that it's not the time for regulation
 

2409
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,080
is that it's not the time for regulation
it is the time for measurement right

2410
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,090
it is the time for measurement right
 

2411
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,210
it is the time for measurement right
that our main policy recommendation is

2412
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:58,220
that our main policy recommendation is
 

2413
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,800
that our main policy recommendation is
that people and you know the government

2414
00:42:59,800 --> 00:42:59,810
that people and you know the government
 

2415
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,570
that people and you know the government
does this all the time with bodies like

2416
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:01,580
does this all the time with bodies like
 

2417
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,360
does this all the time with bodies like
NIST um spend time trying to figure out

2418
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:04,370
NIST um spend time trying to figure out
 

2419
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,910
NIST um spend time trying to figure out
just where the technology is how fast

2420
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:06,920
just where the technology is how fast
 

2421
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,610
just where the technology is how fast
it's moving and can really become

2422
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:09,620
it's moving and can really become
 

2423
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,830
it's moving and can really become
literate and up to speed with respect to

2424
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:11,840
literate and up to speed with respect to
 

2425
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,820
literate and up to speed with respect to
what to expect

2426
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:12,830
what to expect
 

2427
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,070
what to expect
so I think that today the answer really

2428
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:15,080
so I think that today the answer really
 

2429
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,710
so I think that today the answer really
is about about about measurement and I

2430
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:17,720
is about about about measurement and I
 

2431
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,600
is about about about measurement and I
think if there will be a time in place

2432
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:19,610
think if there will be a time in place
 

2433
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,840
think if there will be a time in place
where that will change and I think it's

2434
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:22,850
where that will change and I think it's
 

2435
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,400
where that will change and I think it's
a little bit hard to predict exactly I

2436
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:24,410
a little bit hard to predict exactly I
 

2437
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,680
a little bit hard to predict exactly I
what what exactly that trajectory should

2438
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:26,690
what what exactly that trajectory should
 

2439
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,690
what what exactly that trajectory should
look like so there will be a point

2440
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:28,700
look like so there will be a point
 

2441
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,260
look like so there will be a point
oh it's regulation federal in the United

2442
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:32,270
oh it's regulation federal in the United
 

2443
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,710
oh it's regulation federal in the United
States the government steps in and and

2444
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:34,720
States the government steps in and and
 

2445
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,350
States the government steps in and and
helps be the I don't want to say the

2446
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:38,360
helps be the I don't want to say the
 

2447
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,240
helps be the I don't want to say the
adult in the room to make sure that

2448
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,250
adult in the room to make sure that
 

2449
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,670
adult in the room to make sure that
there is strict rules may be

2450
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:42,680
there is strict rules may be
 

2451
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,350
there is strict rules may be
conservative rules that nobody can cross

2452
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:44,360
conservative rules that nobody can cross
 

2453
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,210
conservative rules that nobody can cross
well I think there's this kind of maybe

2454
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:46,220
well I think there's this kind of maybe
 

2455
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,310
well I think there's this kind of maybe
to two angles to it so today with narrow

2456
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:48,320
to two angles to it so today with narrow
 

2457
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,860
to two angles to it so today with narrow
AI applications that I think there are

2458
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:50,870
AI applications that I think there are
 

2459
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,330
AI applications that I think there are
already existing bodies that are

2460
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:52,340
already existing bodies that are
 

2461
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,740
already existing bodies that are
responsible and should be responsible

2462
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:53,750
responsible and should be responsible
 

2463
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,480
responsible and should be responsible
for regulation you think about for

2464
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,490
for regulation you think about for
 

2465
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,430
for regulation you think about for
example with self-driving cars that you

2466
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
example with self-driving cars that you
 

2467
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,460
example with self-driving cars that you
want the you know the National Highway

2468
00:43:59,460 --> 00:43:59,470
want the you know the National Highway
 

2469
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,040
want the you know the National Highway
it's exactly to be very good mat that

2470
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,050
it's exactly to be very good mat that
 

2471
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,600
it's exactly to be very good mat that
makes sense right that basically what

2472
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:04,610
makes sense right that basically what
 

2473
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:05,650
makes sense right that basically what
we're saying is that we're going to have

2474
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:05,660
we're saying is that we're going to have
 

2475
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,290
we're saying is that we're going to have
these technological systems that are

2476
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:08,300
these technological systems that are
 

2477
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,480
these technological systems that are
going to be do performing applications

2478
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:10,490
going to be do performing applications
 

2479
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:13,030
going to be do performing applications
that humans already do great we already

2480
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,040
that humans already do great we already
 

2481
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,740
that humans already do great we already
have ways of thinking about standards

2482
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:14,750
have ways of thinking about standards
 

2483
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,690
have ways of thinking about standards
and safety for those so I think actually

2484
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:16,700
and safety for those so I think actually
 

2485
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,880
and safety for those so I think actually
empowering those regulators today is

2486
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:18,890
empowering those regulators today is
 

2487
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:19,870
empowering those regulators today is
also pretty important

2488
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:19,880
also pretty important
 

2489
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,079
also pretty important
and then I think for for a GI you know

2490
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:23,089
and then I think for for a GI you know
 

2491
00:44:23,089 --> 00:44:24,910
and then I think for for a GI you know
that there's going to be a point where

2492
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:24,920
that there's going to be a point where
 

2493
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,259
that there's going to be a point where
we'll have better answers and I think

2494
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:26,269
we'll have better answers and I think
 

2495
00:44:26,269 --> 00:44:28,390
we'll have better answers and I think
that maybe a similar approach of first

2496
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:28,400
that maybe a similar approach of first
 

2497
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,099
that maybe a similar approach of first
measurement and you know start thinking

2498
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:30,109
measurement and you know start thinking
 

2499
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:31,690
measurement and you know start thinking
about what the rules should be I think

2500
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:31,700
about what the rules should be I think
 

2501
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,299
about what the rules should be I think
it's really important that we don't

2502
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:33,309
it's really important that we don't
 

2503
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:36,279
it's really important that we don't
prematurely squash you know progress I

2504
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:36,289
prematurely squash you know progress I
 

2505
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:37,930
prematurely squash you know progress I
think it's very easy to kind of smother

2506
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:37,940
think it's very easy to kind of smother
 

2507
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,569
think it's very easy to kind of smother
the budding field and I think that's

2508
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:40,579
the budding field and I think that's
 

2509
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:42,400
the budding field and I think that's
something to really avoid but I don't

2510
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:42,410
something to really avoid but I don't
 

2511
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,660
something to really avoid but I don't
think it's the right way of doing it is

2512
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:43,670
think it's the right way of doing it is
 

2513
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,839
think it's the right way of doing it is
to say let's just try to blaze ahead and

2514
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:46,849
to say let's just try to blaze ahead and
 

2515
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:50,609
to say let's just try to blaze ahead and
not involve all these other stakeholders

2516
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:50,619
not involve all these other stakeholders
 

2517
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:54,759
not involve all these other stakeholders
so you've recently released a paper on

2518
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:54,769
so you've recently released a paper on
 

2519
00:44:54,769 --> 00:44:59,859
so you've recently released a paper on
GPT two language modeling but did not

2520
00:44:59,859 --> 00:44:59,869
GPT two language modeling but did not
 

2521
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:02,499
GPT two language modeling but did not
release the full model because you have

2522
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:02,509
release the full model because you have
 

2523
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:04,480
release the full model because you have
concerns about the possible negative

2524
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:04,490
concerns about the possible negative
 

2525
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:06,730
concerns about the possible negative
effects of the availability of such

2526
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:06,740
effects of the availability of such
 

2527
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,089
effects of the availability of such
model it's uh outside of just that

2528
00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:10,099
model it's uh outside of just that
 

2529
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:12,370
model it's uh outside of just that
decision is super interesting because of

2530
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:12,380
decision is super interesting because of
 

2531
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,400
decision is super interesting because of
the discussion as at a societal level

2532
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:15,410
the discussion as at a societal level
 

2533
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:17,200
the discussion as at a societal level
the discourse it creates so it's

2534
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:17,210
the discourse it creates so it's
 

2535
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,289
the discourse it creates so it's
fascinating in that aspect but if you

2536
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:20,299
fascinating in that aspect but if you
 

2537
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:22,269
fascinating in that aspect but if you
think that's the specifics here at first

2538
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:22,279
think that's the specifics here at first
 

2539
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:24,579
think that's the specifics here at first
what are some negative effects that you

2540
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:24,589
what are some negative effects that you
 

2541
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:27,130
what are some negative effects that you
envisioned and of course what are some

2542
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:27,140
envisioned and of course what are some
 

2543
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,559
envisioned and of course what are some
of the positive effects yeah so again I

2544
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:29,569
of the positive effects yeah so again I
 

2545
00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:31,420
of the positive effects yeah so again I
think to zoom out like the way that we

2546
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:31,430
think to zoom out like the way that we
 

2547
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:34,599
think to zoom out like the way that we
thought about GPT 2 is that with

2548
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:34,609
thought about GPT 2 is that with
 

2549
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:37,029
thought about GPT 2 is that with
language modeling we are clearly on a

2550
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:37,039
language modeling we are clearly on a
 

2551
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:39,910
language modeling we are clearly on a
trajectory right now where we scale up

2552
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:39,920
trajectory right now where we scale up
 

2553
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,999
trajectory right now where we scale up
our models and we get qualitatively

2554
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:43,009
our models and we get qualitatively
 

2555
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:45,279
our models and we get qualitatively
better performance right GPT 2 itself

2556
00:45:45,279 --> 00:45:45,289
better performance right GPT 2 itself
 

2557
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:47,769
better performance right GPT 2 itself
was actually just a scale-up of a model

2558
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:47,779
was actually just a scale-up of a model
 

2559
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,749
was actually just a scale-up of a model
that we've released in the previous June

2560
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:49,759
that we've released in the previous June
 

2561
00:45:49,759 --> 00:45:51,880
that we've released in the previous June
right and we just ran it at you know

2562
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:51,890
right and we just ran it at you know
 

2563
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:53,349
right and we just ran it at you know
much larger scale and we got these

2564
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:53,359
much larger scale and we got these
 

2565
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,599
much larger scale and we got these
results we're suddenly starting to write

2566
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:55,609
results we're suddenly starting to write
 

2567
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:57,880
results we're suddenly starting to write
coherent prose which was not something

2568
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:57,890
coherent prose which was not something
 

2569
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,789
coherent prose which was not something
we'd seen previously and what are we

2570
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:00,799
we'd seen previously and what are we
 

2571
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,650
we'd seen previously and what are we
doing now well we're gonna scale up GPT

2572
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:02,660
doing now well we're gonna scale up GPT
 

2573
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,589
doing now well we're gonna scale up GPT
2 by 10x by hundred X by thousand X and

2574
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:05,599
2 by 10x by hundred X by thousand X and
 

2575
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,089
2 by 10x by hundred X by thousand X and
we don't know what we're going to get

2576
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:07,099
we don't know what we're going to get
 

2577
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:09,999
we don't know what we're going to get
and so it's very clear that the model

2578
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:10,009
and so it's very clear that the model
 

2579
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:11,890
and so it's very clear that the model
that we were that we released last June

2580
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:11,900
that we were that we released last June
 

2581
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,930
that we were that we released last June
you know I think it's kind of like it's

2582
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:13,940
you know I think it's kind of like it's
 

2583
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,569
you know I think it's kind of like it's
it's it's it's a good academic toy it's

2584
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:16,579
it's it's it's a good academic toy it's
 

2585
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:18,640
it's it's it's a good academic toy it's
not something that we think is something

2586
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:18,650
not something that we think is something
 

2587
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,809
not something that we think is something
that can really have negative

2588
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:19,819
that can really have negative
 

2589
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,249
that can really have negative
applications or you know to the sense

2590
00:46:21,249 --> 00:46:21,259
applications or you know to the sense
 

2591
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:23,049
applications or you know to the sense
that it can the positive of people being

2592
00:46:23,049 --> 00:46:23,059
that it can the positive of people being
 

2593
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:25,839
that it can the positive of people being
able to play with it is you know far far

2594
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:25,849
able to play with it is you know far far
 

2595
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,599
able to play with it is you know far far
outweighs the possible harms you fast

2596
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:28,609
outweighs the possible harms you fast
 

2597
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:32,200
outweighs the possible harms you fast
forward to not GPT to buy GPU 20

2598
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:32,210
forward to not GPT to buy GPU 20
 

2599
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,640
forward to not GPT to buy GPU 20
and you think about what that's gonna be

2600
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:33,650
and you think about what that's gonna be
 

2601
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,609
and you think about what that's gonna be
like and I think that the capabilities

2602
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:36,619
like and I think that the capabilities
 

2603
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:38,470
like and I think that the capabilities
are going to be substantive and so if

2604
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:38,480
are going to be substantive and so if
 

2605
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,420
are going to be substantive and so if
there needs to be a point in between the

2606
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:40,430
there needs to be a point in between the
 

2607
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,150
there needs to be a point in between the
two where you say this is something

2608
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:43,160
two where you say this is something
 

2609
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,579
two where you say this is something
where we are drawing the line and that

2610
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:45,589
where we are drawing the line and that
 

2611
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:46,809
where we are drawing the line and that
we need to start thinking about the

2612
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:46,819
we need to start thinking about the
 

2613
00:46:46,819 --> 00:46:49,000
we need to start thinking about the
safety aspects and I think for GPT too

2614
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,010
safety aspects and I think for GPT too
 

2615
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,349
safety aspects and I think for GPT too
we could have gone either way and in

2616
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:50,359
we could have gone either way and in
 

2617
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:51,220
we could have gone either way and in
fact when we had conversations

2618
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,230
fact when we had conversations
 

2619
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,980
fact when we had conversations
internally that we had a bunch of pros

2620
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:53,990
internally that we had a bunch of pros
 

2621
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,960
internally that we had a bunch of pros
and cons and it wasn't clear which one

2622
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:55,970
and cons and it wasn't clear which one
 

2623
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,630
and cons and it wasn't clear which one
which one outweighed the other and I

2624
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:58,640
which one outweighed the other and I
 

2625
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,160
which one outweighed the other and I
think that when we announced that hey we

2626
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,170
think that when we announced that hey we
 

2627
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,290
think that when we announced that hey we
decide not to release this model then

2628
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:02,300
decide not to release this model then
 

2629
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,670
decide not to release this model then
there was a bunch of conversation where

2630
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:03,680
there was a bunch of conversation where
 

2631
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,079
there was a bunch of conversation where
various people said it's so obvious that

2632
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:05,089
various people said it's so obvious that
 

2633
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:06,460
various people said it's so obvious that
you should have just released it there

2634
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:06,470
you should have just released it there
 

2635
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,569
you should have just released it there
other people said it's so obvious you

2636
00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:07,579
other people said it's so obvious you
 

2637
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:09,040
other people said it's so obvious you
should not have released it and I think

2638
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,050
should not have released it and I think
 

2639
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:10,809
should not have released it and I think
that that almost definitionally means

2640
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:10,819
that that almost definitionally means
 

2641
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:12,460
that that almost definitionally means
that holding it back was the correct

2642
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:12,470
that holding it back was the correct
 

2643
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,589
that holding it back was the correct
decision right if it's contra if there's

2644
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:14,599
decision right if it's contra if there's
 

2645
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:16,480
decision right if it's contra if there's
if it's not obvious whether something is

2646
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:16,490
if it's not obvious whether something is
 

2647
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:18,040
if it's not obvious whether something is
beneficial or not you should probably

2648
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,050
beneficial or not you should probably
 

2649
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,500
beneficial or not you should probably
default to caution and so I think that

2650
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:20,510
default to caution and so I think that
 

2651
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,900
default to caution and so I think that
the overall landscape for how we think

2652
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:22,910
the overall landscape for how we think
 

2653
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:25,120
the overall landscape for how we think
about it is that this decision could

2654
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:25,130
about it is that this decision could
 

2655
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,319
about it is that this decision could
have gone either way there are great

2656
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:26,329
have gone either way there are great
 

2657
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:28,329
have gone either way there are great
arguments in both directions but for

2658
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:28,339
arguments in both directions but for
 

2659
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:30,700
arguments in both directions but for
future models down the road and possibly

2660
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:30,710
future models down the road and possibly
 

2661
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,710
future models down the road and possibly
sooner than you'd expect because you

2662
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:32,720
sooner than you'd expect because you
 

2663
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,520
sooner than you'd expect because you
know scaling these things up doesn't

2664
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:33,530
know scaling these things up doesn't
 

2665
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:36,640
know scaling these things up doesn't
have to take that long those ones but

2666
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:36,650
have to take that long those ones but
 

2667
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:37,900
have to take that long those ones but
you're definitely not going to want to

2668
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:37,910
you're definitely not going to want to
 

2669
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:40,690
you're definitely not going to want to
release into the wild and so I think

2670
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:40,700
release into the wild and so I think
 

2671
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,460
release into the wild and so I think
that we almost view this as a test case

2672
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:42,470
that we almost view this as a test case
 

2673
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,280
that we almost view this as a test case
and to see can we even design you know

2674
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:45,290
and to see can we even design you know
 

2675
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,079
and to see can we even design you know
how do you have a society or how do you

2676
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:47,089
how do you have a society or how do you
 

2677
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:48,760
how do you have a society or how do you
have a system that goes from having no

2678
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:48,770
have a system that goes from having no
 

2679
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,620
have a system that goes from having no
concept of responsible disclosure where

2680
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:50,630
concept of responsible disclosure where
 

2681
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,319
concept of responsible disclosure where
the mere idea of not releasing something

2682
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:53,329
the mere idea of not releasing something
 

2683
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:56,079
the mere idea of not releasing something
for safety reasons is unfamiliar to a

2684
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:56,089
for safety reasons is unfamiliar to a
 

2685
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:57,670
for safety reasons is unfamiliar to a
world where you say okay we have a

2686
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:57,680
world where you say okay we have a
 

2687
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,349
world where you say okay we have a
powerful model let's at least think

2688
00:47:59,349 --> 00:47:59,359
powerful model let's at least think
 

2689
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,329
powerful model let's at least think
about it let's go through some process

2690
00:48:00,329 --> 00:48:00,339
about it let's go through some process
 

2691
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:02,170
about it let's go through some process
and you think about the security

2692
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:02,180
and you think about the security
 

2693
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,609
and you think about the security
community it took them a long time to

2694
00:48:03,609 --> 00:48:03,619
community it took them a long time to
 

2695
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:05,710
community it took them a long time to
design responsible disclosure right you

2696
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:05,720
design responsible disclosure right you
 

2697
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,880
design responsible disclosure right you
know you think about this question of

2698
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:06,890
know you think about this question of
 

2699
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,190
know you think about this question of
well I have a security exploit I send it

2700
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:09,200
well I have a security exploit I send it
 

2701
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,870
well I have a security exploit I send it
to the company the companies like tries

2702
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:10,880
to the company the companies like tries
 

2703
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,359
to the company the companies like tries
to prosecute me or just sit just ignores

2704
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:13,369
to prosecute me or just sit just ignores
 

2705
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:16,599
to prosecute me or just sit just ignores
it what do I do right and so you know

2706
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:16,609
it what do I do right and so you know
 

2707
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:17,950
it what do I do right and so you know
the alternatives of oh I just just

2708
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:17,960
the alternatives of oh I just just
 

2709
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,000
the alternatives of oh I just just
always publish your exploits that

2710
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,010
always publish your exploits that
 

2711
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:20,410
always publish your exploits that
doesn't seem good either right and so it

2712
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:20,420
doesn't seem good either right and so it
 

2713
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,599
doesn't seem good either right and so it
really took a long time and took this

2714
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:22,609
really took a long time and took this
 

2715
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:25,089
really took a long time and took this
this it was bigger than any individual

2716
00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:25,099
this it was bigger than any individual
 

2717
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:26,530
this it was bigger than any individual
right is really about building the whole

2718
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:26,540
right is really about building the whole
 

2719
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,059
right is really about building the whole
community that believed that okay we'll

2720
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:28,069
community that believed that okay we'll
 

2721
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:29,200
community that believed that okay we'll
have this process where you send it to

2722
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,210
have this process where you send it to
 

2723
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,819
have this process where you send it to
the company you know if they don't act

2724
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:30,829
the company you know if they don't act
 

2725
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:32,559
the company you know if they don't act
in a certain time then you can go public

2726
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:32,569
in a certain time then you can go public
 

2727
00:48:32,569 --> 00:48:34,720
in a certain time then you can go public
and you're not a bad person you've done

2728
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:34,730
and you're not a bad person you've done
 

2729
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,799
and you're not a bad person you've done
the right thing and I think that in AI

2730
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:37,809
the right thing and I think that in AI
 

2731
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:40,480
the right thing and I think that in AI
part of the response of gbt to just

2732
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:40,490
part of the response of gbt to just
 

2733
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,760
part of the response of gbt to just
proves that we don't have any concept of

2734
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:42,770
proves that we don't have any concept of
 

2735
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,360
proves that we don't have any concept of
this

2736
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:43,370
this
 

2737
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:47,140
this
so that's the high level picture um and

2738
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:47,150
so that's the high level picture um and
 

2739
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,390
so that's the high level picture um and
so I think that I think this was this

2740
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:49,400
so I think that I think this was this
 

2741
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,550
so I think that I think this was this
was a really important move to make and

2742
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:51,560
was a really important move to make and
 

2743
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,380
was a really important move to make and
we could have maybe delayed it for D BT

2744
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,390
we could have maybe delayed it for D BT
 

2745
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,210
we could have maybe delayed it for D BT
3 but I'm really glad we did it for GPT

2746
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:55,220
3 but I'm really glad we did it for GPT
 

2747
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,580
3 but I'm really glad we did it for GPT
too and so now you look at GPT 2 itself

2748
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:57,590
too and so now you look at GPT 2 itself
 

2749
00:48:57,590 --> 00:48:58,750
too and so now you look at GPT 2 itself
and you think about the substance of

2750
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:58,760
and you think about the substance of
 

2751
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,310
and you think about the substance of
okay what are potential negative

2752
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:00,320
okay what are potential negative
 

2753
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,590
okay what are potential negative
applications so you have this model

2754
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:02,600
applications so you have this model
 

2755
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,000
applications so you have this model
that's been trained on the Internet

2756
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,010
that's been trained on the Internet
 

2757
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,350
that's been trained on the Internet
which you know it's also going to be a

2758
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:05,360
which you know it's also going to be a
 

2759
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,180
which you know it's also going to be a
bunch of very biased data a bunch of you

2760
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:07,190
bunch of very biased data a bunch of you
 

2761
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,980
bunch of very biased data a bunch of you
know very offensive content and there

2762
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:08,990
know very offensive content and there
 

2763
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,700
know very offensive content and there
and you can ask it to generate content

2764
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:12,710
and you can ask it to generate content
 

2765
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:14,620
and you can ask it to generate content
for you on basically any topic right you

2766
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:14,630
for you on basically any topic right you
 

2767
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:15,670
for you on basically any topic right you
just give it a prompt and we'll just

2768
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:15,680
just give it a prompt and we'll just
 

2769
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,140
just give it a prompt and we'll just
start start writing and all writes

2770
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,150
start start writing and all writes
 

2771
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,120
start start writing and all writes
content like you see on the internet you

2772
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:19,130
content like you see on the internet you
 

2773
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,500
content like you see on the internet you
know even down to like saying

2774
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:20,510
know even down to like saying
 

2775
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,870
know even down to like saying
advertisement in the middle of some of

2776
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:22,880
advertisement in the middle of some of
 

2777
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,570
advertisement in the middle of some of
its generations and you think about the

2778
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:25,580
its generations and you think about the
 

2779
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,400
its generations and you think about the
possibilities for generating fake news

2780
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:27,410
possibilities for generating fake news
 

2781
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,710
possibilities for generating fake news
or abusive content and you know it's

2782
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:29,720
or abusive content and you know it's
 

2783
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,820
or abusive content and you know it's
interesting seeing what people have done

2784
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:30,830
interesting seeing what people have done
 

2785
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,680
interesting seeing what people have done
with you know we released a smaller

2786
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:32,690
with you know we released a smaller
 

2787
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,680
with you know we released a smaller
version of GPT too and the people have

2788
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:35,690
version of GPT too and the people have
 

2789
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:37,600
version of GPT too and the people have
done things like try to generate now I

2790
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:37,610
done things like try to generate now I
 

2791
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,880
done things like try to generate now I
you know take my own Facebook message

2792
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:39,890
you know take my own Facebook message
 

2793
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,710
you know take my own Facebook message
history and generate more Facebook

2794
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:41,720
history and generate more Facebook
 

2795
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,890
history and generate more Facebook
messages like me and people generating

2796
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:44,900
messages like me and people generating
 

2797
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,070
messages like me and people generating
fake politician content or you know

2798
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:48,080
fake politician content or you know
 

2799
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,660
fake politician content or you know
there's a bunch of things there where

2800
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:49,670
there's a bunch of things there where
 

2801
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,480
there's a bunch of things there where
you at least have to think is this going

2802
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:52,490
you at least have to think is this going
 

2803
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:55,240
you at least have to think is this going
to be good for the world there's the

2804
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:55,250
to be good for the world there's the
 

2805
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,590
to be good for the world there's the
flip side which is I think that there's

2806
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:56,600
flip side which is I think that there's
 

2807
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,910
flip side which is I think that there's
a lot of awesome applications that we

2808
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:57,920
a lot of awesome applications that we
 

2809
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,540
a lot of awesome applications that we
really want to see like creative

2810
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:00,550
really want to see like creative
 

2811
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,010
really want to see like creative
applications in terms of if you have

2812
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:03,020
applications in terms of if you have
 

2813
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,960
applications in terms of if you have
sci-fi authors that can work with this

2814
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:04,970
sci-fi authors that can work with this
 

2815
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,910
sci-fi authors that can work with this
tool and come up with cool ideas like

2816
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:06,920
tool and come up with cool ideas like
 

2817
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,860
tool and come up with cool ideas like
that seems that seems awesome if we can

2818
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:08,870
that seems that seems awesome if we can
 

2819
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:10,060
that seems that seems awesome if we can
write better sci-fi through the use of

2820
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:10,070
write better sci-fi through the use of
 

2821
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,950
write better sci-fi through the use of
these tools and we've actually had a

2822
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:11,960
these tools and we've actually had a
 

2823
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,390
these tools and we've actually had a
bunch of people write in to us asking

2824
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:13,400
bunch of people write in to us asking
 

2825
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,270
bunch of people write in to us asking
hey can we use it for you know for a

2826
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:16,280
hey can we use it for you know for a
 

2827
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,110
hey can we use it for you know for a
variety of different creative

2828
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:17,120
variety of different creative
 

2829
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,690
variety of different creative
applications so the positive I actually

2830
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:19,700
applications so the positive I actually
 

2831
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,310
applications so the positive I actually
pretty easy to imagine there if you know

2832
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:24,320
pretty easy to imagine there if you know
 

2833
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,240
pretty easy to imagine there if you know
the usual

2834
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:25,250
the usual

NLP applications are really interesting

2836
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:28,490
NLP applications are really interesting
 

2837
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,240
NLP applications are really interesting
but let's go there it's kind of

2838
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:31,250
but let's go there it's kind of
 

2839
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,360
but let's go there it's kind of
interesting to think about a world where

2840
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:33,370
interesting to think about a world where
 

2841
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:37,360
interesting to think about a world where
look at Twitter where that just fake

2842
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:37,370
look at Twitter where that just fake
 

2843
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,480
look at Twitter where that just fake
news but smarter and smarter BOTS being

2844
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:40,490
news but smarter and smarter BOTS being
 

2845
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:44,230
news but smarter and smarter BOTS being
able to spread in an interesting complex

2846
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:44,240
able to spread in an interesting complex
 

2847
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,470
able to spread in an interesting complex
in that working way in information that

2848
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:47,480
in that working way in information that
 

2849
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,140
in that working way in information that
just floods out us regular human beings

2850
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,150
just floods out us regular human beings
 

2851
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:54,520
just floods out us regular human beings
with our original thoughts so what are

2852
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:54,530
with our original thoughts so what are

your views of this world with deep
 

2855
00:50:57,319 --> 00:51:00,939
your views of this world with deep
t20 right what are you how do we think

2856
00:51:00,939 --> 00:51:00,949
t20 right what are you how do we think
 

2857
00:51:00,949 --> 00:51:02,199
t20 right what are you how do we think
about again it's like one of those

2858
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:02,209
about again it's like one of those
 

2859
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:03,969
about again it's like one of those
things about in the 50s trying to

2860
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:03,979
things about in the 50s trying to
 

2861
00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:07,539
things about in the 50s trying to

describe the the internet or the
 

2863
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:09,309
describe the the internet or the

smartphone what do you think about that
 

2865
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:11,979
smartphone what do you think about that
world the nature of information do we

2866
00:51:11,979 --> 00:51:11,989
world the nature of information do we
 

2867
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:15,189
world the nature of information do we
and one possibility is that we'll always

and one possibility is that we'll always

try to design systems that identify it

2870
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:17,630
try to design systems that identify it
 

2871
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:20,499
try to design systems that identify it
robot versus human and we'll do so

2872
00:51:20,499 --> 00:51:20,509
robot versus human and we'll do so
 

2873
00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:22,900
robot versus human and we'll do so
successfully and so we will authenticate

2874
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:22,910
successfully and so we will authenticate
 

2875
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,969
successfully and so we will authenticate
that we're still human and the other

2876
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:24,979
that we're still human and the other
 

2877
00:51:24,979 --> 00:51:27,009
that we're still human and the other
world is that we just accept the part

00:51:27,009 --> 00:51:27,019
world is that we just accept the part

world is that we just accept the part
the fact that we're swimming in a sea of

the fact that we're swimming in a sea of
 

2881

the fact that we're swimming in a sea of
fake news and just learn to swim there

fake news and just learn to swim there
 

2883
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:34,719
fake news and just learn to swim there
well have you ever seen the there so you

2884
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:34,729
well have you ever seen the there so you
 

2885
00:51:34,729 --> 00:51:39,969
well have you ever seen the there so you
know popular meme of of robot eye with a

2886
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:39,979
know popular meme of of robot eye with a
 

2887
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:41,709
know popular meme of of robot eye with a
physical physical arm and pen clicking

2888
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:41,719
physical physical arm and pen clicking
 

2889
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:45,430
physical physical arm and pen clicking
the I'm not a robot button yeah I think

2890
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
the I'm not a robot button yeah I think
 

2891
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,799
the I'm not a robot button yeah I think
I think the truth is that that really

2892
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:47,809
I think the truth is that that really
 

2893
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:50,079
I think the truth is that that really
trying to distinguish between robot and

2894
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:50,089
trying to distinguish between robot and
 

2895
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:52,779
trying to distinguish between robot and
human is a losing battle ultimately you

2896
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:52,789
human is a losing battle ultimately you
 

2897
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:54,099
human is a losing battle ultimately you
think it's a losing battle I think it's

2898
00:51:54,099 --> 00:51:54,109
think it's a losing battle I think it's
 

2899
00:51:54,109 --> 00:51:55,779
think it's a losing battle I think it's
a losing battle ultimately right I think

2900
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:55,789
a losing battle ultimately right I think
 

2901
00:51:55,789 --> 00:51:57,339
a losing battle ultimately right I think
that that is that in terms of the

2902
00:51:57,339 --> 00:51:57,349
that that is that in terms of the
 

2903
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:58,719
that that is that in terms of the
content in terms of the actions that you

2904
00:51:58,719 --> 00:51:58,729
content in terms of the actions that you
 

2905
00:51:58,729 --> 00:52:00,370
content in terms of the actions that you
can take I mean think about how captures

2906
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:00,380
can take I mean think about how captures
 

2907
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:00,849
can take I mean think about how captures
have gone

2908
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:00,859
have gone
 

2909
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:02,109
have gone
alright the captures used to be a very

2910
00:52:02,109 --> 00:52:02,119
alright the captures used to be a very
 

2911
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,049
alright the captures used to be a very
nice simple you have this image all of

00:52:05,049 --> 00:52:05,059
nice simple you have this image all of

00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,939
nice simple you have this image all of
our OCR is terrible you put a couple of

2914
00:52:06,939 --> 00:52:06,949
our OCR is terrible you put a couple of
 

2915
00:52:06,949 --> 00:52:09,219
our OCR is terrible you put a couple of
of artifacts in it you know humans are

2916
00:52:09,219 --> 00:52:09,229
of artifacts in it you know humans are
 

2917
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:11,529
of artifacts in it you know humans are
gonna be able to tell what what it is an

00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:11,539
gonna be able to tell what what it is an
 

2919
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:13,959
gonna be able to tell what what it is an
AI system wouldn't be able to today like

2920
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:13,969
AI system wouldn't be able to today like
 

2921
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,910
AI system wouldn't be able to today like
I can barely do CAPTCHAs yeah and I

2922
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:15,920
I can barely do CAPTCHAs yeah and I
 

2923
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,799
I can barely do CAPTCHAs yeah and I
think that that this is just kind of

2924
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:17,809
think that that this is just kind of
 

2925
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:19,059
think that that this is just kind of
where we're going I think CAPTCHAs where

2926
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:19,069
where we're going I think CAPTCHAs where
 

2927
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,859
where we're going I think CAPTCHAs where
we're a moment in time thing and as AI

2928
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:20,869
we're a moment in time thing and as AI
 

2929
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:22,539
we're a moment in time thing and as AI
you systems become more powerful that

2930
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:22,549
you systems become more powerful that
 

2931
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:24,849
you systems become more powerful that
they're being human capabilities that

2932
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:24,859
they're being human capabilities that
 

2933
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:26,650
they're being human capabilities that
can be measured in a very easy automated

2934
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:26,660
can be measured in a very easy automated
 

2935
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,469
can be measured in a very easy automated
way that the a eyes will not be capable

2936
00:52:29,469 --> 00:52:29,479
way that the a eyes will not be capable
 

2937
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,479
way that the a eyes will not be capable
of I think that's just like it's just an

2938
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:31,489
of I think that's just like it's just an
 

2939
00:52:31,489 --> 00:52:34,299
of I think that's just like it's just an
increasingly hard technical battle but

2940
00:52:34,299 --> 00:52:34,309
increasingly hard technical battle but
 

2941
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:36,279
increasingly hard technical battle but
it's not that all hope is lost right and

2942
00:52:36,279 --> 00:52:36,289
it's not that all hope is lost right and
 

2943
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:38,199
it's not that all hope is lost right and
you think about how do we already

2944
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:38,209
you think about how do we already
 

2945
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:40,930
you think about how do we already
authenticate ourselves right the you

2946
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:40,940
authenticate ourselves right the you
 

2947
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,759
authenticate ourselves right the you
know we have systems we have social

2948
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:42,769
know we have systems we have social
 

2949
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:43,989
know we have systems we have social
security numbers if you're in the u.s.

2950
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:43,999
security numbers if you're in the u.s.
 

2951
00:52:43,999 --> 00:52:46,539
security numbers if you're in the u.s.
or you know you have you have uh you

2952
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:46,549
or you know you have you have uh you
 

2953
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:48,039
or you know you have you have uh you
know ways of identifying individual

2954
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:48,049
know ways of identifying individual
 

2955
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:49,839
know ways of identifying individual
people and having real world identity

2956
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:49,849
people and having real world identity
 

2957
00:52:49,849 --> 00:52:52,359
people and having real world identity
tied to to digital identity seems like a

2958
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:52,369
tied to to digital identity seems like a
 

2959
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:55,420
tied to to digital identity seems like a
step towards you know authenticating the

2960
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:55,430
step towards you know authenticating the
 

2961
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,559
step towards you know authenticating the
source of content rather than the

2962
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:56,569
source of content rather than the
 

2963
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:59,199
source of content rather than the
content itself now there are problems

2964
00:52:59,199 --> 00:52:59,209
content itself now there are problems
 

2965
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,150
content itself now there are problems
with that how can you have privacy and

2966
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:01,160
with that how can you have privacy and
 

2967
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,279
with that how can you have privacy and
unanimity in a world where the only

2968
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:03,289
unanimity in a world where the only
 

2969
00:53:03,289 --> 00:53:05,620
unanimity in a world where the only
content you can really trust is or the

2970
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:05,630
content you can really trust is or the
 

2971
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:06,789
content you can really trust is or the
only way you can trust content is by

2972
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:06,799
only way you can trust content is by
 

2973
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:09,249
only way you can trust content is by
looking at where it comes from and so I

2974
00:53:09,249 --> 00:53:09,259
looking at where it comes from and so I
 

2975
00:53:09,259 --> 00:53:10,769
looking at where it comes from and so I
think that building out good reputation

2976
00:53:10,769 --> 00:53:10,779
think that building out good reputation
 

2977
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:13,049

networks maybe maybe one possible

2978
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:13,059
networks maybe maybe one possible
 

2979
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:15,179
networks maybe maybe one possible
solution but yeah I think that this this

2980
00:53:15,179 --> 00:53:15,189
solution but yeah I think that this this
 

2981
00:53:15,189 --> 00:53:17,039
solution but yeah I think that this this
question is it's not an obvious one and

2982
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:17,049
question is it's not an obvious one and

00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:19,709
question is it's not an obvious one and
I think that we you know maybe sooner

I think that we you know maybe sooner
 

2985
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:20,999
I think that we you know maybe sooner
than we think we'll be in a world where

than we think we'll be in a world where
 

2987

00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:50,099
gap between us and AI systems is the

00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:08,049
talking to a human and and I think that
 

3081
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:09,659
talking to a human and and I think that
again this comes down to identity and so

3082

again this comes down to identity and so

00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:11,669
again this comes down to identity and so
I think that the Internet of the future

00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:17,339
of agents out there that will interact
with with you but I think that the

3090
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:17,349
with with you but I think that the
 

3091
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:19,859

00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:51,380
world where ideas can come from models
 

3113
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,770
world where ideas can come from models
trained on human data yeah I think this

3114
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:53,780
trained on human data yeah I think this
 

3115
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,970
trained on human data yeah I think this
is I think is actually a really

3116
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:54,980
is I think is actually a really
 

3117
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,290
is I think is actually a really
interesting question this comes back to

3118
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:56,300
interesting question this comes back to
 

3119
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,210
interesting question this comes back to
the how do you even picture a world with

3120
00:55:58,210 --> 00:55:58,220
the how do you even picture a world with
 

3121
00:55:58,220 --> 00:55:59,890
the how do you even picture a world with
some new technology right and I think

3122
00:55:59,890 --> 00:55:59,900
some new technology right and I think
 

3123
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,960
some new technology right and I think
that that one thing I think is important

3124
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:01,970
that that one thing I think is important
 

3125
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:05,170
that that one thing I think is important
is is you know Gosei honesty um and I

3126
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:05,180
is is you know Gosei honesty um and I
 

3127
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:06,970
is is you know Gosei honesty um and I
think that if you have you know almost

3128
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:06,980
think that if you have you know almost
 

3129
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:10,020
think that if you have you know almost
in the Turing test style sense sense of

3130
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,030
in the Turing test style sense sense of
 

3131
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:12,099
in the Turing test style sense sense of
technology you have a eyes that are

3132
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:12,109
technology you have a eyes that are
 

3133
00:56:12,109 --> 00:56:13,720
technology you have a eyes that are
pretending to be humans and deceiving

3134
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:13,730
pretending to be humans and deceiving
 

3135
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:15,940
pretending to be humans and deceiving
you I think that is you know that that

3136
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:15,950
you I think that is you know that that
 

3137
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:17,650
you I think that is you know that that
feels like a bad thing right I think

3138
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:17,660
feels like a bad thing right I think
 

3139
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,540
feels like a bad thing right I think
that it's really important that we feel

3140
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:19,550
that it's really important that we feel
 

3141
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:20,650
that it's really important that we feel
like we're in control of our environment

3142
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:20,660
like we're in control of our environment
 

3143
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,660
like we're in control of our environment
right that we understand who we're

3144
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:22,670
right that we understand who we're
 

3145
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,520
right that we understand who we're
interacting with and if it's an AI or a

3146
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:24,530
interacting with and if it's an AI or a
 

3147
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:27,430
interacting with and if it's an AI or a
human um that that's not something we're

3148
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,440
human um that that's not something we're
 

3149
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,109
human um that that's not something we're
being deceived about but I think that

3150
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:29,119
being deceived about but I think that
 

3151
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,820
being deceived about but I think that
the flipside of can I have as a

3152
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:30,830
the flipside of can I have as a
 

3153
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:32,440
the flipside of can I have as a
meaningful of an interaction with an AI

3154
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:32,450
meaningful of an interaction with an AI
 

3155
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,930
meaningful of an interaction with an AI
as I can with a human well I actually

3156
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:34,940
as I can with a human well I actually
 

3157
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,240
as I can with a human well I actually
think here you can turn to sci-fi and

3158
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:37,250
think here you can turn to sci-fi and
 

3159
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,579
think here you can turn to sci-fi and
her I think is a great example of asking

3160
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:39,589
her I think is a great example of asking
 

3161
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:41,410
her I think is a great example of asking
this very question right and one thing I

3162
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:41,420
this very question right and one thing I
 

3163
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,490
this very question right and one thing I
really love about her is it really

3164
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:42,500
really love about her is it really
 

3165
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,410
really love about her is it really
starts out almost by asking how

3166
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:44,420
starts out almost by asking how
 

3167
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,120
starts out almost by asking how
meaningful are human virtual

3168
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,130
meaningful are human virtual
 

3169
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,940
meaningful are human virtual
relationships right and and then you

3170
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:48,950
relationships right and and then you
 

3171
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:50,500
relationships right and and then you
have a human who has a relationship with

3172
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:50,510
have a human who has a relationship with
 

3173
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:53,290
have a human who has a relationship with
an AI and that you really start to be

3174
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:53,300
an AI and that you really start to be
 

3175
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,700
an AI and that you really start to be
drawn into that right and that all of

3176
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:54,710
drawn into that right and that all of
 

3177
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,829
drawn into that right and that all of
your emotional buttons get triggered in

3178
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:56,839
your emotional buttons get triggered in
 

3179
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:58,120
your emotional buttons get triggered in
the same way as if there was a real

3180
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:58,130
the same way as if there was a real
 

3181
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:59,710
the same way as if there was a real
human that was on the other side of that

3182
00:56:59,710 --> 00:56:59,720
human that was on the other side of that
 

3183
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,650
human that was on the other side of that
phone and so I think that that this is

3184
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:02,660
phone and so I think that that this is
 

3185
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,300
phone and so I think that that this is
one way of thinking about it is that I

3186
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:04,310
one way of thinking about it is that I
 

3187
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:06,130
one way of thinking about it is that I
think that we can have meaningful

3188
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:06,140
think that we can have meaningful
 

3189
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,290
think that we can have meaningful
interactions and that if there's a funny

3190
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:08,300
interactions and that if there's a funny
 

3191
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,630
interactions and that if there's a funny
joke some sense it doesn't really matter

3192
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:10,640
joke some sense it doesn't really matter
 

3193
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,099
joke some sense it doesn't really matter
if it was written by a human or an AI

3194
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:12,109
if it was written by a human or an AI
 

3195
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:14,829
if it was written by a human or an AI
but what you don't want anyway I think

3196
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:14,839
but what you don't want anyway I think
 

3197
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:16,240
but what you don't want anyway I think
we should really draw hard lines is

3198
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:16,250
we should really draw hard lines is
 

3199
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,230
we should really draw hard lines is
deception

3200
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:17,240
deception
 

3201
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,030
deception
and I think that as long as we're in a

3202
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040
and I think that as long as we're in a
 

3203
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,950
and I think that as long as we're in a
world where you know why do why do we

3204
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:20,960
world where you know why do why do we
 

3205
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,690
world where you know why do why do we
build AI systems at all alright the

3206
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:22,700
build AI systems at all alright the
 

3207
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,829
build AI systems at all alright the
reason we want to build them is to

3208
00:57:23,829 --> 00:57:23,839
reason we want to build them is to
 

3209
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:25,540
reason we want to build them is to
enhance human lives to make humans be

3210
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:25,550
enhance human lives to make humans be
 

3211
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:27,160
enhance human lives to make humans be
able to do more things to have human

3212
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:27,170
able to do more things to have human
 

3213
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:29,440
able to do more things to have human
humans feel more fulfilled and if we can

3214
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:29,450
humans feel more fulfilled and if we can
 

3215
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,230
humans feel more fulfilled and if we can
build AI systems that do that I you know

3216
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:32,240
build AI systems that do that I you know
 

3217
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,329
build AI systems that do that I you know
sign me up so the process of language

3218
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:34,339
sign me up so the process of language
 

3219
00:57:34,339 --> 00:57:36,300
sign me up so the process of language
modeling

3220
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,310
modeling
 

3221
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,970
modeling
how far do you think it take us let's

3222
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:38,980
how far do you think it take us let's
 

3223
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,320
how far do you think it take us let's
look at movie her do you think a dialog

3224
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:43,330
look at movie her do you think a dialog
 

3225
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,120
look at movie her do you think a dialog
natural language conversation is

3226
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:45,130
natural language conversation is
 

3227
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,859
natural language conversation is
formulated by the Turing test for

3228
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:46,869
formulated by the Turing test for
 

3229
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:49,740
formulated by the Turing test for
example do you think that process could

3230
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:49,750
example do you think that process could
 

3231
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,180
example do you think that process could
be achieved through this kind of

3232
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:51,190
be achieved through this kind of
 

3233
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,250
be achieved through this kind of
unsupervised language modeling so I

3234
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:53,260
unsupervised language modeling so I
 

3235
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,890
unsupervised language modeling so I
think the Turing test in it seems real

3236
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:55,900
think the Turing test in it seems real
 

3237
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,620
think the Turing test in it seems real
form isn't just about language right

3238
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:58,630
form isn't just about language right
 

3239
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:00,480
form isn't just about language right
it's really about reasoning to write

3240
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:00,490
it's really about reasoning to write
 

3241
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,920
it's really about reasoning to write
that to really pass the Turing test I

3242
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:01,930
that to really pass the Turing test I
 

3243
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:04,020
that to really pass the Turing test I
should be able to teach calculus to

3244
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,030
should be able to teach calculus to
 

3245
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:06,270
should be able to teach calculus to
whoever's on the other side and have it

3246
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:06,280
whoever's on the other side and have it
 

3247
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,740
whoever's on the other side and have it
really understand calculus and be able

3248
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:07,750
really understand calculus and be able
 

3249
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,840
really understand calculus and be able
to you know go and solve new calculus

3250
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:09,850
to you know go and solve new calculus
 

3251
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:12,599
to you know go and solve new calculus
problems and so I think that to really

3252
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:12,609
problems and so I think that to really
 

3253
00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:14,940
problems and so I think that to really
solve the Turing test we need more than

3254
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:14,950
solve the Turing test we need more than
 

3255
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,230
solve the Turing test we need more than
what we're seeing with language models

3256
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:16,240
what we're seeing with language models
 

3257
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,790
what we're seeing with language models
we need some way of plugging and

3258
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:17,800
we need some way of plugging and
 

3259
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,820
we need some way of plugging and
reasoning now how different will that be

3260
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:20,830
reasoning now how different will that be
 

3261
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,890
reasoning now how different will that be
from what we already do that's an open

3262
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:22,900
from what we already do that's an open
 

3263
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,480
from what we already do that's an open
question right might be that we need

3264
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:24,490
question right might be that we need
 

3265
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:26,430
question right might be that we need
some sequence of totally radical new

3266
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:26,440
some sequence of totally radical new
 

3267
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,349
some sequence of totally radical new
ideas or it might be that we just need

3268
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:28,359
ideas or it might be that we just need
 

3269
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:30,570
ideas or it might be that we just need
to kind of shape our existing systems in

3270
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:30,580
to kind of shape our existing systems in
 

3271
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,420
to kind of shape our existing systems in
a slightly different way but I think

3272
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:33,430
a slightly different way but I think
 

3273
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,859
a slightly different way but I think
that in terms of how far language

3274
00:58:34,859 --> 00:58:34,869
that in terms of how far language
 

3275
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:36,810
that in terms of how far language
modeling will go it's already gone way

3276
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:36,820
modeling will go it's already gone way
 

3277
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,490
modeling will go it's already gone way
further than many people would have

3278
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:38,500
further than many people would have
 

3279
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,349
further than many people would have
expected right I think that things like

3280
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:40,359
expected right I think that things like
 

3281
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:41,820
expected right I think that things like
and I think there's a lot of really

3282
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:41,830
and I think there's a lot of really
 

3283
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,740
and I think there's a lot of really
interesting angles to poke in terms of

3284
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:43,750
interesting angles to poke in terms of
 

3285
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:47,340
interesting angles to poke in terms of
how much does GBT to understand physical

3286
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:47,350
how much does GBT to understand physical
 

3287
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,050
how much does GBT to understand physical
world like you know you you read a

3288
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:49,060
world like you know you you read a
 

3289
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,930
world like you know you you read a
little bit about fire under water in ng

3290
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:51,940
little bit about fire under water in ng
 

3291
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,340
little bit about fire under water in ng
bt - so it's like okay maybe it doesn't

3292
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:53,350
bt - so it's like okay maybe it doesn't
 

3293

quite understand what these things are

3294
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:54,760
quite understand what these things are
 

3295
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,660
quite understand what these things are
but at the same time I think that you

3296
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:57,670
but at the same time I think that you
 

3297
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,520
but at the same time I think that you
also see various things like smoke

3298
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,530
also see various things like smoke
 

3299
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:01,290
also see various things like smoke
coming from flame and you know a bunch

3300
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:01,300
coming from flame and you know a bunch
 

3301
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,090

00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,700

just statically read data and I think

3306
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:08,710
just statically read data and I think
 

3307
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,250
just statically read data and I think
that I think that if the answer is like

3308
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:11,260
that I think that if the answer is like
 

3309
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,570
that I think that if the answer is like
we don't know yet

3310
00:59:12,570 --> 00:59:12,580
we don't know yet
 

3311
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,670
we don't know yet
then these questions though we're

3312
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:14,680
then these questions though we're
 

3313
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,109
then these questions though we're
starting to be able to actually ask them

3314
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:16,119
starting to be able to actually ask them
 

3315
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,150
starting to be able to actually ask them
to physical systems the real systems

3316
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:18,160
to physical systems the real systems
 

3317
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,920
to physical systems the real systems
that exist and that's very exciting do

3318
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:19,930
that exist and that's very exciting do
 

3319
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:21,270
that exist and that's very exciting do
you think what's your intuition do you

3320
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
you think what's your intuition do you
 

3321
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,160
you think what's your intuition do you
think if you just scale language

3322
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,170
think if you just scale language
 

3323
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:27,150
think if you just scale language
modeling maintain like significantly

3324
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:27,160
modeling maintain like significantly
 

3325
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,580
modeling maintain like significantly
scale that reasoning can emerge from the

3326
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:29,590
scale that reasoning can emerge from the
 

3327
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,620
scale that reasoning can emerge from the
same exact mechanisms I think it's

3328
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:31,630
same exact mechanisms I think it's
 

3329
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,750
same exact mechanisms I think it's
unlikely that if we just scale

3330
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:33,760
unlikely that if we just scale
 

3331
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,109
unlikely that if we just scale
gbt - that will have reasoning in the

3332
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119
gbt - that will have reasoning in the
 

3333
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,060
gbt - that will have reasoning in the
full-fledged way and I think that there

3334
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:39,070
full-fledged way and I think that there
 

3335
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,590
full-fledged way and I think that there
is like you know the type signature is a

3336
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:40,600
is like you know the type signature is a
 

3337
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,330
is like you know the type signature is a
little bit wrong right that like there's

3338
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:42,340
little bit wrong right that like there's
 

3339
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,820
little bit wrong right that like there's
something we do with that we call

3340
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:44,830
something we do with that we call
 

3341
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,740
something we do with that we call
thinking right where we spend a lot of

00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:46,750
thinking right where we spend a lot of

get to better answers right I think a

00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:50,910
get to better answers right I think a
 

3349
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,220
get to better answers right I think a
little bit harder I get a better answer

3350
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:52,230
little bit harder I get a better answer
 

3351
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:55,100
little bit harder I get a better answer
and that that kind of type signature

3352
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:55,110
and that that kind of type signature
 

3353
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:58,940
and that that kind of type signature
isn't quite encoded in a gbt all right G

3354
00:59:58,940 --> 00:59:58,950
isn't quite encoded in a gbt all right G
 

3355
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,040
isn't quite encoded in a gbt all right G
BT well kind of like it's been a long

3356
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,050
BT well kind of like it's been a long
 

3357
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,170
BT well kind of like it's been a long
time and it's like evolutionary history

3358
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:03,180
time and it's like evolutionary history
 

3359
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,700

baking and all this information getting

3360
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:04,710
baking and all this information getting
 

3361
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,050

very very good at this predictive

3362
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:06,060
very very good at this predictive
 

3363
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,960
very very good at this predictive
process and then at runtime I just kind

3364
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:08,970
process and then at runtime I just kind
 

3365
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,840
process and then at runtime I just kind
of do one forward pass and and am able

3366
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:11,850
of do one forward pass and and am able
 

3367
01:00:11,850 --> 01:00:14,420
of do one forward pass and and am able
to generate stuff and so you know there

3368
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:14,430
to generate stuff and so you know there
 

3369
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:16,700
to generate stuff and so you know there
might be small tweaks to what we do in

3370
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:16,710
might be small tweaks to what we do in
 

3371
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:17,870
might be small tweaks to what we do in
order to get the type signature right

3372
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:17,880
order to get the type signature right
 

3373
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,580
order to get the type signature right
for example well you know it's not

3374
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:19,590
for example well you know it's not
 

3375
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:21,140
for example well you know it's not
really one forward pass right you know

3376
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:21,150
really one forward pass right you know
 

3377
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,820
really one forward pass right you know
you generate symbol by symbol and so

3378
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:22,830
you generate symbol by symbol and so
 

3379
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,470
you generate symbol by symbol and so
maybe you generate like a whole sequence

3380
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:24,480
maybe you generate like a whole sequence
 

3381
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,300
maybe you generate like a whole sequence
of thoughts and you only keep like the

3382
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:26,310
of thoughts and you only keep like the
 

3383
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:28,370
of thoughts and you only keep like the
last bit or something right um but I

3384
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:28,380
last bit or something right um but I
 

3385
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:29,930
last bit or something right um but I
think that at the very least I would

3386
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:29,940
think that at the very least I would
 

3387
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,130
think that at the very least I would
expect you have to make changes like

3388
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:31,140
expect you have to make changes like
 

3389
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,340
expect you have to make changes like
that yeah yeah just exactly how we you

3390
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:34,350
that yeah yeah just exactly how we you
 

3391
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:36,890
that yeah yeah just exactly how we you
said think is the process of generating

3392
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:36,900
said think is the process of generating
 

3393
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,050
said think is the process of generating
thought by thought in the same kind of

3394
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:39,060
thought by thought in the same kind of
 

3395
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,300
thought by thought in the same kind of
way you like you said keep the last bit

3396
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:41,310
way you like you said keep the last bit
 

3397
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:43,580
way you like you said keep the last bit
the thing that we converge towards you

3398
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:43,590
the thing that we converge towards you
 

3399
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,740
the thing that we converge towards you
know and I think there's there's another

3400
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:45,750
know and I think there's there's another
 

3401
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:47,150
know and I think there's there's another
piece which is which is interesting

3402
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:47,160
piece which is which is interesting
 

3403
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,980
piece which is which is interesting
which is this out of distribution

3404
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:48,990
which is this out of distribution
 

3405
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,840
which is this out of distribution
generalization right that like thinking

3406
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:50,850
generalization right that like thinking
 

3407
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,910
generalization right that like thinking
somehow lets us do that right that we

01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:52,920
somehow lets us do that right that we
 

3409
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,710
somehow lets us do that right that we

01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:54,720
have an experience a thing and yet
 

3411
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,120
have an experience a thing and yet
somehow we just kind of keep refine our

somehow we just kind of keep refine our

something that feels tied to whatever

reasoning is and maybe it's a small

01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:04,620
reasoning is and maybe it's a small
 

3419
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,200
reasoning is and maybe it's a small
tweak to what we do maybe it's many

3420
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:06,210
tweak to what we do maybe it's many
 

3421
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,370
tweak to what we do maybe it's many

3482
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:29,890
fine-tuned expert to tuned a method yeah
 

3483
01:02:29,890 --> 01:02:32,009
fine-tuned expert to tuned a method yeah
so I think that well one thing that I

3484
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:32,019
so I think that well one thing that I
 

3485
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:33,150
so I think that well one thing that I
think was really interesting about the

3486
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:33,160
think was really interesting about the
 

3487
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,430
think was really interesting about the
reaction to that blog post was that a

3488
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:35,440
reaction to that blog post was that a
 

3489
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,509
reaction to that blog post was that a
lot of people have read this as saying

3490
01:02:36,509 --> 01:02:36,519
lot of people have read this as saying
 

3491
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,390
lot of people have read this as saying
that compute is all that matters and

3492
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:39,400
that compute is all that matters and
 

3493
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,489
that compute is all that matters and
it's a very threatening idea right and I

3494
01:02:41,489 --> 01:02:41,499
it's a very threatening idea right and I
 

3495
01:02:41,499 --> 01:02:42,749
it's a very threatening idea right and I
don't think it's a true idea either

3496
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:42,759
don't think it's a true idea either
 

3497
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,609
don't think it's a true idea either
right it's very clear that we have

3498
01:02:44,609 --> 01:02:44,619
right it's very clear that we have
 

3499
01:02:44,619 --> 01:02:46,170
right it's very clear that we have
algorithmic ideas that have been very

3500
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:46,180
algorithmic ideas that have been very
 

3501
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,239
algorithmic ideas that have been very
important for making progress and to

3502
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:48,249
important for making progress and to
 

3503
01:02:48,249 --> 01:02:50,130
important for making progress and to
really build a GI you want to push as

3504
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:50,140
really build a GI you want to push as
 

3505
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,029
really build a GI you want to push as
far as you can on the computational

3506
01:02:51,029 --> 01:02:51,039
far as you can on the computational
 

3507
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,130
far as you can on the computational
scale and you want to push as far as you

3508
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:53,140
scale and you want to push as far as you
 

3509
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,920
scale and you want to push as far as you
can on human human ingenuity and so I

3510
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:55,930
can on human human ingenuity and so I
 

3511
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:57,599
can on human human ingenuity and so I
think you need both but I think the way

3512
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:57,609
think you need both but I think the way
 

3513
01:02:57,609 --> 01:02:58,589
think you need both but I think the way
that you phrase the question is actually

3514
01:02:58,589 --> 01:02:58,599
that you phrase the question is actually
 

3515
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:00,299
that you phrase the question is actually
very good right that it's really about

3516
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:00,309
very good right that it's really about
 

3517
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:03,029
very good right that it's really about
what kind of ideas should we be striving

3518
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:03,039
what kind of ideas should we be striving
 

3519
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:05,519
what kind of ideas should we be striving
for and absolutely if you can find a

3520
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:05,529
for and absolutely if you can find a
 

3521
01:03:05,529 --> 01:03:08,339
for and absolutely if you can find a
scalable idea you'd pour more compute

3522
01:03:08,339 --> 01:03:08,349
scalable idea you'd pour more compute
 

3523
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:10,079
scalable idea you'd pour more compute
into you pour more data into it it gets

3524
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,089
into you pour more data into it it gets
 

3525
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:12,989
into you pour more data into it it gets
better like that's that's the real Holy

3526
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:12,999
better like that's that's the real Holy
 

3527
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:16,049
better like that's that's the real Holy
Grail and so I think that the answer to

3528
01:03:16,049 --> 01:03:16,059
Grail and so I think that the answer to
 

3529
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:18,690
Grail and so I think that the answer to
the question I think is yes that that's

3530
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:18,700
the question I think is yes that that's
 

3531
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,579
the question I think is yes that that's
really how we think about it that part

3532
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:20,589
really how we think about it that part
 

3533
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:22,650
really how we think about it that part
of why we're excited about the power of

3534
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:22,660
of why we're excited about the power of
 

3535
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,569
of why we're excited about the power of
deep learning the potential for building

3536
01:03:24,569 --> 01:03:24,579
deep learning the potential for building
 

3537
01:03:24,579 --> 01:03:26,880
deep learning the potential for building
an AGI is because we look at the system

3538
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:26,890
an AGI is because we look at the system
 

3539
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:28,680
an AGI is because we look at the system
that exists in the most successful AI

3540
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:28,690
that exists in the most successful AI
 

3541
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:32,039
that exists in the most successful AI
systems and we realize that you scale

3542
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:32,049
systems and we realize that you scale
 

3543
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:34,170
systems and we realize that you scale
those up they're gonna work better and I

3544
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:34,180
those up they're gonna work better and I
 

3545
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:36,269
those up they're gonna work better and I
think that that scalability is something

3546
01:03:36,269 --> 01:03:36,279
think that that scalability is something
 

3547
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,440
think that that scalability is something
that really gives us hope for being able

3548
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:37,450
that really gives us hope for being able
 

3549
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,779
that really gives us hope for being able
to build transformative systems so I'll

3550
01:03:39,779 --> 01:03:39,789
to build transformative systems so I'll
 

3551
01:03:39,789 --> 01:03:41,370
to build transformative systems so I'll
tell you this is a partially an

can I possibly compete or contribute to
 

3577
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:08,609
can I possibly compete or contribute to
this world of AI if scale is so

3578
01:04:08,609 --> 01:04:08,619
this world of AI if scale is so
 

3579
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:11,430
this world of AI if scale is so
important so for if you can comment on

3580
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440
important so for if you can comment on
 

3581
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,680
important so for if you can comment on
that and in general do you think we need

3582
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:13,690
that and in general do you think we need
 

3583
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:16,020
that and in general do you think we need
to also in the future focus on

3584
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:16,030
to also in the future focus on
 

3585
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:18,990
to also in the future focus on
democratizing compute resources more

3586
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:19,000
democratizing compute resources more
 

3587
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,510
democratizing compute resources more
more or as much as we democratize the

3588
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:21,520
more or as much as we democratize the
 

3589
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,400
more or as much as we democratize the
algorithms well so the way that I think

3590
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:23,410
algorithms well so the way that I think
 

3591
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:26,940
algorithms well so the way that I think
about it is that there's this space of a

3592
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:26,950
about it is that there's this space of a
 

3593
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,280
about it is that there's this space of a
possible progress right there's a space

3594
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:29,290
possible progress right there's a space
 

3595
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,290
possible progress right there's a space
of ideas and sort of systems that will

3596
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:31,300
of ideas and sort of systems that will
 

3597
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,460
of ideas and sort of systems that will
work that will move us forward and

3598
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:32,470
work that will move us forward and
 

3599
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:35,100
work that will move us forward and
there's a portion of that space and to

3600
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:35,110
there's a portion of that space and to
 

3601
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,750
there's a portion of that space and to
some extent increasingly significant

3602
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:36,760
some extent increasingly significant
 

3603
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,460
some extent increasingly significant
portion in that space that does just

3604
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:38,470
portion in that space that does just
 

3605
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,370
portion in that space that does just
require massive compute resources and

3606
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:40,380
require massive compute resources and
 

3607
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:44,160
require massive compute resources and
for that fit I think that the answer is

3608
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:44,170
for that fit I think that the answer is
 

3609
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:46,320
for that fit I think that the answer is
kind of clear and that part of why we

3610
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:46,330
kind of clear and that part of why we
 

3611
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,000
kind of clear and that part of why we
have this structure that we do is

3612
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,010
have this structure that we do is
 

3613
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,320
have this structure that we do is
because we think it's really important

3614
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:49,330
because we think it's really important
 

3615
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:51,330
because we think it's really important
to be pushing the scale and to be you

3616
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:51,340
to be pushing the scale and to be you
 

3617
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:52,830
to be pushing the scale and to be you
know building these large clusters and

3618
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:52,840
know building these large clusters and
 

3619
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,230
know building these large clusters and
systems but there's another part portion

3620
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:55,240
systems but there's another part portion
 

3621
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,210
systems but there's another part portion
of the space that isn't about the large

3622
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:57,220
of the space that isn't about the large
 

3623
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:59,220
of the space that isn't about the large
scale compute that are these ideas that

3624
01:04:59,220 --> 01:04:59,230
scale compute that are these ideas that
 

3625
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:01,080
scale compute that are these ideas that
and again I think that for the a is to

3626
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:01,090
and again I think that for the a is to
 

3627
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:02,880
and again I think that for the a is to
really be impactful and really shine

3628
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:02,890
really be impactful and really shine
 

3629
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:04,770
really be impactful and really shine
that they should be ideas that if you

3630
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:04,780
that they should be ideas that if you
 

3631
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,330
that they should be ideas that if you
scaled them up would work way better

3632
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:06,340
scaled them up would work way better
 

3633
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,490
scaled them up would work way better
than they do at small scale um

3634
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:08,500
than they do at small scale um
 

3635
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,620
than they do at small scale um
but you can discover them without

3636
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:10,630
but you can discover them without
 

3637
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:12,900
but you can discover them without
massive computational resources and if

3638
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:12,910
massive computational resources and if
 

3639
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,760
massive computational resources and if
you look at the history of recent

3640
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:14,770
you look at the history of recent
 

3641
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:15,690
you look at the history of recent
developments you think about things like

3642
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:15,700
developments you think about things like
 

3643
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:18,360
developments you think about things like
began or the VA II that these are ones

3644
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:18,370
began or the VA II that these are ones
 

3645
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:20,280
began or the VA II that these are ones
that I think you could come up with them

3646
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:20,290
that I think you could come up with them
 

3647
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,500
that I think you could come up with them
without having and you know in practice

3648
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:22,510
without having and you know in practice
 

3649
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:23,790
without having and you know in practice
people did come up with with them

3650
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:23,800
people did come up with with them
 

3651
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,960
people did come up with with them
without having massive massive

3652
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:24,970
without having massive massive
 

3653
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:26,880
without having massive massive
computational resources alright I just

3654
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:26,890
computational resources alright I just
 

3655
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,680
computational resources alright I just
talked to being good fellow but the

3656
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:28,690
talked to being good fellow but the
 

3657
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:32,070
talked to being good fellow but the
thing is the initial gaen produce pretty

3658
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:32,080
thing is the initial gaen produce pretty
 

3659
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,280
thing is the initial gaen produce pretty

01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:04,060
who was a systems professor I remember

sitting in his tenure talk right and you

3688
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:05,950
sitting in his tenure talk right and you
 

3689
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:08,130
sitting in his tenure talk right and you
know that he had literally just gotten

3690
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:08,140
know that he had literally just gotten
 

3691
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:10,110
know that he had literally just gotten
tenure he went to Google for the summer

3692
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:10,120
tenure he went to Google for the summer
 

3693
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,620
tenure he went to Google for the summer
and I then decided he wasn't going back

3694
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:13,630
and I then decided he wasn't going back
 

3695

and I then decided he wasn't going back
it's academia right and that kind of in

01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:16,300
it's academia right and that kind of in

his bog post makes this point that look

3698
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:18,520
his bog post makes this point that look
 

3699
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,810
his bog post makes this point that look
as a systems researcher that I come with

3700
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:21,820
as a systems researcher that I come with
 

3701
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,430
as a systems researcher that I come with
these cool system ideas right and I kind

3702
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:23,440
these cool system ideas right and I kind
 

3703
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,530
these cool system ideas right and I kind
of a little proof of concept and the

3704
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:25,540
of a little proof of concept and the
 

3705
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,750
of a little proof of concept and the
best thing I can hope for is that the

3706
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
best thing I can hope for is that the
 

3707
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,770
best thing I can hope for is that the
people at Google or Yahoo

3708
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:29,780
people at Google or Yahoo
 

3709
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,740
people at Google or Yahoo
which was around at the time I will

3710
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:32,750
which was around at the time I will
 

3711
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,330
which was around at the time I will
implement it and like actually make it

3712
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:34,340
implement it and like actually make it
 

3713
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,020
implement it and like actually make it
work at scale

3714
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:35,030
work at scale
 

3715
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,550
work at scale
right that's like the dream for me right

3716
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:36,560
right that's like the dream for me right
 

3717
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,020
right that's like the dream for me right
I built the little thing and they the

3718
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:38,030
I built the little thing and they the
 

3719
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,030
I built the little thing and they the
big thing that's actually working and

3720
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:40,040
big thing that's actually working and
 

3721
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:43,450
big thing that's actually working and
for him he said I'm done with that I

3722
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:43,460
for him he said I'm done with that I
 

3723
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:44,589
for him he said I'm done with that I
want to be the person who's who's

3724
01:06:44,589 --> 01:06:44,599
want to be the person who's who's
 

3725
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:46,089
want to be the person who's who's
actually doing this building and and

3726
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:46,099
actually doing this building and and
 

3727
01:06:46,099 --> 01:06:48,010
actually doing this building and and
deploying and I think that there's a

3728
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:48,020
deploying and I think that there's a
 

3729
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:49,660
deploying and I think that there's a
similar dichotomy here right I think

3730
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:49,670
similar dichotomy here right I think
 

3731
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:50,620
similar dichotomy here right I think
that there are people who really

3732
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:50,630
that there are people who really
 

3733
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:53,800
that there are people who really
actually find value and I think it is a

3734
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:53,810
actually find value and I think it is a
 

3735
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,870
actually find value and I think it is a
valuable thing to do to be the person

3736
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:55,880
valuable thing to do to be the person
 

3737
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,490
valuable thing to do to be the person
who produces those ideas right who

3738
01:06:57,490 --> 01:06:57,500
who produces those ideas right who
 

3739
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,080
who produces those ideas right who
builds the proof of a concept and yeah

3740
01:06:59,080 --> 01:06:59,090
builds the proof of a concept and yeah
 

3741
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:01,089
builds the proof of a concept and yeah
you don't get to generate the coolest

3742
01:07:01,089 --> 01:07:01,099
you don't get to generate the coolest
 

3743
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:03,310
you don't get to generate the coolest
possible Ganim ajiz but you invent it

3744
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:03,320
possible Ganim ajiz but you invent it
 

3745
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,830
possible Ganim ajiz but you invent it
again right and so that there's that

3746
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:05,840
again right and so that there's that
 

3747
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,150
again right and so that there's that
there's there's a real trade-off there

3748
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:07,160
there's there's a real trade-off there
 

3749
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,680
there's there's a real trade-off there
and I think that's a very personal

3750
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:08,690
and I think that's a very personal
 

3751
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:09,970
and I think that's a very personal
choice but I think there's value in both

3752
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:09,980
choice but I think there's value in both
 

3753
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:13,530
choice but I think there's value in both
sides do you think creating AGI

3754
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:13,540
sides do you think creating AGI
 

3755
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:18,400
sides do you think creating AGI
something or some new models would we

3756
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:18,410
something or some new models would we
 

3757
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,710
something or some new models would we
would see echoes of the brilliance even

3758
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:20,720
would see echoes of the brilliance even
 

3759
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,750
would see echoes of the brilliance even
at the prototype level so you would be

3760
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:22,760
at the prototype level so you would be
 

3761
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,220
at the prototype level so you would be
able to develop those ideas without

3762
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:24,230
able to develop those ideas without
 

3763
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:29,050
able to develop those ideas without
scale the initial so seeds you know I

3764
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:29,060
scale the initial so seeds you know I
 

3765
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,820
scale the initial so seeds you know I
always like to look at at examples that

3766
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:30,830
always like to look at at examples that
 

3767
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:32,740
always like to look at at examples that
exist right look at real precedent and

3768
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:32,750
exist right look at real precedent and
 

3769
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:36,220
exist right look at real precedent and
so take a look at the June 2018 model

3770
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:36,230
so take a look at the June 2018 model
 

3771
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:37,570
so take a look at the June 2018 model
that we released that we scaled up to

3772
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:37,580
that we released that we scaled up to
 

3773
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:40,210
that we released that we scaled up to
turn into GPT - and you can see that at

3774
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:40,220
turn into GPT - and you can see that at
 

3775
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:42,730
turn into GPT - and you can see that at
small scale it set some records right

3776
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:42,740
small scale it set some records right
 

3777
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,980
small scale it set some records right
this was you know the devotional GPT we

3778
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:44,990
this was you know the devotional GPT we
 

3779
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:46,720
this was you know the devotional GPT we
actually had some some cool generations

3780
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:46,730
actually had some some cool generations
 

3781
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,940
actually had some some cool generations
that weren't nearly as amazing and

3782
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:48,950
that weren't nearly as amazing and
 

3783
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:51,190
that weren't nearly as amazing and
really stunning as the GPT - ones every

3784
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,200
really stunning as the GPT - ones every
 

3785
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,630
really stunning as the GPT - ones every
but it was promising it was interesting

3786
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:52,640
but it was promising it was interesting
 

3787
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,030
but it was promising it was interesting
and so I think it is the case that with

3788
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:55,040
and so I think it is the case that with
 

3789
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:55,810
and so I think it is the case that with
a lot of these ideas

3790
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:55,820
a lot of these ideas
 

3791
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:58,420
a lot of these ideas
do you see prominence at small-scale but

3792
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:58,430
do you see prominence at small-scale but
 

3793
01:07:58,430 --> 01:07:59,980
do you see prominence at small-scale but
there is an asterisk here a very big

3794
01:07:59,980 --> 01:07:59,990
there is an asterisk here a very big
 

3795
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:03,210
there is an asterisk here a very big
asterisk which is sometimes we see

3796
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:03,220
asterisk which is sometimes we see
 

3797
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:05,710
asterisk which is sometimes we see
behaviors that emerge that are

3798
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:05,720
behaviors that emerge that are
 

3799
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,780
behaviors that emerge that are
qualitatively different from anything we

3800
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:07,790
qualitatively different from anything we
 

3801
01:08:07,790 --> 01:08:09,430
qualitatively different from anything we
saw it's small scale and that the

3802
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:09,440
saw it's small scale and that the
 

3803
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,310
saw it's small scale and that the
original inventor of whatever algorithm

3804
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:12,320
original inventor of whatever algorithm
 

3805
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,230
original inventor of whatever algorithm
looks at and says I didn't think it

3806
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:14,240
looks at and says I didn't think it
 

3807
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,150
looks at and says I didn't think it
could do that this is what we saw in

3808
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:16,160
could do that this is what we saw in
 

3809
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,599
could do that this is what we saw in
DotA

3810

all right so PPO was was created by John

3812
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:18,980
all right so PPO was was created by John
 

3813
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,510
all right so PPO was was created by John
Schulman who's a researcher here and and

3814
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:21,520
Schulman who's a researcher here and and
 

3815
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,459
Schulman who's a researcher here and and
with with dota we basically just ran PPO

3816
01:08:24,459 --> 01:08:24,469
with with dota we basically just ran PPO
 

3817
01:08:24,469 --> 01:08:27,459
with with dota we basically just ran PPO
at massive massive scale and I there's

3818
01:08:27,459 --> 01:08:27,469
at massive massive scale and I there's
 

3819
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:29,019
at massive massive scale and I there's
some tweaks and in order to make it work

3820
01:08:29,019 --> 01:08:29,029
some tweaks and in order to make it work
 

3821
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:30,610
some tweaks and in order to make it work
but fundamentally it's PPO with the core

3822
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:30,620
but fundamentally it's PPO with the core
 

3823
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,390
but fundamentally it's PPO with the core
and we were able to get this long-term

3824
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,400
and we were able to get this long-term
 

3825
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,640
and we were able to get this long-term
planning these behaviors to really play

3826
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:36,650
planning these behaviors to really play
 

3827
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:39,459
planning these behaviors to really play
out on a time scale that we just thought

3828
01:08:39,459 --> 01:08:39,469
out on a time scale that we just thought
 

3829
01:08:39,469 --> 01:08:41,860
out on a time scale that we just thought
was not possible and John looked at that

3830
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:41,870
was not possible and John looked at that
 

3831
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:43,240
was not possible and John looked at that
and it was like I didn't think it could

3832
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:43,250
and it was like I didn't think it could
 

3833
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:43,700
and it was like I didn't think it could
do that

3834
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:43,710
do that
 

3835
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:45,200
do that
that's what happens when you're at three

3836
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:45,210
that's what happens when you're at three
 

3837
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:47,420
that's what happens when you're at three
orders of magnitude more scale contest

3838
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:47,430
orders of magnitude more scale contest
 

3839
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:49,460
orders of magnitude more scale contest
to that yeah but it still has the same

3840
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:49,470
to that yeah but it still has the same
 

3841
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:53,720
to that yeah but it still has the same
flavors of you know at least echoes of

3842
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:53,730
flavors of you know at least echoes of
 

3843
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:56,540
flavors of you know at least echoes of
the expected billions although I suspect

3844
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:56,550
the expected billions although I suspect
 

3845
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:59,120
the expected billions although I suspect
with GPT is scaled more and more you

3846
01:08:59,120 --> 01:08:59,130
with GPT is scaled more and more you
 

3847
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:02,600
with GPT is scaled more and more you
might get surprising things so yeah yeah

3848
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:02,610
might get surprising things so yeah yeah
 

3849
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,400
might get surprising things so yeah yeah
you're right it's it's interesting that

01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:04,410
you're right it's it's interesting that
 

3851
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:06,890
you're right it's it's interesting that
it's it's difficult to see how far an

01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:06,900
it's it's difficult to see how far an
 

3853
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,440
it's it's difficult to see how far an

01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:41,880
opening high five and that passed and
 

3887
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,060
opening high five and that passed and
what was the process of self play it's a

3888
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:44,070
what was the process of self play it's a
 

3889
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:46,280
what was the process of self play it's a
lot of training yeah yeah yeah yeah so

3890
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:46,290
lot of training yeah yeah yeah yeah so
 

3891
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,300
lot of training yeah yeah yeah yeah so
with donors dota

3892
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:47,310
with donors dota
 

3893
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:50,270
with donors dota
yeah it's a complex video game and we

3894
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:50,280
yeah it's a complex video game and we
 

3895
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,830
yeah it's a complex video game and we
started training we started trying to

3896
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:51,840
started training we started trying to
 

3897
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,930
started training we started trying to
solve dota because we felt like this was

3898
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:53,940
solve dota because we felt like this was
 

3899
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,940
solve dota because we felt like this was
a step towards the real world relative

3900
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:55,950
a step towards the real world relative
 

3901
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:57,950
a step towards the real world relative
to other games like chess or go right

3902
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:57,960
to other games like chess or go right
 

3903
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,390
to other games like chess or go right
those various free board games where you

3904
01:09:59,390 --> 01:09:59,400
those various free board games where you
 

3905
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:00,650
those various free board games where you
just kind of have this board very

3906
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:00,660
just kind of have this board very
 

3907
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,690
just kind of have this board very
discrete moves dota starts to be much

3908
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:02,700
discrete moves dota starts to be much
 

3909
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,550
discrete moves dota starts to be much
more continuous time so you have this

3910
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:04,560
more continuous time so you have this
 

3911
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,290
more continuous time so you have this
huge variety of different actions that

3912
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:06,300
huge variety of different actions that
 

3913
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,060
huge variety of different actions that
you have a 45 minute game with all these

3914
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:08,070
you have a 45 minute game with all these
 

3915
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,430
you have a 45 minute game with all these
different units and it's got a lot of

3916
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:10,440
different units and it's got a lot of
 

3917
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,710
different units and it's got a lot of
messiness to it that really hasn't been

3918
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:12,720
messiness to it that really hasn't been
 

3919
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,080
messiness to it that really hasn't been
captured by previous games and famously

3920
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:15,090
captured by previous games and famously
 

3921
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,420
captured by previous games and famously
all of the hard-coded bots for dota were

3922
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:17,430
all of the hard-coded bots for dota were
 

3923
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:19,250
all of the hard-coded bots for dota were
terrible right just impossible to write

3924
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:19,260
terrible right just impossible to write
 

3925
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,420
terrible right just impossible to write
anything good for it because it's so

3926
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:20,430
anything good for it because it's so
 

3927
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:22,460
anything good for it because it's so
complex and so this seems like a really

3928
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:22,470
complex and so this seems like a really
 

3929
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:24,740
complex and so this seems like a really
good place to push what's the state of

3930
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:24,750
good place to push what's the state of
 

3931
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:27,200
good place to push what's the state of
the art in reinforcement learning and so

3932
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:27,210
the art in reinforcement learning and so
 

3933
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:28,850
the art in reinforcement learning and so
we started by focusing on the one versus

3934
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:28,860
we started by focusing on the one versus
 

3935
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,220
we started by focusing on the one versus
one version of the game and and and were

3936
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:31,230
one version of the game and and and were
 

3937
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:32,810
one version of the game and and and were
able to solve that we were able to beat

3938
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:32,820
able to solve that we were able to beat
 

3939
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,450
able to solve that we were able to beat
the world champions and that the

3940
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:34,460
the world champions and that the
 

3941
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,370
the world champions and that the
learning you know the skill curve was

3942
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:37,380
learning you know the skill curve was
 

3943
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:39,260
learning you know the skill curve was
this crazy exponential right it was like

3944
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:39,270
this crazy exponential right it was like
 

3945
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:41,090
this crazy exponential right it was like
constantly we were just scaling up that

3946
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:41,100
constantly we were just scaling up that
 

3947
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,950
constantly we were just scaling up that
we were fixing bugs and you know that

3948
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:42,960
we were fixing bugs and you know that
 

3949
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,360
we were fixing bugs and you know that
you look at the at the skill curve and

3950
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:44,370
you look at the at the skill curve and
 

3951
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:46,760
you look at the at the skill curve and
it was really very very smooth one it's

3952
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:46,770
it was really very very smooth one it's
 

3953
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:47,810
it was really very very smooth one it's
actually really interesting to see how

3954
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:47,820
actually really interesting to see how
 

3955
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,450
actually really interesting to see how
that like human iteration loop yielded

3956
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:50,460
that like human iteration loop yielded
 

3957
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,570
that like human iteration loop yielded
very steady exponential progress and to

3958
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:53,580
very steady exponential progress and to
 

3959
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,340
very steady exponential progress and to
want one side note first of all it's an

3960
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:55,350
want one side note first of all it's an
 

3961
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:57,380
want one side note first of all it's an
exceptionally popular video game this

3962
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:57,390
exceptionally popular video game this
 

3963
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:59,480
exceptionally popular video game this
effect is that there's a lot of

3964
01:10:59,480 --> 01:10:59,490
effect is that there's a lot of
 

3965
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,670
effect is that there's a lot of
incredible human experts at that video

3966
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:01,680
incredible human experts at that video
 

3967
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,920
incredible human experts at that video
again so the benchmark the trying to

3968
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:03,930
again so the benchmark the trying to
 

3969
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:06,050
again so the benchmark the trying to
reach is very high and the other can you

3970
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:06,060
reach is very high and the other can you
 

3971
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:08,360
reach is very high and the other can you
talk about the approach that was used

3972
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:08,370
talk about the approach that was used
 

3973
01:11:08,370 --> 01:11:10,700
talk about the approach that was used
initially and throughout training these

3974
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:10,710
initially and throughout training these
 

3975
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,650
initially and throughout training these
agents to play this game yep and so they

3976
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:12,660
agents to play this game yep and so they
 

3977
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,630
agents to play this game yep and so they
person that we used is self play and so

3978
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:14,640
person that we used is self play and so
 

3979
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,490
person that we used is self play and so
you have cue agents they don't know

3980
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:16,500
you have cue agents they don't know
 

3981
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,740
you have cue agents they don't know
anything they battle each other they

3982
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:18,750
anything they battle each other they
 

3983
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,450
anything they battle each other they
discover something a little bit good and

3984
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:20,460
discover something a little bit good and
 

3985
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:22,550
discover something a little bit good and
now they both know it and they just get

3986
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:22,560
now they both know it and they just get
 

3987
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,600
now they both know it and they just get
better and better and better without

3988
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:23,610
better and better and better without
 

3989
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:25,610
better and better and better without
bound and that's a really powerful idea

3990
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:25,620
bound and that's a really powerful idea
 

3991
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:29,150
bound and that's a really powerful idea
right that we then went from the one

3992
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:29,160
right that we then went from the one
 

3993
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,650
right that we then went from the one
versus one version of the game and

3994
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:30,660
versus one version of the game and
 

3995
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,390
versus one version of the game and
scaled up to four five versus five right

3996
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:32,400
scaled up to four five versus five right
 

3997
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,620
scaled up to four five versus five right
so you think about kind of like with

3998
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:33,630
so you think about kind of like with
 

3999
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:35,030
so you think about kind of like with
basketball where you have this like team

4000
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,040
basketball where you have this like team
 

4001
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,110
basketball where you have this like team
sport you know I need to do all this

4002
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:36,120
sport you know I need to do all this
 

4003
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,050
sport you know I need to do all this
coordination and we were able to push

4004
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:39,060
coordination and we were able to push
 

4005
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:44,450
coordination and we were able to push
the same idea the same self play to to

4006
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:44,460
the same idea the same self play to to
 

4007
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:45,950
the same idea the same self play to to
really get to the professional level at

4008
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:45,960
really get to the professional level at
 

4009
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,080
really get to the professional level at
the full thigh versus by version of the

4010
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:48,090
the full thigh versus by version of the
 

4011
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:51,650
the full thigh versus by version of the
game and and and the things I think are

4012
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:51,660
game and and and the things I think are
 

4013
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,780
game and and and the things I think are
really interesting here is that these

4014
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:53,790
really interesting here is that these
 

4015
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,370
really interesting here is that these
agents in some ways they're almost like

4016
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:55,380
agents in some ways they're almost like
 

4017
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,140
agents in some ways they're almost like
an insect like intelligence right where

4018
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:57,150
an insect like intelligence right where
 

4019
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,580
an insect like intelligence right where
the you know there's they've a lot in

4020
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:58,590
the you know there's they've a lot in
 

4021
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,020
the you know there's they've a lot in
common with how an insect is trained

4022
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:00,030
common with how an insect is trained
 

4023
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:01,520
common with how an insect is trained
right insect kind of lives in this

4024
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:01,530
right insect kind of lives in this
 

4025
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,050
right insect kind of lives in this
environment for a very long time or you

4026
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:03,060
environment for a very long time or you
 

4027
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,060
environment for a very long time or you
know the the ancestors of this insect

4028
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:05,070
know the the ancestors of this insect
 

4029
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,260
know the the ancestors of this insect
I've been around for a long time and had

4030
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:06,270
I've been around for a long time and had
 

4031
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:07,940
I've been around for a long time and had
a lot of experience it gets baked into

4032
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:07,950
a lot of experience it gets baked into
 

4033
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:10,760
a lot of experience it gets baked into
into into this agent and you know it's

4034
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:10,770
into into this agent and you know it's
 

4035
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:12,710
into into this agent and you know it's
not really smart in the sense of a human

4036
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:12,720
not really smart in the sense of a human
 

4037
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,970
not really smart in the sense of a human
right it's not able to go and learn

4038
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:13,980
right it's not able to go and learn
 

4039
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,770
right it's not able to go and learn
calculus but it's able to navigate its

they handle unexpected things in the

they handle unexpected things in the

01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:20,150
they handle unexpected things in the

4047
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,090
environment that's never seen before
pretty well and we see the same sort of

4048
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:23,100
pretty well and we see the same sort of
 

4049
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,470
pretty well and we see the same sort of
thing with our dota BOTS

4050
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:24,480
thing with our dota BOTS
 

4051
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,270
thing with our dota BOTS
right they're able to in within this

4052
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:26,280
right they're able to in within this
 

4053
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,280
right they're able to in within this
game they're able to play against humans

4054
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:28,290
game they're able to play against humans
 

4055
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:29,570
game they're able to play against humans
which are something that never existed

4056
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:29,580
which are something that never existed
 

4057
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,940
which are something that never existed

different playstyles from humans versus

01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:33,840
different playstyles from humans versus
 

4061
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,140
different playstyles from humans versus
the bots and yet it's able to handle it

4062
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:36,150
the bots and yet it's able to handle it
 

4063
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:38,090
the bots and yet it's able to handle it
extremely well and that's something I

4064
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:38,100
extremely well and that's something I
 

4065
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,460
extremely well and that's something I
think was very surprising to us was

4066
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:40,470
think was very surprising to us was
 

4067
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:43,430
think was very surprising to us was
something that doesn't really emerge

4068
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
something that doesn't really emerge
 

4069
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,250
something that doesn't really emerge
from what we've seen with PPO at smaller

01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:46,260
from what we've seen with PPO at smaller
 

4071
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,960
from what we've seen with PPO at smaller
scale writing the kind of scale we're

01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:47,970
scale writing the kind of scale we're
 

4073
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:49,820
scale writing the kind of scale we're
running the stuff out was you know I

4074
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:49,830
running the stuff out was you know I
 

4075
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:51,650
running the stuff out was you know I
could take a hundred thousand CPU cores

4076
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:51,660
could take a hundred thousand CPU cores
 

4077
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,350
could take a hundred thousand CPU cores
running with like hundreds of GPUs it's

01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:54,360
running with like hundreds of GPUs it's
 

4079
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,480
running with like hundreds of GPUs it's
probably about I you know like you know

probably about I you know like you know
 

4081
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:59,300
probably about I you know like you know
it's something like hundreds of years of

it's something like hundreds of years of
 

4083
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:01,670
it's something like hundreds of years of
experience going into this bot every

01:13:01,670 --> 01:13:01,680
experience going into this bot every
 

4085
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,510
experience going into this bot every
single real day and so that scale is

4086
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:05,520
single real day and so that scale is
 

4087
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,160
single real day and so that scale is
massive and we start to see very

4088
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:07,170
massive and we start to see very
 

4089
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:09,020
massive and we start to see very
different kinds of behaviors out of the

different kinds of behaviors out of the

01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:10,470
different kinds of behaviors out of the

01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:10,480
algorithms that we all know and love

Dora he mentioned beat the world expert

4094
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:13,200
Dora he mentioned beat the world expert
 

4095
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,430
Dora he mentioned beat the world expert
1v1

1v1
 

4097
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:19,080
1v1
and then you didn't weren't able to win

4098
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:19,090
and then you didn't weren't able to win
 

4099
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:22,950
and then you didn't weren't able to win
505 this year yeah at the best in the

4100
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:22,960
505 this year yeah at the best in the
 

4101
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,740
505 this year yeah at the best in the
world so what's what's the comeback

4102
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:25,750
world so what's what's the comeback
 

4103
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,480
world so what's what's the comeback
story what's first of all talk through

4104
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:27,490
story what's first of all talk through
 

4105
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:29,250
story what's first of all talk through
that does exceptionally exciting event

4106
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:29,260
that does exceptionally exciting event
 

4107
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:32,130
that does exceptionally exciting event
and what's what's the following months

4108
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:32,140
and what's what's the following months
 

4109
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:33,990
and what's what's the following months
and this year look like yeah yeah so

4110
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:34,000
and this year look like yeah yeah so
 

4111
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,400
and this year look like yeah yeah so
well one thing that's interesting is

4112
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:35,410
well one thing that's interesting is
 

4113
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,820
well one thing that's interesting is
that you know we lose all the time

4114
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:37,830
that you know we lose all the time
 

4115
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:41,070
that you know we lose all the time
because we we so the dota team at

4116
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:41,080
because we we so the dota team at
 

4117
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,230
because we we so the dota team at
opening I we played the bot against

4118
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:43,240
opening I we played the bot against
 

4119
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,390
opening I we played the bot against
better players than our system all the

4120
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:45,400
better players than our system all the
 

4121
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,400
better players than our system all the
time or at least we used to it right

4122
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:47,410
time or at least we used to it right
 

4123
01:13:47,410 --> 01:13:49,320
time or at least we used to it right
like you know the the first time we lost

4124
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:49,330
like you know the the first time we lost
 

4125
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:51,360
like you know the the first time we lost
publicly was we went up on stage at the

4126
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:51,370
publicly was we went up on stage at the
 

4127
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:53,580
publicly was we went up on stage at the
International and we played against some

4128
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:53,590
International and we played against some
 

4129
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:55,110
International and we played against some
of the best teams in the world and we

4130
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:55,120
of the best teams in the world and we
 

4131
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,360
of the best teams in the world and we
ended up losing both games but we gave

4132
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:57,370
ended up losing both games but we gave
 

4133
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:58,200
ended up losing both games but we gave
them a run for their money

4134
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:58,210
them a run for their money
 

4135
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:00,030
them a run for their money
right the both games were kind of 30

4136
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:00,040
right the both games were kind of 30
 

4137
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:02,100
right the both games were kind of 30
minutes 25 minutes and that they went

4138
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:02,110
minutes 25 minutes and that they went
 

4139
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:03,390
minutes 25 minutes and that they went
back and forth back and forth back and

4140
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:03,400
back and forth back and forth back and
 

4141
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,310
back and forth back and forth back and
forth and so I think that really shows

4142
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:05,320
forth and so I think that really shows
 

4143
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,920
forth and so I think that really shows
that we're at the professional level and

4144
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:07,930
that we're at the professional level and
 

4145
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:09,810
that we're at the professional level and
that kind of looking at those games we

4146
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:09,820
that kind of looking at those games we
 

4147
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,670
that kind of looking at those games we
think that the coin could have gone a

4148
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:11,680
think that the coin could have gone a
 

4149
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,810
think that the coin could have gone a
different direction and it could have

4150
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:12,820
different direction and it could have
 

4151
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,310
different direction and it could have
could have had some wins and so that was

4152
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:14,320
could have had some wins and so that was
 

4153
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,620
could have had some wins and so that was
actually very encouraging for us and you

4154
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:16,630
actually very encouraging for us and you
 

4155
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:17,730
actually very encouraging for us and you
know it's interesting because the

4156
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:17,740
know it's interesting because the
 

4157
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:19,770
know it's interesting because the
international was at a fixed time right

4158
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:19,780
international was at a fixed time right
 

4159
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,990
international was at a fixed time right
so we we knew exactly what day we were

4160
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,000
so we we knew exactly what day we were
 

4161
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,340
so we we knew exactly what day we were
going to be playing and we pushed as far

4162
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:23,350
going to be playing and we pushed as far
 

4163
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:24,750
going to be playing and we pushed as far
as we could as fast as we could

4164
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:24,760
as we could as fast as we could
 

4165
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,150
as we could as fast as we could
two weeks later we had a bot that had an

4166
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:27,160
two weeks later we had a bot that had an
 

4167
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:28,890
two weeks later we had a bot that had an
80% win rate versus the one that played

4168
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:28,900
80% win rate versus the one that played
 

4169
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,800
80% win rate versus the one that played
at ti so the march of progress you know

4170
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:31,810
at ti so the march of progress you know
 

4171
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,510
at ti so the march of progress you know
you should think of as a snapshot rather

4172
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:33,520
you should think of as a snapshot rather
 

4173
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,850
you should think of as a snapshot rather
than as an end state and so in fact well

4174
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:35,860
than as an end state and so in fact well
 

4175
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:38,100
than as an end state and so in fact well
we'll be announcing our our finals

4176
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:38,110
we'll be announcing our our finals
 

4177
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:40,440
we'll be announcing our our finals
pretty soon I actually think that we'll

4178
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:40,450
pretty soon I actually think that we'll
 

4179
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:44,010
pretty soon I actually think that we'll
announce our final match I prior to this

4180
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:44,020
announce our final match I prior to this
 

4181
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,720
announce our final match I prior to this

about like that the way that we think

what is 2019 hold for you massive scale
scale I will put a naturist on that and

4240
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:49,290
scale I will put a naturist on that and
 

4241
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:50,480
scale I will put a naturist on that and
just say you know I think that it's

4242
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:50,490
just say you know I think that it's
 

4243
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:53,090
just say you know I think that it's
about ideas plus scale you need both so

4244
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:53,100
about ideas plus scale you need both so
 

4245
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:55,340
about ideas plus scale you need both so
that's a really good point so the

4246
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:55,350
that's a really good point so the
 

4247
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:59,120
that's a really good point so the
question in terms of ideas you have a

4248
01:15:59,120 --> 01:15:59,130
question in terms of ideas you have a
 

4249
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:02,210
question in terms of ideas you have a
lot of projects that are exploring

4250
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:02,220
lot of projects that are exploring
 

4251
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,240
lot of projects that are exploring
different areas of intelligence and the

4252
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:05,250
different areas of intelligence and the
 

4253
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,040
different areas of intelligence and the
question is when you when you think of

4254
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:07,050
question is when you when you think of
 

4255
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:09,680
question is when you when you think of
scale do you think about growing scale

4256
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:09,690
scale do you think about growing scale
 

4257
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,180
scale do you think about growing scale
those individual projects so do you

4258
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:11,190
those individual projects so do you
 

4259
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:13,150
those individual projects so do you
think about adding new projects and

4260
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:13,160
think about adding new projects and
 

4261
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,770
think about adding new projects and
society today in if you are thinking

4262
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:15,780
society today in if you are thinking
 

4263
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,990
society today in if you are thinking
about adding new projects or if you look

4264
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,000
about adding new projects or if you look
 

4265
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,360
about adding new projects or if you look
at the past what's the process of coming

4266
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:20,370
at the past what's the process of coming
 

4267
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:23,030
at the past what's the process of coming
up with new projects and new ideas so we

4268
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
up with new projects and new ideas so we
 

4269
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,680
up with new projects and new ideas so we
really have a life cycle of project here

4270
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:24,690
really have a life cycle of project here
 

4271
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:26,810
really have a life cycle of project here
so we start with a few people just

4272
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:26,820
so we start with a few people just
 

4273
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:28,580
so we start with a few people just
working on a small scale idea and

4274
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:28,590
working on a small scale idea and
 

4275
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,870
working on a small scale idea and
language is actually a very good example

4276
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:29,880
language is actually a very good example
 

4277
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,610
language is actually a very good example
of this that it was really you know one

4278
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:31,620
of this that it was really you know one
 

4279
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,770
of this that it was really you know one
person here who was pushing on language

4280
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:33,780
person here who was pushing on language
 

4281
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:35,510
person here who was pushing on language
for a long time I mean then you get

4282
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:35,520
for a long time I mean then you get
 

4283
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:37,460
for a long time I mean then you get
signs of life right and so this is like

4284
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:37,470
signs of life right and so this is like
 

4285
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:39,440
signs of life right and so this is like
let's say you know with with the

4286
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:39,450
let's say you know with with the
 

4287
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:41,870
let's say you know with with the
original gbt we had something that was

4288
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:41,880
original gbt we had something that was
 

4289
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,910
original gbt we had something that was
interesting and we said okay it's time

4290
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:43,920
interesting and we said okay it's time
 

4291
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,410
interesting and we said okay it's time
to scale this right it's time to put

4292
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:45,420
to scale this right it's time to put
 

4293
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,940
to scale this right it's time to put
more people on it put more computational

4294
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:46,950
more people on it put more computational
 

4295
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:50,060
more people on it put more computational
resources behind it and and then we just

4296
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:50,070
resources behind it and and then we just
 

4297
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:51,260
resources behind it and and then we just
kind of keep pushing and keep pushing

4298
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:51,270
kind of keep pushing and keep pushing
 

4299
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:52,790
kind of keep pushing and keep pushing
and the end state is something that

4300
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:52,800
and the end state is something that
 

4301
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,590
and the end state is something that
looks like dota or robotics where you

4302
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:54,600
looks like dota or robotics where you
 

4303
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,300
looks like dota or robotics where you
have a large team of you know 10 or 15

4304
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:56,310
have a large team of you know 10 or 15
 

4305
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:58,070
have a large team of you know 10 or 15
people that are running things at very

4306
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:58,080
people that are running things at very
 

4307
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,020
people that are running things at very
large scale and that you're able to

4308
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:00,030
large scale and that you're able to
 

4309
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:02,840
large scale and that you're able to
really have material engineering and and

4310
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:02,850
really have material engineering and and
 

4311
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,940
really have material engineering and and
and and you know sort of machine

4312
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:04,950
and and you know sort of machine
 

4313
01:17:04,950 --> 01:17:07,160
and and you know sort of machine
learning science coming together to make

4314
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:07,170
learning science coming together to make
 

4315
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:09,950
learning science coming together to make
systems that work and get material

4316
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:09,960
systems that work and get material
 

4317
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:10,880
systems that work and get material
results that just would've been

4318
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:10,890
results that just would've been
 

4319
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,950
results that just would've been
impossible otherwise so we do that whole

4320
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
impossible otherwise so we do that whole
 

4321
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,420
impossible otherwise so we do that whole
lifecycle we've done it a number of

4322
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:14,430
lifecycle we've done it a number of
 

4323
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,880
lifecycle we've done it a number of
times you know typically end to end it's

4324
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:16,890
times you know typically end to end it's
 

4325
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:20,090
times you know typically end to end it's
probably to two years or so to do it I

4326
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:20,100
probably to two years or so to do it I
 

4327
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,290
probably to two years or so to do it I
you know the organization's been around

4328
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:21,300
you know the organization's been around
 

4329
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,760
you know the organization's been around
for three years so maybe we'll find it

4330
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:22,770
for three years so maybe we'll find it
 

4331
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:24,260
for three years so maybe we'll find it
we also have longer life cycle projects

4332
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:24,270
we also have longer life cycle projects
 

4333
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:27,880
we also have longer life cycle projects
but you know we we will work up to those

4334
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:27,890
but you know we we will work up to those
 

4335
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,800
but you know we we will work up to those
we have so so one one team that we were

4336
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:30,810
we have so so one one team that we were
 

4337
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:32,270
we have so so one one team that we were
actually just starting Illya and I are

4338
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:32,280
actually just starting Illya and I are
 

4339
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,650
actually just starting Illya and I are
kicking off a new team called the

4340
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:33,660
kicking off a new team called the
 

4341
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:34,440
kicking off a new team called the
reasoning team

4342
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:34,450
reasoning team
 

4343
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:36,030
reasoning team
and that this is to really try to tackle

4344
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:36,040
and that this is to really try to tackle
 

4345
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,370
and that this is to really try to tackle
how do you get neural networks to reason

4346
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:38,380
how do you get neural networks to reason
 

4347
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,890
how do you get neural networks to reason

this year he mentioned reasoning I think

4414
01:18:59,880 --> 01:18:59,890
this year he mentioned reasoning I think
 

4415
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:01,530
this year he mentioned reasoning I think
that's that's a heck of a problem yeah

4416
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:01,540
that's that's a heck of a problem yeah
 

4417
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:02,820
that's that's a heck of a problem yeah
so I think reasoning is an important one

4418
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:02,830
so I think reasoning is an important one
 

4419
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:03,960
so I think reasoning is an important one
I think it's gonna be hard to get good

talking about autonomous vehicles or any
kind of system do you see that scaling

4484
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:12,380
kind of system do you see that scaling
 

4485
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:14,859
kind of system do you see that scaling
so we'll be able to simulate systems and

4486
01:20:14,859 --> 01:20:14,869
so we'll be able to simulate systems and
 

4487
01:20:14,869 --> 01:20:17,620
so we'll be able to simulate systems and
enhance be able to create a simulator

01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:35,350
take a look at our robotic system dactyl
right that was trained in simulation

4504
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:35,360
right that was trained in simulation
 

4505
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,350
right that was trained in simulation
using the DOTA system in fact and it

4506
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:38,360
using the DOTA system in fact and it
 

4507
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:40,629
using the DOTA system in fact and it
transfers to a physical robot and I

4508
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639
transfers to a physical robot and I
 

4509
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,310
transfers to a physical robot and I
think everyone looks at our dota system

4510
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:42,320
think everyone looks at our dota system
 

4511
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,750
think everyone looks at our dota system
the wreck okay it's just a game how are

4512
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
the wreck okay it's just a game how are
 

4513
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:44,649
the wreck okay it's just a game how are
you ever going to escape to the real

4514
01:20:44,649 --> 01:20:44,659
you ever going to escape to the real
 

4515
01:20:44,659 --> 01:20:45,010
you ever going to escape to the real
world

4516
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:45,020
world
 

4517
01:20:45,020 --> 01:20:46,750
world
and the answer is well we did it with

4518
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:46,760
and the answer is well we did it with
 

4519
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:47,890
and the answer is well we did it with
the physical robot the noble could

4520
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:47,900
the physical robot the noble could
 

4521
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,720
the physical robot the noble could
program and so I think the answer is

4522
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:49,730
program and so I think the answer is
 

4523
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:51,160
program and so I think the answer is
simulation goes a lot further than you

4524
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:51,170
simulation goes a lot further than you
 

4525
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:53,109
simulation goes a lot further than you
think if you apply the right techniques

4526
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:53,119
think if you apply the right techniques
 

4527
01:20:53,119 --> 01:20:55,390
think if you apply the right techniques
to it now there's a question of you know

4528
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:55,400
to it now there's a question of you know
 

4529
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,859
to it now there's a question of you know
are the beings in that simulation gonna

4530
01:20:56,859 --> 01:20:56,869
are the beings in that simulation gonna
 

4531
01:20:56,869 --> 01:20:59,890
are the beings in that simulation gonna
wake up and have consciousness I think

4532
01:20:59,890 --> 01:20:59,900
wake up and have consciousness I think
 

4533
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,870
wake up and have consciousness I think
that one seems a lot a lot harder to

4534
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:01,880
that one seems a lot a lot harder to
 

4535
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,820
that one seems a lot a lot harder to
again reason about I think that you know

4536
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:03,830
again reason about I think that you know
 

4537
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:05,560
again reason about I think that you know
you really should think about like where

4538
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:05,570
you really should think about like where
 

4539
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:07,359
you really should think about like where
where exactly just human consciousness

4540
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:07,369
where exactly just human consciousness
 

4541
01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:09,250
where exactly just human consciousness
come from and our own self-awareness and

4542
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:09,260
come from and our own self-awareness and
 

4543
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:10,990
come from and our own self-awareness and
you know is it just that like once you

4544
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:11,000
you know is it just that like once you
 

4545
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,160
you know is it just that like once you
have like a complicated enough neural

4546
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:12,170
have like a complicated enough neural
 

4547
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:13,330
have like a complicated enough neural
net do you have to worry about the

4548
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:13,340
net do you have to worry about the
 

4549
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:17,410
net do you have to worry about the
agents feeling pain and I think there's

4550
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:17,420
agents feeling pain and I think there's
 

4551
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:19,330
agents feeling pain and I think there's
like interesting speculation to do there

4552
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:19,340
like interesting speculation to do there
 

4553
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:21,640
like interesting speculation to do there
but but you know again I think it's a

4554
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:21,650
but but you know again I think it's a
 

4555
01:21:21,650 --> 01:21:23,169
but but you know again I think it's a
little bit hard to know for sure well

4556
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:23,179
little bit hard to know for sure well
 

4557
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:25,090
little bit hard to know for sure well
let me just keep with a speculation do

4558
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:25,100
let me just keep with a speculation do
 

4559
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:27,609
let me just keep with a speculation do
you think to create intelligence general

4560
01:21:27,609 --> 01:21:27,619
you think to create intelligence general
 

4561
01:21:27,619 --> 01:21:30,490
you think to create intelligence general
intelligence you need one consciousness

4562
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:30,500
intelligence you need one consciousness
 

4563
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:34,090
intelligence you need one consciousness
and to a body do you think any of those

4564
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:34,100
and to a body do you think any of those
 

4565
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,800
and to a body do you think any of those
elements are needed or as intelligence

4566
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:35,810
elements are needed or as intelligence
 

4567
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:38,109
elements are needed or as intelligence
something that's that's orthogonal to

4568
01:21:38,109 --> 01:21:38,119
something that's that's orthogonal to
 

4569
01:21:38,119 --> 01:21:39,879
something that's that's orthogonal to
those I'll stick to the kind of like the

4570
01:21:39,879 --> 01:21:39,889
those I'll stick to the kind of like the
 

4571
01:21:39,889 --> 01:21:41,709

the non grand answer first
 

4573
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:43,209
the non grand answer first
right so the non grand answer is just to

4574
01:21:43,209 --> 01:21:43,219
right so the non grand answer is just to
 

4575
01:21:43,219 --> 01:21:44,890
right so the non grand answer is just to

4576
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:44,900
look at you know what are we already

seems the answer is probably not right

4606
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:13,310
seems the answer is probably not right
 

4607
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:14,470
seems the answer is probably not right
that we can probably just continue to

yeah here's where the speculation starts

01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:41,120
yeah here's where the speculation starts

take it but it certainly seems that when
 

4639
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:51,640
take it but it certainly seems that when

right I you know not as conscious as a
 

4647
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:59,500
right I you know not as conscious as a

human and you could imagine that you
 

4649
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,940
human and you could imagine that you
could build a little consciousness meter

4650

4655
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:06,940
little reading we ran a human gives you
much bigger reading what would happen if

4656
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:06,950
much bigger reading what would happen if
 

4657
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,680
much bigger reading what would happen if
