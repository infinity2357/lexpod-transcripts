00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:07,259
what happened with both tensorflow and
 

9
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:09,169
what happened with both tensorflow and
pytorch is that the explosion of

10
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:09,179
pytorch is that the explosion of
 

11
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,810
pytorch is that the explosion of
innovation in AI has led to it's not

just about multiplication and

14
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
just about multiplication and
 

15
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,410
just about multiplication and

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:34,860
from here on out right and so to me the
 

37
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,350
from here on out right and so to me the
exciting part about what we're building

but the world's changing and what's
 

151
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,410
but the world's changing and what's
happened with AI is we have new gpus and

152
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:54,420
happened with AI is we have new gpus and
 

153
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,250
happened with AI is we have new gpus and
new

00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:03,959
that's one of the biggest larger scale
 

163
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,770
that's one of the biggest larger scale
deployed systems that exist for AI and

164
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:06,780
deployed systems that exist for AI and
 

165
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,809
deployed systems that exist for AI and
really what you see is if you look

166
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:08,819
really what you see is if you look
 

167
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:10,250
really what you see is if you look
across all of the things that are

168
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,260
across all of the things that are
 

169
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,270
across all of the things that are
happening in the industry there's this

170
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
happening in the industry there's this
 

171
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,309
happening in the industry there's this
new compute platform coming and it's not

172
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:13,319
new compute platform coming and it's not
 

173
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,110
new compute platform coming and it's not
just about

174
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
just about
 

175
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,410
just about
CPUs or gpus or tpus or npus or ipus or

176
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,420
CPUs or gpus or tpus or npus or ipus or
 

177
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,410
CPUs or gpus or tpus or npus or ipus or
whatever all the pus right it's about

178
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:21,420
whatever all the pus right it's about
 

179
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,149
whatever all the pus right it's about
how do we program these things

180
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:23,159
how do we program these things
 

181
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,089
how do we program these things
right and so for software folks like us

182
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:26,099
right and so for software folks like us
 

183
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,430
right and so for software folks like us
right it doesn't do us any good if

184
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:28,440
right it doesn't do us any good if
 

185
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,990
right it doesn't do us any good if
there's this amazing Hardware that we

186
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
there's this amazing Hardware that we
 

187
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,949
there's this amazing Hardware that we
can't use

188
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
can't use
 

189
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,630
can't use
and one of the things you find out

190
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,640
and one of the things you find out
 

191
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,729
and one of the things you find out
really quick is that having the

192
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:34,739
really quick is that having the
 

193
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:36,350
really quick is that having the
theoretical capability of programming

194
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,360
theoretical capability of programming
 

195
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,509
theoretical capability of programming
something and then having the world's

196
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:38,519
something and then having the world's
 

197
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,030
something and then having the world's
power and the innovation of all the all

198
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
power and the innovation of all the all
 

199
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,410
power and the innovation of all the all
the smart people in the world get

200
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:42,420
the smart people in the world get
 

201
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,089
the smart people in the world get
Unleashed on something can be quite

202
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:44,099
Unleashed on something can be quite
 

203
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,610
Unleashed on something can be quite
different and so really where Mojo came

204
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:46,620
different and so really where Mojo came
 

205
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,430
different and so really where Mojo came
from was starting from a problem of we

206
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
from was starting from a problem of we
 

207
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,809
from was starting from a problem of we
need to be able to take machine learning

208
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:50,819
need to be able to take machine learning
 

209
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,309
need to be able to take machine learning
take the infrastructure underneath it

210
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
take the infrastructure underneath it
 

211
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,110
take the infrastructure underneath it
and make it way more accessible way more

212
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,120
and make it way more accessible way more
 

213
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,930
and make it way more accessible way more
usable way more understandable by normal

214
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:56,940
usable way more understandable by normal
 

215
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,970
usable way more understandable by normal
people and researchers and other folks

216
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:58,980
people and researchers and other folks
 

217
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,070
people and researchers and other folks
that are not themselves like experts in

218
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,080
that are not themselves like experts in
 

219
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,229
that are not themselves like experts in
gpus and things like this and then

220
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,239
gpus and things like this and then
 

221
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,270
gpus and things like this and then
through that Journey we realized hey we

222
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
through that Journey we realized hey we
 

223
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,530
through that Journey we realized hey we
need Syntax for this we need to do a

224
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:06,540
need Syntax for this we need to do a
 

225
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,509
need Syntax for this we need to do a
programming language so one one of the

226
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:08,519
programming language so one one of the
 

227
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,149
programming language so one one of the
the main features of the language I say

228
00:04:11,149 --> 00:04:11,159
the main features of the language I say
 

229
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,509
the main features of the language I say
so fully ingest is that it allows you to

230
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:14,519
so fully ingest is that it allows you to
 

231
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,990
so fully ingest is that it allows you to
have the file extension to be uh an

232
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
have the file extension to be uh an
 

233
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,289
have the file extension to be uh an
emoji or the fire Emoji which is

234
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:21,299
emoji or the fire Emoji which is
 

235
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:24,189
emoji or the fire Emoji which is
one of the first

236
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:24,199
one of the first
 

237
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,450
one of the first
emojis used as a file extension I've

238
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:26,460
emojis used as a file extension I've
 

239
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,950
emojis used as a file extension I've
ever seen in my life and then you ask

240
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:27,960
ever seen in my life and then you ask
 

241
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,469
ever seen in my life and then you ask
yourself the question why in the 21st

242
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
yourself the question why in the 21st
 

243
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,530
yourself the question why in the 21st
century we're not using Unicode for file

244
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:33,540
century we're not using Unicode for file
 

245
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,749
century we're not using Unicode for file
extensions does that mean it's an epic

246
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
extensions does that mean it's an epic
 

247
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,909
extensions does that mean it's an epic
decision I think clearly the most

248
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
decision I think clearly the most
 

249
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,290
decision I think clearly the most
important decision you made the most but

250
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:39,300
important decision you made the most but
 

251
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,570
important decision you made the most but
but you could also just use mojo as the

252
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:41,580
but you could also just use mojo as the
 

253
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,550
but you could also just use mojo as the
file extension well so okay so take a

254
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:43,560
file extension well so okay so take a
 

255
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,870
file extension well so okay so take a
step back I mean come on Max do you

256
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
step back I mean come on Max do you
 

257
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,830
step back I mean come on Max do you
think that the world's ready for this

258
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
think that the world's ready for this
 

259
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,570
think that the world's ready for this
this is a big moment in the world right

260
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:47,580
this is a big moment in the world right
 

261
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,310
this is a big moment in the world right
this is we'll release this onto the

262
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,320
this is we'll release this onto the
 

263
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,249
this is we'll release this onto the
world this is innovation

264
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:51,259
world this is innovation
 

265
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,590
world this is innovation
I mean it really is kind of brilliant

266
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
I mean it really is kind of brilliant
 

267
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,230
I mean it really is kind of brilliant
emojis is such a big part of our daily

268
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:57,240
emojis is such a big part of our daily
 

269
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,469
emojis is such a big part of our daily
lives why is it not in programming well

270
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
lives why is it not in programming well
 

271
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,909
lives why is it not in programming well
and and like you take a step back and

272
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
and and like you take a step back and
 

273
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,249
and and like you take a step back and
look look at what file extensions are

274
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:04,259
look look at what file extensions are
 

275
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,590
look look at what file extensions are
right they're basically metadata right

276
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:06,600
right they're basically metadata right
 

277
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,850
right they're basically metadata right
and so why are we spending all the

278
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:07,860
and so why are we spending all the
 

279
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,530
and so why are we spending all the
screen space on them and all the stuff

280
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:09,540
screen space on them and all the stuff
 

281
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,450
screen space on them and all the stuff
also you know you have them stacked up

282
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:11,460
also you know you have them stacked up
 

283
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,490
also you know you have them stacked up
next to text files and PDF files and

284
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:13,500
next to text files and PDF files and
 

285
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,990
next to text files and PDF files and
whatever else like if you're gonna do

286
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,000
whatever else like if you're gonna do
 

287
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,070
whatever else like if you're gonna do
something cool you want to stand out

288
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
something cool you want to stand out
 

289
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,170
something cool you want to stand out
right and emojis are colorful they're

290
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,180
right and emojis are colorful they're
 

291
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,030
right and emojis are colorful they're
visual they're they're beautiful right

292
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,040
visual they're they're beautiful right
 

293
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,550
visual they're they're beautiful right
what's been the response so far from uh

294
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
what's been the response so far from uh
 

295
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,710
what's been the response so far from uh
is is there support on like Windows on

296
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
is is there support on like Windows on
 

297
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,210
is is there support on like Windows on
the operating system in displaying like

298
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,220
the operating system in displaying like
 

299
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,550
the operating system in displaying like
file explorer yeah the one problem I've

300
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
file explorer yeah the one problem I've
 

301
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,730
file explorer yeah the one problem I've
seen is the git doesn't escape it right

302
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:30,740
seen is the git doesn't escape it right
 

303
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,110
seen is the git doesn't escape it right
and so it thinks that the fire Emoji is

304
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
and so it thinks that the fire Emoji is
 

305
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,490
and so it thinks that the fire Emoji is
unprintable and so it like prints out

306
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:34,500
unprintable and so it like prints out
 

307
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,990
unprintable and so it like prints out
weird hex things if you use the command

308
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
weird hex things if you use the command
 

309
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,689
weird hex things if you use the command
line git tool but everything else as far

310
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:38,699
line git tool but everything else as far
 

311
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,430
line git tool but everything else as far
as I'm aware works fine and I I have

312
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:40,440
as I'm aware works fine and I I have
 

313
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,070
as I'm aware works fine and I I have
faith that git can be improved so GitHub

314
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080
faith that git can be improved so GitHub
 

315
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,890
faith that git can be improved so GitHub
is fine GitHub is fine yep GitHub is

316
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:45,900
is fine GitHub is fine yep GitHub is
 

317
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,110
is fine GitHub is fine yep GitHub is
fine Visual Studio code Windows like all

318
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,120
fine Visual Studio code Windows like all
 

319
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,029
fine Visual Studio code Windows like all
this stuff totally ready because people

320
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:50,039
this stuff totally ready because people
 

321
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,370
this stuff totally ready because people
have internationalization yeah in their

322
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:52,380
have internationalization yeah in their
 

323
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,170
have internationalization yeah in their
normal part of their past

324
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,180
normal part of their past
 

325
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,550
normal part of their past
so this is just like taking the next

326
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:55,560
so this is just like taking the next
 

327
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,629
so this is just like taking the next
step right

328
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
step right
 

329
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,090
step right
somewhere between oh wow that makes

330
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,100
somewhere between oh wow that makes
 

331
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,510
somewhere between oh wow that makes
sense cool I like new things too oh my

332
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,520
sense cool I like new things too oh my
 

333
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,189
sense cool I like new things too oh my
God you're killing my baby like what are

334
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:04,199
God you're killing my baby like what are
 

335
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,570
God you're killing my baby like what are
you talking about this can never be like

336
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:05,580
you talking about this can never be like
 

337
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,010
you talking about this can never be like
I can never handle this how am I going

338
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,020
I can never handle this how am I going
 

339
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,350
I can never handle this how am I going
to type this like all these things and

340
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
to type this like all these things and
 

341
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,570
to type this like all these things and
so this is something where I think that

342
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:11,580
so this is something where I think that
 

343
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,070
so this is something where I think that
the world will get there we don't have

344
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,080
the world will get there we don't have
 

345
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,050
the world will get there we don't have
to bet the whole Farm on this I think we

346
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,060
to bet the whole Farm on this I think we
 

347
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,930
to bet the whole Farm on this I think we
can provide both paths but I think it'll

348
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:17,940
can provide both paths but I think it'll
 

349
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,450
can provide both paths but I think it'll
be great uh when can we have emojis as

350
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:20,460
be great uh when can we have emojis as
 

351
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,909
be great uh when can we have emojis as
part of the code I wonder uh yeah so I

352
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:22,919
part of the code I wonder uh yeah so I
 

353
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,010
part of the code I wonder uh yeah so I
mean lots of languages provide that so

354
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,020
mean lots of languages provide that so
 

355
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,450
mean lots of languages provide that so
um I think that we have partial support

356
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:26,460
um I think that we have partial support
 

357
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,710
um I think that we have partial support
for that it's probably not fully done

358
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:27,720
for that it's probably not fully done
 

359
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,350
for that it's probably not fully done
yet but but yeah you can you can do that

360
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,360
yet but but yeah you can you can do that
 

361
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,969
yet but but yeah you can you can do that
for example in Swift you can do that for

362
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:31,979
for example in Swift you can do that for
 

363
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,029
for example in Swift you can do that for
sure so an example we give give it Apple

364
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
sure so an example we give give it Apple
 

365
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,090
sure so an example we give give it Apple
was the the dog cow yeah so that's a

366
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,100
was the the dog cow yeah so that's a
 

367
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,430
was the the dog cow yeah so that's a
classical Mac Heritage thing and so he's

368
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:40,440
classical Mac Heritage thing and so he's
 

369
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,870
classical Mac Heritage thing and so he's
the dog and the cow emoji together and

370
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:41,880
the dog and the cow emoji together and
 

371
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,430
the dog and the cow emoji together and
that could be your variable name but of

372
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
that could be your variable name but of
 

373
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,170
that could be your variable name but of
course the internet went and made pile

374
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,180
course the internet went and made pile
 

375
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,570
course the internet went and made pile
of poop for everything yeah so you know

376
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:47,580
of poop for everything yeah so you know
 

377
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,950
of poop for everything yeah so you know
if you want to name your function pile

378
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
if you want to name your function pile
 

379
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,930
if you want to name your function pile
of poop then you can totally go to town

380
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:50,940
of poop then you can totally go to town
 

381
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,950
of poop then you can totally go to town
and see how that gets through code

382
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:51,960
and see how that gets through code
 

383
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,710
and see how that gets through code
review

384
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:53,720
review
 

385
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,110
review
okay so uh let me just ask bunch of

386
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
okay so uh let me just ask bunch of
 

387
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,770
okay so uh let me just ask bunch of
random questions uh so is Mojo primarily

388
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:00,780
random questions uh so is Mojo primarily
 

389
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,930
random questions uh so is Mojo primarily
designed for AIS or is it a general

390
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:02,940
designed for AIS or is it a general
 

391
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,370
designed for AIS or is it a general
purpose programming yeah good question

392
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:04,380
purpose programming yeah good question
 

393
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,249
purpose programming yeah good question
so it's AI first and so AI is driving a

394
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:07,259
so it's AI first and so AI is driving a
 

395
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,529
so it's AI first and so AI is driving a
lot of the requirements and so

396
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:09,539
lot of the requirements and so
 

397
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,990
lot of the requirements and so
um modular is building and designing and

398
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
um modular is building and designing and
 

399
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,790
um modular is building and designing and
driving Mojo forward it's not because

400
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:13,800
driving Mojo forward it's not because
 

401
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,170
driving Mojo forward it's not because
it's an interesting project

402
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,180
it's an interesting project
 

403
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,930
it's an interesting project
theoretically to build it's because we

404
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:17,940
theoretically to build it's because we
 

405
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,189
theoretically to build it's because we
need it

406
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
need it
 

407
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,570
need it
that's what modular we're really

408
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:20,580
that's what modular we're really
 

409
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,210
that's what modular we're really
tackling the AI infrastructure landscape

410
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:23,220
tackling the AI infrastructure landscape
 

411
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,309
tackling the AI infrastructure landscape
and the big problems in Ai and the

412
00:07:25,309 --> 00:07:25,319
and the big problems in Ai and the
 

413
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,930
and the big problems in Ai and the
reasons it is so difficult to use in

414
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:26,940
reasons it is so difficult to use in
 

415
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,510
reasons it is so difficult to use in
scale and adopt and deploy and like all

416
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
scale and adopt and deploy and like all
 

417
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,150
scale and adopt and deploy and like all
these big problems in Ai and so we're

418
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
these big problems in Ai and so we're
 

419
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,770
these big problems in Ai and so we're
coming out from that perspective now

420
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:33,780
coming out from that perspective now
 

421
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,629
coming out from that perspective now
when you do that when you start tackling

422
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:35,639
when you do that when you start tackling
 

423
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,469
when you do that when you start tackling
these problems you realize that the

424
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
these problems you realize that the
 

425
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,790
these problems you realize that the
solution to these problems isn't

426
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
solution to these problems isn't
 

427
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,010
solution to these problems isn't
actually an AI specific solution

428
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,020
actually an AI specific solution
 

429
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,270
actually an AI specific solution
and so while we're doing this we're

430
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,280
and so while we're doing this we're
 

431
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,409
and so while we're doing this we're
building Mojo to be a fully General

432
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:45,419
building Mojo to be a fully General
 

433
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,029
building Mojo to be a fully General
programming language and that means that

434
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
programming language and that means that
 

435
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,550
programming language and that means that
you can

436
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
you can
 

437
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,529
you can
obviously tackle gpus and CPUs and like

438
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:51,539
obviously tackle gpus and CPUs and like
 

439
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,150
obviously tackle gpus and CPUs and like
these AI things but it's also a really

440
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,160
these AI things but it's also a really
 

441
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,529
these AI things but it's also a really
great way to build

442
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:54,539
great way to build
 

443
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,170
great way to build
numpy and other things like that or you

444
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,180
numpy and other things like that or you
 

445
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,850
numpy and other things like that or you
know just if you look at what many

446
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:58,860
know just if you look at what many
 

447
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,890
know just if you look at what many
python libraries are today often they're

448
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:00,900
python libraries are today often they're
 

449
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,050
python libraries are today often they're
a layer of python for the API and they

450
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,060
a layer of python for the API and they
 

451
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,490
a layer of python for the API and they
end up being C and C plus plus code

452
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:04,500
end up being C and C plus plus code
 

453
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,249
end up being C and C plus plus code
underneath them that's very true in AI

454
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:07,259
underneath them that's very true in AI
 

455
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,930
underneath them that's very true in AI
That's True in lots of other domains as

456
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:08,940
That's True in lots of other domains as
 

457
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,550
That's True in lots of other domains as
well and so anytime you see this pattern

458
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
well and so anytime you see this pattern
 

459
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,870
well and so anytime you see this pattern
that's an opportunity for Mojo to help

460
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:11,880
that's an opportunity for Mojo to help
 

461
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,390
that's an opportunity for Mojo to help
simplify the world and help people have

462
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
simplify the world and help people have
 

463
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,089
simplify the world and help people have
one thing to optimize through

464
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:17,099
one thing to optimize through
 

465
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:19,010
one thing to optimize through
simplification

466
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,020
simplification
 

467
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,230
simplification
by having one thing so you mentioned

468
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:21,240
by having one thing so you mentioned
 

469
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,210
by having one thing so you mentioned
modular Mojo is the programming language

470
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,220
modular Mojo is the programming language
 

471
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,089
modular Mojo is the programming language
modular is the whole software stack so

472
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:26,099
modular is the whole software stack so
 

473
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:27,529
modular is the whole software stack so
just over a year ago we started this

474
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:27,539
just over a year ago we started this
 

475
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:29,150
just over a year ago we started this
company called modular yeah okay what

476
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,160
company called modular yeah okay what
 

477
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,550
company called modular yeah okay what
modular is about is it's about taking Ai

478
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:31,560
modular is about is it's about taking Ai
 

479
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,589
modular is about is it's about taking Ai
and up leveling it into the Next

480
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:33,599
and up leveling it into the Next
 

481
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,889
and up leveling it into the Next
Generation right and so if you take a

482
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:36,899
Generation right and so if you take a
 

483
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,930
Generation right and so if you take a
step back what's gone on in the last

484
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:38,940
step back what's gone on in the last
 

485
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,089
step back what's gone on in the last
five six seven eight years is that we've

486
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:41,099
five six seven eight years is that we've
 

487
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,490
five six seven eight years is that we've
had things like tensorflow and pytorch

488
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:43,500
had things like tensorflow and pytorch
 

489
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,110
had things like tensorflow and pytorch
and these other systems come in you've

490
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
and these other systems come in you've
 

491
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,329
and these other systems come in you've
used them you know this and what's

492
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:47,339
used them you know this and what's
 

493
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,310
used them you know this and what's
happened is these things have grown like

494
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,320
happened is these things have grown like
 

495
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,889
happened is these things have grown like
crazy they get tons of users it's in

496
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:51,899
crazy they get tons of users it's in
 

497
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,570
crazy they get tons of users it's in
production deployment scenarios it's

498
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:53,580
production deployment scenarios it's
 

499
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,790
production deployment scenarios it's
being used to power so many systems I

500
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:55,800
being used to power so many systems I
 

501
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,949
being used to power so many systems I
mean AIS all around us now now it used

502
00:08:57,949 --> 00:08:57,959
mean AIS all around us now now it used
 

503
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,870
mean AIS all around us now now it used
to be controversial years ago but now

504
00:08:59,870 --> 00:08:59,880
to be controversial years ago but now
 

505
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,329
to be controversial years ago but now
it's a thing but the challenge with

506
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:02,339
it's a thing but the challenge with
 

507
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,470
it's a thing but the challenge with
these systems is that they haven't

508
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:03,480
these systems is that they haven't
 

509
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,670
these systems is that they haven't
always been

510
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:04,680
always been
 

511
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,269
always been
um thought out with current demands in

512
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:08,279
um thought out with current demands in
 

513
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,370
um thought out with current demands in
mind and so you think about it when

514
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:10,380
mind and so you think about it when
 

515
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,790
mind and so you think about it when
where were llms eight years ago well

516
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:13,800
where were llms eight years ago well
 

517
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,650
where were llms eight years ago well
they didn't exist right AI has changed

518
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:15,660
they didn't exist right AI has changed
 

519
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,389
they didn't exist right AI has changed
so much and a lot of what people are

520
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:17,399
so much and a lot of what people are
 

521
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,710
so much and a lot of what people are
doing today are very different than when

522
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
doing today are very different than when
 

523
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,690
doing today are very different than when
these systems were built and meanwhile

524
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:20,700
these systems were built and meanwhile
 

525
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,490
these systems were built and meanwhile
the hardware side of this has gone into

526
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:22,500
the hardware side of this has gone into
 

527
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,470
the hardware side of this has gone into
a huge mess there's tons of new chips

528
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
a huge mess there's tons of new chips
 

529
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,970
a huge mess there's tons of new chips
and accelerators and every every big

530
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:25,980
and accelerators and every every big
 

531
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,350
and accelerators and every every big
company's announcing a new chip every

532
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
company's announcing a new chip every
 

533
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,810
company's announcing a new chip every
day it feels like and so between that

534
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:29,820
day it feels like and so between that
 

535
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,290
day it feels like and so between that
you have like this moving system on one

536
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:33,300
you have like this moving system on one
 

537
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,910
you have like this moving system on one
side a moving system on the other side

538
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:34,920
side a moving system on the other side
 

539
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,350
side a moving system on the other side
and it just turns into this gigantic

540
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:36,360
and it just turns into this gigantic
 

541
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,150
and it just turns into this gigantic
mess which makes it very difficult for

542
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
mess which makes it very difficult for
 

543
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,670
mess which makes it very difficult for
people to actually use AI particularly

544
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:40,680
people to actually use AI particularly
 

545
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,350
people to actually use AI particularly
in production deployment scenarios

546
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,360
in production deployment scenarios
 

547
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,910
in production deployment scenarios
that's what modular is doing is we're

548
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
that's what modular is doing is we're
 

549
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,710
that's what modular is doing is we're
helping build out that software stack to

550
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:45,720
helping build out that software stack to
 

551
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,210
helping build out that software stack to
help solve some of those problems so

552
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:47,220
help solve some of those problems so
 

553
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,650
help solve some of those problems so
then people can be more productive and

554
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:48,660
then people can be more productive and
 

555
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,810
then people can be more productive and
get more AI Research into production

556
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:50,820
get more AI Research into production
 

557
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,449
get more AI Research into production
now what Mojo does is it's a really

558
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:53,459
now what Mojo does is it's a really
 

559
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,889
now what Mojo does is it's a really
really really important piece of that

560
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:54,899
really really important piece of that
 

561
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,290
really really important piece of that
and so that is you know part of that

562
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,300
and so that is you know part of that
 

563
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,730
and so that is you know part of that
engine and part of the technology that

564
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:58,740
engine and part of the technology that
 

565
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,949
engine and part of the technology that
allows us to solve these problems so

566
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
allows us to solve these problems so
 

567
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,410
allows us to solve these problems so
Mojo is a programming language that

568
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:03,420
Mojo is a programming language that
 

569
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,810
Mojo is a programming language that
allows you to do a higher level

570
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:05,820
allows you to do a higher level
 

571
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,670
allows you to do a higher level
programming the low level programming

572
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
programming the low level programming
 

573
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,610
programming the low level programming
like do all kinds of programming

574
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:10,620
like do all kinds of programming
 

575
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,710
like do all kinds of programming
in that spectrum that gets you closer

576
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
in that spectrum that gets you closer
 

577
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,690
in that spectrum that gets you closer
and closer to the hardware so take step

578
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:14,700
and closer to the hardware so take step
 

579
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,070
and closer to the hardware so take step
back so let's what do you love about

580
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:16,080
back so let's what do you love about
 

581
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,470
back so let's what do you love about

how when I can not just write but read

604
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:39,540
how when I can not just write but read
 

605
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,970
how when I can not just write but read
other people's code somehow I can

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:40,980
other people's code somehow I can
 

607
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,550
other people's code somehow I can

sexy little features yeah uh we'll

616
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,320
sexy little features yeah uh we'll
 

617
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,870
sexy little features yeah uh we'll
probably talk about some of them but

618
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
probably talk about some of them but
 

619
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,069
probably talk about some of them but
list comprehensions and stuff like this

620
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
list comprehensions and stuff like this
 

621
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,870
list comprehensions and stuff like this
and don't forget the entire ecosystem of

622
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
and don't forget the entire ecosystem of
 

623
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,009
and don't forget the entire ecosystem of
all the Packers oh yeah there's probably

624
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:04,019
all the Packers oh yeah there's probably
 

625
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,810
all the Packers oh yeah there's probably
huge there's always something if you

626
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:05,820
huge there's always something if you
 

627
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,310
huge there's always something if you
want to do anything there's always a

628
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:07,320
want to do anything there's always a
 

629
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,550
want to do anything there's always a
package yeah so it's not just

630
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:10,560
package yeah so it's not just
 

631
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,590
package yeah so it's not just
the ecosystem of the packages and the

632
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:12,600
the ecosystem of the packages and the
 

633
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,269
the ecosystem of the packages and the
ecosystem of the humans that do it that

634
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:14,279
ecosystem of the humans that do it that
 

635
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,949
ecosystem of the humans that do it that
that's a really

636
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:15,959
that's a really
 

637
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,530
that's a really
that's an interesting dynamic because I

638
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:18,540
that's an interesting dynamic because I
 

639
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,850
that's an interesting dynamic because I
think something

640
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:19,860
think something
 

641
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,550
think something
about the the usability and the

642
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
about the the usability and the
 

643
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,710
about the the usability and the
ecosystem makes the thing viral it grows

644
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
ecosystem makes the thing viral it grows
 

645
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,170
ecosystem makes the thing viral it grows
and then it's a virtuous cycle I think

646
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:27,180
and then it's a virtuous cycle I think
 

647
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,490
and then it's a virtuous cycle I think
well there's many things that went into

648
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:28,500
well there's many things that went into
 

649
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,230
well there's many things that went into
that like so I think that ml was very

650
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
that like so I think that ml was very
 

651
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,269
that like so I think that ml was very
good for Python and so I think that

652
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:32,279
good for Python and so I think that
 

653
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,250
good for Python and so I think that
tensorflow and pytorch in these systems

654
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,260
tensorflow and pytorch in these systems
 

655
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,949
tensorflow and pytorch in these systems
embracing python really took and helped

656
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
embracing python really took and helped
 

657
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,769
embracing python really took and helped
python grow but I think that the major

658
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:39,779
python grow but I think that the major
 

659
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,329
python grow but I think that the major
thing underlying it is that Python's

660
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:41,339
thing underlying it is that Python's
 

661
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,030
thing underlying it is that Python's
like the universal connector right it

662
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,040
like the universal connector right it
 

663
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,410
like the universal connector right it
really helps bring together lots of

664
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:45,420
really helps bring together lots of
 

665
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,730
really helps bring together lots of
different systems so you can compose

666
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:46,740
different systems so you can compose
 

667
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,230
different systems so you can compose
them and build out larger systems

668
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
them and build out larger systems
 

669
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,430
them and build out larger systems
without having to understand how it

670
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
without having to understand how it
 

671
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,130
without having to understand how it
works but then what is the problem with

672
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,140
works but then what is the problem with
 

673
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,030
works but then what is the problem with
python

674
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
python
 

675
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,949
python
well I guess you could say several

676
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
well I guess you could say several
 

677
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,110
well I guess you could say several
things but probably that it's slow

678
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
things but probably that it's slow
 

679
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,430
things but probably that it's slow
I think that's usually what people

680
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:58,440
I think that's usually what people
 

681
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,069
I think that's usually what people
complain about right and so slow I mean

682
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,079
complain about right and so slow I mean
 

683
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,810
complain about right and so slow I mean
other people complain about tabs in

684
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:02,820
other people complain about tabs in
 

685
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,610
other people complain about tabs in
spaces versus curly braces or whatever

686
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:04,620
spaces versus curly braces or whatever
 

687
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,949
spaces versus curly braces or whatever
but I mean those people are just wrong

688
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:06,959
but I mean those people are just wrong
 

689
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,170
but I mean those people are just wrong
because it is actually just better to

690
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:09,180
because it is actually just better to
 

691
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,750
because it is actually just better to
use indentation

692
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:10,760
use indentation
 

693
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,210
use indentation
wow strong words so actually I'm a small

694
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:14,220
wow strong words so actually I'm a small
 

695
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,009
wow strong words so actually I'm a small
change let's actually take that let's

00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:16,019
change let's actually take that let's

emacs for vs code the kind of hate mail

704
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:25,560

I had to receive because on the way to

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,930
doing that I also said I've considered
Vim yep and uh chose not to and went

710
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:32,940
Vim yep and uh chose not to and went
 

711
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,910
Vim yep and uh chose not to and went
with vs code and especially on deep

712
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:34,920
with vs code and especially on deep
 

713
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,329
with vs code and especially on deep
religions right anyway uh tabs is an

714
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:38,339
religions right anyway uh tabs is an
 

715
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,889
religions right anyway uh tabs is an
interesting design decision and so

716
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:39,899
interesting design decision and so
 

717
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,170
interesting design decision and so
you've really written a new programming

718
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,180
you've really written a new programming
 

719
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,650
you've really written a new programming
language here yes it is a a super set of

720
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:45,660
language here yes it is a a super set of
 

721
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,090
language here yes it is a a super set of
python but you can make a bunch of

722
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,100
python but you can make a bunch of
 

723
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,230
python but you can make a bunch of
different interesting decisions here

724
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
different interesting decisions here
 

725
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,269
different interesting decisions here
totally yeah and you chose actually to

726
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:50,279
totally yeah and you chose actually to
 

727
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,730
totally yeah and you chose actually to
stick with python is a

728
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:52,740
stick with python is a
 

729
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,550
stick with python is a
uh in terms of some of the syntax well

730
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:55,560
uh in terms of some of the syntax well
 

731
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,250
uh in terms of some of the syntax well
so let me explain why right so

732
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,260
so let me explain why right so
 

733
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,829
so let me explain why right so
I mean you can explain this in many

734
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:00,839
I mean you can explain this in many
 

735
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,590
I mean you can explain this in many
rational ways I think that the

736
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
rational ways I think that the
 

737
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,150
rational ways I think that the
indentation is beautiful but that's not

738
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,160
indentation is beautiful but that's not
 

739
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,250
indentation is beautiful but that's not
a rational explanation right so but I

740
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:07,260
a rational explanation right so but I
 

741
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,750
a rational explanation right so but I
can defend it rationally right so first

742
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:08,760
can defend it rationally right so first
 

743
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,030
can defend it rationally right so first
of all python one

744
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
of all python one
 

745
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,250
of all python one
has millions of programmers yeah it is

746
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,260
has millions of programmers yeah it is
 

747
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,569
has millions of programmers yeah it is
huge it's everywhere it owns machine

748
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:14,579
huge it's everywhere it owns machine
 

749
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,569
huge it's everywhere it owns machine
learning right so factually it is the

750
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:17,579
learning right so factually it is the
 

751
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,550
learning right so factually it is the
thing right second of all if you look at

752
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
thing right second of all if you look at
 

753
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,310
thing right second of all if you look at
it C code C plus plus code Java whatever

754
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
it C code C plus plus code Java whatever
 

755
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,210
it C code C plus plus code Java whatever
Swift curly brace languages also run

756
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:26,220
Swift curly brace languages also run
 

757
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,530
Swift curly brace languages also run
through formatting tools and get

758
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:27,540
through formatting tools and get
 

759
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,350
through formatting tools and get
indented and so if they're not indented

760
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:30,360
indented and so if they're not indented
 

761
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,810
indented and so if they're not indented
correctly first of all we'll twist your

762
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:32,820
correctly first of all we'll twist your
 

763
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,509
correctly first of all we'll twist your
brain around it can lead to bugs there's

764
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
brain around it can lead to bugs there's
 

765
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,310
brain around it can lead to bugs there's
notorious bugs that have happened across

766
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:37,320
notorious bugs that have happened across
 

767
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,470
notorious bugs that have happened across
time where the indentation was wrong or

768
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:39,480
time where the indentation was wrong or
 

769
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,150
time where the indentation was wrong or
misleading and it wasn't formatted right

770
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,160
misleading and it wasn't formatted right
 

771
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,790
misleading and it wasn't formatted right
and so it turned into an issue right and

772
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:43,800
and so it turned into an issue right and
 

773
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,650
and so it turned into an issue right and
so what ends up happening in modern

774
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:45,660
so what ends up happening in modern
 

775
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,389
so what ends up happening in modern
large-scale code bases is people run

776
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:47,399
large-scale code bases is people run
 

777
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,129
large-scale code bases is people run
automatic formatters

778
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:49,139
automatic formatters
 

779
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,389
automatic formatters
so now what you end up with is

780
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:50,399
so now what you end up with is
 

781
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,389
so now what you end up with is
indentation and curly braces

782
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:53,399
indentation and curly braces
 

783
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,030
indentation and curly braces
well if you're going to have

784
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,040
well if you're going to have
 

785
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,090
well if you're going to have
you know the notion of grouping why not

786
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,100
you know the notion of grouping why not
 

787
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,949
you know the notion of grouping why not
have one thing right and get rid of all

788
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
have one thing right and get rid of all
 

789
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,030
have one thing right and get rid of all
the Clutter and have a more beautiful

790
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,040
the Clutter and have a more beautiful
 

791
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,650
the Clutter and have a more beautiful
thing right also you look at many of

792
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:03,660
thing right also you look at many of
 

793
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,790
thing right also you look at many of
these languages it's like okay well we

794
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
these languages it's like okay well we
 

795
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,069
these languages it's like okay well we
can have curly braces or you can omit

796
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:07,079
can have curly braces or you can omit
 

797
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,329
can have curly braces or you can omit
them if there's one statement or you

798
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:08,339
them if there's one statement or you
 

799
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:09,829
them if there's one statement or you
just like enter this entire world of

800
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
just like enter this entire world of
 

801
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,650
just like enter this entire world of
complicated design space that

802
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:11,660
complicated design space that
 

803
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,550
complicated design space that
objectively you don't need if you have

804
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:13,560
objectively you don't need if you have
 

805
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,129
objectively you don't need if you have
python style indentation so yeah I would

806
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:16,139
python style indentation so yeah I would
 

807
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,509
python style indentation so yeah I would
love to actually see statistics on

808
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
love to actually see statistics on
 

809
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,090
love to actually see statistics on
errors made because of indentation like

810
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,100
errors made because of indentation like
 

811
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,949
errors made because of indentation like
how many errors are made in python

812
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:21,959
how many errors are made in python
 

813
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:24,290
how many errors are made in python
versus in C plus plus that have to do

814
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:24,300
versus in C plus plus that have to do
 

815
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,090
versus in C plus plus that have to do
with basic formatting all that kind of

816
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,100
with basic formatting all that kind of
 

817
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,650
with basic formatting all that kind of
stuff I would love to see I think it's

818
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:27,660
stuff I would love to see I think it's
 

819
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,329
stuff I would love to see I think it's
it's probably pretty minor because once

820
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:29,339
it's probably pretty minor because once
 

821
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,090
it's probably pretty minor because once
you get uh like you use vs code I do too

822
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,100
you get uh like you use vs code I do too
 

823
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,829
you get uh like you use vs code I do too
so if you get vs code set up it does the

824
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
so if you get vs code set up it does the
 

825
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,629
so if you get vs code set up it does the
indentation for you generally right and

826
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:35,639
indentation for you generally right and
 

827
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,009
indentation for you generally right and
so you don't you know it's actually

828
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:37,019
so you don't you know it's actually
 

829
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,650
so you don't you know it's actually
really nice to not have to fight it and

830
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:39,660
really nice to not have to fight it and
 

831
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,210
really nice to not have to fight it and
then what you can see is the editors

832
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,220
then what you can see is the editors
 

833
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,370
then what you can see is the editors
telling you how your code will work by

834
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:43,380
telling you how your code will work by
 

835
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,870
telling you how your code will work by
indenting it which I think is pretty

836
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
indenting it which I think is pretty
 

837
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,689
indenting it which I think is pretty
cool I honestly don't think

838
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:47,699
cool I honestly don't think
 

839
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:51,290
cool I honestly don't think
I've ever I don't remember having an

840
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,300
I've ever I don't remember having an
 

841
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,970
I've ever I don't remember having an
error in Python because I indented stuff

842
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:52,980
error in Python because I indented stuff
 

843
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,710
error in Python because I indented stuff
wrong so I mean I think that there's

844
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
wrong so I mean I think that there's
 

845
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,449
wrong so I mean I think that there's
again this is a religious thing and so I

846
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:56,459
again this is a religious thing and so I
 

847
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,610
again this is a religious thing and so I
can joke about it and I love I love to

848
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:58,620
can joke about it and I love I love to
 

849
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,050
can joke about it and I love I love to
kind of

850
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,060
kind of
 

851
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,030
kind of
you know I realized that this is such a

852
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,040
you know I realized that this is such a
 

853
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,590
you know I realized that this is such a
polarizing thing and everyone wants to

854
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
polarizing thing and everyone wants to
 

855
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,389
polarizing thing and everyone wants to
argue about and so I like poking at the

856
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:05,399
argue about and so I like poking at the
 

857
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,269
argue about and so I like poking at the
bear a little bit right but but frankly

858
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:08,279
bear a little bit right but but frankly
 

859
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,590
bear a little bit right but but frankly
right come back to the first point

860
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
right come back to the first point
 

861
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,230
right come back to the first point
python one like it's huge it's an AI um

862
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
python one like it's huge it's an AI um
 

863
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,150
python one like it's huge it's an AI um
it's the right thing for us like we see

864
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
it's the right thing for us like we see
 

865
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,650
it's the right thing for us like we see
mojos being an incredible part of the

866
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:15,660
mojos being an incredible part of the
 

867
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,930
mojos being an incredible part of the
Python ecosystem we're not looking to

868
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:17,940
Python ecosystem we're not looking to
 

869
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,970
Python ecosystem we're not looking to
break python or change it or quote

870
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:19,980
break python or change it or quote
 

871
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,370
break python or change it or quote
unquote fix it we love python for what

872
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:22,380
unquote fix it we love python for what
 

873
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,889
unquote fix it we love python for what
it is our view is that python is just

874
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:24,899
it is our view is that python is just
 

875
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:26,210
it is our view is that python is just
not done yet

876
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,220
not done yet
 

877
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,590
not done yet
and so if you look at you know you

878
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
and so if you look at you know you
 

879
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,210
and so if you look at you know you
mentioned python being slow well there's

880
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:29,220
mentioned python being slow well there's
 

881
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,290
mentioned python being slow well there's
a couple of different things go into

882
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:30,300
a couple of different things go into
 

883
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,550
a couple of different things go into
that which we can talk about if you want

884
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,560
that which we can talk about if you want
 

885
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,650
that which we can talk about if you want
but one of them is it just doesn't have

886
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:33,660
but one of them is it just doesn't have
 

887
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,750
but one of them is it just doesn't have
those features that you would use to do

888
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:35,760
those features that you would use to do
 

889
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,329
those features that you would use to do
c like programming and so if you say

890
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:38,339
c like programming and so if you say
 

891
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,610
c like programming and so if you say
okay well I'm forced out of python into

892
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:40,620
okay well I'm forced out of python into
 

893
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,769
okay well I'm forced out of python into
C for certain use cases

894
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:42,779
C for certain use cases
 

895
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,030
C for certain use cases
well then what we're doing is we're

896
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,040
well then what we're doing is we're
 

897
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,189
well then what we're doing is we're
saying okay well why why is that can we

898
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:46,199
saying okay well why why is that can we
 

899
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,810
saying okay well why why is that can we
just add those features that are missing

900
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:47,820
just add those features that are missing
 

901
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,509
just add those features that are missing
from python back up to Mojo and then you

902
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:50,519
from python back up to Mojo and then you
 

903
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,710
from python back up to Mojo and then you
can have everything that's great about

904
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:51,720
can have everything that's great about
 

905
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,030
can have everything that's great about
python all the things you're talking

906
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,040
python all the things you're talking
 

907
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,670
python all the things you're talking
about that you love plus not be forced

908
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
about that you love plus not be forced
 

909
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,990
about that you love plus not be forced
out of it when you do something a little

910
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,000
out of it when you do something a little
 

911
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,750
out of it when you do something a little
bit more computationally intense or

912
00:15:59,750 --> 00:15:59,760
bit more computationally intense or
 

913
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,269
bit more computationally intense or
weird or Hardware or whatever it is that

914
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:02,279
weird or Hardware or whatever it is that
 

915
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,790
weird or Hardware or whatever it is that
you're doing well a million questions I

916
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
you're doing well a million questions I
 

917
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,949
you're doing well a million questions I
want to ask what high level again is it

918
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
want to ask what high level again is it
 

919
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,329
want to ask what high level again is it
compiled or is it an interpretive

920
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:08,339
compiled or is it an interpretive
 

921
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:10,430
compiled or is it an interpretive
language so python is just in time

922
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:10,440
language so python is just in time
 

923
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,670
language so python is just in time
compilation what's what's Mojo

924
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
compilation what's what's Mojo
 

925
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,069
compilation what's what's Mojo
so Mojo a complicated answer does all

926
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
so Mojo a complicated answer does all
 

927
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,170
so Mojo a complicated answer does all
the things so it's interpreted it's Chip

928
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,180
the things so it's interpreted it's Chip
 

929
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,050
the things so it's interpreted it's Chip
compiled and it's statically compiled

930
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,060
compiled and it's statically compiled
 

931
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,210
compiled and it's statically compiled
um and so this is for a variety of

932
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:23,220
um and so this is for a variety of
 

933
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,009
um and so this is for a variety of
reasons so

934
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:25,019
reasons so
 

935
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,629
reasons so
one of the things that makes python

936
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
one of the things that makes python
 

937
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,569
one of the things that makes python
beautiful is that it's very Dynamic and

938
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:29,579
beautiful is that it's very Dynamic and
 

939
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,670
beautiful is that it's very Dynamic and
because it's Dynamic one of the things

940
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
because it's Dynamic one of the things
 

941
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,470
because it's Dynamic one of the things
they added is that it has this powerful

942
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:33,480
they added is that it has this powerful
 

943
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,569
they added is that it has this powerful
meta programming feature and so if you

944
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:35,579
meta programming feature and so if you
 

945
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,189
meta programming feature and so if you
look at something like pytorch or

946
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
look at something like pytorch or
 

947
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,430
look at something like pytorch or
tensorflow or or I mean even a simple

948
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:40,440
tensorflow or or I mean even a simple
 

949
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,009
tensorflow or or I mean even a simple
simple use case like you define a class

950
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:43,019
simple use case like you define a class
 

951
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,710
simple use case like you define a class
that has the plus method right you can

952
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:45,720
that has the plus method right you can
 

953
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,689
that has the plus method right you can
overload the dunder methods like Dunder

954
00:16:47,689 --> 00:16:47,699
overload the dunder methods like Dunder
 

955
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,790
overload the dunder methods like Dunder
add for example and then the plus method

956
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:49,800
add for example and then the plus method
 

957
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,889
add for example and then the plus method
works on your class and so it has very

958
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:51,899
works on your class and so it has very
 

959
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,569
works on your class and so it has very
nice and very expressive

960
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:53,579
nice and very expressive
 

961
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,569
nice and very expressive
Dynamic meta programming features

962
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:56,579
Dynamic meta programming features
 

963
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,670
Dynamic meta programming features
in Mojo we want all those features come

964
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:58,680
in Mojo we want all those features come
 

965
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,990
in Mojo we want all those features come
in like we don't want to break python we

966
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
in like we don't want to break python we
 

967
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,730
in like we don't want to break python we
want all the work but the problem is you

968
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:01,740
want all the work but the problem is you
 

969
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,069
want all the work but the problem is you
can't run those super Dynamic features

970
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:04,079
can't run those super Dynamic features
 

971
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,030
can't run those super Dynamic features
on an embedded processor or on a GPU

972
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,040
on an embedded processor or on a GPU
 

973
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,490
on an embedded processor or on a GPU
right or if you could you probably don't

974
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:10,500
right or if you could you probably don't
 

975
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,870
right or if you could you probably don't
want to just because of the performance

976
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:11,880
want to just because of the performance
 

977
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,090
want to just because of the performance
and so we entered this question of

978
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,100
and so we entered this question of
 

979
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,909
and so we entered this question of
saying okay how do you get the power of

980
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:16,919
saying okay how do you get the power of
 

981
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:20,270
saying okay how do you get the power of
this Dynamic meta programming into a

982
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:20,280
this Dynamic meta programming into a
 

983
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,650
this Dynamic meta programming into a
language that has to be super efficient

984
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:21,660
language that has to be super efficient
 

985
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,990
language that has to be super efficient
in specific cases and so what we did was

986
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,000
in specific cases and so what we did was
 

987
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,669
in specific cases and so what we did was
we said okay we'll take that interpreter

988
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
we said okay we'll take that interpreter
 

989
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,650
we said okay we'll take that interpreter
python has an interpreter in it right

990
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:27,660
python has an interpreter in it right
 

991
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,450
python has an interpreter in it right
take that interpreter and allow to run

992
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:29,460
take that interpreter and allow to run
 

993
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,210
take that interpreter and allow to run
it compile time and so now what you get

994
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:32,220
it compile time and so now what you get
 

995
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,250
it compile time and so now what you get
is you get compile time meta programming

996
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,260
is you get compile time meta programming
 

997
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,110
is you get compile time meta programming
and so this is super interesting and

998
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,120
and so this is super interesting and
 

999
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,909
and so this is super interesting and
super powerful because

1000
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
super powerful because
 

1001
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,710
super powerful because
one of the big advantages you get is you

1002
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:39,720
one of the big advantages you get is you
 

1003
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,470
one of the big advantages you get is you
get python style expressive apis you get

1004
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
get python style expressive apis you get
 

1005
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,990
get python style expressive apis you get
the ability to have overloaded operators

1006
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,000
the ability to have overloaded operators
 

1007
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,549
the ability to have overloaded operators
and if you look at what happens inside

1008
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:46,559
and if you look at what happens inside
 

1009
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,110
and if you look at what happens inside
of like pytorch for example with

1010
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,120
of like pytorch for example with
 

1011
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,970
of like pytorch for example with
automatic differentiation and eager mode

1012
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:49,980
automatic differentiation and eager mode
 

1013
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,590
automatic differentiation and eager mode
like all these things they're using

1014
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600
like all these things they're using
 

1015
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,150
like all these things they're using
these really Dynamic and Powerful

1016
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:53,160
these really Dynamic and Powerful
 

1017
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,310
these really Dynamic and Powerful
features at runtime but we can take

1018
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,320
features at runtime but we can take
 

1019
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,110
features at runtime but we can take
those features and lift them so they run

1020
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
those features and lift them so they run
 

1021
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,810
those features and lift them so they run
a compile time so you're because C plus

1022
00:17:59,810 --> 00:17:59,820
a compile time so you're because C plus
 

1023
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,090
a compile time so you're because C plus
does amount of programming with with

1024
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:02,100
does amount of programming with with
 

1025
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,830
does amount of programming with with
templates

1026
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
templates
 

1027
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,350
templates
but it's really messy it's super messy

1028
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:06,360
but it's really messy it's super messy
 

1029
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,470
but it's really messy it's super messy
it's it's always it was accidentally I

1030
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,480
it's it's always it was accidentally I
 

1031
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,669
it's it's always it was accidentally I
mean different people have different

1032
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:10,679
mean different people have different
 

1033
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,710
mean different people have different
interpretations my interpretation is

1034
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
interpretations my interpretation is
 

1035
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,510
interpretations my interpretation is
that it was made accidentally powerful

1036
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:14,520
that it was made accidentally powerful
 

1037
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,789
that it was made accidentally powerful
it was not designed to be terrain

1038
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
it was not designed to be terrain
 

1039
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,169
it was not designed to be terrain
complete for example but that was

1040
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:18,179
complete for example but that was
 

1041
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,610
complete for example but that was
discovered kind of along the way

1042
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:19,620
discovered kind of along the way
 

1043
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,529
discovered kind of along the way
accidentally

1044
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:21,539
accidentally
 

1045
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,150
accidentally
um and so there have been a number of

1046
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:23,160
um and so there have been a number of
 

1047
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,830
um and so there have been a number of
languages in the space and so they

1048
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:24,840
languages in the space and so they
 

1049
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,230
languages in the space and so they
usually have templates or code

1050
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:27,240
usually have templates or code
 

1051
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,970
usually have templates or code
instantiation code copying features of

1052
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:28,980
instantiation code copying features of
 

1053
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,770
instantiation code copying features of
various sorts

1054
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:30,780
various sorts
 

1055
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,690
various sorts
um some more modern languages or some

1056
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:32,700
um some more modern languages or some
 

1057
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,210
um some more modern languages or some
more newer languages let's say like you

1058
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,220
more newer languages let's say like you
 

1059
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,750
more newer languages let's say like you
know they're fairly unknown like Zig for

1060
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:38,760
know they're fairly unknown like Zig for
 

1061
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,710
know they're fairly unknown like Zig for
example

1062
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:39,720
example
 

1063
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,289
example
um says okay well let's take all of

1064
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:42,299
um says okay well let's take all of
 

1065
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,210
um says okay well let's take all of
those types so you can run it all those

1066
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,220
those types so you can run it all those
 

1067
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,250
those types so you can run it all those
things you can do at runtime and allow

1068
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,260
things you can do at runtime and allow
 

1069
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,830
things you can do at runtime and allow
them to happen at compile time and so

1070
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:48,840
them to happen at compile time and so
 

1071
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,810
them to happen at compile time and so
one of the problems with C plus plus I

1072
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:50,820
one of the problems with C plus plus I
 

1073
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,970
one of the problems with C plus plus I
mean which is one of one of the problems

1074
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:52,980
mean which is one of one of the problems
 

1075
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,490
mean which is one of one of the problems
with C plus plus there we go is wrong

1076
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:55,500
with C plus plus there we go is wrong
 

1077
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,409
with C plus plus there we go is wrong
words

1078
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:56,419
words
 

1079
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,909
words
oh that's okay I mean everybody hates me

1080
00:18:58,909 --> 00:18:58,919
oh that's okay I mean everybody hates me
 

1081
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:00,169
oh that's okay I mean everybody hates me
for a variety of reasons anyways I'm

1082
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:00,179
for a variety of reasons anyways I'm
 

1083
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,630
for a variety of reasons anyways I'm
sure right I've written that's the way

1084
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
sure right I've written that's the way
 

1085
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,610
sure right I've written that's the way
they show love I have written enough C

1086
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:04,620
they show love I have written enough C
 

1087
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,230
they show love I have written enough C
plus plus code to earn a little bit of

1088
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
plus plus code to earn a little bit of
 

1089
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,570
plus plus code to earn a little bit of
grumpiness with C plus plus but

1090
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:08,580
grumpiness with C plus plus but
 

1091
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,610
grumpiness with C plus plus but
um but one of the problems with it is

1092
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:10,620
um but one of the problems with it is
 

1093
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,930
um but one of the problems with it is
that the meta programming system

1094
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:11,940
that the meta programming system
 

1095
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,090
that the meta programming system
templates is just a completely different

1096
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,100
templates is just a completely different
 

1097
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,850
templates is just a completely different
Universe from the normal runtime

1098
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:16,860
Universe from the normal runtime
 

1099
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,130
Universe from the normal runtime
programming world and so if you do meta

1100
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,140
programming world and so if you do meta
 

1101
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,630
programming world and so if you do meta
programming and programming it's just

1102
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:20,640
programming and programming it's just
 

1103
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,590
programming and programming it's just
like a different Universe different

1104
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
like a different Universe different
 

1105
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,990
like a different Universe different
syntax different concepts different

1106
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
syntax different concepts different
 

1107
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,270
syntax different concepts different
stuff going on and so again one of our

1108
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,280
stuff going on and so again one of our
 

1109
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,190
stuff going on and so again one of our
goals with mojos to make things really

1110
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,200
goals with mojos to make things really
 

1111
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,470
goals with mojos to make things really
easy to use easy to learn and so there's

1112
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
easy to use easy to learn and so there's
 

1113
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,570
easy to use easy to learn and so there's
a natural stepping stone

1114
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:32,580
a natural stepping stone
 

1115
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,430
a natural stepping stone
and so as you do this you say okay well

1116
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:34,440
and so as you do this you say okay well
 

1117
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,169
and so as you do this you say okay well
I have to do programming at runtime

1118
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:36,179
I have to do programming at runtime
 

1119
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,990
I have to do programming at runtime
after you do programming at compile time

1120
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:39,000
after you do programming at compile time
 

1121
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,870
after you do programming at compile time
why are these different things how hard

1122
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:41,880
why are these different things how hard
 

1123
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,890
why are these different things how hard
is that to pull it up because that

1124
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:42,900
is that to pull it up because that
 

1125
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,750
is that to pull it up because that
sounds to me as a fan of meta

1126
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:44,760
sounds to me as a fan of meta
 

1127
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,970
sounds to me as a fan of meta
programming in c plus even

1128
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:46,980
programming in c plus even
 

1129
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,310
programming in c plus even
how how hard is it to pull that off that

1130
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,320
how how hard is it to pull that off that
 

1131
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,630
how how hard is it to pull that off that
sounds really really exciting because

1132
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
sounds really really exciting because
 

1133
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,970
sounds really really exciting because
you can do the same style programming at

1134
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:52,980
you can do the same style programming at
 

1135
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,950
you can do the same style programming at
compile time in a runtime that's really

1136
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
compile time in a runtime that's really
 

1137
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,110
compile time in a runtime that's really
really exciting yep and so I mean in

1138
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
really exciting yep and so I mean in
 

1139
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,370
really exciting yep and so I mean in
terms of the compiler implementation

1140
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:58,380
terms of the compiler implementation
 

1141
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,350
terms of the compiler implementation
details it's hard

1142
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,360
details it's hard
 

1143
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,390
details it's hard
I won't be shy about that it's super

1144
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
I won't be shy about that it's super
 

1145
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,150
I won't be shy about that it's super
hard it requires I mean what Mojo has

1146
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,160
hard it requires I mean what Mojo has
 

1147
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,470
hard it requires I mean what Mojo has
underneath the covers is a completely

1148
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
underneath the covers is a completely
 

1149
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,270
underneath the covers is a completely
new approach to the design of the

1150
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,280
new approach to the design of the
 

1151
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,610
new approach to the design of the
compiler itself and so this Builds on

1152
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:10,620
compiler itself and so this Builds on
 

1153
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,289
compiler itself and so this Builds on
these Technologies like mlir that you

1154
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:12,299
these Technologies like mlir that you
 

1155
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,150
these Technologies like mlir that you
mentioned but it also includes other

1156
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:14,160
mentioned but it also includes other
 

1157
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,750
mentioned but it also includes other
like caching and other interpreters and

1158
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
like caching and other interpreters and
 

1159
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,490
like caching and other interpreters and
jit compilers and other stuff like so

1160
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:19,500
jit compilers and other stuff like so
 

1161
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,390
jit compilers and other stuff like so
you have like an interpreter inside

1162
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
you have like an interpreter inside
 

1163
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,270
you have like an interpreter inside
within the compiler yes

1164
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:23,280
within the compiler yes
 

1165
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,370
within the compiler yes
and so it really takes the standard

1166
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:25,380
and so it really takes the standard
 

1167
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,270
and so it really takes the standard
model of programming languages and kind

1168
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
model of programming languages and kind
 

1169
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,250
model of programming languages and kind
of twisted and unifies it with the

1170
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:31,260
of twisted and unifies it with the
 

1171
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,289
of twisted and unifies it with the
runtime model right which I think is

1172
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:33,299
runtime model right which I think is
 

1173
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,270
runtime model right which I think is
really cool and to me the value of that

1174
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
really cool and to me the value of that
 

1175
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,130
really cool and to me the value of that
is that again many of these languages

1176
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,140
is that again many of these languages
 

1177
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,570
is that again many of these languages
have meta programming features like they

1178
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:38,580
have meta programming features like they
 

1179
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,730
have meta programming features like they
grow macros or something right lisp

1180
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:40,740
grow macros or something right lisp
 

1181
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,330
grow macros or something right lisp
right yes I know your roots right

1182
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:44,340
right yes I know your roots right
 

1183
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,549
right yes I know your roots right
um you know and this is a powerful thing

1184
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
um you know and this is a powerful thing
 

1185
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,289
um you know and this is a powerful thing
right and so you know if you go back to

1186
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:48,299
right and so you know if you go back to
 

1187
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,490
right and so you know if you go back to
list one of the most powerful things

1188
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:49,500
list one of the most powerful things
 

1189
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,770
list one of the most powerful things
about about it is that it said that the

1190
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:51,780
about about it is that it said that the
 

1191
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,090
about about it is that it said that the
meta programming the programming are the

1192
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:53,100
meta programming the programming are the
 

1193
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,310
meta programming the programming are the
same right and so that made it way

1194
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:55,320
same right and so that made it way
 

1195
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,110
same right and so that made it way
simpler way more consistent way easier

1196
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,120
simpler way more consistent way easier
 

1197
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,789
simpler way more consistent way easier
to understand reason about and it made

1198
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
to understand reason about and it made
 

1199
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,350
to understand reason about and it made
it more composable so if you build a

1200
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,360
it more composable so if you build a
 

1201
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,970
it more composable so if you build a
library you can use it both at runtime

1202
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:01,980
library you can use it both at runtime
 

1203
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,350
library you can use it both at runtime
and compile time

1204
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
and compile time
 

1205
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,450
and compile time
which is pretty cool yeah and then for

1206
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:05,460
which is pretty cool yeah and then for
 

1207
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,529
which is pretty cool yeah and then for
machine learning I think meta

1208
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:06,539
machine learning I think meta
 

1209
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:07,850
machine learning I think meta
programming

1210
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:07,860
programming
 

1211
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,190
programming
I think we could generally say is

1212
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:10,200
I think we could generally say is
 

1213
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,430
I think we could generally say is
extremely useful and so you get features

1214
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
extremely useful and so you get features
 

1215
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,130
extremely useful and so you get features
I mean I'll jump around but there's the

1216
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,140
I mean I'll jump around but there's the
 

1217
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,169
I mean I'll jump around but there's the
feature of Auto tuning and adaptive

1218
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:18,179
feature of Auto tuning and adaptive
 

1219
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:21,049
feature of Auto tuning and adaptive
compilation just blows my mind yeah well

1220
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:21,059
compilation just blows my mind yeah well
 

1221
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,669
compilation just blows my mind yeah well
so okay so let's come back to that all

1222
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:22,679
so okay so let's come back to that all
 

1223
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,650
so okay so let's come back to that all
right so so what what is what is what is

1224
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:24,660
right so so what what is what is what is
 

1225
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,909
right so so what what is what is what is
machine learning like or what is a

1226
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
machine learning like or what is a
 

1227
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:26,930
machine learning like or what is a
machine learning model like you take a

1228
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:26,940
machine learning model like you take a
 

1229
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,270
machine learning model like you take a
pie torch model off the internet right

1230
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
pie torch model off the internet right
 

1231
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,590
pie torch model off the internet right
um it's really interesting to me because

1232
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:30,600
um it's really interesting to me because
 

1233
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,570
um it's really interesting to me because
what a pipe what pi torch and what

1234
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:32,580
what a pipe what pi torch and what
 

1235
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,370
what a pipe what pi torch and what
tensorflow and all these Frameworks are

1236
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:34,380
tensorflow and all these Frameworks are
 

1237
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,049
tensorflow and all these Frameworks are
kind of pushing compute into as they're

1238
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:36,059
kind of pushing compute into as they're
 

1239
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,149
kind of pushing compute into as they're
pushing into like this abstract

1240
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
pushing into like this abstract
 

1241
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,149
pushing into like this abstract
specification of a compute problem which

1242
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:41,159
specification of a compute problem which
 

1243
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,409
specification of a compute problem which
then gets mapped in a whole bunch of

1244
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:42,419
then gets mapped in a whole bunch of
 

1245
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,149
then gets mapped in a whole bunch of
different ways right so this is why it

1246
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
different ways right so this is why it
 

1247
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,590
different ways right so this is why it
became a meta programming problem is

1248
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
became a meta programming problem is
 

1249
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,450
became a meta programming problem is
that you want to be able to say cool I

1250
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:47,460
that you want to be able to say cool I
 

1251
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,490
that you want to be able to say cool I
have I have this neural net now run with

1252
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:49,500
have I have this neural net now run with
 

1253
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,029
have I have this neural net now run with
batch size a thousand right do do do a

1254
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
batch size a thousand right do do do a
 

1255
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,430
batch size a thousand right do do do a
mapping across batch or okay I want to

1256
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
mapping across batch or okay I want to
 

1257
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,169
mapping across batch or okay I want to
take this problem now running across a

1258
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:57,179
take this problem now running across a
 

1259
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:00,350
take this problem now running across a
thousand CPUs or gpus right and so like

1260
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:00,360
thousand CPUs or gpus right and so like
 

1261
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,049
thousand CPUs or gpus right and so like
this this problem of like just describe

1262
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:03,059
this this problem of like just describe
 

1263
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,090
this this problem of like just describe
the compute and then map it and do

1264
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,100
the compute and then map it and do
 

1265
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,490
the compute and then map it and do
things and transform it or like actually

1266
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:07,500
things and transform it or like actually
 

1267
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,230
things and transform it or like actually
it's very profound and that's one of the

1268
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,240
it's very profound and that's one of the
 

1269
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,250
it's very profound and that's one of the
things that makes machine Learning

1270
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:10,260
things that makes machine Learning
 

1271
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,890
things that makes machine Learning
Systems really special uh maybe can you

1272
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:12,900
Systems really special uh maybe can you
 

1273
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,289
Systems really special uh maybe can you
describe Auto tuning and how do you pull

1274
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:15,299
describe Auto tuning and how do you pull
 

1275
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,510
describe Auto tuning and how do you pull
off I mean I guess adaptive compilation

1276
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
off I mean I guess adaptive compilation
 

1277
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,070
off I mean I guess adaptive compilation
is what we're talking about as meta

1278
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,080
is what we're talking about as meta
 

1279
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,330
is what we're talking about as meta
programming yeah how do you pull off

1280
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:20,340
programming yeah how do you pull off
 

1281
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,250
programming yeah how do you pull off
auto-tune I mean is that is that as

1282
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,260
auto-tune I mean is that is that as
 

1283
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,990
auto-tune I mean is that is that as
profound as I think it is it seems like

1284
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,000
profound as I think it is it seems like
 

1285
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,270
profound as I think it is it seems like
a really like uh you know we'll

1286
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:26,280
a really like uh you know we'll
 

1287
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,330
a really like uh you know we'll
mentioned list comprehensions to me from

1288
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:29,340
mentioned list comprehensions to me from
 

1289
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,330
mentioned list comprehensions to me from
a quick glass of Mojo uh which by the

1290
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:32,340
a quick glass of Mojo uh which by the
 

1291
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,230
a quick glass of Mojo uh which by the
way I have to absolutely like dive in uh

1292
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:35,240
way I have to absolutely like dive in uh
 

1293
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,789
way I have to absolutely like dive in uh
as I realized how amazing this is I

1294
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:37,799
as I realized how amazing this is I
 

1295
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,370
as I realized how amazing this is I
absolutely must have been uh it that

1296
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:40,380
absolutely must have been uh it that
 

1297
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,870
absolutely must have been uh it that
looks like just an incredible feature

1298
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:41,880
looks like just an incredible feature
 

1299
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,789
looks like just an incredible feature
for machine learning people yeah well so

1300
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:43,799
for machine learning people yeah well so
 

1301
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,070
for machine learning people yeah well so
so what is autotune so take a step back

1302
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,080
so what is autotune so take a step back
 

1303
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,049
so what is autotune so take a step back
Auto tuning is a feature in Mojo it's

1304
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:48,059
Auto tuning is a feature in Mojo it's
 

1305
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,029
Auto tuning is a feature in Mojo it's
not so very very little of what we're

1306
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:50,039
not so very very little of what we're
 

1307
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,830
not so very very little of what we're
doing is actually research like many of

1308
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
doing is actually research like many of
 

1309
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,930
doing is actually research like many of
these ideas have existed in other

1310
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:53,940
these ideas have existed in other
 

1311
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,370
these ideas have existed in other
systems and other places and so what

1312
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:55,380
systems and other places and so what
 

1313
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,270
systems and other places and so what
we're doing is we're pulling together

1314
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,280
we're doing is we're pulling together
 

1315
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,029
we're doing is we're pulling together
good ideas remixing them and making them

1316
00:22:59,029 --> 00:22:59,039
good ideas remixing them and making them
 

1317
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,010
good ideas remixing them and making them
into hopefully a beautiful system right

1318
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,020
into hopefully a beautiful system right
 

1319
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,649
into hopefully a beautiful system right
and so Auto tuning the observation is

1320
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:03,659
and so Auto tuning the observation is
 

1321
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:06,970
and so Auto tuning the observation is
that it turns out hardware systems

1322
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:06,980
that it turns out hardware systems
 

1323
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,710
that it turns out hardware systems
algorithms are really complicated turns

1324
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:09,720
algorithms are really complicated turns
 

1325
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,090
algorithms are really complicated turns
out maybe you don't actually want to

1326
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,100
out maybe you don't actually want to
 

1327
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,010
out maybe you don't actually want to
know how the hardware works

1328
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:13,020
know how the hardware works
 

1329
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,289
know how the hardware works
right A lot of people don't right and so

1330
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:15,299
right A lot of people don't right and so
 

1331
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,090
right A lot of people don't right and so
there are lots of really smart Hardware

1332
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,100
there are lots of really smart Hardware
 

1333
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,370
there are lots of really smart Hardware
people I know a lot of them uh where

1334
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:19,380
people I know a lot of them uh where
 

1335
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,010
people I know a lot of them uh where
they know everything about okay the the

1336
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:22,020
they know everything about okay the the
 

1337
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,570
they know everything about okay the the
cache size is this and the number of

1338
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:23,580
cache size is this and the number of
 

1339
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,130
cache size is this and the number of
registers is that and if you use this

1340
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:25,140
registers is that and if you use this
 

1341
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,570
registers is that and if you use this
what length of vector is going to be

1342
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:26,580
what length of vector is going to be
 

1343
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,130
what length of vector is going to be
super efficient because it Maps directly

1344
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:28,140
super efficient because it Maps directly
 

1345
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,750
super efficient because it Maps directly
onto what it can do and like all this

1346
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
onto what it can do and like all this
 

1347
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,730
onto what it can do and like all this
kind of stuff or the GPU has SMS and it

1348
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:31,740
kind of stuff or the GPU has SMS and it
 

1349
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,770
kind of stuff or the GPU has SMS and it
has a warp size of whatever right all

1350
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:33,780
has a warp size of whatever right all
 

1351
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,090
has a warp size of whatever right all
the stuff that goes into these things or

1352
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,100
the stuff that goes into these things or
 

1353
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,310
the stuff that goes into these things or
the dial size of a TPU is 128 like these

1354
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:37,320
the dial size of a TPU is 128 like these
 

1355
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,190
the dial size of a TPU is 128 like these
these factoids right

1356
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,200
these factoids right
 

1357
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,490
these factoids right
my belief is that most normal people and

1358
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:43,500
my belief is that most normal people and
 

1359
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,930
my belief is that most normal people and
I love Hardware people also I'm not

1360
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:44,940
I love Hardware people also I'm not
 

1361
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,250
I love Hardware people also I'm not
trying to offend literally everybody in

1362
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,260
trying to offend literally everybody in
 

1363
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,390
trying to offend literally everybody in
the internet

1364
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:47,400
the internet
 

1365
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,909
the internet
um but uh most programmers actually

1366
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
um but uh most programmers actually
 

1367
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,950
um but uh most programmers actually
don't want to know this stuff right and

1368
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:51,960
don't want to know this stuff right and
 

1369
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,570
don't want to know this stuff right and
so if you come at it from perspective of

1370
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:53,580
so if you come at it from perspective of
 

1371
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,669
so if you come at it from perspective of
how do we allow people to build both

1372
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
how do we allow people to build both
 

1373
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,710
how do we allow people to build both
more abstracted but also more portable

1374
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:57,720
more abstracted but also more portable
 

1375
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,730
more abstracted but also more portable
code

1376
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:58,740
code
 

1377
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,350
code
because you know it could be that the

1378
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,360
because you know it could be that the
 

1379
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,789
because you know it could be that the
vector length changes or the cash size

1380
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:01,799
vector length changes or the cash size
 

1381
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,289
vector length changes or the cash size
changes it could be that the tile size

1382
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:03,299
changes it could be that the tile size
 

1383
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,330
changes it could be that the tile size
of your Matrix changes or the number you

1384
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:05,340
of your Matrix changes or the number you
 

1385
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,610
of your Matrix changes or the number you
know an a100 versus an h100 versus a

1386
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:07,620
know an a100 versus an h100 versus a
 

1387
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,010
know an a100 versus an h100 versus a
Volta versus whatever GPU have different

1388
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,020
Volta versus whatever GPU have different
 

1389
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,930
Volta versus whatever GPU have different
characteristics right a lot of the

1390
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:11,940
characteristics right a lot of the
 

1391
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,730
characteristics right a lot of the
algorithms that you run are actually the

1392
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:13,740
algorithms that you run are actually the
 

1393
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,190
algorithms that you run are actually the
same but the parameters these magic

1394
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,200
same but the parameters these magic
 

1395
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,810
same but the parameters these magic
numbers you have to fill in end up being

1396
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:17,820
numbers you have to fill in end up being
 

1397
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,210
numbers you have to fill in end up being
really fiddly numbers that an expert has

1398
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:20,220
really fiddly numbers that an expert has
 

1399
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,250
really fiddly numbers that an expert has
to go figure out and so what Auto tuning

1400
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,260
to go figure out and so what Auto tuning
 

1401
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,870
to go figure out and so what Auto tuning
does it says okay well

1402
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:23,880
does it says okay well
 

1403
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,549
does it says okay well
guess what there's a lot of compute out

1404
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:25,559
guess what there's a lot of compute out
 

1405
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,450
guess what there's a lot of compute out
there

1406
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:26,460
there
 

1407
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,430
there
right so instead of having humans go

1408
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:28,440
right so instead of having humans go
 

1409
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,350
right so instead of having humans go
randomly try all the things or do a grid

1410
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,360
randomly try all the things or do a grid
 

1411
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,789
randomly try all the things or do a grid
search or go search some complicated

1412
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:31,799
search or go search some complicated
 

1413
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,010
search or go search some complicated
multi-dimensional space

1414
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,020
multi-dimensional space
 

1415
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,510
multi-dimensional space
how about we have computers do that

1416
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
how about we have computers do that
 

1417
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,850
how about we have computers do that
right and so autotuning does is you can

1418
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:37,860
right and so autotuning does is you can
 

1419
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,950
right and so autotuning does is you can
say hey here's my algorithm

1420
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:39,960
say hey here's my algorithm
 

1421
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,649
say hey here's my algorithm
if it's a a matrix operation or

1422
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:42,659
if it's a a matrix operation or
 

1423
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,029
if it's a a matrix operation or
something like that you can say okay I'm

1424
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:44,039
something like that you can say okay I'm
 

1425
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,590
something like that you can say okay I'm
going to carve it up into blocks I'm

1426
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
going to carve it up into blocks I'm
 

1427
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,149
going to carve it up into blocks I'm
going to do those blocks in parallel and

1428
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:47,159
going to do those blocks in parallel and
 

1429
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:50,090
going to do those blocks in parallel and
I want this this with 128 things that

1430
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,100
I want this this with 128 things that
 

1431
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,590
I want this this with 128 things that
I'm running on I want to cut it this way

1432
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:51,600
I'm running on I want to cut it this way
 

1433
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,390
I'm running on I want to cut it this way
or that way or whatever and you can say

1434
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:53,400
or that way or whatever and you can say
 

1435
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,710
or that way or whatever and you can say
hey go see which one's actually

1436
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
hey go see which one's actually
 

1437
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,049
hey go see which one's actually
empirically better on the system

1438
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:57,059
empirically better on the system
 

1439
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,510
empirically better on the system
and then the result of that you cash for

1440
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
and then the result of that you cash for
 

1441
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,970
and then the result of that you cash for
that system yep you save it and so come

1442
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:01,980
that system yep you save it and so come
 

1443
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,149
that system yep you save it and so come
back to twisting your compiler brain

1444
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:05,159
back to twisting your compiler brain
 

1445
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,549
back to twisting your compiler brain
right so not only does the compiler have

1446
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:07,559
right so not only does the compiler have
 

1447
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,110
right so not only does the compiler have
an interpreter that's used to do meta

1448
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,120
an interpreter that's used to do meta
 

1449
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,909
an interpreter that's used to do meta
programming that compiler that

1450
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:10,919
programming that compiler that
 

1451
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,010
programming that compiler that
interpreter that meta programming now

1452
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:13,020
interpreter that meta programming now
 

1453
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,690
interpreter that meta programming now
has to actually take your code and go

1454
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:14,700
has to actually take your code and go
 

1455
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,330
has to actually take your code and go
run it on a Target machine

1456
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:17,340
run it on a Target machine
 

1457
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,370
run it on a Target machine
see which one it likes the best and then

1458
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:19,380
see which one it likes the best and then
 

1459
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,930
see which one it likes the best and then
Stitch it in and then keep going right

1460
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:20,940
Stitch it in and then keep going right
 

1461
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,610
Stitch it in and then keep going right
so part of the compilation is machine

1462
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:22,620
so part of the compilation is machine
 

1463
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,130
so part of the compilation is machine
specific yeah well so I mean this is an

1464
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:25,140
specific yeah well so I mean this is an
 

1465
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,330
specific yeah well so I mean this is an
optional feature right so you don't have

1466
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:26,340
optional feature right so you don't have
 

1467
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,590
optional feature right so you don't have
to use it for everything but yeah if you

1468
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,600
to use it for everything but yeah if you
 

1469
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,409
to use it for everything but yeah if you
if you're so one one of one of the

1470
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:30,419
if you're so one one of one of the
 

1471
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:31,789
if you're so one one of one of the
things that we're in the quest of is

1472
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:31,799
things that we're in the quest of is
 

1473
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,850
things that we're in the quest of is
Ultimate performance yes right ultimate

1474
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:34,860
Ultimate performance yes right ultimate
 

1475
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,110
Ultimate performance yes right ultimate
performance is important for a couple of

1476
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,120
performance is important for a couple of
 

1477
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,549
performance is important for a couple of
reasons right so if you're an Enterprise

1478
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:37,559
reasons right so if you're an Enterprise
 

1479
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,409
reasons right so if you're an Enterprise
you're looking to save cost and compute

1480
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:39,419
you're looking to save cost and compute
 

1481
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:40,970
you're looking to save cost and compute
and things like this ultimate

1482
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:40,980
and things like this ultimate
 

1483
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,070
and things like this ultimate
performance translates to you know fewer

1484
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,080
performance translates to you know fewer
 

1485
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,149
performance translates to you know fewer
servers

1486
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
servers
 

1487
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,070
servers
if you care about the environment hey

1488
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
if you care about the environment hey
 

1489
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,350
if you care about the environment hey
better performance leads to more

1490
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:48,360
better performance leads to more
 

1491
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,250
better performance leads to more
efficiency

1492
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,260
efficiency
 

1493
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,529
efficiency
I mean you could joke and say like you

1494
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:51,539
I mean you could joke and say like you
 

1495
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,289
I mean you could joke and say like you
know Python's bad for the environment

1496
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:53,299
know Python's bad for the environment
 

1497
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:55,669
know Python's bad for the environment
right and so if you move to Mojo it's

1498
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
right and so if you move to Mojo it's
 

1499
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,169
right and so if you move to Mojo it's
like at least 10x better or just out of

1500
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:57,179
like at least 10x better or just out of
 

1501
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:59,390
like at least 10x better or just out of
the box and then keep going right

1502
00:25:59,390 --> 00:25:59,400
the box and then keep going right
 

1503
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,789
the box and then keep going right
um uh but but performance is also

1504
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:01,799
um uh but but performance is also
 

1505
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,870
um uh but but performance is also
interesting because it leads to better

1506
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:02,880
interesting because it leads to better
 

1507
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,330
interesting because it leads to better
products and so in the space of machine

1508
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:05,340
products and so in the space of machine
 

1509
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,890
products and so in the space of machine
learning right if you reduce the latency

1510
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:06,900
learning right if you reduce the latency
 

1511
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,510
learning right if you reduce the latency
of a model

1512
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:08,520
of a model
 

1513
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,549
of a model
so that it runs faster so every time you

1514
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
so that it runs faster so every time you
 

1515
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,049
so that it runs faster so every time you
query the server running the model it

1516
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:12,059
query the server running the model it
 

1517
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,430
query the server running the model it
takes less time well then the product

1518
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,440
takes less time well then the product
 

1519
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,409
takes less time well then the product
team can go and make the model bigger

1520
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:15,419
team can go and make the model bigger
 

1521
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,450
team can go and make the model bigger
well that's actually makes it so you

1522
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:17,460
well that's actually makes it so you
 

1523
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,549
well that's actually makes it so you
have a better experience as a customer

1524
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:19,559
have a better experience as a customer
 

1525
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,350
have a better experience as a customer
and so a lot of people care about that

1526
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,360
and so a lot of people care about that
 

1527
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,690
and so a lot of people care about that
so for auto-tune for like towel size you

1528
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:23,700
so for auto-tune for like towel size you
 

1529
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,029
so for auto-tune for like towel size you
mentioned 128 for tpus you would specify

1530
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:26,039
mentioned 128 for tpus you would specify
 

1531
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:28,490
mentioned 128 for tpus you would specify
like a bunch of options to try yeah just

1532
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:28,500
like a bunch of options to try yeah just
 

1533
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,310
like a bunch of options to try yeah just
in the code it's a simple statement and

1534
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,320
in the code it's a simple statement and
 

1535
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,169
in the code it's a simple statement and
then you can just set and forget and

1536
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:33,179
then you can just set and forget and
 

1537
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:35,390
then you can just set and forget and
know depending wherever it compiles

1538
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:35,400
know depending wherever it compiles
 

1539
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,789
know depending wherever it compiles
it'll actually be the fastest and yeah

1540
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:37,799
it'll actually be the fastest and yeah
 

1541
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,230
it'll actually be the fastest and yeah
exactly the beauty of this is that it

1542
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,240
exactly the beauty of this is that it
 

1543
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,190
exactly the beauty of this is that it
helps you in a whole bunch of different

1544
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,200
helps you in a whole bunch of different
 

1545
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,289
helps you in a whole bunch of different
ways right so if you're building so

1546
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:42,299
ways right so if you're building so
 

1547
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:44,090
ways right so if you're building so
often what will happen is that you know

1548
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:44,100
often what will happen is that you know
 

1549
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,049
often what will happen is that you know
you've written a bunch of software

1550
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:45,059
you've written a bunch of software
 

1551
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,269
you've written a bunch of software
yourself right you you wake up one day

1552
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:47,279
yourself right you you wake up one day
 

1553
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,409
yourself right you you wake up one day
you say I have an idea I'm going to go

1554
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:48,419
you say I have an idea I'm going to go
 

1555
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,750
you say I have an idea I'm going to go
put up some code I get to work

1556
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:50,760
put up some code I get to work
 

1557
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,610
put up some code I get to work
I forget about it

1558
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:52,620
I forget about it
 

1559
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,350
I forget about it
and move on with life I come back six

1560
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:54,360
and move on with life I come back six
 

1561
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,669
and move on with life I come back six
months or a year or two years or three

1562
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:55,679
months or a year or two years or three
 

1563
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,110
months or a year or two years or three
years later you dust it off and you go

1564
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,120
years later you dust it off and you go
 

1565
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,690
years later you dust it off and you go
use it again in a new environment and

1566
00:26:59,690 --> 00:26:59,700
use it again in a new environment and
 

1567
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,490
use it again in a new environment and
maybe your GPU is different maybe you're

1568
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:01,500
maybe your GPU is different maybe you're
 

1569
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,169
maybe your GPU is different maybe you're
running on a server instead of a laptop

1570
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:03,179
running on a server instead of a laptop
 

1571
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,049
running on a server instead of a laptop
maybe whatever right and so the problem

1572
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:06,059
maybe whatever right and so the problem
 

1573
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,850
maybe whatever right and so the problem
now is you say okay well I mean again

1574
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:07,860
now is you say okay well I mean again
 

1575
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,230
now is you say okay well I mean again
not everybody cares about performance

1576
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,240
not everybody cares about performance
 

1577
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,330
not everybody cares about performance
but if you do you say okay well I want

1578
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,340
but if you do you say okay well I want
 

1579
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,409
but if you do you say okay well I want
to take advantage of all these new

1580
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:12,419
to take advantage of all these new
 

1581
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,210
to take advantage of all these new
features I don't want to break the old

1582
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,220
features I don't want to break the old
 

1583
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,230
features I don't want to break the old
thing though

1584
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,240
thing though
 

1585
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,230
thing though
right and so the typical way of handling

1586
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
right and so the typical way of handling
 

1587
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,510
right and so the typical way of handling
this kind of stuff before is you know if

1588
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:20,520
this kind of stuff before is you know if
 

1589
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,830
this kind of stuff before is you know if
you're talking about sequence templates

1590
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
you're talking about sequence templates
 

1591
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,590
you're talking about sequence templates
are you talking about C with macros you

1592
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:24,600
are you talking about C with macros you
 

1593
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,210
are you talking about C with macros you
end up with if defs you get like all

1594
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:26,220
end up with if defs you get like all
 

1595
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,010
end up with if defs you get like all
these weird things get layered in make

1596
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,020
these weird things get layered in make
 

1597
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,630
these weird things get layered in make
the code super complicated and then how

1598
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:29,640
the code super complicated and then how
 

1599
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,610
the code super complicated and then how
do you test it right it becomes this

1600
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:31,620
do you test it right it becomes this
 

1601
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,010
do you test it right it becomes this
this crazy complexity multi-dimensional

1602
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,020
this crazy complexity multi-dimensional
 

1603
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,110
this crazy complexity multi-dimensional
space that you have to worry about and

1604
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,120
space that you have to worry about and
 

1605
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,850
space that you have to worry about and
you know that just doesn't scale very

1606
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:37,860
you know that just doesn't scale very
 

1607
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,930
you know that just doesn't scale very
well

1608
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:38,940
well
 

1609
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,549
well
actually let me just jump around before

1610
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
actually let me just jump around before
 

1611
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,950
actually let me just jump around before
it goes to specific features like the

1612
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
it goes to specific features like the
 

1613
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,169
it goes to specific features like the
increase in performance here that we're

1614
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:45,179
increase in performance here that we're
 

1615
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,350
increase in performance here that we're
talking about can be just insane uh you

1616
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:48,360
talking about can be just insane uh you
 

1617
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:52,330
talking about can be just insane uh you
write that Mojo can provide a 35

1618
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:52,340
write that Mojo can provide a 35
 

1619
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,330
write that Mojo can provide a 35
thousand X speed up over python uh how

1620
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:56,340
thousand X speed up over python uh how
 

1621
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,850
thousand X speed up over python uh how
does it do that yeah so it can even do

1622
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:58,860
does it do that yeah so it can even do
 

1623
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,990
does it do that yeah so it can even do
more but uh we'll get to that so uh so

1624
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,000
more but uh we'll get to that so uh so
 

1625
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,730
more but uh we'll get to that so uh so
first of all when we say that we're

1626
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:04,740
first of all when we say that we're
 

1627
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,010
first of all when we say that we're
talking about what's called C python

1628
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,020
talking about what's called C python
 

1629
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,570
talking about what's called C python
it's the default python that everybody

1630
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:08,580
it's the default python that everybody
 

1631
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,549
it's the default python that everybody
uses when you type python3 that's like

1632
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:10,559
uses when you type python3 that's like
 

1633
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,830
uses when you type python3 that's like
typically the one you use right see

1634
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:12,840
typically the one you use right see
 

1635
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,570
typically the one you use right see
python is an interpreter

1636
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:14,580
python is an interpreter
 

1637
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,430
python is an interpreter
and so interpreters they have an extra

1638
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:16,440
and so interpreters they have an extra
 

1639
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,250
and so interpreters they have an extra
layer of like byte codes and things like

1640
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:19,260
layer of like byte codes and things like
 

1641
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,870
layer of like byte codes and things like
this that they have to go read parse

1642
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
this that they have to go read parse
 

1643
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,250
this that they have to go read parse
interpret and it makes them kind of slow

1644
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,260
interpret and it makes them kind of slow
 

1645
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,470
interpret and it makes them kind of slow
from that perspective and so one of the

1646
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
from that perspective and so one of the
 

1647
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,149
from that perspective and so one of the
first things we do is we move to a

1648
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
first things we do is we move to a
 

1649
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,110
first things we do is we move to a
compiler

1650
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
compiler
 

1651
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,730
compiler
and so I'm just moving to a compiler

1652
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:28,740
and so I'm just moving to a compiler
 

1653
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,049
and so I'm just moving to a compiler
getting The Interpreter out of the loop

1654
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:30,059
getting The Interpreter out of the loop
 

1655
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,330
getting The Interpreter out of the loop
is two to five to ten X speed up

1656
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:32,340
is two to five to ten X speed up
 

1657
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,549
is two to five to ten X speed up
depending on the code so just out of the

1658
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
depending on the code so just out of the
 

1659
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,570
depending on the code so just out of the
gate

1660
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:35,580
gate
 

1661
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,870
gate
just using more modern techniques right

1662
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
just using more modern techniques right
 

1663
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,909
just using more modern techniques right
now if you do that one of the things you

1664
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:40,919
now if you do that one of the things you
 

1665
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,649
now if you do that one of the things you
can do is you can start to look at how C

1666
00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:42,659
can do is you can start to look at how C
 

1667
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,830
can do is you can start to look at how C
python started to lay out data

1668
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:45,840
python started to lay out data
 

1669
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,049
python started to lay out data
and so one of the things that that c

1670
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:48,059
and so one of the things that that c
 

1671
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,970
and so one of the things that that c
python did and this isn't part of the

1672
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:49,980
python did and this isn't part of the
 

1673
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,070
python did and this isn't part of the
Python spec necessarily but this is just

1674
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,080
Python spec necessarily but this is just
 

1675
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,710
Python spec necessarily but this is just
sets of decisions is that

1676
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
sets of decisions is that
 

1677
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,930
sets of decisions is that
if you take an integer for example it'll

1678
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:56,940
if you take an integer for example it'll
 

1679
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,330
if you take an integer for example it'll
put it in an object because in Python

1680
00:28:59,330 --> 00:28:59,340
put it in an object because in Python
 

1681
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,070
put it in an object because in Python
everything's an object and so they do

1682
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,080
everything's an object and so they do
 

1683
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,890
everything's an object and so they do
the very logical thing of keeping the

1684
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:03,900
the very logical thing of keeping the
 

1685
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,110
the very logical thing of keeping the
memory representation of all objects the

1686
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,120
memory representation of all objects the
 

1687
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,390
memory representation of all objects the
same so all objects have a header they

1688
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:08,400
same so all objects have a header they
 

1689
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,850
same so all objects have a header they
have like payload data they and what

1690
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:10,860
have like payload data they and what
 

1691
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,110
have like payload data they and what
this means is every time you pass around

1692
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,120
this means is every time you pass around
 

1693
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,370
this means is every time you pass around
an object you're passing around a

1694
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:13,380
an object you're passing around a
 

1695
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,350
an object you're passing around a
pointer to the data

1696
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
pointer to the data
 

1697
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,630
pointer to the data
well this has overhead it turns out that

1698
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:17,640
well this has overhead it turns out that
 

1699
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,669
well this has overhead it turns out that
modern computers don't like chasing

1700
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
modern computers don't like chasing
 

1701
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,990
modern computers don't like chasing
pointers very much and things like this

1702
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,000
pointers very much and things like this
 

1703
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,610
pointers very much and things like this
it means that you have to allocate the

1704
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:22,620
it means that you have to allocate the
 

1705
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,649
it means that you have to allocate the
data means you have to reference count

1706
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:24,659
data means you have to reference count
 

1707
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,389
data means you have to reference count
it which is another way of that python

1708
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
it which is another way of that python
 

1709
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,490
it which is another way of that python
uses to keep track of memory and so this

1710
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:28,500
uses to keep track of memory and so this
 

1711
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,350
uses to keep track of memory and so this
has a lot of overhead and so if you say

1712
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,360
has a lot of overhead and so if you say
 

1713
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,430
has a lot of overhead and so if you say
okay

1714
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
okay
 

1715
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,769
okay
let's try to get that out of

1716
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:33,779
let's try to get that out of
 

1717
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,409
let's try to get that out of
the Heap out of a box out of an

1718
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:36,419
the Heap out of a box out of an
 

1719
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:40,190
the Heap out of a box out of an
interaction and into the registers

1720
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,200
interaction and into the registers
 

1721
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,250
interaction and into the registers
that's that's another 10x so it adds up

1722
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:43,260
that's that's another 10x so it adds up
 

1723
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,690
that's that's another 10x so it adds up
if you if you're reference counting

1724
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:44,700
if you if you're reference counting
 

1725
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,549
if you if you're reference counting
every single every every single thing

1726
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:46,559
every single every every single thing
 

1727
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,769
every single every every single thing
you create that adds up yeah and if you

1728
00:29:48,769 --> 00:29:48,779
you create that adds up yeah and if you
 

1729
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:50,029
you create that adds up yeah and if you
look at you know people complain about

1730
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:50,039
look at you know people complain about
 

1731
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,710
look at you know people complain about
the python Gill this is one of the

1732
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:51,720
the python Gill this is one of the
 

1733
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,049
the python Gill this is one of the
things that hurts parallelism

1734
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:54,059
things that hurts parallelism
 

1735
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,010
things that hurts parallelism
um that's because of the reference

1736
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,020
um that's because of the reference
 

1737
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,029
um that's because of the reference
Counting

1738
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:56,039
Counting
 

1739
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,649
Counting
right and so the Gill and reference

1740
00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:57,659
right and so the Gill and reference
 

1741
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,090
right and so the Gill and reference
counting are very tightly intertwined in

1742
00:29:59,090 --> 00:29:59,100
counting are very tightly intertwined in
 

1743
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,649
counting are very tightly intertwined in
Python it's not the only thing but it's

1744
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:00,659
Python it's not the only thing but it's
 

1745
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,570
Python it's not the only thing but it's
very tightly intertwined and so then you

1746
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:02,580
very tightly intertwined and so then you
 

1747
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,769
very tightly intertwined and so then you
lean into this and you say okay cool

1748
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:03,779
lean into this and you say okay cool
 

1749
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:06,169
lean into this and you say okay cool
well modern computers they can do more

1750
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:06,179
well modern computers they can do more
 

1751
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,389
well modern computers they can do more
than one operation at a time and so they

1752
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
than one operation at a time and so they
 

1753
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,769
than one operation at a time and so they
have vectors what is a vector well a

1754
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:09,779
have vectors what is a vector well a
 

1755
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,630
have vectors what is a vector well a
vector allows you to take one instead of

1756
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:11,640
vector allows you to take one instead of
 

1757
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,190
vector allows you to take one instead of
taking one piece of data doing an ad or

1758
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,200
taking one piece of data doing an ad or
 

1759
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,169
taking one piece of data doing an ad or
multiply and then picking up the next

1760
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:15,179
multiply and then picking up the next
 

1761
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,690
multiply and then picking up the next
one you can now do a 4 or 8 or 16 or 32

1762
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:17,700
one you can now do a 4 or 8 or 16 or 32
 

1763
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,610
one you can now do a 4 or 8 or 16 or 32
at a time right well python doesn't

1764
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:19,620
at a time right well python doesn't
 

1765
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,889
at a time right well python doesn't
expose that because of reasons and so

1766
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:21,899
expose that because of reasons and so
 

1767
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,210
expose that because of reasons and so
now you can say okay well you can adopt

1768
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:23,220
now you can say okay well you can adopt
 

1769
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:23,870
now you can say okay well you can adopt
that

1770
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:23,880
that
 

1771
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,789
that
now you have threads now you have like

1772
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:25,799
now you have threads now you have like
 

1773
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,110
now you have threads now you have like
additional things like you control

1774
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,120
additional things like you control
 

1775
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,909
additional things like you control
memory hierarchy and so what Mojo allows

1776
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:28,919
memory hierarchy and so what Mojo allows
 

1777
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,169
memory hierarchy and so what Mojo allows
you to do is it allows you to start

1778
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:30,179
you to do is it allows you to start
 

1779
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:32,090
you to do is it allows you to start
taking advantage of all these powerful

1780
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,100
taking advantage of all these powerful
 

1781
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,230
taking advantage of all these powerful
things that have been built into the

1782
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:33,240
things that have been built into the
 

1783
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,810
things that have been built into the
hardware over time and it gives the

1784
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:35,820
hardware over time and it gives the
 

1785
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,810
hardware over time and it gives the
library gives um very nice features so

1786
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:38,820
library gives um very nice features so
 

1787
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,789
library gives um very nice features so
you can say just parallelize this do

1788
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:40,799
you can say just parallelize this do
 

1789
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,909
you can say just parallelize this do
this in parallel right so it's very very

1790
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:43,919
this in parallel right so it's very very
 

1791
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,850
this in parallel right so it's very very
powerful weapons against slowness which

1792
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:46,860
powerful weapons against slowness which
 

1793
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,649
powerful weapons against slowness which
is why people have been I think having

1794
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:48,659
is why people have been I think having
 

1795
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:50,330
is why people have been I think having
fun like just taking code and making go

1796
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:50,340
fun like just taking code and making go
 

1797
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,950
fun like just taking code and making go
fast because it's just kind of an

1798
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:51,960
fast because it's just kind of an
 

1799
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,510
fast because it's just kind of an
adrenaline rush to see like how fast you

1800
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520
adrenaline rush to see like how fast you
 

1801
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,669
adrenaline rush to see like how fast you
can get things before I talk about some

1802
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:55,679
can get things before I talk about some
 

1803
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,510
can get things before I talk about some
of the interesting stuff with

1804
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:56,520
of the interesting stuff with
 

1805
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,250
of the interesting stuff with
parallelization all that let's let's

1806
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:58,260
parallelization all that let's let's
 

1807
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,350
parallelization all that let's let's
first talk about like the basics we

1808
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,360
first talk about like the basics we
 

1809
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,909
first talk about like the basics we
talked to indentation right so this

1810
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:01,919
talked to indentation right so this
 

1811
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,250
talked to indentation right so this
thing looks like python

1812
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:04,260
thing looks like python
 

1813
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,590
thing looks like python
it's sexy and beautiful like python as I

1814
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:06,600
it's sexy and beautiful like python as I
 

1815
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,529
it's sexy and beautiful like python as I
mentioned uh is it a typed language so

1816
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:09,539
mentioned uh is it a typed language so
 

1817
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,450
mentioned uh is it a typed language so
what's the role of types yeah good

1818
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:11,460
what's the role of types yeah good
 

1819
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,450
what's the role of types yeah good
question so python has types it has

1820
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:14,460
question so python has types it has
 

1821
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,210
question so python has types it has
strings as integers it has dictionaries

1822
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:17,220
strings as integers it has dictionaries
 

1823
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,830
strings as integers it has dictionaries
and like all that stuff but they all

1824
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:18,840
and like all that stuff but they all
 

1825
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,090
and like all that stuff but they all
live at runtime

1826
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:20,100
live at runtime
 

1827
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,470
live at runtime
right and so

1828
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:21,480
right and so
 

1829
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,210
right and so
because all those types of runtime in

1830
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:23,220
because all those types of runtime in
 

1831
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,190
because all those types of runtime in
Python you never or you don't have to

1832
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,200
Python you never or you don't have to
 

1833
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,070
Python you never or you don't have to
spell them python also has like this

1834
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
spell them python also has like this
 

1835
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,450
spell them python also has like this
whole typing thing going on now and a

1836
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:29,460
whole typing thing going on now and a
 

1837
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,010
whole typing thing going on now and a
lot of people use it yeah I'm not

1838
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,020
lot of people use it yeah I'm not
 

1839
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,149
lot of people use it yeah I'm not
talking about that that's that's kind of

1840
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:32,159
talking about that that's that's kind of
 

1841
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,230
talking about that that's that's kind of
a different thing we can go back to that

1842
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,240
a different thing we can go back to that
 

1843
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,950
a different thing we can go back to that
if you want but but typically the um

1844
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
if you want but but typically the um
 

1845
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,750
if you want but but typically the um
you know you just say I take I have a

1846
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:38,760
you know you just say I take I have a
 

1847
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,370
you know you just say I take I have a
death and my def takes two parameters

1848
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:40,380
death and my def takes two parameters
 

1849
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,810
death and my def takes two parameters
I'm going to call them A and B and I

1850
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:41,820
I'm going to call them A and B and I
 

1851
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,350
I'm going to call them A and B and I
don't have to write a type okay so that

1852
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,360
don't have to write a type okay so that
 

1853
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,909
don't have to write a type okay so that
is great but what that does is that

1854
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:46,919
is great but what that does is that
 

1855
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,350
is great but what that does is that
forces what's called a consistent

1856
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,360
forces what's called a consistent
 

1857
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,149
forces what's called a consistent
representation so these things have to

1858
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:50,159
representation so these things have to
 

1859
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,130
representation so these things have to
be a pointer to an object with the

1860
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:52,140
be a pointer to an object with the
 

1861
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,510
be a pointer to an object with the
object header and they all have to look

1862
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:53,520
object header and they all have to look
 

1863
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,669
object header and they all have to look
the same and then when you dispatch a

1864
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:55,679
the same and then when you dispatch a
 

1865
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,470
the same and then when you dispatch a
method you go through all the same

1866
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:57,480
method you go through all the same
 

1867
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,090
method you go through all the same
different paths no matter what the the

1868
00:31:59,090 --> 00:31:59,100
different paths no matter what the the
 

1869
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,490
different paths no matter what the the
receiver whatever that type is so what

1870
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:01,500
receiver whatever that type is so what
 

1871
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,649
receiver whatever that type is so what
Mojo does is it allows you to have more

1872
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:03,659
Mojo does is it allows you to have more
 

1873
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,750
Mojo does is it allows you to have more
than one kind of type and so what it

1874
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:05,760
than one kind of type and so what it
 

1875
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,130
than one kind of type and so what it
does is allows you to say okay cool I

1876
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:07,140
does is allows you to say okay cool I
 

1877
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,289
does is allows you to say okay cool I
have I have an object an object's behave

1878
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:09,299
have I have an object an object's behave
 

1879
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:10,970
have I have an object an object's behave
like python does and so it's fully

1880
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:10,980
like python does and so it's fully
 

1881
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,649
like python does and so it's fully
Dynamic and that's all great and for

1882
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:12,659
Dynamic and that's all great and for
 

1883
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,690
Dynamic and that's all great and for
many things classes like that's all very

1884
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:14,700
many things classes like that's all very
 

1885
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,310
many things classes like that's all very
powerful and very important

1886
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,320
powerful and very important
 

1887
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,230
powerful and very important
but if you want to say hey it's an

1888
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,240
but if you want to say hey it's an
 

1889
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,450
but if you want to say hey it's an
integer and it's 32 bits or 64 bits or

1890
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:20,460
integer and it's 32 bits or 64 bits or
 

1891
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,710
integer and it's 32 bits or 64 bits or
whatever it is or it's a floating point

1892
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:21,720
whatever it is or it's a floating point
 

1893
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,789
whatever it is or it's a floating point
value

1894
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799
value
 

1895
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,310
value
at six four bits well then the compiler

1896
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,320
at six four bits well then the compiler
 

1897
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,350
at six four bits well then the compiler
can take that and it can use that to do

1898
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
can take that and it can use that to do
 

1899
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,389
can take that and it can use that to do
way better optimization and turns out

1900
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:29,399
way better optimization and turns out
 

1901
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,710
way better optimization and turns out
again getting rid of the interactions

1902
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
again getting rid of the interactions
 

1903
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,110
again getting rid of the interactions
it's huge means you can get better code

1904
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,120
it's huge means you can get better code
 

1905
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,970
it's huge means you can get better code
completion because you have

1906
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:34,980
completion because you have
 

1907
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,590
completion because you have
um because compiler knows what the type

1908
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:36,600
um because compiler knows what the type
 

1909
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,750
um because compiler knows what the type
is and so knows what operations work on

1910
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:38,760
is and so knows what operations work on
 

1911
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,430
is and so knows what operations work on
it and so that's actually pretty huge

1912
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:40,440
it and so that's actually pretty huge
 

1913
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,970
it and so that's actually pretty huge
and so what Mojo does allows you to

1914
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:43,980
and so what Mojo does allows you to
 

1915
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,649
and so what Mojo does allows you to
progressively adopt types into your

1916
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:45,659
progressively adopt types into your
 

1917
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,930
progressively adopt types into your
program so you can start again it's

1918
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:47,940
program so you can start again it's
 

1919
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,909
program so you can start again it's
compatible with python and so then you

1920
00:32:49,909 --> 00:32:49,919
compatible with python and so then you
 

1921
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,230
compatible with python and so then you
can add however many types you want

1922
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,240
can add however many types you want
 

1923
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,029
can add however many types you want
wherever you want them and if you don't

1924
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:53,039
wherever you want them and if you don't
 

1925
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:53,930
wherever you want them and if you don't
want to deal with it you don't have to

1926
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:53,940
want to deal with it you don't have to
 

1927
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,389
want to deal with it you don't have to
deal with it right and so one of one of

1928
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:56,399
deal with it right and so one of one of
 

1929
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,750
deal with it right and so one of one of
you know our opinions on this is It's

1930
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
you know our opinions on this is It's
 

1931
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,909
you know our opinions on this is It's
not that types are the right thing or

1932
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
not that types are the right thing or
 

1933
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,110
not that types are the right thing or
the wrong thing

1934
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,120
the wrong thing
 

1935
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,269
the wrong thing
it's a very useful thing

1936
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
it's a very useful thing
 

1937
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,070
it's a very useful thing
which was kind of optional it's not

1938
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,080
which was kind of optional it's not
 

1939
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,049
which was kind of optional it's not
strict typing you don't have to specify

1940
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:09,059
strict typing you don't have to specify
 

1941
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,430
strict typing you don't have to specify
a type exactly

1942
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:10,440
a type exactly
 

1943
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,409
a type exactly
okay so starting from the thing that

1944
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:12,419
okay so starting from the thing that
 

1945
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,149
okay so starting from the thing that
Python's kind of reaching towards right

1946
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:14,159
Python's kind of reaching towards right
 

1947
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,149
Python's kind of reaching towards right
now with trying to inject types into it

1948
00:33:17,149 --> 00:33:17,159
now with trying to inject types into it
 

1949
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,070
now with trying to inject types into it
yeah with a very different approach but

1950
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,080
yeah with a very different approach but
 

1951
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,110
yeah with a very different approach but
yes yes what's the different approach

1952
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,120
yes yes what's the different approach
 

1953
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,289
yes yes what's the different approach
I'm actually one of the people

1954
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:24,299
I'm actually one of the people
 

1955
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,210
I'm actually one of the people
that have not been using types very much

1956
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:26,220
that have not been using types very much
 

1957
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,450
that have not been using types very much
in Python okay why did you say

1958
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:29,460
in Python okay why did you say
 

1959
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,549
in Python okay why did you say
it's just well because I I know the

1960
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:31,559
it's just well because I I know the
 

1961
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,490
it's just well because I I know the
importance it's like adults use strict

1962
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:34,500
importance it's like adults use strict
 

1963
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,730
importance it's like adults use strict
typing and so I I refuse to grow up in

1964
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:37,740
typing and so I I refuse to grow up in
 

1965
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,990
typing and so I I refuse to grow up in
that sense it's a it's a kind of

1966
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,000
that sense it's a it's a kind of
 

1967
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,950
that sense it's a it's a kind of
rebellion but I I just know that um

1968
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:41,960
rebellion but I I just know that um
 

1969
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,269
rebellion but I I just know that um
it probably reduces the amount of Errors

1970
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:44,279
it probably reduces the amount of Errors
 

1971
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,250
it probably reduces the amount of Errors
even just for forget about performance

1972
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:46,260
even just for forget about performance
 

1973
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,110
even just for forget about performance
improvements it probably reduces errors

1974
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,120
improvements it probably reduces errors
 

1975
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,669
improvements it probably reduces errors
of when you do strict typing yeah so I

1976
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:49,679
of when you do strict typing yeah so I
 

1977
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,870
of when you do strict typing yeah so I
mean I think it's interesting if you

1978
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
mean I think it's interesting if you
 

1979
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,370
mean I think it's interesting if you
look at that right and the reason is I'm

1980
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:52,380
look at that right and the reason is I'm
 

1981
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,769
look at that right and the reason is I'm
giving a hard time yeah is that that

1982
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:54,779
giving a hard time yeah is that that
 

1983
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:57,289
giving a hard time yeah is that that
there's this this cultural norm this

1984
00:33:57,289 --> 00:33:57,299
there's this this cultural norm this
 

1985
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,029
there's this this cultural norm this
pressure this like there has to be a

1986
00:33:59,029 --> 00:33:59,039
pressure this like there has to be a
 

1987
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,649
pressure this like there has to be a
right way to do things like you know

1988
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:00,659
right way to do things like you know
 

1989
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,149
right way to do things like you know
only grown-ups only do it one way and if

1990
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:02,159
only grown-ups only do it one way and if
 

1991
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,230
only grown-ups only do it one way and if
you want to do that you should feel bad

1992
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,240
you want to do that you should feel bad
 

1993
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,970
you want to do that you should feel bad
yes right like some people feel like

1994
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:04,980
yes right like some people feel like
 

1995
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,710
yes right like some people feel like
Python's a guilty pleasure or something

1996
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
Python's a guilty pleasure or something
 

1997
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,570
Python's a guilty pleasure or something
and that's like when I get serious I

1998
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:08,580
and that's like when I get serious I
 

1999
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,510
and that's like when I get serious I
need to go rewrite it right yeah exactly

2000
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:10,520
need to go rewrite it right yeah exactly
 

2001
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,070
need to go rewrite it right yeah exactly
I mean cool I understand history and I

2002
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,080
I mean cool I understand history and I
 

2003
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,270
I mean cool I understand history and I
understand kind of where this comes from

2004
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:14,280
understand kind of where this comes from
 

2005
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,369
understand kind of where this comes from
but I don't think it has to be a guilty

2006
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:16,379
but I don't think it has to be a guilty
 

2007
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,349
but I don't think it has to be a guilty
pleasure yeah right and so if you look

2008
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:18,359
pleasure yeah right and so if you look
 

2009
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,849
pleasure yeah right and so if you look
at that you say why do you have to

2010
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:19,859
at that you say why do you have to
 

2011
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:20,930
at that you say why do you have to
rewrite it well you have to rewrite it

2012
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:20,940
rewrite it well you have to rewrite it
 

2013
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,389
rewrite it well you have to rewrite it
to deploy well why do you want to deploy

2014
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:23,399
to deploy well why do you want to deploy
 

2015
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,190
to deploy well why do you want to deploy
well you care about performance you care

2016
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,200
well you care about performance you care
 

2017
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,470
well you care about performance you care
about predictability or you want you

2018
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:27,480
about predictability or you want you
 

2019
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,510
about predictability or you want you
know a tiny thing on the server that has

2020
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,520
know a tiny thing on the server that has
 

2021
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,950
know a tiny thing on the server that has
no dependencies or you know you have

2022
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:30,960
no dependencies or you know you have
 

2023
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,129
no dependencies or you know you have
objectives you're trying to attain

2024
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:34,139
objectives you're trying to attain
 

2025
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,349
objectives you're trying to attain
so what if python can achieve those

2026
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:36,359
so what if python can achieve those
 

2027
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:37,550
so what if python can achieve those
objectives

2028
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:37,560
objectives
 

2029
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,230
objectives
so if you want types well maybe you want

2030
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,240
so if you want types well maybe you want
 

2031
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,310
so if you want types well maybe you want
types because you want to make sure

2032
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
types because you want to make sure
 

2033
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,349
types because you want to make sure
you're passing the right thing sure you

2034
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:42,359
you're passing the right thing sure you
 

2035
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,930
you're passing the right thing sure you
can add a type if you don't care you're

2036
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:44,940
can add a type if you don't care you're
 

2037
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,490
can add a type if you don't care you're
protyping some stuff you're hacking some

2038
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:46,500
protyping some stuff you're hacking some
 

2039
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,050
protyping some stuff you're hacking some
things out you're like pulling some Ram

2040
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,060
things out you're like pulling some Ram
 

2041
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,550
things out you're like pulling some Ram
good off the internet it should just

2042
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:49,560
good off the internet it should just
 

2043
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,550
good off the internet it should just
work right and you shouldn't be like

2044
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:52,560
work right and you shouldn't be like
 

2045
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,649
work right and you shouldn't be like
pressured he shouldn't feel bad about

2046
00:34:54,649 --> 00:34:54,659
pressured he shouldn't feel bad about
 

2047
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,149
pressured he shouldn't feel bad about
doing the right thing or the thing that

2048
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
doing the right thing or the thing that
 

2049
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,790
doing the right thing or the thing that
feels good now if you're in a team right

2050
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
feels good now if you're in a team right
 

2051
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,530
feels good now if you're in a team right
you're working at some massive internet

2052
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:00,540
you're working at some massive internet
 

2053
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,510
you're working at some massive internet
company and you have 400 million lines

2054
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:02,520
company and you have 400 million lines
 

2055
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,910
company and you have 400 million lines
of python code well they they may have a

2056
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:04,920
of python code well they they may have a
 

2057
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,130
of python code well they they may have a
house rule that you use types yeah right

2058
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,140
house rule that you use types yeah right
 

2059
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,270
house rule that you use types yeah right
because it makes it easier for different

2060
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,280
because it makes it easier for different
 

2061
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,530
because it makes it easier for different
humans to talk to each other and

2062
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:09,540
humans to talk to each other and
 

2063
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,750
humans to talk to each other and
understand what's going on and bugs at

2064
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:11,760
understand what's going on and bugs at
 

2065
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,730
understand what's going on and bugs at
scale right and so there are lots of

2066
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:13,740
scale right and so there are lots of
 

2067
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,050
scale right and so there are lots of
good reasons why you might want to use

2068
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,060
good reasons why you might want to use
 

2069
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,390
good reasons why you might want to use
types but that doesn't mean that

2070
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:17,400
types but that doesn't mean that
 

2071
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,589
types but that doesn't mean that
everybody should use them all the time

2072
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:18,599
everybody should use them all the time
 

2073
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,329
everybody should use them all the time
right so what Mojo does is it says cool

2074
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:20,339
right so what Mojo does is it says cool
 

2075
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:23,030
right so what Mojo does is it says cool
well allow people to use types and if

2076
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
well allow people to use types and if
 

2077
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,250
well allow people to use types and if
you use types you get nice things out of

2078
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:25,260
you use types you get nice things out of
 

2079
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,569
you use types you get nice things out of
it right you get better performance and

2080
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:26,579
it right you get better performance and
 

2081
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:29,569
it right you get better performance and
things like this right but Mojo is a

2082
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:29,579
things like this right but Mojo is a
 

2083
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:33,170
things like this right but Mojo is a
full compatible superset of python

2084
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:33,180
full compatible superset of python
 

2085
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,569
full compatible superset of python
and so that means it has to work without

2086
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:35,579
and so that means it has to work without
 

2087
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:36,890
and so that means it has to work without
types

2088
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:36,900
types
 

2089
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,510
types
it has to support all the dynamic things

2090
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:38,520
it has to support all the dynamic things
 

2091
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,950
it has to support all the dynamic things
I support all the packages that support

2092
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:39,960
I support all the packages that support
 

2093
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,010
I support all the packages that support
uh for comprehension list comprehensions

2094
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,020
uh for comprehension list comprehensions
 

2095
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,990
uh for comprehension list comprehensions
and things like this right and so that

2096
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,000
and things like this right and so that
 

2097
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,670
and things like this right and so that
that starting point I think is really

2098
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:46,680
that starting point I think is really
 

2099
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,710
that starting point I think is really
important and I think that

2100
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
important and I think that
 

2101
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,630
important and I think that
again you can look at why I care so much

2102
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:50,640
again you can look at why I care so much
 

2103
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,130
again you can look at why I care so much
about this and there's many different

2104
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:52,140
about this and there's many different
 

2105
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,050
about this and there's many different
aspects of that one of which is the

2106
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:54,060
aspects of that one of which is the
 

2107
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,609
aspects of that one of which is the
world went through a very challenging

2108
00:35:55,609 --> 00:35:55,619
world went through a very challenging
 

2109
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,550
world went through a very challenging
migration from python 2 to python 3.

2110
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
migration from python 2 to python 3.
 

2111
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,849
migration from python 2 to python 3.
right yes this migration took many years

2112
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:01,859
right yes this migration took many years
 

2113
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,770
right yes this migration took many years
and it was very painful for many teams

2114
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:03,780
and it was very painful for many teams
 

2115
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,450
and it was very painful for many teams
right and there's a lot of a lot of

2116
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:05,460
right and there's a lot of a lot of
 

2117
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,370
right and there's a lot of a lot of
things that went on in that

2118
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:07,380
things that went on in that
 

2119
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,230
things that went on in that
um I'm not an expert in all the details

2120
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,240
um I'm not an expert in all the details
 

2121
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,329
um I'm not an expert in all the details
I honestly don't want to be I don't want

2122
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:11,339
I honestly don't want to be I don't want
 

2123
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:12,290
I honestly don't want to be I don't want
the world to have to go through that

2124
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:12,300
the world to have to go through that
 

2125
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,390
the world to have to go through that
yeah right and you know people can

2126
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,400
yeah right and you know people can
 

2127
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,250
yeah right and you know people can
ignore Mojo and if it's not their thing

2128
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:16,260
ignore Mojo and if it's not their thing
 

2129
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,750
ignore Mojo and if it's not their thing
that's that's cool but if they want to

2130
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
that's that's cool but if they want to
 

2131
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,890
that's that's cool but if they want to
use Mojo I don't want them to have to

2132
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:18,900
use Mojo I don't want them to have to
 

2133
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,569
use Mojo I don't want them to have to
rewrite all their code yeah I mean just

2134
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:20,579
rewrite all their code yeah I mean just
 

2135
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,450
rewrite all their code yeah I mean just
look at the superset part is

2136
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:23,460
look at the superset part is
 

2137
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,890
look at the superset part is
there's just I mean there's so much

2138
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:24,900
there's just I mean there's so much
 

2139
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,450
there's just I mean there's so much
brilliant stuff here that definitely is

2140
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:26,460
brilliant stuff here that definitely is
 

2141
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,670
brilliant stuff here that definitely is
is incredible

2142
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:28,680
is incredible
 

2143
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,470
is incredible
um we'll talk about that yeah first of

2144
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,480
um we'll talk about that yeah first of
 

2145
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,970
um we'll talk about that yeah first of
all how's the typing implemented

2146
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:31,980
all how's the typing implemented
 

2147
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,050
all how's the typing implemented
differently in uh in python versus uh

2148
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:36,060
differently in uh in python versus uh
 

2149
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,290
differently in uh in python versus uh
Mojo So this heterogeneous flexibility

2150
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:39,300
Mojo So this heterogeneous flexibility
 

2151
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,970
Mojo So this heterogeneous flexibility
you said it's definitely implemented

2152
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:40,980
you said it's definitely implemented
 

2153
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,430
you said it's definitely implemented
yeah so I'm not a full expert in the

2154
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
yeah so I'm not a full expert in the
 

2155
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,290
yeah so I'm not a full expert in the
whole backstory and types in Python so

2156
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:45,300
whole backstory and types in Python so
 

2157
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,910
whole backstory and types in Python so
I'll give you I'll give you that I can

2158
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:46,920
I'll give you I'll give you that I can
 

2159
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,589
I'll give you I'll give you that I can
give you my understanding

2160
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:48,599
give you my understanding
 

2161
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,690
give you my understanding
um my understanding is basically like

2162
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:50,700
um my understanding is basically like
 

2163
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,390
um my understanding is basically like
many Dynamic languages the ecosystem

2164
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:53,400
many Dynamic languages the ecosystem
 

2165
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,790
many Dynamic languages the ecosystem
went through a phase where people went

2166
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:55,800
went through a phase where people went
 

2167
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,530
went through a phase where people went
from writing scripts during a large

2168
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:57,540
from writing scripts during a large
 

2169
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,490
from writing scripts during a large
scale huge code bases in Python and at

2170
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:01,500
scale huge code bases in Python and at
 

2171
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,950
scale huge code bases in Python and at
scale kind of helps have types yeah

2172
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:03,960
scale kind of helps have types yeah
 

2173
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,030
scale kind of helps have types yeah
people want to be able to reason about

2174
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,040
people want to be able to reason about
 

2175
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,829
people want to be able to reason about
interfaces what what do you expect

2176
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:06,839
interfaces what what do you expect
 

2177
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,050
interfaces what what do you expect
string or an inch or like what these

2178
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,060
string or an inch or like what these
 

2179
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,849
string or an inch or like what these
basic things right and so what the

2180
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:10,859
basic things right and so what the
 

2181
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:12,829
basic things right and so what the
python Community started doing is it

2182
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:12,839
python Community started doing is it
 

2183
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,870
python Community started doing is it
started saying okay let's have tools on

2184
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880
started saying okay let's have tools on
 

2185
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,130
started saying okay let's have tools on
the side

2186
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:16,140
the side
 

2187
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,410
the side
Checker tools right the go and like

2188
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:18,420
Checker tools right the go and like
 

2189
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,410
Checker tools right the go and like
enforce some variants check for bugs try

2190
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:21,420
enforce some variants check for bugs try
 

2191
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,150
enforce some variants check for bugs try
to identify things these are called

2192
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,160
to identify things these are called
 

2193
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,250
to identify things these are called
Static analysis tools generally and so

2194
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:25,260
Static analysis tools generally and so
 

2195
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,630
Static analysis tools generally and so
these tools run over your code and try

2196
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:26,640
these tools run over your code and try
 

2197
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,829
these tools run over your code and try
to look for bugs

2198
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:27,839
to look for bugs
 

2199
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,270
to look for bugs
what ended up happening is there's so

2200
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
what ended up happening is there's so
 

2201
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,410
what ended up happening is there's so
many of these things so many different

2202
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:30,420
many of these things so many different
 

2203
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,910
many of these things so many different
weird patterns and different approaches

2204
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920
weird patterns and different approaches
 

2205
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,710
weird patterns and different approaches
on specifying the types and different

2206
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:33,720
on specifying the types and different
 

2207
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,030
on specifying the types and different
things going on that the python

2208
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,040
things going on that the python
 

2209
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,130
things going on that the python
Community realize and recognize hey hey

2210
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:37,140
Community realize and recognize hey hey
 

2211
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,530
Community realize and recognize hey hey
there's the thing here and so what they

2212
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:39,540
there's the thing here and so what they
 

2213
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,609
there's the thing here and so what they
started to do is they started to

2214
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:40,619
started to do is they started to
 

2215
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,349
started to do is they started to
standardize the Syntax for adding types

2216
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:42,359
standardize the Syntax for adding types
 

2217
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,810
standardize the Syntax for adding types
to python now one of the challenges that

2218
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:44,820
to python now one of the challenges that
 

2219
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,069
to python now one of the challenges that
they had is that they're coming from

2220
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
they had is that they're coming from
 

2221
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,630
they had is that they're coming from
kind of this fragmented world where

2222
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:47,640
kind of this fragmented world where
 

2223
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,829
kind of this fragmented world where
there's lots of different tools they

2224
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:48,839
there's lots of different tools they
 

2225
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:49,849
there's lots of different tools they
have different trade-offs and

2226
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:49,859
have different trade-offs and
 

2227
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,410
have different trade-offs and
interpretations and the types mean

2228
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:51,420
interpretations and the types mean
 

2229
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,390
interpretations and the types mean
different things and so if you look at

2230
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:53,400
different things and so if you look at
 

2231
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,490
different things and so if you look at
types in Python according to the python

2232
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:55,500
types in Python according to the python
 

2233
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,450
types in Python according to the python
spec

2234
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:56,460
spec
 

2235
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,849
spec
the types are ignored

2236
00:37:58,849 --> 00:37:58,859
the types are ignored
 

2237
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,950
the types are ignored
right so according to python spec you

2238
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
right so according to python spec you
 

2239
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,829
right so according to python spec you
can write pretty much anything in in a

2240
00:38:03,829 --> 00:38:03,839
can write pretty much anything in in a
 

2241
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,829
can write pretty much anything in in a
tight position okay and um

2242
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:06,839
tight position okay and um
 

2243
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:08,569
tight position okay and um
you can technically you can write any

2244
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:08,579
you can technically you can write any
 

2245
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,210
you can technically you can write any
expression okay now

2246
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:11,220
expression okay now
 

2247
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,730
expression okay now
that's beautiful because you can extend

2248
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:13,740
that's beautiful because you can extend
 

2249
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,050
that's beautiful because you can extend
it you can do cool things you can build

2250
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:15,060
it you can do cool things you can build
 

2251
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,490
it you can do cool things you can build
your own tools you can build your own

2252
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:16,500
your own tools you can build your own
 

2253
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,349
your own tools you can build your own
house linter or something like that

2254
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:18,359
house linter or something like that
 

2255
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:20,329
house linter or something like that
right but it's also a problem because

2256
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:20,339
right but it's also a problem because
 

2257
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,390
right but it's also a problem because
any existing Python program may be using

2258
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,400
any existing Python program may be using
 

2259
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,770
any existing Python program may be using
different tools and they have different

2260
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:24,780
different tools and they have different
 

2261
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,870
different tools and they have different
interpretations and so if you adopt

2262
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:26,880
interpretations and so if you adopt
 

2263
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,490
interpretations and so if you adopt
somebody's package into your ecosystem

2264
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:28,500
somebody's package into your ecosystem
 

2265
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,770
somebody's package into your ecosystem
try to run the tool you prefer it may

2266
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:30,780
try to run the tool you prefer it may
 

2267
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,030
try to run the tool you prefer it may
throw out tons of weird errors and

2268
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,040
throw out tons of weird errors and
 

2269
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,530
throw out tons of weird errors and
warnings and problems just because it's

2270
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:33,540
warnings and problems just because it's
 

2271
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,329
warnings and problems just because it's
incompatible with how these things work

2272
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:35,339
incompatible with how these things work
 

2273
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,790
incompatible with how these things work
also because they're added late and

2274
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:37,800
also because they're added late and
 

2275
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,170
also because they're added late and
they're not checked by the python

2276
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,180
they're not checked by the python
 

2277
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,550
they're not checked by the python
interpreter it's always kind of more of

2278
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:40,560
interpreter it's always kind of more of
 

2279
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,970
interpreter it's always kind of more of
a hint than it is a requirement also the

2280
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:43,980
a hint than it is a requirement also the
 

2281
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,589
a hint than it is a requirement also the
C python implementation can't use them

2282
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
C python implementation can't use them
 

2283
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,329
C python implementation can't use them
for performance and so it's really

2284
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:47,339
for performance and so it's really
 

2285
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:49,010
for performance and so it's really
that's a big one right so you can't

2286
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,020
that's a big one right so you can't
 

2287
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,050
that's a big one right so you can't
utilize the for the compilation for the

2288
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:51,060
utilize the for the compilation for the
 

2289
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,970
utilize the for the compilation for the
just in time compilation okay exactly

2290
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:52,980
just in time compilation okay exactly
 

2291
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,290
just in time compilation okay exactly
and this this all comes back to the

2292
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:54,300
and this this all comes back to the
 

2293
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,390
and this this all comes back to the
design principle if it's it's kind of

2294
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
design principle if it's it's kind of
 

2295
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,770
design principle if it's it's kind of
they're kind of hints they're kind of

2296
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:57,780
they're kind of hints they're kind of
 

2297
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,329
they're kind of hints they're kind of
the definition is a little bit murky

2298
00:38:59,329 --> 00:38:59,339
the definition is a little bit murky
 

2299
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,069
the definition is a little bit murky
it's unclear exactly the interpretation

2300
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:01,079
it's unclear exactly the interpretation
 

2301
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:02,990
it's unclear exactly the interpretation
in a bunch of cases and so because of

2302
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,000
in a bunch of cases and so because of
 

2303
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,450
in a bunch of cases and so because of
that you can't actually even if you want

2304
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:05,460
that you can't actually even if you want
 

2305
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,890
that you can't actually even if you want
to it's really difficult to use them to

2306
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:06,900
to it's really difficult to use them to
 

2307
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,530
to it's really difficult to use them to
say like it is going to be an INT and if

2308
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:09,540
say like it is going to be an INT and if
 

2309
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,210
say like it is going to be an INT and if
it's not it's a problem right a lot of

2310
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:11,220
it's not it's a problem right a lot of
 

2311
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,790
it's not it's a problem right a lot of
code would break if you did that so so

2312
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:13,800
code would break if you did that so so
 

2313
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,589
code would break if you did that so so
in Mojo right so you can still use those

2314
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:15,599
in Mojo right so you can still use those
 

2315
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,569
in Mojo right so you can still use those
kind of type annotations it's fine but

2316
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:17,579
kind of type annotations it's fine but
 

2317
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:19,550
kind of type annotations it's fine but
in Mojo if you declare a type and you

2318
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:19,560
in Mojo if you declare a type and you
 

2319
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,069
in Mojo if you declare a type and you
use it then it means it is going to be

2320
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:22,079
use it then it means it is going to be
 

2321
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,109
use it then it means it is going to be
that type and the compiler helps you

2322
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:24,119
that type and the compiler helps you
 

2323
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,510
that type and the compiler helps you
check that and force it and it's safe

2324
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:26,520
check that and force it and it's safe
 

2325
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,329
check that and force it and it's safe
um and it's not it's not a like best

2326
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:29,339
um and it's not it's not a like best
 

2327
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:31,550
um and it's not it's not a like best
effort kind of a thing so if you try to

2328
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:31,560
effort kind of a thing so if you try to
 

2329
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,310
effort kind of a thing so if you try to
shovel string type thing into an integer

2330
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
shovel string type thing into an integer
 

2331
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,010
shovel string type thing into an integer
you get an error from the compiler

2332
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:37,020
you get an error from the compiler
 

2333
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,810
you get an error from the compiler
compile time

2334
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:38,820
compile time
 

2335
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,510
compile time
nice okay what kind of basic types are

2336
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,520
nice okay what kind of basic types are
 

2337
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,710
nice okay what kind of basic types are
there yeah so uh Mojo is

2338
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:45,720
there yeah so uh Mojo is
 

2339
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,230
there yeah so uh Mojo is
um pretty hardcore in terms of what it

2340
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:48,240
um pretty hardcore in terms of what it
 

2341
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,349
um pretty hardcore in terms of what it
tries to do in the language which is the

2342
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
tries to do in the language which is the
 

2343
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,750
tries to do in the language which is the
philosophy there is that we

2344
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:53,760
philosophy there is that we
 

2345
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,650
philosophy there is that we
um

2346
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:54,660
um
 

2347
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,390
um
again if you if you look at python right

2348
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:56,400
again if you if you look at python right
 

2349
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,710
again if you if you look at python right
Python's a beautiful language because

2350
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:57,720
Python's a beautiful language because
 

2351
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,170
Python's a beautiful language because
it's so extensible right and so all of

2352
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:00,180
it's so extensible right and so all of
 

2353
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,210
it's so extensible right and so all of
the different things in Python like for

2354
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:02,220
the different things in Python like for
 

2355
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,310
the different things in Python like for

loops and plus and like all these things
 

2357
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,290
loops and plus and like all these things
can be accessed through these Under

Armor methods okay so you have to say

2360
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:10,020
Armor methods okay so you have to say
 

2361
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,690
Armor methods okay so you have to say
okay if I make something that is super

2362
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:11,700
okay if I make something that is super
 

2363
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,950
okay if I make something that is super
fast I can go all the way down to the

2364
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:12,960
fast I can go all the way down to the
 

2365
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,990
fast I can go all the way down to the
metal why do I need to have integers

2366
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,000
metal why do I need to have integers
 

2367
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,970
metal why do I need to have integers
built into the language

2368
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:16,980
built into the language
 

2369
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,890
built into the language
right so what Mojo does it says okay

2370
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:18,900
right so what Mojo does it says okay
 

2371
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,690
right so what Mojo does it says okay
well we can have this notion of structs

2372
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:20,700
well we can have this notion of structs
 

2373
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,849
well we can have this notion of structs
so we have classes in Python now you can

2374
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:22,859
so we have classes in Python now you can
 

2375
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:25,910
so we have classes in Python now you can
have structs classes are Dynamic structs

2376
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:25,920
have structs classes are Dynamic structs
 

2377
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,990
have structs classes are Dynamic structs
are static

2378
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,000
are static
 

2379
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,670
are static
cool we can get high performance we can

2380
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:28,680
cool we can get high performance we can
 

2381
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,349
cool we can get high performance we can
write C plus plus kind of code with

2382
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:30,359
write C plus plus kind of code with
 

2383
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,510
write C plus plus kind of code with
structs if you want these things mix and

2384
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:32,520
structs if you want these things mix and
 

2385
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,970
structs if you want these things mix and
work beautifully together but what that

2386
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:34,980
work beautifully together but what that
 

2387
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,230
work beautifully together but what that
means is that you can go and Implement

2388
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,240
means is that you can go and Implement
 

2389
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,810
means is that you can go and Implement
strings and ins and floats and arrays

2390
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:38,820
strings and ins and floats and arrays
 

2391
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,370
strings and ins and floats and arrays
and all that kind of stuff in the

2392
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:40,380
and all that kind of stuff in the
 

2393
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,390
and all that kind of stuff in the
language

2394
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:41,400
language
 

2395
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,329
language
right and so that's really cool because

2396
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:43,339
right and so that's really cool because
 

2397
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:47,930
right and so that's really cool because
you know to me as a ideal idealizing

2398
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:47,940
you know to me as a ideal idealizing
 

2399
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,910
you know to me as a ideal idealizing
compile compiler language type of person

2400
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:49,920

2401
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,589

what I want to do is I want to get magic

2402
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
what I want to do is I want to get magic
 

2403
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,690
what I want to do is I want to get magic
out of the compiler and put in the

2404
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:53,700
out of the compiler and put in the
 

2405
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,730
out of the compiler and put in the
libraries because if somebody can you

2406
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:55,740
libraries because if somebody can you
 

2407
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,470
libraries because if somebody can you
know if we can build an integer that's

2408
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:57,480
know if we can build an integer that's
 

2409
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,270
know if we can build an integer that's
beautiful and it has an amazing API it

2410
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,280
beautiful and it has an amazing API it
 

2411
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,290
beautiful and it has an amazing API it
does all the things you'd expect an

2412
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:00,300
does all the things you'd expect an
 

2413
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,609
does all the things you'd expect an
Editor to do

2414
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:01,619
Editor to do
 

2415
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:03,829
Editor to do
if you don't like it maybe you want a

2416
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:03,839
if you don't like it maybe you want a
 

2417
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,210
if you don't like it maybe you want a
big integer maybe you want to like

2418
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:05,220
big integer maybe you want to like
 

2419
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,890
big integer maybe you want to like
sideways integer I don't know like what

2420
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:06,900
sideways integer I don't know like what
 

2421
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,990
sideways integer I don't know like what
what all the space of integers are um

2422
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,000
what all the space of integers are um
 

2423
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,290
what all the space of integers are um
then uh then you can do that and it's

2424
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:12,300
then uh then you can do that and it's
 

2425
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,569
then uh then you can do that and it's
not a second class citizen

2426
00:41:14,569 --> 00:41:14,579
not a second class citizen
 

2427
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:16,130
not a second class citizen
and so if you look at certain other

2428
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,140
and so if you look at certain other
 

2429
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,770
and so if you look at certain other
languages like C plus plus one I also

2430
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:18,780
languages like C plus plus one I also
 

2431
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,870
languages like C plus plus one I also
love and use a lot um

2432
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880
love and use a lot um
 

2433
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,990
love and use a lot um
into hard code in the language

2434
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
into hard code in the language
 

2435
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,890
into hard code in the language
but complex is not and so isn't it kind

2436
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:27,900
but complex is not and so isn't it kind
 

2437
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,750
but complex is not and so isn't it kind
of weird that you know you have this STD

2438
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:29,760
of weird that you know you have this STD
 

2439
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,810
of weird that you know you have this STD
complex class but you have int and

2440
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:32,820
complex class but you have int and
 

2441
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,970
complex class but you have int and
complex tries to look like a natural

2442
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:34,980
complex tries to look like a natural
 

2443
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,430
complex tries to look like a natural
numeric type and things like this but

2444
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,440
numeric type and things like this but
 

2445
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,990
numeric type and things like this but
integers and floating Point have these

2446
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:39,000
integers and floating Point have these
 

2447
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,970
integers and floating Point have these
like special promotion rules and other

2448
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:40,980
like special promotion rules and other
 

2449
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,230
like special promotion rules and other
things like that that are magic and

2450
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,240
things like that that are magic and
 

2451
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,030
things like that that are magic and
they're hacked into the compiler and

2452
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,040
they're hacked into the compiler and
 

2453
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,230
they're hacked into the compiler and
because of that you can't actually make

2454
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:45,240
because of that you can't actually make
 

2455
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,430
because of that you can't actually make
something that works like the built-in

2456
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:46,440
something that works like the built-in
 

2457
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,250
something that works like the built-in
types is there something provided as a

2458
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:49,260
types is there something provided as a
 

2459
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,829
types is there something provided as a
standard because uh you know because

2460
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:51,839
standard because uh you know because
 

2461
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,750
standard because uh you know because
it's AI first

2462
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
it's AI first
 

2463
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,609
it's AI first
you know numerical types are so

2464
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:55,619
you know numerical types are so
 

2465
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:57,410
you know numerical types are so
important here so is there something

2466
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:57,420
important here so is there something
 

2467
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,650
important here so is there something
like a nice standard implementation of

2468
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:00,660
like a nice standard implementation of
 

2469
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,210
like a nice standard implementation of
integer influence yeah so so we're still

2470
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,220
integer influence yeah so so we're still
 

2471
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,349
integer influence yeah so so we're still
building all that stuff out so we

2472
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:03,359
building all that stuff out so we
 

2473
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,790
building all that stuff out so we
provide answers and floats and all that

2474
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:04,800
provide answers and floats and all that
 

2475
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,990
provide answers and floats and all that
kind of stuff we also provide like

2476
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,000
kind of stuff we also provide like
 

2477
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,970
kind of stuff we also provide like
buffers and tensors and things like that

2478
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:07,980
buffers and tensors and things like that
 

2479
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,609
buffers and tensors and things like that
that you'd expect in an ml context

2480
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:09,619
that you'd expect in an ml context
 

2481
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:12,710
that you'd expect in an ml context
honestly we need to keep designing and

2482
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:12,720
honestly we need to keep designing and
 

2483
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,790
honestly we need to keep designing and
redesigning and working with the

2484
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:13,800
redesigning and working with the
 

2485
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,750
redesigning and working with the
community to build that out and make

2486
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:14,760
community to build that out and make
 

2487
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,950
community to build that out and make
that better that's not our strength

2488
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:15,960
that better that's not our strength
 

2489
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,970
that better that's not our strength
right now

2490
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:16,980
right now
 

2491
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,710
right now
give us six months or a year and I think

2492
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
give us six months or a year and I think
 

2493
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,290
give us six months or a year and I think
it'll be way better but um but the power

2494
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:21,300
it'll be way better but um but the power
 

2495
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,970
it'll be way better but um but the power
of putting in the library means we can

2496
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:22,980
of putting in the library means we can
 

2497
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,410
of putting in the library means we can
have teams of experts that aren't

2498
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:24,420
have teams of experts that aren't
 

2499
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,510
have teams of experts that aren't
compiler Engineers that can help us

2500
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:26,520
compiler Engineers that can help us
 

2501
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,490
compiler Engineers that can help us
design and refine and drive this forward

2502
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:28,500
design and refine and drive this forward
 

2503
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,470
design and refine and drive this forward
so uh one of the exciting things we

2504
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:30,480
so uh one of the exciting things we
 

2505
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,030
so uh one of the exciting things we
should mention here is that

2506
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:32,040
should mention here is that
 

2507
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,750
should mention here is that
this is uh this is new and fresh this

2508
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:35,760
this is uh this is new and fresh this
 

2509
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,670
this is uh this is new and fresh this
cake is unbaked

2510
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:37,680
cake is unbaked
 

2511
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,290
cake is unbaked
it's almost baked you can tell it's

2512
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:39,300
it's almost baked you can tell it's
 

2513
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,550
it's almost baked you can tell it's
delicious

2514
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,560
delicious
 

2515
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,710
delicious
but it's not fully ready to be consumed

2516
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:42,720
but it's not fully ready to be consumed
 

2517
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,050
but it's not fully ready to be consumed
yep that's very fair it is very useful

2518
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:45,060
yep that's very fair it is very useful
 

2519
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,550
yep that's very fair it is very useful
but it's very useful if you're a super

2520
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,560
but it's very useful if you're a super
 

2521
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,290
but it's very useful if you're a super
low level programmer right now and what

2522
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:48,300
low level programmer right now and what
 

2523
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,430
low level programmer right now and what
we're doing is we're working our way up

2524
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
we're doing is we're working our way up
 

2525
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,349
we're doing is we're working our way up
the stack and so the way I would look at

2526
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:51,359
the stack and so the way I would look at
 

2527
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:55,910
the stack and so the way I would look at
Mojo today in May and 2023

2528
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:55,920
Mojo today in May and 2023
 

2529
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,010
Mojo today in May and 2023
um is that it's like a 0.1

2530
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,020
um is that it's like a 0.1
 

2531
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,410
um is that it's like a 0.1
so I think that you know a year from now

2532
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:00,420
so I think that you know a year from now
 

2533
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,870
so I think that you know a year from now
it's gonna be way more interesting to a

2534
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:02,880
it's gonna be way more interesting to a
 

2535
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,790
it's gonna be way more interesting to a
variety of people but what we're doing

2536
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:04,800
variety of people but what we're doing
 

2537
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,890
variety of people but what we're doing
is we're we decide to release it early

2538
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:06,900
is we're we decide to release it early
 

2539
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,510
is we're we decide to release it early
so that people can get access to it and

2540
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:08,520
so that people can get access to it and
 

2541
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,530
so that people can get access to it and
play with them we can build it with the

2542
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:09,540
play with them we can build it with the
 

2543
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,010
play with them we can build it with the
community we um have a big road map

2544
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,020
community we um have a big road map
 

2545
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,349
community we um have a big road map
fully published being transparent about

2546
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:15,359
fully published being transparent about
 

2547
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,730
fully published being transparent about
this and a lot of people are involved in

2548
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:16,740
this and a lot of people are involved in
 

2549
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,109
this and a lot of people are involved in
this stuff and so what we're doing is

2550
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:18,119
this stuff and so what we're doing is
 

2551
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,670
this stuff and so what we're doing is
we're really optimizing for building

2552
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:19,680
we're really optimizing for building
 

2553
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,670
we're really optimizing for building
this thing the right way and building it

2554
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:22,680
this thing the right way and building it
 

2555
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,930
this thing the right way and building it
the right way is kind of interesting

2556
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:23,940
the right way is kind of interesting
 

2557
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,069
the right way is kind of interesting
working with the community because

2558
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:25,079
working with the community because
 

2559
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,990
working with the community because
everybody wants it yesterday

2560
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,000
everybody wants it yesterday
 

2561
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,650
everybody wants it yesterday
and so it's sometimes it's kind of you

2562
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:30,660
and so it's sometimes it's kind of you
 

2563
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,270
and so it's sometimes it's kind of you
know there's some Dynamics there but

2564
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:32,280
know there's some Dynamics there but
 

2565
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,069
know there's some Dynamics there but
yeah I think it's good it's the right

2566
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,079
yeah I think it's good it's the right
 

2567
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,050
yeah I think it's good it's the right
thing so there's a Discord also so the

2568
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:36,060
thing so there's a Discord also so the
 

2569
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,390
thing so there's a Discord also so the
Dynamics is pretty interesting sometimes

2570
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:38,400
Dynamics is pretty interesting sometimes
 

2571
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,650
Dynamics is pretty interesting sometimes
the community probably can be very

2572
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:39,660
the community probably can be very
 

2573
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,450
the community probably can be very
chaotic

2574
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:41,460
chaotic
 

2575
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,109
chaotic
and uh introduce a lot of stress Guido

2576
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
and uh introduce a lot of stress Guido
 

2577
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,089
and uh introduce a lot of stress Guido
famously quit over the stress of the

2578
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:47,099
famously quit over the stress of the
 

2579
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,309
famously quit over the stress of the
walrus operator I mean yeah you know it

2580
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:49,319
walrus operator I mean yeah you know it
 

2581
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,730
walrus operator I mean yeah you know it
broke maybe

2582
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:51,740
broke maybe
 

2583
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,050
broke maybe
exactly and so like it could be very

2584
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:54,060
exactly and so like it could be very
 

2585
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,030
exactly and so like it could be very
stressful to develop but can you just

2586
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:56,040
stressful to develop but can you just
 

2587
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,730
stressful to develop but can you just
add tangent upon a tangent is it

2588
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:58,740
add tangent upon a tangent is it
 

2589
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,670
add tangent upon a tangent is it
stressful to to uh

2590
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
stressful to to uh
 

2591
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,950
stressful to to uh
to work through the design of various

2592
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:03,960
to work through the design of various
 

2593
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,930
to work through the design of various
features here given that the community

2594
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:05,940
features here given that the community
 

2595
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,690
features here given that the community
is so richly involved well so um so I've

2596
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:08,700
is so richly involved well so um so I've
 

2597
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,370
is so richly involved well so um so I've
been doing open development and

2598
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:10,380
been doing open development and
 

2599
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,829
been doing open development and
Community stuff for decades now somehow

2600
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:12,839
Community stuff for decades now somehow
 

2601
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:14,089
Community stuff for decades now somehow
this has happened to me

2602
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:14,099
this has happened to me
 

2603
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,190
this has happened to me
um so I've I've learned some tricks but

2604
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:16,200
um so I've I've learned some tricks but
 

2605
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,809
um so I've I've learned some tricks but
the the thing that always gets me is I

2606
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:17,819
the the thing that always gets me is I
 

2607
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:20,089
the the thing that always gets me is I
want to make people happy right and so

2608
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:20,099
want to make people happy right and so
 

2609
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:22,849
want to make people happy right and so
this is this is maybe not all people all

2610
00:44:22,849 --> 00:44:22,859
this is this is maybe not all people all
 

2611
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,710
this is this is maybe not all people all
happy all the time but generally I want

2612
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:24,720
happy all the time but generally I want
 

2613
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,450
happy all the time but generally I want
I want people to be happy right and so

2614
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:26,460
I want people to be happy right and so
 

2615
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,670
I want people to be happy right and so
the challenge is that again we're

2616
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:28,680
the challenge is that again we're
 

2617
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,650
the challenge is that again we're
tapping into some long

2618
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:30,660
tapping into some long
 

2619
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,710
tapping into some long
some deep-seated long tensions and

2620
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:33,720
some deep-seated long tensions and
 

2621
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,569
some deep-seated long tensions and
pressures both in the python world but

2622
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:35,579
pressures both in the python world but
 

2623
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,130
pressures both in the python world but
also in the AI world in the hardware

2624
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:37,140
also in the AI world in the hardware
 

2625
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,809
also in the AI world in the hardware
world and things like this and so people

2626
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:38,819
world and things like this and so people
 

2627
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:41,690
world and things like this and so people
just want us to move faster right and so

2628
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:41,700
just want us to move faster right and so
 

2629
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,030
just want us to move faster right and so
again our decision was let's release

2630
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:44,040
again our decision was let's release
 

2631
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,849
again our decision was let's release
this early let's get people used to it

2632
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:46,859
this early let's get people used to it
 

2633
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,349
this early let's get people used to it
or access to it and play with it and

2634
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:48,359
or access to it and play with it and
 

2635
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:49,790
or access to it and play with it and
like let's let's build it in the open

2636
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:49,800
like let's let's build it in the open
 

2637
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,450
like let's let's build it in the open
which we could have you know had the the

2638
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:53,460
which we could have you know had the the
 

2639
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,210
which we could have you know had the the
language monk sitting in the Cloister up

2640
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:56,220
language monk sitting in the Cloister up
 

2641
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,849
language monk sitting in the Cloister up
on the hilltop like beavering away

2642
00:44:58,849 --> 00:44:58,859
on the hilltop like beavering away
 

2643
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:00,050
on the hilltop like beavering away
trying to build something but in my

2644
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:00,060
trying to build something but in my
 

2645
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,490
trying to build something but in my
experience you get something that's way

2646
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:01,500
experience you get something that's way
 

2647
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,230
experience you get something that's way
better if you work with the community

2648
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:03,240
better if you work with the community
 

2649
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,450
better if you work with the community
right uh and so yes it can be

2650
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:05,460
right uh and so yes it can be
 

2651
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,829
right uh and so yes it can be
frustrating can be challenging for lots

2652
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:06,839
frustrating can be challenging for lots
 

2653
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:08,630
frustrating can be challenging for lots
of people involved and you know if you I

2654
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:08,640
of people involved and you know if you I
 

2655
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,130
of people involved and you know if you I
mean if you mention our Discord we have

2656
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:10,140
mean if you mention our Discord we have
 

2657
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,410
mean if you mention our Discord we have
over 10 000 people on the Discord 11 000

2658
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:12,420
over 10 000 people on the Discord 11 000
 

2659
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,970
over 10 000 people on the Discord 11 000
people or something keep in mind we

2660
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:13,980
people or something keep in mind we
 

2661
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,390
people or something keep in mind we
released Mojo like two weeks ago yeah so

2662
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:17,400
released Mojo like two weeks ago yeah so
 

2663
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,849
released Mojo like two weeks ago yeah so
um very effective so it's very cool

2664
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:19,859
um very effective so it's very cool
 

2665
00:45:19,859 --> 00:45:22,190
um very effective so it's very cool
um but what that means is that um you

2666
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:22,200
um but what that means is that um you
 

2667
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,589
um but what that means is that um you
know 10 11 000 people all will want

2668
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:24,599
know 10 11 000 people all will want
 

2669
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,990
know 10 11 000 people all will want
something different right and so what

2670
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:27,000
something different right and so what
 

2671
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,609
something different right and so what
we've done is we've tried to say okay

2672
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:28,619
we've done is we've tried to say okay
 

2673
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:31,190
we've done is we've tried to say okay
cool here's our roadmap here here and

2674
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
cool here's our roadmap here here and
 

2675
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,410
cool here's our roadmap here here and
the roadmap isn't completely arbitrary

2676
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:33,420
the roadmap isn't completely arbitrary
 

2677
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,510
the roadmap isn't completely arbitrary
it's based on here's the logical order

2678
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:35,520
it's based on here's the logical order
 

2679
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,190
it's based on here's the logical order
in which to build these features or add

2680
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
in which to build these features or add
 

2681
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,690
in which to build these features or add
add these capabilities and things like

2682
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:38,700
add these capabilities and things like
 

2683
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,430
add these capabilities and things like
that and what we've done is we've spun

2684
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:40,440
that and what we've done is we've spun
 

2685
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,829
that and what we've done is we've spun
really fast on like bug fixes and so we

2686
00:45:42,829 --> 00:45:42,839
really fast on like bug fixes and so we
 

2687
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,230
really fast on like bug fixes and so we
actually have very few bugs which is

2688
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:45,240
actually have very few bugs which is
 

2689
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,690
actually have very few bugs which is
cool I mean actually for a project in

2690
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:47,700
cool I mean actually for a project in
 

2691
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,190
cool I mean actually for a project in
the state but then what we're doing is

2692
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:49,200
the state but then what we're doing is
 

2693
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,329
the state but then what we're doing is
we're dropping in features very

2694
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:50,339
we're dropping in features very
 

2695
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:52,250
we're dropping in features very
deliberately I mean this is fun to watch

2696
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:52,260
deliberately I mean this is fun to watch
 

2697
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,750
deliberately I mean this is fun to watch
because you got the two

2698
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:53,760
because you got the two
 

2699
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,030
because you got the two
gigantic communities of like Hardware

2700
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:56,040
gigantic communities of like Hardware
 

2701
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,550
gigantic communities of like Hardware
like systems engineers and then you have

2702
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:58,560
like systems engineers and then you have
 

2703
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,910
like systems engineers and then you have
the machine learning python people that

2704
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:01,920
the machine learning python people that
 

2705
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,370
the machine learning python people that
are like higher level yeah and it's just

2706
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:04,380
are like higher level yeah and it's just
 

2707
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:08,150
are like higher level yeah and it's just
too like for like Army like uh they've

2708
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
too like for like Army like uh they've
 

2709
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,010
too like for like Army like uh they've
been at War yeah they've been at War

2710
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:10,020
been at War yeah they've been at War
 

2711
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,829
been at War yeah they've been at War
right and so so here's here's a Tolkien

2712
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:12,839
right and so so here's here's a Tolkien
 

2713
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,390
right and so so here's here's a Tolkien
novel or something okay so here's a test

2714
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
novel or something okay so here's a test
 

2715
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,130
novel or something okay so here's a test
again like it's it's super funny for for

2716
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:16,140
again like it's it's super funny for for
 

2717
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,510
again like it's it's super funny for for
something that's only been out for two

2718
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:17,520
something that's only been out for two
 

2719
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,490
something that's only been out for two
weeks right people are so impatient

2720
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:19,500
weeks right people are so impatient
 

2721
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,250
weeks right people are so impatient
right but okay cool let's fast forward a

2722
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:22,260
right but okay cool let's fast forward a
 

2723
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:22,970
right but okay cool let's fast forward a
year

2724
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:22,980
year
 

2725
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,890
year
like in a year's time Mojo will be

2726
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:24,900
like in a year's time Mojo will be
 

2727
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,690
like in a year's time Mojo will be
actually quite amazing and solve tons of

2728
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:26,700
actually quite amazing and solve tons of
 

2729
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,970
actually quite amazing and solve tons of
problems and be very good

2730
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:28,980
problems and be very good
 

2731
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,470
problems and be very good
um people still have these problems

2732
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
um people still have these problems
 

2733
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,470
um people still have these problems
right and so you you look at this you

2734
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:33,480
right and so you you look at this you
 

2735
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,089
right and so you you look at this you
say and the way I look at this at least

2736
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:35,099
say and the way I look at this at least
 

2737
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,390
say and the way I look at this at least
is to say okay well we're solving big

2738
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:38,400
is to say okay well we're solving big
 

2739
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,670
is to say okay well we're solving big
long-standing problems

2740
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:40,680
long-standing problems
 

2741
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,950
long-standing problems
to me I again working on many different

2742
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:42,960
to me I again working on many different
 

2743
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,089
to me I again working on many different
problems I want to make sure we do it

2744
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:44,099
problems I want to make sure we do it
 

2745
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:44,870
problems I want to make sure we do it
right

2746
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:44,880
right
 

2747
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,730
right
there's like a responsibility you feel

2748
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:46,740
there's like a responsibility you feel
 

2749
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:50,030
there's like a responsibility you feel
because if you mess it up right there's

2750
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:50,040
because if you mess it up right there's
 

2751
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,470
because if you mess it up right there's
very few opportunities to do projects

2752
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:51,480
very few opportunities to do projects
 

2753
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,490
very few opportunities to do projects
like this and have them really have

2754
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:52,500
like this and have them really have
 

2755
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,589
like this and have them really have
impact on the world if we do it right

2756
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:54,599
impact on the world if we do it right
 

2757
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:56,569
impact on the world if we do it right
then maybe we can take those feuding

2758
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:56,579
then maybe we can take those feuding
 

2759
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,490
then maybe we can take those feuding
armies and actually heal some of those

2760
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:58,500
armies and actually heal some of those
 

2761
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,309
armies and actually heal some of those
wounds yeah like this feels this feels

2762
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:01,319
wounds yeah like this feels this feels
 

2763
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,230
wounds yeah like this feels this feels
like a speech by George Washington or

2764
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:03,240
like a speech by George Washington or
 

2765
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,809
like a speech by George Washington or
Abraham Lincoln or something and you

2766
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:05,819
Abraham Lincoln or something and you
 

2767
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:06,890
Abraham Lincoln or something and you
look at this it's like okay well how

2768
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:06,900
look at this it's like okay well how
 

2769
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,809
look at this it's like okay well how
different are we yeah we all want

2770
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:08,819
different are we yeah we all want
 

2771
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:10,250
different are we yeah we all want
beautiful things we all want something

2772
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:10,260
beautiful things we all want something
 

2773
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,510
beautiful things we all want something
that's nice we all want to be able to

2774
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,520
that's nice we all want to be able to
 

2775
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,890
that's nice we all want to be able to
work together we all want our stuff be

2776
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:12,900
work together we all want our stuff be
 

2777
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,630
work together we all want our stuff be
used right and so if we can help heal

2778
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:14,640
used right and so if we can help heal
 

2779
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,849
used right and so if we can help heal
that now I'm not optimistic that

2780
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:16,859
that now I'm not optimistic that
 

2781
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:18,470
that now I'm not optimistic that
all people will use Mojo and they'll

2782
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:18,480
all people will use Mojo and they'll
 

2783
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,910
all people will use Mojo and they'll
stop using C plus plus like that's not

2784
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
stop using C plus plus like that's not
 

2785
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,430
stop using C plus plus like that's not
my goal right but um but if we can heal

2786
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:22,440
my goal right but um but if we can heal
 

2787
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,930
my goal right but um but if we can heal
some of that I think that'd be pretty

2788
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:23,940
some of that I think that'd be pretty
 

2789
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,569
some of that I think that'd be pretty
cool yeah and we start by putting the

2790
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:26,579
cool yeah and we start by putting the
 

2791
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:29,050
cool yeah and we start by putting the
people who like braces into the gulag no

2792
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:29,060
people who like braces into the gulag no
 

2793
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,150
people who like braces into the gulag no
uh so so there are proposals for adding

2794
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,160
uh so so there are proposals for adding
 

2795
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,650
uh so so there are proposals for adding
braces to Mojo and we just know what's

2796
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:33,660
braces to Mojo and we just know what's
 

2797
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,150
braces to Mojo and we just know what's
your thing we tell them no okay

2798
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:37,160
your thing we tell them no okay
 

2799
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,010
your thing we tell them no okay
politely yeah anyway so there's a lot of

2800
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:40,020
politely yeah anyway so there's a lot of
 

2801
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,690
politely yeah anyway so there's a lot of
amazing features on the roadmap and

2802
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:41,700
amazing features on the roadmap and
 

2803
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,309
amazing features on the roadmap and
those already implemented it it'd be

2804
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:43,319
those already implemented it it'd be
 

2805
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,870
those already implemented it it'd be
awesome I could just ask you a few

2806
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:44,880
awesome I could just ask you a few
 

2807
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,809
awesome I could just ask you a few
things yeah so uh the the other

2808
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:47,819
things yeah so uh the the other
 

2809
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:49,130
things yeah so uh the the other
performance Improvement comes from

2810
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:49,140
performance Improvement comes from
 

2811
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,710
performance Improvement comes from
immutability so what's the what's this

2812
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:51,720
immutability so what's the what's this
 

2813
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,349
immutability so what's the what's this
VAR and this let thing that we got going

2814
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:54,359
VAR and this let thing that we got going
 

2815
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:56,750
VAR and this let thing that we got going
on what's immutability

2816
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:56,760
on what's immutability
 

2817
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,510
on what's immutability
yeah so one of the things that is uh

2818
00:47:59,510 --> 00:47:59,520
yeah so one of the things that is uh
 

2819
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,970
yeah so one of the things that is uh
useful and it's not always required but

2820
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:01,980
useful and it's not always required but
 

2821
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,829
useful and it's not always required but
it's useful is knowing whether something

2822
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:03,839
it's useful is knowing whether something
 

2823
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,750
it's useful is knowing whether something
can change out from underneath you right

2824
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:05,760
can change out from underneath you right
 

2825
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,089
can change out from underneath you right
so in Python you have a pointer to an

2826
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:08,099
so in Python you have a pointer to an
 

2827
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:10,790
so in Python you have a pointer to an
array right and so you pass that pointer

2828
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:10,800
array right and so you pass that pointer
 

2829
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,890
array right and so you pass that pointer
to an array around to things

2830
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:12,900
to an array around to things
 

2831
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,349
to an array around to things
if you pass into a function they may

2832
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:15,359
if you pass into a function they may
 

2833
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,970
if you pass into a function they may
take that and scroll away in some other

2834
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:16,980
take that and scroll away in some other
 

2835
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,309
take that and scroll away in some other
data structure and so you get your array

2836
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:19,319
data structure and so you get your array
 

2837
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:20,870
data structure and so you get your array
back and you go to use it now somebody

2838
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:20,880
back and you go to use it now somebody
 

2839
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,490
back and you go to use it now somebody
else is like putting stuff in your array

2840
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:22,500
else is like putting stuff in your array
 

2841
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,650
else is like putting stuff in your array
how do you reason about that it gets to

2842
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:24,660
how do you reason about that it gets to
 

2843
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,990
how do you reason about that it gets to
be very complicated at least lots of

2844
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:27,000
be very complicated at least lots of
 

2845
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,630
be very complicated at least lots of
bugs right and so one of the things that

2846
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:29,640
bugs right and so one of the things that
 

2847
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,849
bugs right and so one of the things that
you know again this is not selling Mojo

2848
00:48:31,849 --> 00:48:31,859
you know again this is not selling Mojo
 

2849
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,770
you know again this is not selling Mojo
forces on you but something that Mojo

2850
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:33,780
forces on you but something that Mojo
 

2851
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,030
forces on you but something that Mojo
enables is a thing called value

2852
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,040
enables is a thing called value
 

2853
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,670
enables is a thing called value
semantics and what value semantics do is

2854
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:37,680
semantics and what value semantics do is
 

2855
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,290
semantics and what value semantics do is
they take

2856
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:39,300
they take
 

2857
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,569
they take
collections like arrays like

2858
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:41,579
collections like arrays like
 

2859
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:44,510
collections like arrays like
dictionaries also tensors and strings

2860
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:44,520
dictionaries also tensors and strings
 

2861
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,950
dictionaries also tensors and strings
and things like this that are much

2862
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:45,960
and things like this that are much
 

2863
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,589
and things like this that are much
higher level and make them behave like

2864
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:48,599
higher level and make them behave like
 

2865
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,450
higher level and make them behave like
proper values and so it makes it look

2866
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:50,460
proper values and so it makes it look
 

2867
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,030
proper values and so it makes it look
like if you pass these things around you

2868
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,040
like if you pass these things around you
 

2869
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,370
like if you pass these things around you
get a logical copy of all the data and

2870
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:55,380
get a logical copy of all the data and
 

2871
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,010
get a logical copy of all the data and
so if I pass you an array your array you

2872
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:58,020
so if I pass you an array your array you
 

2873
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,150
so if I pass you an array your array you
can go do what you want to it you're not

2874
00:48:59,150 --> 00:48:59,160
can go do what you want to it you're not
 

2875
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,970
can go do what you want to it you're not
going to hurt my array now that is an

2876
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:01,980
going to hurt my array now that is an
 

2877
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,349
going to hurt my array now that is an
interesting and very powerful design

2878
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:03,359
interesting and very powerful design
 

2879
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,390
interesting and very powerful design
principle it defines away a ton of bugs

2880
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:05,400
principle it defines away a ton of bugs
 

2881
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,309
principle it defines away a ton of bugs
you have to be careful to implement it

2882
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:07,319
you have to be careful to implement it
 

2883
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,710
you have to be careful to implement it
in an efficient way as their performance

2884
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:09,720
in an efficient way as their performance
 

2885
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,530
in an efficient way as their performance
hit that's a significant

2886
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:12,540
hit that's a significant
 

2887
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,930
hit that's a significant
uh generally not if you implement it the

2888
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:14,940
uh generally not if you implement it the
 

2889
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,089
uh generally not if you implement it the
right way but it requires a lot of very

2890
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:17,099
right way but it requires a lot of very
 

2891
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,309
right way but it requires a lot of very
low level uh getting the language right

2892
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:19,319
low level uh getting the language right
 

2893
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:21,950
low level uh getting the language right
bits I assume there'll be a huge

2894
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:21,960
bits I assume there'll be a huge
 

2895
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,569
bits I assume there'll be a huge
performance hit because it's a really

2896
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:23,579
performance hit because it's a really
 

2897
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:25,250
performance hit because it's a really
the benefit is really nice because you

2898
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:25,260
the benefit is really nice because you
 

2899
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,230
the benefit is really nice because you
don't get into that absolutely well the

2900
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:27,240
don't get into that absolutely well the
 

2901
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,790
don't get into that absolutely well the
trick is is you can't do it you can't do

2902
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:28,800
trick is is you can't do it you can't do
 

2903
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,809
trick is is you can't do it you can't do
copies

2904
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:29,819
copies
 

2905
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:31,430
copies
so you have to provide

2906
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:31,440
so you have to provide
 

2907
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,130
so you have to provide
the behavior of copying without doing

2908
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:34,140
the behavior of copying without doing
 

2909
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,730
the behavior of copying without doing
the copy yeah how do you do that

2910
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:37,740
the copy yeah how do you do that
 

2911
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,530
the copy yeah how do you do that
is that how do you do that it's not

2912
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:39,540
is that how do you do that it's not
 

2913
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,690
is that how do you do that it's not
magic it's just it's actually pretty

2914
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:41,700
magic it's just it's actually pretty
 

2915
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,490
magic it's just it's actually pretty
cool well so first before we talk about

2916
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:43,500
cool well so first before we talk about
 

2917
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,230
cool well so first before we talk about
how that works let's talk about how it

2918
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:45,240
how that works let's talk about how it
 

2919
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,329
how that works let's talk about how it
works in Python right so in Python you

2920
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:47,339
works in Python right so in Python you
 

2921
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,550
works in Python right so in Python you
need to find a person class or maybe a

2922
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:49,560
need to find a person class or maybe a
 

2923
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,410
need to find a person class or maybe a
person class is a bad idea you define a

2924
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:51,420
person class is a bad idea you define a
 

2925
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,030
person class is a bad idea you define a
database class right and database class

2926
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
database class right and database class
 

2927
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,650
database class right and database class
has an array of Records something like

2928
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:54,660
has an array of Records something like
 

2929
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,870
has an array of Records something like
that right and so the problem is that if

2930
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:56,880
that right and so the problem is that if
 

2931
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,030
that right and so the problem is that if
you pass in a record or class instance

2932
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
you pass in a record or class instance
 

2933
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,910
you pass in a record or class instance
into the database it'll take a hold of

2934
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:01,920
into the database it'll take a hold of
 

2935
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,950
into the database it'll take a hold of
that object and then it assumes it has

2936
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:03,960
that object and then it assumes it has
 

2937
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,890
that object and then it assumes it has
it and if you're passing an object in

2938
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:06,900
it and if you're passing an object in
 

2939
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,270
it and if you're passing an object in
you have to know that that database is

2940
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:08,280
you have to know that that database is
 

2941
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,550
you have to know that that database is
going to take take it and therefore you

2942
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:10,560
going to take take it and therefore you
 

2943
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,569
going to take take it and therefore you
shouldn't change it after you put in the

2944
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:11,579
shouldn't change it after you put in the
 

2945
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:13,130
shouldn't change it after you put in the
database right this is this you kind of

2946
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:13,140
database right this is this you kind of
 

2947
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,510
database right this is this you kind of
have to know that you just have to kind

2948
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:14,520
have to know that you just have to kind
 

2949
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,150
have to know that you just have to kind
of know that right and so you roll out

2950
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:17,160
of know that right and so you roll out
 

2951
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,470
of know that right and so you roll out
version one of the database you just

2952
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:18,480
version one of the database you just
 

2953
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,270
version one of the database you just
kind of have to know that of course Lex

2954
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:20,280
kind of have to know that of course Lex
 

2955
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,309
kind of have to know that of course Lex
uses its own database right yeah right

2956
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:22,319
uses its own database right yeah right
 

2957
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,569
uses its own database right yeah right
because you built it you understand how

2958
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:23,579
because you built it you understand how
 

2959
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:25,849
because you built it you understand how
this works right somebody else joins the

2960
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:25,859
this works right somebody else joins the
 

2961
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:27,530
this works right somebody else joins the
team they don't know this yes right and

2962
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:27,540
team they don't know this yes right and
 

2963
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,870
team they don't know this yes right and
so now they suddenly get bugs you're

2964
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:29,880
so now they suddenly get bugs you're
 

2965
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,430
so now they suddenly get bugs you're
having to maintain the database you

2966
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:31,440
having to maintain the database you
 

2967
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,370
having to maintain the database you
shake your fist you argue the tenth time

2968
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:34,380
shake your fist you argue the tenth time
 

2969
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,930
shake your fist you argue the tenth time
this happens you're like okay we have to

2970
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:35,940
this happens you're like okay we have to
 

2971
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,250
this happens you're like okay we have to
do something different right and so what

2972
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:37,260
do something different right and so what
 

2973
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,569
do something different right and so what
you do is you go to change your python

2974
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:38,579
you do is you go to change your python
 

2975
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,430
you do is you go to change your python
code and you change your database class

2976
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:40,440
code and you change your database class
 

2977
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,309
code and you change your database class
to copy the record every time you add it

2978
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:43,319
to copy the record every time you add it
 

2979
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:45,230
to copy the record every time you add it
and so what ends up happening is you say

2980
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:45,240
and so what ends up happening is you say
 

2981
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,150
and so what ends up happening is you say
okay I will do what's called a defensive

2982
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:47,160
okay I will do what's called a defensive
 

2983
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,210
okay I will do what's called a defensive
copy inside the database and then that

2984
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:50,220
copy inside the database and then that
 

2985
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,250
copy inside the database and then that
way if somebody passes something in I

2986
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:52,260
way if somebody passes something in I
 

2987
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,950
way if somebody passes something in I
will have my own copy of it and they can

2988
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:54,960
will have my own copy of it and they can
 

2989
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,030
will have my own copy of it and they can
go do whatever and they're not going to

2990
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:56,040
go do whatever and they're not going to
 

2991
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,530
go do whatever and they're not going to
break my thing

2992
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:57,540
break my thing
 

2993
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,230
break my thing
okay this is usually the the two design

2994
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
okay this is usually the the two design
 

2995
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,970
okay this is usually the the two design
patterns if you look in pytorch for

2996
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:01,980
patterns if you look in pytorch for
 

2997
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,950
patterns if you look in pytorch for
example this is cloning a tensor like

2998
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:03,960
example this is cloning a tensor like
 

2999
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,450
example this is cloning a tensor like
there's a specific thing and you have to

3000
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:05,460
there's a specific thing and you have to
 

3001
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,530
there's a specific thing and you have to
know where to call it if you don't call

3002
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:06,540
know where to call it if you don't call
 

3003
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,730
know where to call it if you don't call
in the right place you get these bugs

3004
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:07,740
in the right place you get these bugs
 

3005
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,490
in the right place you get these bugs
and this is state of the art right

3006
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:10,500
and this is state of the art right
 

3007
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,470
and this is state of the art right
so a different approach so it's used in

3008
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:12,480
so a different approach so it's used in
 

3009
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,970
so a different approach so it's used in
many languages so I've worked with it in

3010
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:13,980
many languages so I've worked with it in
 

3011
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:14,930
many languages so I've worked with it in
Swift

3012
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:14,940
Swift
 

3013
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,910
Swift
um is you say okay well let's provide

3014
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:16,920
um is you say okay well let's provide
 

3015
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,890
um is you say okay well let's provide
value semantics and so we want to

3016
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:18,900
value semantics and so we want to
 

3017
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,109
value semantics and so we want to
provide the view that you get a

3018
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
provide the view that you get a
 

3019
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,450
provide the view that you get a
logically independent copy but we won't

3020
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:23,460
logically independent copy but we won't
 

3021
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,829
logically independent copy but we won't
do that lazily

3022
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:24,839
do that lazily
 

3023
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,690
do that lazily
and so what what we do is you say okay

3024
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:26,700
and so what what we do is you say okay
 

3025
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,270
and so what what we do is you say okay
if you pass something into a function it

3026
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:29,280
if you pass something into a function it
 

3027
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,890
if you pass something into a function it
doesn't actually make a copy what it

3028
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:30,900
doesn't actually make a copy what it
 

3029
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,150
doesn't actually make a copy what it
actually does is it just increments a

3030
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:32,160
actually does is it just increments a
 

3031
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,890
actually does is it just increments a
reference to it and if you pass it

3032
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:33,900
reference to it and if you pass it
 

3033
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,690
reference to it and if you pass it
around you stick in your database

3034
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:35,700
around you stick in your database
 

3035
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,970
around you stick in your database
they can go on the database you or not

3036
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:37,980
they can go on the database you or not
 

3037
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,470
they can go on the database you or not
and then you come back out of the stack

3038
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:39,480
and then you come back out of the stack
 

3039
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,750
and then you come back out of the stack
nobody's copied anything you come back

3040
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
nobody's copied anything you come back
 

3041
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,130
nobody's copied anything you come back
out of the stack and then the caller

3042
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:43,140
out of the stack and then the caller
 

3043
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,829
out of the stack and then the caller
lets go of it well then you've just

3044
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:45,839
lets go of it well then you've just
 

3045
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,870
lets go of it well then you've just
handed it off to the database you've

3046
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:47,880
handed it off to the database you've
 

3047
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,670
handed it off to the database you've
transferred it and there's no copies

3048
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:49,680
transferred it and there's no copies
 

3049
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,630
transferred it and there's no copies
made

3050
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:50,640
made
 

3051
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,390
made
now on the other hand if you know your

3052
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:53,400
now on the other hand if you know your
 

3053
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,430
now on the other hand if you know your
co-worker goes and hands you a record

3054
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:55,440
co-worker goes and hands you a record
 

3055
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,049
co-worker goes and hands you a record
and you pass it in you stick it in the

3056
00:51:57,049 --> 00:51:57,059
and you pass it in you stick it in the
 

3057
00:51:57,059 --> 00:51:58,910
and you pass it in you stick it in the
database and then you go to town and you

3058
00:51:58,910 --> 00:51:58,920
database and then you go to town and you
 

3059
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,130
database and then you go to town and you
start modifying it what happens is you

3060
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:01,140
start modifying it what happens is you
 

3061
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,309
start modifying it what happens is you
get a copy lazily on demand

3062
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:04,319
get a copy lazily on demand
 

3063
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,870
get a copy lazily on demand
and so what this does is gives you

3064
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:05,880
and so what this does is gives you
 

3065
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,270
and so what this does is gives you
copies only when you need them and it

3066
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:08,280
copies only when you need them and it
 

3067
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,770
copies only when you need them and it
also so it defines away the bugs but

3068
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:09,780
also so it defines away the bugs but
 

3069
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:11,569
also so it defines away the bugs but
also generally reduces the number of

3070
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:11,579
also generally reduces the number of
 

3071
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,370
also generally reduces the number of
copies in practice and so but the

3072
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:13,380
copies in practice and so but the
 

3073
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,990
copies in practice and so but the
implementation details are tricky here

3074
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:15,000
implementation details are tricky here
 

3075
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,809
implementation details are tricky here
yeah so this is yes something with

3076
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:17,819
yeah so this is yes something with
 

3077
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:19,490
yeah so this is yes something with
reference Counting

3078
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:19,500
reference Counting
 

3079
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,150
reference Counting
but to make it performant

3080
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
but to make it performant
 

3081
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,030
but to make it performant
across a number of different kinds of

3082
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,040
across a number of different kinds of
 

3083
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,530
across a number of different kinds of
objects yeah well so you need a couple

3084
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:27,540
objects yeah well so you need a couple
 

3085
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,210
objects yeah well so you need a couple
of things and so there's many so this

3086
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:29,220
of things and so there's many so this
 

3087
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,829
of things and so there's many so this
concept has existed in many different

3088
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:30,839
concept has existed in many different
 

3089
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,710
concept has existed in many different
worlds and so that again it's not novel

3090
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:33,720
worlds and so that again it's not novel
 

3091
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,170
worlds and so that again it's not novel
research at all right the magic is

3092
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:36,180
research at all right the magic is
 

3093
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,910
research at all right the magic is
getting the design right so that you can

3094
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:37,920
getting the design right so that you can
 

3095
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,770
getting the design right so that you can
do this in a reasonable way right and so

3096
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:39,780
do this in a reasonable way right and so
 

3097
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,910
do this in a reasonable way right and so
there's a number of components that go

3098
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:40,920
there's a number of components that go
 

3099
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,309
there's a number of components that go
into this one is when you're passing

3100
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:43,319
into this one is when you're passing
 

3101
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:45,710
into this one is when you're passing
around so we're talking about Python and

3102
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:45,720
around so we're talking about Python and
 

3103
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:46,970
around so we're talking about Python and
reference counting and the expense of

3104
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:46,980
reference counting and the expense of
 

3105
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,010
reference counting and the expense of
doing that when you're passing values

3106
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,020
doing that when you're passing values
 

3107
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,510
doing that when you're passing values
around you don't want to do extra

3108
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:50,520
around you don't want to do extra
 

3109
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,829
around you don't want to do extra
reference counting for no good reason

3110
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:51,839
reference counting for no good reason
 

3111
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,329
reference counting for no good reason
and so you have to make sure that you're

3112
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:53,339
and so you have to make sure that you're
 

3113
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:55,190
and so you have to make sure that you're
efficient and you transfer ownership

3114
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:55,200
efficient and you transfer ownership
 

3115
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,470
efficient and you transfer ownership
instead of duplicating references and

3116
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:57,480
instead of duplicating references and
 

3117
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,849
instead of duplicating references and
things like that which is a very low

3118
00:52:58,849 --> 00:52:58,859
things like that which is a very low
 

3119
00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:02,210
things like that which is a very low
level problem you also have to adopt

3120
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:02,220
level problem you also have to adopt
 

3121
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,890
level problem you also have to adopt
this and you have to build these data

3122
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:03,900
this and you have to build these data
 

3123
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,109
this and you have to build these data
structures and so if you say

3124
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:06,119
structures and so if you say
 

3125
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,430
structures and so if you say
um you know Mojo has to be compatible

3126
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:07,440
um you know Mojo has to be compatible
 

3127
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,109
um you know Mojo has to be compatible
with python so of course the default

3128
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
with python so of course the default
 

3129
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,930
with python so of course the default
list is a reference semantic list that

3130
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:11,940
list is a reference semantic list that
 

3131
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,390
list is a reference semantic list that
works the way you'd expect in Python but

3132
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
works the way you'd expect in Python but
 

3133
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,069
works the way you'd expect in Python but
then you have to design a value semantic

3134
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,079
then you have to design a value semantic
 

3135
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,870
then you have to design a value semantic
list and so you just have to implement

3136
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:17,880
list and so you just have to implement
 

3137
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,370
list and so you just have to implement
that and then you implement the logic

3138
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:19,380
that and then you implement the logic
 

3139
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,650
that and then you implement the logic
within and so the the role of the

3140
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:21,660
within and so the the role of the
 

3141
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,089
within and so the the role of the
language here is to provide all the

3142
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:23,099
language here is to provide all the
 

3143
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,569
language here is to provide all the
low-level hooks that allow the author of

3144
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:26,579
low-level hooks that allow the author of
 

3145
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,069
low-level hooks that allow the author of
the type to be able to get and express

3146
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
the type to be able to get and express
 

3147
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,930
the type to be able to get and express
this Behavior without forcing it into

3148
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:29,940
this Behavior without forcing it into
 

3149
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,329
this Behavior without forcing it into
all cases or hard coding this into the

3150
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:32,339
all cases or hard coding this into the
 

3151
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:34,010
all cases or hard coding this into the
language itself but there's a ownership

3152
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:34,020
language itself but there's a ownership
 

3153
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,990
language itself but there's a ownership
So you you're constantly transferring

3154
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,000
So you you're constantly transferring
 

3155
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,490
So you you're constantly transferring
you're tracking who owns the thing yes

3156
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:37,500
you're tracking who owns the thing yes
 

3157
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,630
you're tracking who owns the thing yes
and so there's a whole system called

3158
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:38,640
and so there's a whole system called
 

3159
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,690
and so there's a whole system called
ownership and so this is related to work

3160
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:41,700
ownership and so this is related to work
 

3161
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,910
ownership and so this is related to work
done in the rust Community also the

3162
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:43,920
done in the rust Community also the
 

3163
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,109
done in the rust Community also the
Swift community's done a bunch of work

3164
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:45,119
Swift community's done a bunch of work
 

3165
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,250
Swift community's done a bunch of work
and there's a bunch of different other

3166
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:46,260
and there's a bunch of different other
 

3167
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,109
and there's a bunch of different other
languages that have all kind of C plus

3168
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:48,119
languages that have all kind of C plus
 

3169
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:50,210
languages that have all kind of C plus
plus actually has copy Constructors and

3170
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:50,220
plus actually has copy Constructors and
 

3171
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,849
plus actually has copy Constructors and
destructors and things like that and so

3172
00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:52,859
destructors and things like that and so
 

3173
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:54,349
destructors and things like that and so
um and I mean single spell says

3174
00:53:54,349 --> 00:53:54,359
um and I mean single spell says
 

3175
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:55,549
um and I mean single spell says
everything so it has moved Constructors

3176
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:55,559
everything so it has moved Constructors
 

3177
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,109
everything so it has moved Constructors
it has like this whole world of things

3178
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:57,119
it has like this whole world of things
 

3179
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,890
it has like this whole world of things
and so this is uh this is a body of work

3180
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:00,900
and so this is uh this is a body of work
 

3181
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,329
and so this is uh this is a body of work
that's kind of been developing for many

3182
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:02,339
that's kind of been developing for many
 

3183
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,609
that's kind of been developing for many
many years now and so Mojo takes some of

3184
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:04,619
many years now and so Mojo takes some of
 

3185
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:05,569
many years now and so Mojo takes some of
the best

3186
00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:05,579
the best
 

3187
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,549
the best
ideas out of all these systems and

3188
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:07,559
ideas out of all these systems and
 

3189
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:10,309
ideas out of all these systems and
remixes in a nice way so that you get

3190
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
remixes in a nice way so that you get
 

3191
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,930
remixes in a nice way so that you get
the power of something like the rust

3192
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:11,940
the power of something like the rust
 

3193
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,270
the power of something like the rust
programming language but you don't have

3194
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:14,280
programming language but you don't have
 

3195
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,589
programming language but you don't have
to deal with it when you don't want to

3196
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:15,599
to deal with it when you don't want to
 

3197
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,390
to deal with it when you don't want to
which is a major thing in terms of

3198
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:17,400
which is a major thing in terms of
 

3199
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,710
which is a major thing in terms of
teaching and learning and being able to

3200
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:18,720
teaching and learning and being able to
 

3201
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,349
teaching and learning and being able to
use and scale these systems uh how does

3202
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:21,359
use and scale these systems uh how does
 

3203
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:24,230
use and scale these systems uh how does
that play with argument conventions what

3204
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:24,240
that play with argument conventions what
 

3205
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,910
that play with argument conventions what
are they why are they important how does

3206
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:25,920
are they why are they important how does
 

3207
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,290
are they why are they important how does
the value semantics how does the

3208
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:27,300
the value semantics how does the
 

3209
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,690
the value semantics how does the
transfer ownership uh work with with the

3210
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:29,700
transfer ownership uh work with with the
 

3211
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,829
transfer ownership uh work with with the
arguments when they're passing different

3212
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:30,839
arguments when they're passing different
 

3213
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:33,589
arguments when they're passing different
yeah so so if you go deep into systems

3214
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:33,599
yeah so so if you go deep into systems
 

3215
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,270
yeah so so if you go deep into systems
programming land so this isn't again

3216
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:35,280
programming land so this isn't again
 

3217
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,010
programming land so this isn't again
this is not something for everybody but

3218
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:37,020
this is not something for everybody but
 

3219
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,390
this is not something for everybody but
if you go deep into systems programming

3220
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:38,400
if you go deep into systems programming
 

3221
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,490
if you go deep into systems programming
land what you encounters you encounter

3222
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:40,500
land what you encounters you encounter
 

3223
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,390
land what you encounters you encounter
these types that get weird so if you're

3224
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,400
these types that get weird so if you're
 

3225
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,410
these types that get weird so if you're
used to python you think about

3226
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:45,420
used to python you think about
 

3227
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,630
used to python you think about
everything I could just copy it around I

3228
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:47,640
everything I could just copy it around I
 

3229
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,670
everything I could just copy it around I
can go change it and mutate it and do

3230
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:49,680
can go change it and mutate it and do
 

3231
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,950
can go change it and mutate it and do
these things and it's all cool

3232
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:51,960
these things and it's all cool
 

3233
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,690
these things and it's all cool
um if you get into systems programming

3234
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:53,700
um if you get into systems programming
 

3235
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,490
um if you get into systems programming
land you get into these things like I

3236
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:55,500
land you get into these things like I
 

3237
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,890
land you get into these things like I
have an atomic number or I have a mutex

3238
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:57,900
have an atomic number or I have a mutex
 

3239
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,730
have an atomic number or I have a mutex
or I have a uniquely owned database

3240
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:01,740
or I have a uniquely owned database
 

3241
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,309
or I have a uniquely owned database
handle things like this right so these

3242
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:04,319
handle things like this right so these
 

3243
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,870
handle things like this right so these
types you can't necessarily copy yeah

3244
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:05,880
types you can't necessarily copy yeah
 

3245
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,490
types you can't necessarily copy yeah
sometimes you can't necessarily even

3246
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:07,500
sometimes you can't necessarily even
 

3247
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,349
sometimes you can't necessarily even
move them to a different address

3248
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:09,359
move them to a different address
 

3249
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,750
move them to a different address
and so what Mojo allows you to do is it

3250
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
and so what Mojo allows you to do is it
 

3251
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,849
and so what Mojo allows you to do is it
allows you to express hey I don't want

3252
00:55:13,849 --> 00:55:13,859
allows you to express hey I don't want
 

3253
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:16,309
allows you to express hey I don't want
to get a copy of this thing I want to

3254
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:16,319
to get a copy of this thing I want to
 

3255
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,589
to get a copy of this thing I want to
actually just get a reference to it and

3256
00:55:18,589 --> 00:55:18,599
actually just get a reference to it and
 

3257
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:20,030
actually just get a reference to it and
by doing that what you can say is you

3258
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:20,040
by doing that what you can say is you
 

3259
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,410
by doing that what you can say is you
can say okay if I'm defining something

3260
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:21,420
can say okay if I'm defining something
 

3261
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,410
can say okay if I'm defining something
weird like a atomic number or something

3262
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:24,420
weird like a atomic number or something
 

3263
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,170
weird like a atomic number or something
it's like it has to be so it's an atomic

3264
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:27,180
it's like it has to be so it's an atomic
 

3265
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,870
it's like it has to be so it's an atomic
number is a an area in memory that

3266
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:29,880
number is a an area in memory that
 

3267
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,309
number is a an area in memory that
multiple threads can access at a time

3268
00:55:31,309 --> 00:55:31,319
multiple threads can access at a time
 

3269
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:32,410
multiple threads can access at a time
without synchronous without without

3270
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:32,420
without synchronous without without
 

3271
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:36,650
without synchronous without without
locks right and so uh and so like the

3272
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:36,660
locks right and so uh and so like the
 

3273
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,510
locks right and so uh and so like the
definition of atomic number is multiple

3274
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:38,520
definition of atomic number is multiple
 

3275
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,589
definition of atomic number is multiple
different things have to be poking it

3276
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:39,599
different things have to be poking it
 

3277
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,030
different things have to be poking it
therefore they have to agree on where it

3278
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:41,040
therefore they have to agree on where it
 

3279
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,490
therefore they have to agree on where it
is right so you can't just like move it

3280
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:43,500
is right so you can't just like move it
 

3281
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,109
is right so you can't just like move it
up from underneath one because it kind

3282
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:45,119
up from underneath one because it kind
 

3283
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,030
up from underneath one because it kind
of breaks what what it means and so

3284
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040
of breaks what what it means and so
 

3285
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,290
of breaks what what it means and so
that's that's an example of a type that

3286
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:48,300
that's that's an example of a type that
 

3287
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,089
that's that's an example of a type that
you can't even you can't copy you can't

3288
00:55:50,089 --> 00:55:50,099
you can't even you can't copy you can't
 

3289
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:52,010
you can't even you can't copy you can't
move it like once you create it has to

3290
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:52,020
move it like once you create it has to
 

3291
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,650
move it like once you create it has to
be where it was right now if you look at

3292
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:54,660
be where it was right now if you look at
 

3293
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,750
be where it was right now if you look at
many other examples like a database

3294
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:56,760
many other examples like a database
 

3295
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,410
many other examples like a database
handle right so okay well what happens

3296
00:55:59,410 --> 00:55:59,420
handle right so okay well what happens
 

3297
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,089
handle right so okay well what happens
how do you copy a database handle do you

3298
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:02,099
how do you copy a database handle do you
 

3299
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,530
how do you copy a database handle do you
copy the whole database that's not

3300
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:03,540
copy the whole database that's not
 

3301
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,930
copy the whole database that's not
something you necessarily want to do

3302
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:05,940
something you necessarily want to do
 

3303
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,089
something you necessarily want to do
um the there's a lot of types like that

3304
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:08,099
um the there's a lot of types like that
 

3305
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:10,010
um the there's a lot of types like that
where you want to be able to say that

3306
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:10,020
where you want to be able to say that
 

3307
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,349
where you want to be able to say that
they are uniquely owned and so there's

3308
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:12,359
they are uniquely owned and so there's
 

3309
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:17,270
they are uniquely owned and so there's
always one of this thing and or if if I

3310
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:17,280
always one of this thing and or if if I
 

3311
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,849
always one of this thing and or if if I
create a thing I don't copy it and so

3312
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:19,859
create a thing I don't copy it and so
 

3313
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,470
create a thing I don't copy it and so
what Mojo allows you to do is it allows

3314
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:21,480
what Mojo allows you to do is it allows
 

3315
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,270
what Mojo allows you to do is it allows
you to say hey I want to pass around a

3316
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
you to say hey I want to pass around a
 

3317
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,470
you to say hey I want to pass around a
reference to this thing without copying

3318
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
reference to this thing without copying
 

3319
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,290
reference to this thing without copying
it and so it has borrowed conventions so

3320
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:27,300
it and so it has borrowed conventions so
 

3321
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,870
it and so it has borrowed conventions so
you can say you can use it but you don't

3322
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:29,880
you can say you can use it but you don't
 

3323
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,210
you can say you can use it but you don't
get to change it you can pass it by

3324
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:32,220
get to change it you can pass it by
 

3325
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,130
get to change it you can pass it by
mutable reference and so if you do that

3326
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:34,140
mutable reference and so if you do that
 

3327
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,230
mutable reference and so if you do that
then you can you get a reference to it

3328
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:36,240
then you can you get a reference to it
 

3329
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,510
then you can you get a reference to it
but you can change it and so it manages

3330
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:38,520
but you can change it and so it manages
 

3331
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,910
but you can change it and so it manages
all that kind of stuff so it's uh it's

3332
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:40,920
all that kind of stuff so it's uh it's
 

3333
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,410
all that kind of stuff so it's uh it's
just a really nice implementation of

3334
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:42,420
just a really nice implementation of
 

3335
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,890
just a really nice implementation of
like C plus plus has yeah uh you know

3336
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:45,900
like C plus plus has yeah uh you know
 

3337
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,510
like C plus plus has yeah uh you know
the reference kinds of pointers yeah

3338
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:47,520
the reference kinds of pointers yeah
 

3339
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,670
the reference kinds of pointers yeah
smart smart different different kinds of

3340
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:49,680
smart smart different different kinds of
 

3341
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,230
smart smart different different kinds of
applications and smart pointers that you

3342
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:51,240
applications and smart pointers that you
 

3343
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,510
applications and smart pointers that you
can uh explicitly Define this allows you

3344
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:53,520
can uh explicitly Define this allows you
 

3345
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,670
can uh explicitly Define this allows you
but you're saying that's more like

3346
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
but you're saying that's more like
 

3347
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,530
but you're saying that's more like
um the weird case versus the common case

3348
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:57,540
um the weird case versus the common case
 

3349
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,349
um the weird case versus the common case
well it depends on where I mean I mean I

3350
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:00,359
well it depends on where I mean I mean I
 

3351
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:01,730
well it depends on where I mean I mean I
don't I don't think I'm a normal person

3352
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:01,740
don't I don't think I'm a normal person
 

3353
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,349
don't I don't think I'm a normal person
so yes I mean I'm not one to call other

3354
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:03,359
so yes I mean I'm not one to call other
 

3355
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:04,809
so yes I mean I'm not one to call other
people weird yeah

3356
00:57:04,809 --> 00:57:04,819
people weird yeah
 

3357
00:57:04,819 --> 00:57:08,450
people weird yeah
but the uh uh but you know if you talk

3358
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:08,460
but the uh uh but you know if you talk
 

3359
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,490
but the uh uh but you know if you talk
to a normal python a typical python

3360
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:10,500
to a normal python a typical python
 

3361
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,870
to a normal python a typical python
programmer you're typically not about

3362
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:11,880
programmer you're typically not about
 

3363
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,549
programmer you're typically not about
this right this is a lower level of

3364
00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:13,559
this right this is a lower level of
 

3365
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:14,930
this right this is a lower level of
abstraction now if you talk to a C plus

3366
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:14,940
abstraction now if you talk to a C plus
 

3367
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,549
abstraction now if you talk to a C plus
plus programmer certainly if you talk to

3368
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:16,559
plus programmer certainly if you talk to
 

3369
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,650
plus programmer certainly if you talk to
a rust programmer again they're not

3370
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:18,660
a rust programmer again they're not
 

3371
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,270
a rust programmer again they're not
weird they're delightful like these are

3372
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:20,280
weird they're delightful like these are
 

3373
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,950
weird they're delightful like these are
all good people right

3374
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:21,960
all good people right
 

3375
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,270
all good people right
um those those folks will think about

3376
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
um those those folks will think about
 

3377
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,410
um those those folks will think about
all the time

3378
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:24,420
all the time
 

3379
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,510
all the time
right and so I look at this as there's a

3380
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:26,520
right and so I look at this as there's a
 

3381
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,849
right and so I look at this as there's a
spectrum between very deep low-level

3382
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:28,859
spectrum between very deep low-level
 

3383
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:30,410
spectrum between very deep low-level
systems I'm going to go poke the bits

3384
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:30,420
systems I'm going to go poke the bits
 

3385
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:31,670
systems I'm going to go poke the bits
and care about how they're laid out in

3386
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:31,680
and care about how they're laid out in
 

3387
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,250
and care about how they're laid out in
memory all the way up to application and

3388
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:34,260
memory all the way up to application and
 

3389
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,870
memory all the way up to application and
scripting and other things like this and

3390
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:35,880
scripting and other things like this and
 

3391
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,609
scripting and other things like this and
so it's not that anybody's right or

3392
00:57:37,609 --> 00:57:37,619
so it's not that anybody's right or
 

3393
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:39,230
so it's not that anybody's right or
wrong it's about how do we build

3394
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:39,240
wrong it's about how do we build
 

3395
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,089
wrong it's about how do we build
one system that scales

3396
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:41,099
one system that scales
 

3397
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:44,329
one system that scales
by the way the the idea of an atomic

3398
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:44,339
by the way the the idea of an atomic
 

3399
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:46,250
by the way the the idea of an atomic
number has been something that always

3400
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:46,260
number has been something that always
 

3401
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:50,870
number has been something that always
brought me deep happiness because

3402
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:50,880
brought me deep happiness because
 

3403
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,849
brought me deep happiness because
the flip side of that the the idea that

3404
00:57:55,849 --> 00:57:55,859
the flip side of that the the idea that
 

3405
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:58,970
the flip side of that the the idea that
threads can just modify stuff

3406
00:57:58,970 --> 00:57:58,980
threads can just modify stuff
 

3407
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,650
threads can just modify stuff
um

3408
00:57:59,650 --> 00:57:59,660
um
 

3409
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,030
um
asynchronously it's the whole idea of

3410
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:02,040
asynchronously it's the whole idea of
 

3411
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:03,770
asynchronously it's the whole idea of
concurrent programming is a source of

3412
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:03,780
concurrent programming is a source of
 

3413
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,990
concurrent programming is a source of
infinite stress for me well so this is

3414
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:06,000
infinite stress for me well so this is
 

3415
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,210
infinite stress for me well so this is
where you jump into

3416
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:08,220
where you jump into
 

3417
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,549
where you jump into
um you know again you zoom out and get

3418
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:10,559
um you know again you zoom out and get
 

3419
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,049
um you know again you zoom out and get
out of program languages or compilers

3420
00:58:12,049 --> 00:58:12,059
out of program languages or compilers
 

3421
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,870
out of program languages or compilers
and just look what the industry has done

3422
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:13,880
and just look what the industry has done
 

3423
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,309
and just look what the industry has done
my mind is constantly blown by this

3424
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:16,319
my mind is constantly blown by this
 

3425
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,770
my mind is constantly blown by this
right and you look at what you know

3426
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:18,780
right and you look at what you know
 

3427
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,170
right and you look at what you know
Moore's Law Moore's law has this idea

3428
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:21,180
Moore's Law Moore's law has this idea
 

3429
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,849
Moore's Law Moore's law has this idea
that like computers for a long time

3430
00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:22,859
that like computers for a long time
 

3431
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:24,710
that like computers for a long time
single thread performance just got

3432
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
single thread performance just got
 

3433
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,030
single thread performance just got

but then physics and other things

3438
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:29,819
but then physics and other things
 

3439
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:31,910
but then physics and other things
intervened in power consumption like

3440
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
intervened in power consumption like
 

3441
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,349
intervened in power consumption like
other things started to matter and so

3442
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359
other things started to matter and so
 

3443
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,910
other things started to matter and so
what ended up happening is we went from

3444
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:34,920
what ended up happening is we went from
 

3445
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,609
what ended up happening is we went from
single Core computers to multi-core then

3446
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:37,619
single Core computers to multi-core then
 

3447
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:39,589
single Core computers to multi-core then
we went to accelerators right this this

3448
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:39,599
we went to accelerators right this this
 

3449
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,270
we went to accelerators right this this
trend towards specialization of Hardware

3450
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
trend towards specialization of Hardware
 

3451
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,170
trend towards specialization of Hardware
is only going to continue and so for

3452
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:45,180
is only going to continue and so for
 

3453
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,870
is only going to continue and so for
years us programming language nerds and

3454
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:47,880
years us programming language nerds and
 

3455
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,430
years us programming language nerds and
compiler people have been saying okay

3456
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,440
compiler people have been saying okay
 

3457
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,770
compiler people have been saying okay
well how do we tackle multi-core right

3458
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:51,780
well how do we tackle multi-core right
 

3459
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,329
well how do we tackle multi-core right
for a while it was like multi-core is

3460
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:53,339
for a while it was like multi-core is
 

3461
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:54,589
for a while it was like multi-core is
the future we have to get on top of this

3462
00:58:54,589 --> 00:58:54,599
the future we have to get on top of this
 

3463
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,510
the future we have to get on top of this
thing and then it was multi-cores to

3464
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:56,520
thing and then it was multi-cores to
 

3465
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,650
thing and then it was multi-cores to
default what are we doing with this

3466
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:57,660
default what are we doing with this
 

3467
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,870
default what are we doing with this
thing and that is like there's chips

3468
00:58:59,870 --> 00:58:59,880
thing and that is like there's chips
 

3469
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,730
thing and that is like there's chips
with hundreds of cores in them what

3470
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:01,740
with hundreds of cores in them what
 

3471
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,549
with hundreds of cores in them what
happened right yeah and so

3472
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:04,559
happened right yeah and so
 

3473
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,069
happened right yeah and so
I'm super inspired by the fact that you

3474
00:59:07,069 --> 00:59:07,079
I'm super inspired by the fact that you
 

3475
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:08,990
I'm super inspired by the fact that you
know in the face of this you know those

3476
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:09,000
know in the face of this you know those
 

3477
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,150
know in the face of this you know those
machine learning people invented this

3478
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:11,160
machine learning people invented this
 

3479
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,789
machine learning people invented this
idea of a tensor right and was it tensor

3480
00:59:13,789 --> 00:59:13,799
idea of a tensor right and was it tensor
 

3481
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:15,589
idea of a tensor right and was it tensor
a tensor is an

3482
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:15,599
a tensor is an
 

3483
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,170
a tensor is an
like an arithmetic and algebraic concept

3484
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:18,180
like an arithmetic and algebraic concept
 

3485
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,450
like an arithmetic and algebraic concept
it's like an abstraction around a

3486
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:20,460
it's like an abstraction around a
 

3487
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:24,230
it's like an abstraction around a
gigantic paralyzable data set right and

3488
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:24,240
gigantic paralyzable data set right and
 

3489
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,490
gigantic paralyzable data set right and
because of that and because of things

3490
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:25,500
because of that and because of things
 

3491
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,289
because of that and because of things
like tensorflow and pytorch we're able

3492
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:27,299
like tensorflow and pytorch we're able
 

3493
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:30,109
like tensorflow and pytorch we're able
to say okay we'll Express the math

3494
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:30,119
to say okay we'll Express the math
 

3495
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:32,450
to say okay we'll Express the math
of the system this enables you to do

3496
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:32,460
of the system this enables you to do
 

3497
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,130
of the system this enables you to do
automatic differentiations enables you

3498
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:34,140
automatic differentiations enables you
 

3499
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,410
automatic differentiations enables you
do like all these cool things

3500
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:36,420
do like all these cool things
 

3501
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,690
do like all these cool things
um and and it's it's an abstract

3502
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:38,700
um and and it's it's an abstract
 

3503
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,490
um and and it's it's an abstract
representation well because you have

3504
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:40,500
representation well because you have
 

3505
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,990
representation well because you have
that abstract representation you can now

3506
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:42,000
that abstract representation you can now
 

3507
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,549
that abstract representation you can now
map it onto these parallel machines

3508
00:59:43,549 --> 00:59:43,559
map it onto these parallel machines
 

3509
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:45,650
map it onto these parallel machines
without having to

3510
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:45,660
without having to
 

3511
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,510
without having to
um control okay put that right here put

3512
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
um control okay put that right here put
 

3513
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,710
um control okay put that right here put
that right there put that right there

3514
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:48,720
that right there put that right there
 

3515
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,690
that right there put that right there
and this has enabled an explosion in

3516
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:50,700
and this has enabled an explosion in
 

3517
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,690
and this has enabled an explosion in
terms of AI compute accelerators like

3518
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:53,700
terms of AI compute accelerators like
 

3519
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,730
terms of AI compute accelerators like
all the stuff and so that's super super

3520
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:55,740
all the stuff and so that's super super
 

3521
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,309
all the stuff and so that's super super
exciting what about the the deployment

3522
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319
exciting what about the the deployment
 

3523
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,410
exciting what about the the deployment
the execution across multiple machines

3524
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:00,420
the execution across multiple machines
 

3525
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:04,609
the execution across multiple machines
so uh you write that the modular compute

3526
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:04,619
so uh you write that the modular compute
 

3527
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:06,829
so uh you write that the modular compute

really interesting
um tensions so there's a whole bunch of

3554
01:00:35,329 --> 01:00:35,339
um tensions so there's a whole bunch of
 

3555
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:37,250
um tensions so there's a whole bunch of
stuff that goes into that I'll pick a

3556
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:37,260
stuff that goes into that I'll pick a
 

3557
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,710
stuff that goes into that I'll pick a
random walkthrough uh if you if you go

3558
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:39,720
random walkthrough uh if you if you go
 

3559
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,569
random walkthrough uh if you if you go
back and replay the history of machine

3560
01:00:41,569 --> 01:00:41,579
back and replay the history of machine
 

3561
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:43,549
back and replay the history of machine
learning right I mean the brief the

3562
01:00:43,549 --> 01:00:43,559
learning right I mean the brief the
 

3563
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:44,750
learning right I mean the brief the
brief most recent history of machine

3564
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:44,760
brief most recent history of machine
 

3565
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,010

very deep I I knew Lex when he had an AI

3568
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:49,619
very deep I I knew Lex when he had an AI
 

3569

podcast yes

3570
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:51,720
podcast yes
 

3571
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,549
podcast yes
right yeah

3572
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:54,559
right yeah
 

3573
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:57,289
right yeah
so uh so if you look at just tensorflow

3574
01:00:57,289 --> 01:00:57,299
so uh so if you look at just tensorflow
 

3575
01:00:57,299 --> 01:00:58,549
so uh so if you look at just tensorflow
and Pie George which is pretty recent

3576
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:58,559
and Pie George which is pretty recent
 

3577
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,890
and Pie George which is pretty recent
history in the big picture right but

3578
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:00,900
history in the big picture right but
 

3579
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,829
history in the big picture right but
tensorflow is all about graphs pie torch

3580
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:03,839
tensorflow is all about graphs pie torch
 

3581
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,109
tensorflow is all about graphs pie torch
I think pretty unarguably ended up

3582
01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:06,119
I think pretty unarguably ended up
 

3583
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:08,030
I think pretty unarguably ended up
winning and why did It win mostly

3584
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:08,040
winning and why did It win mostly
 

3585
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,470
winning and why did It win mostly
because of usability

3586
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:09,480
because of usability
 

3587
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,569
because of usability
right and the usability of pie torches I

3588
01:01:11,569 --> 01:01:11,579
right and the usability of pie torches I
 

3589
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:13,010
right and the usability of pie torches I
think huge and I think again that's a

3590
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:13,020
think huge and I think again that's a
 

3591
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,890
think huge and I think again that's a
huge Testament to the power of taking

3592
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:15,900
huge Testament to the power of taking
 

3593
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,410
huge Testament to the power of taking
abstract theoretical technical Concepts

3594
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:18,420
abstract theoretical technical Concepts
 

3595
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,049
abstract theoretical technical Concepts

and bring it to the masses right now the
 

3597
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:23,569
and bring it to the masses right now the
challenge with what the tensorflow

3598
01:01:23,569 --> 01:01:23,579
challenge with what the tensorflow
 

3599
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,150
challenge with what the tensorflow
versus the pie George

3600
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:25,160
versus the pie George
 

3601
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,970
versus the pie George
design points was that tensorflows kind

3602
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:28,980
design points was that tensorflows kind
 

3603
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,410
design points was that tensorflows kind
of difficult to use for researchers but

3604
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:30,420
of difficult to use for researchers but
 

3605
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,250
of difficult to use for researchers but
it was actually pretty good for

3606
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:31,260
it was actually pretty good for
 

3607
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,210
it was actually pretty good for
deployment

3608
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:32,220
deployment
 

3609
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,950
deployment
pytorch is really good for researchers

3610
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:33,960
pytorch is really good for researchers
 

3611
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,329
pytorch is really good for researchers
it kind of not super great for

3612
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:35,339
it kind of not super great for
 

3613
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:38,030
it kind of not super great for
deployment right and so I think the we

3614
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:38,040
deployment right and so I think the we
 

3615
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,430
deployment right and so I think the we
as an industry have been struggling and

3616
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:40,440
as an industry have been struggling and
 

3617
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,230
as an industry have been struggling and
if you look at what deploying a machine

3618
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240
if you look at what deploying a machine
 

3619
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,150
if you look at what deploying a machine
learning model today means is that

3620
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:44,160
learning model today means is that
 

3621
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,430
learning model today means is that
you'll have researchers who are I mean

3622
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:46,440
you'll have researchers who are I mean
 

3623
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,870
you'll have researchers who are I mean
Wicked smart of course but they're

3624
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:47,880
Wicked smart of course but they're
 

3625
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,690
Wicked smart of course but they're
Wicked smart at model architecture and

3626
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:50,700
Wicked smart at model architecture and
 

3627
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,870
Wicked smart at model architecture and
data and calculus and like all like

3628
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:53,880
data and calculus and like all like
 

3629
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,430
data and calculus and like all like
they're Wicked Smart in various domains

3630
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:55,440
they're Wicked Smart in various domains
 

3631
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,750
they're Wicked Smart in various domains
they don't want to know anything about

3632
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:56,760
they don't want to know anything about
 

3633
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,549
they don't want to know anything about
the hardware deployment or C plus plus

3634
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559
the hardware deployment or C plus plus
 

3635
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,049
the hardware deployment or C plus plus
or things like this right and so what's

3636
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:00,059
or things like this right and so what's
 

3637
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:01,789
or things like this right and so what's
happened is you get people who train the

3638
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:01,799
happened is you get people who train the
 

3639
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:03,710
happened is you get people who train the
model they throw over throw it over the

3640
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:03,720
model they throw over throw it over the
 

3641
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,690
model they throw over throw it over the
fence and they have people that try to

3642
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:05,700
fence and they have people that try to
 

3643
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,230
fence and they have people that try to
deploy the model

3644
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240
deploy the model
 

3645
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,690
deploy the model
well every time you have a team a does X

3646
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:11,700
well every time you have a team a does X
 

3647
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,549
well every time you have a team a does X
they throw it over the fence and team y

3648
01:02:13,549 --> 01:02:13,559
they throw it over the fence and team y
 

3649
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:17,390
they throw it over the fence and team y
does some Team B does y like you have a

3650
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:17,400
does some Team B does y like you have a
 

3651
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,370
does some Team B does y like you have a
problem because of course it never works

3652
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:19,380
problem because of course it never works
 

3653
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,530
problem because of course it never works
the first time and so you throw over the

3654
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:21,540
the first time and so you throw over the
 

3655
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,450
the first time and so you throw over the
fence they figure out okay it's too slow

3656
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:23,460
fence they figure out okay it's too slow
 

3657
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,670
fence they figure out okay it's too slow
it won't fit doesn't use the right

3658
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:25,680
it won't fit doesn't use the right
 

3659
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:29,510
it won't fit doesn't use the right
operator the tool crashes whatever the

3660
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,520
operator the tool crashes whatever the
 

3661
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,069
operator the tool crashes whatever the
problem is then they have to throw it

3662
01:02:31,069 --> 01:02:31,079
problem is then they have to throw it
 

3663
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:32,390
problem is then they have to throw it
back over the fence

3664
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:32,400
back over the fence
 

3665
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,849
back over the fence
and every time you throw a thing over a

3666
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:34,859
and every time you throw a thing over a
 

3667
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:35,990
and every time you throw a thing over a
fence it takes three weeks of project

3668
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:36,000
fence it takes three weeks of project
 

3669
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,670
fence it takes three weeks of project
managers and meetings and things like

3670
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
managers and meetings and things like
 

3671
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,069
managers and meetings and things like
this and so what we've seen today is

3672
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:40,079
this and so what we've seen today is
 

3673
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,950
this and so what we've seen today is
getting models in production can take

3674
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:41,960
getting models in production can take
 

3675
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,630
getting models in production can take
weeks or months like it's not atypical

3676
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:44,640
weeks or months like it's not atypical
 

3677
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,190
weeks or months like it's not atypical
right I talk to lots of people and you

3678
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:46,200
right I talk to lots of people and you
 

3679
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,589
right I talk to lots of people and you
talk about like VP of software some

3680
01:02:48,589 --> 01:02:48,599
talk about like VP of software some
 

3681
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:50,089
talk about like VP of software some
internet company trying to deploy a

3682
01:02:50,089 --> 01:02:50,099
internet company trying to deploy a
 

3683
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,650
internet company trying to deploy a
model and they're like why do I need a

3684
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:51,660
model and they're like why do I need a
 

3685
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,510
model and they're like why do I need a
team of 45 people

3686
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:53,520
team of 45 people
 

3687
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,970
team of 45 people
okay it's so easy to train a model why

3688
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:55,980
okay it's so easy to train a model why
 

3689
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,609
okay it's so easy to train a model why
why can't I deploy it right and if you

3690
01:02:58,609 --> 01:02:58,619
why can't I deploy it right and if you
 

3691
01:02:58,619 --> 01:02:59,870
why can't I deploy it right and if you
dig into this

3692
01:02:59,870 --> 01:02:59,880
dig into this
 

3693
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,210
dig into this
every layer is problematic so if you

3694
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:02,220
every layer is problematic so if you
 

3695
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,190
every layer is problematic so if you
look at the language piece I mean this

3696
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:04,200
look at the language piece I mean this
 

3697
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,049
look at the language piece I mean this
is tip of the iceberg it's a very

3698
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:06,059
is tip of the iceberg it's a very
 

3699
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:07,609
is tip of the iceberg it's a very
exciting tip of the iceberg for folks

3700
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:07,619
exciting tip of the iceberg for folks
 

3701
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:09,890
exciting tip of the iceberg for folks
but you've got python on one side and C

3702
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:09,900
but you've got python on one side and C
 

3703
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,750
but you've got python on one side and C
plus plus on the other side python

3704
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:11,760
plus plus on the other side python
 

3705
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,910
plus plus on the other side python
doesn't really deploy I mean it can

3706
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:13,920
doesn't really deploy I mean it can
 

3707
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,530
doesn't really deploy I mean it can
theoretically technically in some cases

3708
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:15,540
theoretically technically in some cases
 

3709
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,450
theoretically technically in some cases
but often a lot of production teams will

3710
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:17,460
but often a lot of production teams will
 

3711
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,890
but often a lot of production teams will
want to get things out of python because

3712
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:18,900
want to get things out of python because
 

3713
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,270
want to get things out of python because
they get their performance and control

3714
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:20,280
they get their performance and control
 

3715
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,609
they get their performance and control
and whatever else so Mojo can help with

3716
01:03:22,609 --> 01:03:22,619
and whatever else so Mojo can help with
 

3717
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:23,690
and whatever else so Mojo can help with
that

3718
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:23,700
that
 

3719
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:26,270
that
if you look at serving so you talk about

3720
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:26,280
if you look at serving so you talk about
 

3721
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,549
if you look at serving so you talk about
gigantic models well a gigantic model

3722
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:28,559
gigantic models well a gigantic model
 

3723
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,770
gigantic models well a gigantic model
won't fit on one machine

3724
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:30,780
won't fit on one machine
 

3725
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,690
won't fit on one machine
right and so now you have this model

3726
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:32,700
right and so now you have this model
 

3727
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,970
right and so now you have this model
it's written in Python it has to be

3728
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:34,980
it's written in Python it has to be
 

3729
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,829
it's written in Python it has to be
Rewritten in C plus plus now it also has

3730
01:03:36,829 --> 01:03:36,839
Rewritten in C plus plus now it also has
 

3731
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:38,690
Rewritten in C plus plus now it also has
to be carved up so that half of it runs

3732
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:38,700
to be carved up so that half of it runs
 

3733
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,829
to be carved up so that half of it runs
on one machine half of it runs on

3734
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
on one machine half of it runs on
 

3735
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,289
on one machine half of it runs on
another machine or maybe it runs on 10

3736
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:42,299
another machine or maybe it runs on 10
 

3737
01:03:42,299 --> 01:03:43,370
another machine or maybe it runs on 10
machines

3738
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:43,380
machines
 

3739
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,589
machines
well so now suddenly the complexity is

3740
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:45,599
well so now suddenly the complexity is
 

3741
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,530
well so now suddenly the complexity is
exploding right and the reason for this

3742
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:48,540
exploding right and the reason for this
 

3743
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,849
exploding right and the reason for this
is that if you if you look into

3744
01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:49,859
is that if you if you look into
 

3745
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:52,730
is that if you if you look into
tensorflow pytorch these systems they

3746
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:52,740
tensorflow pytorch these systems they
 

3747
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,589
tensorflow pytorch these systems they
weren't really designed for this world

3748
01:03:54,589 --> 01:03:54,599
weren't really designed for this world
 

3749
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:56,630
weren't really designed for this world
right they're designed for you know back

3750
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
right they're designed for you know back
 

3751
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,609
right they're designed for you know back
in the day when we were starting and

3752
01:03:58,609 --> 01:03:58,619
in the day when we were starting and
 

3753
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:00,829
in the day when we were starting and
doing things where it was a different

3754
01:04:00,829 --> 01:04:00,839
doing things where it was a different
 

3755
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:02,750
doing things where it was a different
much simpler world like you want to run

3756
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:02,760
much simpler world like you want to run
 

3757
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,609
much simpler world like you want to run
resnet 50 or some ancient model

3758
01:04:04,609 --> 01:04:04,619
resnet 50 or some ancient model
 

3759
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:07,010
resnet 50 or some ancient model
architecture like this it was just a it

3760
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:07,020
architecture like this it was just a it
 

3761
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,690
architecture like this it was just a it
was a completely different world trained

3762
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:08,700
was a completely different world trained
 

3763
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,990
was a completely different world trained
on one GPU exactly doing

3764
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:11,000
on one GPU exactly doing
 

3765
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,430
on one GPU exactly doing
yeah now it's not right in the major

3766
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:13,440
yeah now it's not right in the major
 

3767
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,470
yeah now it's not right in the major
breakthrough and

3768
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:15,480
breakthrough and
 

3769
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,069
breakthrough and
um

3770
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:16,079
um
 

3771
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,990
um
and the world has changed right and so

3772
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:18,000
and the world has changed right and so
 

3773
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,270
and the world has changed right and so
now the challenge is that tensorflow Pi

3774
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:20,280
now the challenge is that tensorflow Pi
 

3775
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,170
now the challenge is that tensorflow Pi
towards these systems they weren't

3776
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:21,180
towards these systems they weren't
 

3777
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,210
towards these systems they weren't
actually designed for llm so like that

3778
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:23,220
actually designed for llm so like that
 

3779
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,730
actually designed for llm so like that
was not that was not a thing and so what

3780
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:25,740
was not that was not a thing and so what
 

3781
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,410
was not that was not a thing and so what
where tensile actually has amazing power

3782
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:27,420
where tensile actually has amazing power
 

3783
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,270
where tensile actually has amazing power
in terms of scale and deployment and

3784
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:29,280
in terms of scale and deployment and
 

3785
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,490
in terms of scale and deployment and
things like that and I think Google is

3786
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:31,500
things like that and I think Google is
 

3787
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,109
things like that and I think Google is
I mean maybe not unmatched but they're

3788
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:33,119
I mean maybe not unmatched but they're
 

3789
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,430
I mean maybe not unmatched but they're
like incredible in terms of their

3790
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:34,440
like incredible in terms of their
 

3791
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,130
like incredible in terms of their
capabilities and gigantic scale

3792
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:37,140
capabilities and gigantic scale
 

3793
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:40,549
capabilities and gigantic scale
um many researchers using pytorch right

3794
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:40,559
um many researchers using pytorch right
 

3795
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,049
um many researchers using pytorch right
and so pytorch doesn't have those same

3796
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:42,059
and so pytorch doesn't have those same
 

3797
01:04:42,059 --> 01:04:43,670
and so pytorch doesn't have those same
capabilities and so what modular can do

3798
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:43,680
capabilities and so what modular can do
 

3799
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,289
capabilities and so what modular can do
is it can help with that now if you take

3800
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:45,299
is it can help with that now if you take
 

3801
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:47,329
is it can help with that now if you take
a step back and say like what is modular

3802
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:47,339
a step back and say like what is modular
 

3803
01:04:47,339 --> 01:04:50,210
a step back and say like what is modular
doing right so modular has like a

3804
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:50,220
doing right so modular has like a
 

3805
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,730
doing right so modular has like a
a bitter enemy they were fighting

3806
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:52,740
a bitter enemy they were fighting
 

3807
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,770
a bitter enemy they were fighting
against in the industry and it's one of

3808
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:54,780
against in the industry and it's one of
 

3809
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,930
against in the industry and it's one of
these things where everybody knows it

3810
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:56,940
these things where everybody knows it
 

3811
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:59,870
these things where everybody knows it
but nobody is usually willing to talk

3812
01:04:59,870 --> 01:04:59,880
but nobody is usually willing to talk
 

3813
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,109
but nobody is usually willing to talk
about it the bitter enemy The Bitter

3814
01:05:03,109 --> 01:05:03,119
about it the bitter enemy The Bitter
 

3815
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,150
about it the bitter enemy The Bitter
thing that we have to destroy that we're

3816
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:05,160
thing that we have to destroy that we're
 

3817
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,470
thing that we have to destroy that we're
all struggling with and it's like all

3818
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
all struggling with and it's like all
 

3819
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,670
all struggling with and it's like all
around it's like fish can't see water

3820
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,680
around it's like fish can't see water
 

3821
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,710
around it's like fish can't see water
it's complexity

3822
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:09,720
it's complexity
 

3823
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,030
it's complexity
sure yes

3824
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:11,040
sure yes
 

3825
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,829
sure yes
complexity right that was very

3826
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:12,839
complexity right that was very
 

3827
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:14,289
complexity right that was very
philosophical

3828
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:14,299
philosophical
 

3829
01:05:14,299 --> 01:05:17,630
philosophical
and so if you look at it yes it is on

3830
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:17,640
and so if you look at it yes it is on
 

3831
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,490
and so if you look at it yes it is on
the hardware side yes all these all

3832
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:19,500
the hardware side yes all these all
 

3833
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,870
the hardware side yes all these all
these accelerators all these software

3834
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:20,880
these accelerators all these software
 

3835
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,609
these accelerators all these software
Stacks that go with the accelerator all

3836
01:05:22,609 --> 01:05:22,619
Stacks that go with the accelerator all
 

3837
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,650
Stacks that go with the accelerator all
these like this massive complexity over

3838
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:24,660
these like this massive complexity over
 

3839
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,089
these like this massive complexity over
there you look at

3840
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:26,099
there you look at
 

3841
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:28,089
there you look at
what's happening on the modeling side

3842
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:28,099
what's happening on the modeling side
 

3843
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:30,170
what's happening on the modeling side
massive amount of complexity like things

3844
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:30,180
massive amount of complexity like things
 

3845
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,190
massive amount of complexity like things
are changing all the time people are

3846
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
are changing all the time people are
 

3847
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,230
are changing all the time people are
inventing turns out the research is not

3848
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:33,240
inventing turns out the research is not
 

3849
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:34,250
inventing turns out the research is not
done

3850
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:34,260
done
 

3851
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,690
done
right and so people want to be able to

3852
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:35,700
right and so people want to be able to
 

3853
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:38,089
right and so people want to be able to
move fast Transformers are amazing but

3854
01:05:38,089 --> 01:05:38,099
move fast Transformers are amazing but
 

3855
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:39,829
move fast Transformers are amazing but
there's a ton of diversity even within

3856
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:39,839
there's a ton of diversity even within
 

3857
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,030
there's a ton of diversity even within
Transformers and what's the next

3858
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:41,040
Transformers and what's the next
 

3859
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,549
Transformers and what's the next
Transformer right and you look into

3860
01:05:43,549 --> 01:05:43,559
Transformer right and you look into
 

3861
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:46,670
Transformer right and you look into
serving also huge amounts of complexity

3862
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:46,680

3863
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:48,230
serving also huge amounts of complexity
it turns out that all the cloud

3864
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:48,240
it turns out that all the cloud
 

3865
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,630
it turns out that all the cloud

using that you look at classical serving

3874
01:05:58,849 --> 01:05:58,859
using that you look at classical serving
 

3875
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:00,530
using that you look at classical serving

principle's approach to this and so what

3900
01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:24,359
principle's approach to this and so what
 

3901
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,750
principle's approach to this and so what
modular is doing is we're saying okay

01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:35,220
like are worked on pytorch core we've
 

3911
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:37,010
like are worked on pytorch core we've
worked on onyx one time we've worked on

3912
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:37,020
worked on onyx one time we've worked on
 

3913
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:39,430
worked on onyx one time we've worked on
many of these other systems and so the

3914
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:39,440
many of these other systems and so the
 

3915
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,990
many of these other systems and so the
systems like the Apple accelerators and

3916
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,000
systems like the Apple accelerators and
 

3917
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,150
systems like the Apple accelerators and
all that kind of stuff like our team is

3918
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:44,160
all that kind of stuff like our team is
 

3919
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,370
all that kind of stuff like our team is
quite amazing and so one of the things

3920
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:46,380
quite amazing and so one of the things
 

3921
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:48,710
quite amazing and so one of the things
that roughly everybody modular is grumpy

3922
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:48,720
that roughly everybody modular is grumpy
 

3923
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,750
that roughly everybody modular is grumpy
about is that when you're working on one

3924
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:50,760
about is that when you're working on one
 

3925
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,970
about is that when you're working on one
of these projects you have a first order

3926
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:52,980
of these projects you have a first order
 

3927
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,170
of these projects you have a first order
goal

3928
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:54,180
goal
 

3929
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,210
goal
get the hardware to work get the system

3930
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:56,220
get the hardware to work get the system
 

3931
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,370
get the hardware to work get the system
to enable one more model get this

3932
01:06:58,370 --> 01:06:58,380
to enable one more model get this
 

3933
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:00,529
to enable one more model get this
product out the door enable the specific

3934
01:07:00,529 --> 01:07:00,539
product out the door enable the specific
 

3935
01:07:00,539 --> 01:07:02,870
product out the door enable the specific
workload or make it solve this problem

3936
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:02,880
workload or make it solve this problem
 

3937
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,210
workload or make it solve this problem
for this this product team right and

3938
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:05,220
for this this product team right and
 

3939
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,529
for this this product team right and
nobody's been given a chance to actually

3940
01:07:06,529 --> 01:07:06,539
nobody's been given a chance to actually
 

3941
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:08,630
nobody's been given a chance to actually
do that step back and so we as an

3942
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:08,640
do that step back and so we as an
 

3943
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,770
do that step back and so we as an
industry we didn't take two steps

3944
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:09,780
industry we didn't take two steps
 

3945
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:12,710
industry we didn't take two steps
forward we took like 18 steps forward in

3946
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
forward we took like 18 steps forward in
 

3947
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,029
forward we took like 18 steps forward in
terms of all this really cool technology

3948
01:07:14,029 --> 01:07:14,039
terms of all this really cool technology
 

3949
01:07:14,039 --> 01:07:15,710
terms of all this really cool technology
across compilers and systems and

3950
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:15,720
across compilers and systems and
 

3951
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,569
across compilers and systems and
runtimes and heterogeneous Computing

3952
01:07:17,569 --> 01:07:17,579
runtimes and heterogeneous Computing
 

3953
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:18,890
runtimes and heterogeneous Computing
like all this kind of stuff and like all

3954
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:18,900
like all this kind of stuff and like all
 

3955
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,349
like all this kind of stuff and like all
this technology has been you know I

3956
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
this technology has been you know I
 

3957
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,510
this technology has been you know I
wouldn't say uh beautifully designed but

3958
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,520
wouldn't say uh beautifully designed but
 

3959
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,430
wouldn't say uh beautifully designed but
it's been proven in different quadrants

3960
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:25,440
it's been proven in different quadrants
 

3961
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,109
it's been proven in different quadrants
like you know you look at Google with

3962
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:27,119
like you know you look at Google with
 

3963
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,370
like you know you look at Google with
tpus massive huge exaflops of compute

3964
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:31,380
tpus massive huge exaflops of compute
 

3965
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,650
tpus massive huge exaflops of compute
strapped together into machines that

3966
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:33,660
strapped together into machines that
 

3967
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,870
strapped together into machines that
researchers are programming in Python in

3968
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:35,880
researchers are programming in Python in
 

3969
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,630
researchers are programming in Python in
a notebook that's huge that's amazing

3970
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:38,640
a notebook that's huge that's amazing
 

3971
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,309
a notebook that's huge that's amazing
that's incredible right it's incredible

3972
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:40,319
that's incredible right it's incredible
 

3973
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,690
that's incredible right it's incredible
and so you look at the technology that

3974
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:41,700
and so you look at the technology that
 

3975
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,630
and so you look at the technology that
goes into that and the the algorithms

3976
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:44,640
goes into that and the the algorithms
 

3977
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,890
goes into that and the the algorithms
were actually quite General

3978
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:45,900
were actually quite General
 

3979
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,589
were actually quite General
and so lots of other Hardware out there

3980
01:07:48,589 --> 01:07:48,599
and so lots of other Hardware out there
 

3981
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:50,150
and so lots of other Hardware out there
and lots of other teams out there don't

3982
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:50,160
and lots of other teams out there don't
 

3983
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:51,710
and lots of other teams out there don't
have the sophistication or that maybe

3984
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:51,720
have the sophistication or that maybe
 

3985
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:54,410
have the sophistication or that maybe
the the years working on it or the the

3986
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:54,420
the the years working on it or the the
 

3987
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,910
the the years working on it or the the
budget or whatever that Google does

3988
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:55,920
budget or whatever that Google does
 

3989
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,829
budget or whatever that Google does
right and so they should be getting

3990
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:57,839
right and so they should be getting
 

3991
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,510
right and so they should be getting
access to same algorithms but they just

3992
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520
access to same algorithms but they just
 

3993
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,589
access to same algorithms but they just
don't have that right that's what

3994
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:00,599
don't have that right that's what
 

3995
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:02,930
don't have that right that's what
modular's doing is we're saying

3996
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:02,940
modular's doing is we're saying
 

3997
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,150
modular's doing is we're saying
cool this is not research anymore like

3998
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:05,160
cool this is not research anymore like
 

3999
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,250
cool this is not research anymore like
we've we've built Auto tuning in many

4000
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:07,260
we've we've built Auto tuning in many
 

4001
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,990
we've we've built Auto tuning in many
systems we've built programming

4002
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:09,000
systems we've built programming
 

4003
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,210
systems we've built programming
languages right and so like have have

4004
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:11,220
languages right and so like have have
 

4005
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,829
languages right and so like have have
you know implemented C plus plus I've

4006
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:12,839
you know implemented C plus plus I've
 

4007
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,210
you know implemented C plus plus I've
implemented Swift I've implemented many

4008
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:14,220
implemented Swift I've implemented many
 

4009
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,430
implemented Swift I've implemented many
of these things and so you know this

4010
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:16,440
of these things and so you know this
 

4011
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:20,269
of these things and so you know this
it's hard but it's not research and you

4012
01:08:20,269 --> 01:08:20,279
it's hard but it's not research and you
 

4013
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:22,130
it's hard but it's not research and you
look at accelerators well we know

4014
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:22,140
look at accelerators well we know
 

4015
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,169
look at accelerators well we know
there's a bunch of different weird kind

4016
01:08:24,169 --> 01:08:24,179
there's a bunch of different weird kind
 

4017
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:25,430
there's a bunch of different weird kind
of accelerators but they actually

4018
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:25,440
of accelerators but they actually
 

4019
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:27,890
of accelerators but they actually
cluster together right and you look at

4020
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:27,900
cluster together right and you look at
 

4021
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,450
cluster together right and you look at
gpus well there's a couple of major

4022
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:29,460
gpus well there's a couple of major
 

4023
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,729
gpus well there's a couple of major
vendors of gpus and they maybe don't

4024
01:08:31,729 --> 01:08:31,739
vendors of gpus and they maybe don't
 

4025
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:33,349
vendors of gpus and they maybe don't
always get along but their architectures

4026
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:33,359
always get along but their architectures
 

4027
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,990
always get along but their architectures
are very similar you look at CPUs CPUs

4028
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:36,000
are very similar you look at CPUs CPUs
 

4029
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,729
are very similar you look at CPUs CPUs
are still super important for the

4030
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:37,739
are still super important for the
 

4031
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,829
are still super important for the
deployment side of things you see new

4032
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
deployment side of things you see new
 

4033
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,269
deployment side of things you see new
new architectures coming out from all

4034
01:08:41,269 --> 01:08:41,279
new architectures coming out from all
 

4035
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,650
new architectures coming out from all
the cloud providers and things like this

4036
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:42,660
the cloud providers and things like this
 

4037
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,630
the cloud providers and things like this
and they're all super important to the

4038
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:44,640
and they're all super important to the
 

4039
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,610
and they're all super important to the
world right but they don't have the 30

4040
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:46,620
world right but they don't have the 30
 

4041
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:49,010
world right but they don't have the 30
years of development that the entrenched

4042
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:49,020
years of development that the entrenched
 

4043
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,410
years of development that the entrenched
people do right and so what modular can

4044
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:51,420
people do right and so what modular can
 

4045
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,030
people do right and so what modular can
do is we're saying okay all this

4046
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:53,040
do is we're saying okay all this
 

4047
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,729
do is we're saying okay all this
complexity like it's not it's not bad

4048
01:08:55,729 --> 01:08:55,739
complexity like it's not it's not bad
 

4049
01:08:55,739 --> 01:08:58,329
complexity like it's not it's not bad
complexity it's actually Innovation

4050
01:08:58,329 --> 01:08:58,339
complexity it's actually Innovation
 

4051
01:08:58,339 --> 01:09:00,950
complexity it's actually Innovation
right and so it's Innovation that's

4052
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:00,960
right and so it's Innovation that's
 

4053
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:03,650
right and so it's Innovation that's
happening and it's for good reasons but

4054
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:03,660
happening and it's for good reasons but
 

4055
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:05,209
happening and it's for good reasons but
I have sympathy for the poor software

4056
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:05,219
I have sympathy for the poor software
 

4057
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:07,309
I have sympathy for the poor software
people right I mean again I'm a

4058
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:07,319
people right I mean again I'm a
 

4059
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:08,809
people right I mean again I'm a
generally a software person too I love

4060
01:09:08,809 --> 01:09:08,819
generally a software person too I love
 

4061
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:10,970
generally a software person too I love
Hardware but software people want to

4062
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:10,980
Hardware but software people want to
 

4063
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,829
Hardware but software people want to
build applications and products and

4064
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:12,839
build applications and products and
 

4065
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:15,769
build applications and products and
solutions that scale over many years

4066
01:09:15,769 --> 01:09:15,779
solutions that scale over many years
 

4067
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:17,390
solutions that scale over many years
they don't want to build a solution for

4068
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:17,400
they don't want to build a solution for
 

4069
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,189
they don't want to build a solution for
one generation of Hardware with one

4070
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,199
one generation of Hardware with one
 

4071
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:21,470
one generation of Hardware with one
vendor's tools right and because of this

4072
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:21,480
vendor's tools right and because of this
 

4073
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,689
vendor's tools right and because of this
they need something that scales with

4074
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:23,699
they need something that scales with
 

4075
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:25,789
they need something that scales with
them they need something works on cloud

4076
01:09:25,789 --> 01:09:25,799
them they need something works on cloud
 

4077
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:27,530
them they need something works on cloud
and mobile

4078
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:27,540
and mobile
 

4079
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,150
and mobile
right because you know their product

4080
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:29,160
right because you know their product
 

4081
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,950
right because you know their product
manager said hey I wanted to be have

4082
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:30,960
manager said hey I wanted to be have
 

4083
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,809
manager said hey I wanted to be have
lower latency and it's better for

4084
01:09:32,809 --> 01:09:32,819
lower latency and it's better for
 

4085
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:34,849
lower latency and it's better for
personalization or whatever they decide

4086
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:34,859
personalization or whatever they decide
 

4087
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:37,910
personalization or whatever they decide
right products evolve and so the

4088
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:37,920
right products evolve and so the
 

4089
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,169
right products evolve and so the
challenge with the machine learning

4090
01:09:39,169 --> 01:09:39,179
challenge with the machine learning
 

4091
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:40,669
challenge with the machine learning
technology and the infrastructure we

4092
01:09:40,669 --> 01:09:40,679
technology and the infrastructure we
 

4093
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:42,829
technology and the infrastructure we
have today in the industry is that it's

4094
01:09:42,829 --> 01:09:42,839
have today in the industry is that it's
 

4095
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:44,570
have today in the industry is that it's
all these Point Solutions

4096
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:44,580
all these Point Solutions
 

4097
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,829
all these Point Solutions
and because there are all these Point

4098
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:45,839
and because there are all these Point
 

4099
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:47,390
and because there are all these Point
Solutions it means that Azure product

4100
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:47,400
Solutions it means that Azure product
 

4101
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,530
Solutions it means that Azure product
evolves you have to like switch

4102
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:48,540
evolves you have to like switch
 

4103
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:50,450
evolves you have to like switch
different technology Stacks or switch to

4104
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:50,460
different technology Stacks or switch to
 

4105
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,249
different technology Stacks or switch to
different vendor and what that does is

4106
01:09:52,249 --> 01:09:52,259
different vendor and what that does is
 

4107
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:54,110
different vendor and what that does is
that slows down progress

4108
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:54,120
that slows down progress
 

4109
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,990
that slows down progress
so basically a lot of the things we've

4110
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,000
so basically a lot of the things we've
 

4111
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,590
so basically a lot of the things we've
developed in those little uh silos for

4112
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:00,600
developed in those little uh silos for
 

4113
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,689
developed in those little uh silos for
machine learning tasks you want to make

4114
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:02,699
machine learning tasks you want to make
 

4115
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,490
machine learning tasks you want to make
that the first class citizen of a

4116
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:04,500
that the first class citizen of a
 

4117
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,810
that the first class citizen of a
general purpose programming language

4118
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:05,820
general purpose programming language
 

4119
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,850
general purpose programming language
they can then be compiled across all

4120
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:07,860
they can then be compiled across all
 

4121
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,470
they can then be compiled across all
these kinds of Hardware well so it's not

4122
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:09,480
these kinds of Hardware well so it's not
 

4123
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,850
these kinds of Hardware well so it's not
really about a programming language I

4124
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:10,860
really about a programming language I
 

4125
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,169
really about a programming language I
mean the programming language is a

4126
01:10:12,169 --> 01:10:12,179
mean the programming language is a
 

4127
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:14,090
mean the programming language is a
component of the mission right and the

4128
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:14,100
component of the mission right and the
 

4129
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:16,250
component of the mission right and the
mission is are not literal but our

4130
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:16,260
mission is are not literal but our
 

4131
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,990
mission is are not literal but our
joking mission is to save the world from

4132
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,000
joking mission is to save the world from
 

4133
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,310
joking mission is to save the world from
terrible AI software

4134
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:21,320

 

4135
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,110

so so you know if you look at this

4136
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:24,120
so so you know if you look at this
 

4137
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,810
so so you know if you look at this
Mission you need a syntax

4138
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:26,820
Mission you need a syntax
 

4139
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,610
Mission you need a syntax
so that's so yeah she needed a

4140
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:28,620
so that's so yeah she needed a
 

4141
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:30,470
so that's so yeah she needed a
programming language right and and like

4142
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:30,480
programming language right and and like
 

4143
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:31,430
programming language right and and like
we wouldn't have to build the

4144
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:31,440
we wouldn't have to build the
 

4145
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,110
we wouldn't have to build the
programming language if one existed

4146
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,120
programming language if one existed
 

4147
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:34,850
programming language if one existed
right so if python was already good

4148
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:34,860
right so if python was already good
 

4149
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:36,169
right so if python was already good
enough then cool we've just used it

4150
01:10:36,169 --> 01:10:36,179
enough then cool we've just used it
 

4151
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:38,510
enough then cool we've just used it
right we're not just doing very large

4152
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:38,520
right we're not just doing very large
 

4153
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,250
right we're not just doing very large
scale expensive engineering projects for

4154
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:40,260
scale expensive engineering projects for
 

4155
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,410
scale expensive engineering projects for
the sake of it like it's to solve a

4156
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:42,420
the sake of it like it's to solve a
 

4157
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,870
the sake of it like it's to solve a
problem right it's also about

4158
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:44,880
problem right it's also about
 

4159
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,750
problem right it's also about
um uh accelerators it's also about

4160
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:47,760
um uh accelerators it's also about
 

4161
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,270
um uh accelerators it's also about
exotic numerics and B float 16 and

4162
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:50,280
exotic numerics and B float 16 and
 

4163
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,010
exotic numerics and B float 16 and
Matrix multiplications and convolutions

4164
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:52,020
Matrix multiplications and convolutions
 

4165
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,870
Matrix multiplications and convolutions
and like this this kind of stuff

4166
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:53,880
and like this this kind of stuff
 

4167
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,430
and like this this kind of stuff
um within the stack there are things

4168
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:55,440
um within the stack there are things
 

4169
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,530
um within the stack there are things
like uh kernel Fusion

4170
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:57,540
like uh kernel Fusion
 

4171
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,630
like uh kernel Fusion
that's a esoteric but really important

4172
01:10:59,630 --> 01:10:59,640
that's a esoteric but really important
 

4173
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,070
that's a esoteric but really important
thing that leads to much better

4174
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:01,080
thing that leads to much better
 

4175
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,890
thing that leads to much better
performance and much more general

4176
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:03,900
performance and much more general
 

4177
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,410
performance and much more general
research hackability together

4178
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:06,420
research hackability together
 

4179
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,689
research hackability together
right and that that's enabled by the

4180
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:08,699
right and that that's enabled by the
 

4181
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:10,310
right and that that's enabled by the
Asics that's enabled by certain Hardware

4182
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:10,320
Asics that's enabled by certain Hardware
 

4183
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,330
Asics that's enabled by certain Hardware
so it's like where's the dance between

4184
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:14,340
so it's like where's the dance between
 

4185
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,010
so it's like where's the dance between
um there's several questions here like

4186
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:16,020
um there's several questions here like
 

4187
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,450
um there's several questions here like
how do you add a piece of Hardware to

4188
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:17,460
how do you add a piece of Hardware to
 

4189
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,030
how do you add a piece of Hardware to
this deck yeah if a new piece like if I

4190
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:20,040
this deck yeah if a new piece like if I
 

4191
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,189
this deck yeah if a new piece like if I
have this genius invention

4192
01:11:22,189 --> 01:11:22,199
have this genius invention
 

4193
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:25,430
have this genius invention
of a specialized accelerator yeah how do

4194
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:25,440
of a specialized accelerator yeah how do
 

4195
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,709
of a specialized accelerator yeah how do
I add that to the module framework and

4196
01:11:27,709 --> 01:11:27,719
I add that to the module framework and
 

4197
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:30,110
I add that to the module framework and
also how does modular as a standard

4198
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:30,120
also how does modular as a standard
 

4199
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,110
also how does modular as a standard
start to define the kind of

4200
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
start to define the kind of
 

4201
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,390
start to define the kind of
Hardware that should be developed yeah

4202
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:35,400
Hardware that should be developed yeah
 

4203
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,010
Hardware that should be developed yeah
so let me take a step back and talk

4204
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:37,020
so let me take a step back and talk
 

4205
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:40,370
so let me take a step back and talk
about status quo okay yes and so um if

4206
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:40,380
about status quo okay yes and so um if
 

4207
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,709
about status quo okay yes and so um if
you go back to tensorflow 1 Pi torch one

4208
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
you go back to tensorflow 1 Pi torch one
 

4209
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,470
you go back to tensorflow 1 Pi torch one
the this kind of time frame

4210
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:45,480
the this kind of time frame
 

4211
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,390
the this kind of time frame
um and these have all evolved and gotten

4212
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:47,400
um and these have all evolved and gotten
 

4213
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,709
um and these have all evolved and gotten
way more complicated so let's go back to

4214
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:48,719
way more complicated so let's go back to
 

4215
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,050
way more complicated so let's go back to
the the Glorious simple days right these

4216
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:51,060
the the Glorious simple days right these
 

4217
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,350
the the Glorious simple days right these
things basically were CPUs and Cuda and

4218
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:54,360
things basically were CPUs and Cuda and
 

4219
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,930
things basically were CPUs and Cuda and
so what you do is you say go do

4220
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:56,940
so what you do is you say go do
 

4221
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:58,970
so what you do is you say go do
a dense layer and a dens layer has a

4222
01:11:58,970 --> 01:11:58,980
a dense layer and a dens layer has a
 

4223
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,830
a dense layer and a dens layer has a
matrix multiplication in it right and so

4224
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:00,840
matrix multiplication in it right and so
 

4225
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,930
matrix multiplication in it right and so
when you say that you say go do this big

4226
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:02,940
when you say that you say go do this big
 

4227
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,209
when you say that you say go do this big
operation of matrix multiplication and

4228
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:05,219
operation of matrix multiplication and
 

4229
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:08,390
operation of matrix multiplication and
if it's on a GPU kick off Cuda kernel if

4230
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:08,400
if it's on a GPU kick off Cuda kernel if
 

4231
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,550
if it's on a GPU kick off Cuda kernel if
it's on CPU go do

4232
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:10,560
it's on CPU go do
 

4233
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,229
it's on CPU go do
like an Intel algorithm or something

4234
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:12,239
like an Intel algorithm or something
 

4235
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:15,050
like an Intel algorithm or something
like that with the Intel mko okay now

4236
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:15,060
like that with the Intel mko okay now
 

4237
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,510
like that with the Intel mko okay now
that's really cool if you're either in

4238
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:17,520
that's really cool if you're either in
 

4239
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,630
that's really cool if you're either in
video or Intel right but then more

4240
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:20,640
video or Intel right but then more
 

4241
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,189
video or Intel right but then more
Hardware comes in

4242
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:22,199
Hardware comes in
 

4243
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,649
Hardware comes in
right and and on one access you have

4244
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:24,659
right and and on one access you have
 

4245
01:12:24,659 --> 01:12:25,790
right and and on one access you have
more Hardware coming in on the other

4246
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:25,800
more Hardware coming in on the other
 

4247
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,189
more Hardware coming in on the other
hand you have an explosion of innovation

4248
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:28,199
hand you have an explosion of innovation
 

4249
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:30,290
hand you have an explosion of innovation
in Ai and so what happened with both

4250
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:30,300
in Ai and so what happened with both
 

4251
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,209
in Ai and so what happened with both
tensorflow and pytorch is that the

4252
01:12:32,209 --> 01:12:32,219
tensorflow and pytorch is that the
 

4253
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:34,669
tensorflow and pytorch is that the
explosion of innovation in AI has led to

4254
01:12:34,669 --> 01:12:34,679
explosion of innovation in AI has led to
 

4255
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:36,770
explosion of innovation in AI has led to
it's not just about multiplication and

4256
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:36,780
it's not just about multiplication and
 

4257
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,990
it's not just about multiplication and
convolution these things have now like 2

4258
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:39,000
convolution these things have now like 2
 

4259
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,729
convolution these things have now like 2
000 different operators

4260
01:12:40,729 --> 01:12:40,739
000 different operators
 

4261
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:42,350
000 different operators
and on the other hand you have I don't

4262
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:42,360
and on the other hand you have I don't
 

4263
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,669
and on the other hand you have I don't
know how many pieces of Hardware there

4264
01:12:43,669 --> 01:12:43,679
know how many pieces of Hardware there
 

4265
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,649
know how many pieces of Hardware there
are out there it's a lot

4266
01:12:45,649 --> 01:12:45,659
are out there it's a lot
 

4267
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:47,450
are out there it's a lot
it's it's not it's not even hundreds

4268
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:47,460
it's it's not it's not even hundreds
 

4269
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,970
it's it's not it's not even hundreds
it's probably thousands okay and across

4270
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:49,980
it's probably thousands okay and across
 

4271
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,010
it's probably thousands okay and across
all of Edge and across like all the

4272
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:52,020
all of Edge and across like all the
 

4273
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:53,810
all of Edge and across like all the
different things that are used at scale

4274
01:12:53,810 --> 01:12:53,820
different things that are used at scale
 

4275
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,090
different things that are used at scale
yeah exactly I mean so it's not just

4276
01:12:56,090 --> 01:12:56,100
yeah exactly I mean so it's not just
 

4277
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,310
yeah exactly I mean so it's not just
like ai's everywhere yeah it's not a

4278
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:58,320
like ai's everywhere yeah it's not a
 

4279
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,649
like ai's everywhere yeah it's not a
handful of TPU Alternatives correct it's

4280
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:00,659
handful of TPU Alternatives correct it's
 

4281
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:03,169
handful of TPU Alternatives correct it's
it's every phone often with many

4282
01:13:03,169 --> 01:13:03,179
it's every phone often with many
 

4283
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:05,870
it's every phone often with many
different right chips inside of it from

4284
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:05,880
different right chips inside of it from
 

4285
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:09,350
different right chips inside of it from
different vendors right like it's AI is

4286
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,360
different vendors right like it's AI is
 

4287
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:11,630
different vendors right like it's AI is
everywhere it's a thing right why are

4288
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:11,640
everywhere it's a thing right why are
 

4289
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,010
everywhere it's a thing right why are
they all making their own chips like

4290
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:13,020
they all making their own chips like
 

4291
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,270
they all making their own chips like
what why is everybody making their own

4292
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:14,280
what why is everybody making their own
 

4293
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,410
what why is everybody making their own
thing

4294
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:15,420
thing
 

4295
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,290
thing
well so is that a good thing official so

4296
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:18,300
well so is that a good thing official so
 

4297
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,330
well so is that a good thing official so
Chris's velocity on Hardware yeah right

4298
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:20,340
Chris's velocity on Hardware yeah right
 

4299
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,330
Chris's velocity on Hardware yeah right
so My Philosophy is that there isn't one

4300
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:23,340
so My Philosophy is that there isn't one
 

4301
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:24,649
so My Philosophy is that there isn't one
right solution

4302
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:24,659
right solution
 

4303
01:13:24,659 --> 01:13:26,870
right solution
right and so I think that again we're at

4304
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
right and so I think that again we're at
 

4305
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,550
right and so I think that again we're at
the end of Moore's Law specialization

4306
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
the end of Moore's Law specialization
 

4307
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,830
the end of Moore's Law specialization
happens yeah if you if you're building

4308
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:30,840
happens yeah if you if you're building
 

4309
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,790
happens yeah if you if you're building
if you're training gpt5 you want some

4310
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:34,800
if you're training gpt5 you want some
 

4311
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,910
if you're training gpt5 you want some
crazy super computer data center thingy

4312
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
crazy super computer data center thingy
 

4313
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,610
crazy super computer data center thingy
if you're making a smart camera that

4314
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:40,620
if you're making a smart camera that
 

4315
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:42,470
if you're making a smart camera that
runs on batteries you want something

4316
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:42,480
runs on batteries you want something
 

4317
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,729
runs on batteries you want something
that looks very different

4318
01:13:43,729 --> 01:13:43,739
that looks very different
 

4319
01:13:43,739 --> 01:13:45,110
that looks very different
if you're building a phone you want

4320
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,120
if you're building a phone you want
 

4321
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,370
if you're building a phone you want
something looks very different if you

4322
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:46,380
something looks very different if you
 

4323
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:48,050
something looks very different if you
have something like a laptop you want

4324
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,060
have something like a laptop you want
 

4325
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:50,149
have something like a laptop you want
something that looks maybe similar but a

4326
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:50,159
something that looks maybe similar but a
 

4327
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:53,090
something that looks maybe similar but a
different scale right and so AI ends up

4328
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:53,100
different scale right and so AI ends up
 

4329
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,370
different scale right and so AI ends up
touching all of our Lives robotics right

4330
01:13:55,370 --> 01:13:55,380
touching all of our Lives robotics right
 

4331
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,590
touching all of our Lives robotics right
and like lots of different things and so

4332
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:57,600
and like lots of different things and so
 

4333
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,570
and like lots of different things and so
as you look into this these have

4334
01:13:59,570 --> 01:13:59,580
as you look into this these have
 

4335
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,250
as you look into this these have
different Power envelopes there's

4336
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:01,260
different Power envelopes there's
 

4337
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:02,510
different Power envelopes there's
different trade-offs in terms of the

4338
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:02,520
different trade-offs in terms of the
 

4339
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,250
different trade-offs in terms of the
algorithms there's new Innovations and

4340
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:04,260
algorithms there's new Innovations and
 

4341
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:05,930
algorithms there's new Innovations and
sparsity and other data formats and

4342
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:05,940
sparsity and other data formats and
 

4343
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,510
sparsity and other data formats and
things like that and so uh Hardware

4344
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:08,520
things like that and so uh Hardware
 

4345
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,010
things like that and so uh Hardware
Innovation I think is a really good

4346
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:10,020
Innovation I think is a really good
 

4347
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,689
Innovation I think is a really good
thing right and what I'm interested in

4348
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:11,699
thing right and what I'm interested in
 

4349
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:13,130
thing right and what I'm interested in
is unlocking that Innovation there's

4350
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:13,140
is unlocking that Innovation there's
 

4351
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:14,810
is unlocking that Innovation there's
also like analog and Quantum and like

4352
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:14,820
also like analog and Quantum and like
 

4353
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,669
also like analog and Quantum and like
all the the

4354
01:14:16,669 --> 01:14:16,679
all the the
 

4355
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:19,010
all the the
they're really weird stuff right and so

4356
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:19,020
they're really weird stuff right and so
 

4357
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,689
they're really weird stuff right and so
if somebody can come up with a chip that

4358
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:20,699
if somebody can come up with a chip that
 

4359
01:14:20,699 --> 01:14:22,850
if somebody can come up with a chip that
uses analog Computing and it's 100x more

4360
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:22,860
uses analog Computing and it's 100x more
 

4361
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,649
uses analog Computing and it's 100x more
power efficient think what that would

4362
01:14:24,649 --> 01:14:24,659
power efficient think what that would
 

4363
01:14:24,659 --> 01:14:27,229
power efficient think what that would
mean in terms of the daily impact on the

4364
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:27,239
mean in terms of the daily impact on the
 

4365
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:29,810
mean in terms of the daily impact on the
products we use that would be huge now

4366
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:29,820
products we use that would be huge now
 

4367
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,729
products we use that would be huge now
if you're building an analog computer

4368
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:31,739
if you're building an analog computer
 

4369
01:14:31,739 --> 01:14:34,430
if you're building an analog computer
you may not be a compiler specialist

4370
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:34,440
you may not be a compiler specialist
 

4371
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,110
you may not be a compiler specialist
right these are different skill sets

4372
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:36,120
right these are different skill sets
 

4373
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,630
right these are different skill sets
right and so you can hire some compiler

4374
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
right and so you can hire some compiler
 

4375
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,010
right and so you can hire some compiler
people if you're running a big company

4376
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:40,020
people if you're running a big company
 

4377
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,830
people if you're running a big company
maybe but it turns out these are really

4378
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:42,840
maybe but it turns out these are really
 

4379
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,590
maybe but it turns out these are really
uh like exotic new generation of

4380
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600
uh like exotic new generation of
 

4381
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,570
uh like exotic new generation of
compilers like this this is a different

4382
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:47,580
compilers like this this is a different
 

4383
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,370
compilers like this this is a different
thing right and so if you if you take a

4384
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:49,380
thing right and so if you if you take a
 

4385
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:50,870
thing right and so if you if you take a
step back out and come back to what is

4386
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
step back out and come back to what is
 

4387
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,689
step back out and come back to what is
the status quo status quo is that

4388
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:53,699
the status quo status quo is that
 

4389
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:55,370
the status quo status quo is that
if you're Intel or you're in video you

4390
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:55,380
if you're Intel or you're in video you
 

4391
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,169
if you're Intel or you're in video you
can you keep up with the industry and

4392
01:14:57,169 --> 01:14:57,179
can you keep up with the industry and
 

4393
01:14:57,179 --> 01:14:59,630
can you keep up with the industry and
you chase and okay there's 1900 now

4394
01:14:59,630 --> 01:14:59,640
you chase and okay there's 1900 now
 

4395
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,970
you chase and okay there's 1900 now
there's 2 000 now there's 2100 and you

4396
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:01,980
there's 2 000 now there's 2100 and you
 

4397
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,410
there's 2 000 now there's 2100 and you
have a huge team of people that are like

4398
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:03,420
have a huge team of people that are like
 

4399
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,910
have a huge team of people that are like
trying to keep up and tune and optimize

4400
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:04,920
trying to keep up and tune and optimize
 

4401
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:07,430
trying to keep up and tune and optimize
and even when uh one of the big guys

4402
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,440
and even when uh one of the big guys
 

4403
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,930
and even when uh one of the big guys
comes out with a new generation of their

4404
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:08,940
comes out with a new generation of their
 

4405
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:10,790
comes out with a new generation of their
chip they have to go back and rewrite

4406
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:10,800
chip they have to go back and rewrite
 

4407
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,830
chip they have to go back and rewrite
all these things right so really it's

4408
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:12,840
all these things right so really it's
 

4409
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,330
all these things right so really it's
only powered by having hundreds of

4410
01:15:14,330 --> 01:15:14,340
only powered by having hundreds of
 

4411
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,550
only powered by having hundreds of
people they're all like frantically

4412
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
people they're all like frantically
 

4413
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,050
people they're all like frantically
trying to keep up and what that does is

4414
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:18,060
trying to keep up and what that does is
 

4415
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:19,729
trying to keep up and what that does is
that keeps out the little guys

4416
01:15:19,729 --> 01:15:19,739
that keeps out the little guys
 

4417
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:21,590
that keeps out the little guys
and sometimes the not so little guys the

4418
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:21,600
and sometimes the not so little guys the
 

4419
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,810
and sometimes the not so little guys the
big guys that are also just not not in

4420
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:23,820
big guys that are also just not not in
 

4421
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:26,090
big guys that are also just not not in
those dominant positions and so

4422
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:26,100
those dominant positions and so
 

4423
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,610
those dominant positions and so
um and so what has been happening and so

4424
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:28,620
um and so what has been happening and so
 

4425
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,770
um and so what has been happening and so
a lot of you talk about the rise of new

4426
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:30,780
a lot of you talk about the rise of new
 

4427
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:32,630
a lot of you talk about the rise of new
exotic crazy accelerators is people have

4428
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:32,640
exotic crazy accelerators is people have
 

4429
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,430
exotic crazy accelerators is people have
been trying to turn this from uh let's

4430
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:34,440
been trying to turn this from uh let's
 

4431
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,229
been trying to turn this from uh let's
go write lots of special kernels problem

4432
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:36,239
go write lots of special kernels problem
 

4433
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,209
go write lots of special kernels problem
into a compiler problem

4434
01:15:38,209 --> 01:15:38,219
into a compiler problem
 

4435
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:40,729
into a compiler problem
and so we and I contributed to this as

4436
01:15:40,729 --> 01:15:40,739
and so we and I contributed to this as
 

4437
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:43,370
and so we and I contributed to this as
well we as an industry went into it like

4438
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:43,380
well we as an industry went into it like
 

4439
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:45,649
well we as an industry went into it like
let's go make this compiler problem

4440
01:15:45,649 --> 01:15:45,659
let's go make this compiler problem
 

4441
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:48,290
let's go make this compiler problem
phase let's call it and much of the

4442
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:48,300
phase let's call it and much of the
 

4443
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,729
phase let's call it and much of the
industry is still in this phase by the

4444
01:15:49,729 --> 01:15:49,739
industry is still in this phase by the
 

4445
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:51,350
industry is still in this phase by the
way so it's I won't say this phase is

4446
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
way so it's I won't say this phase is
 

4447
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,050
way so it's I won't say this phase is
over and so the idea is to say look okay

4448
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:54,060
over and so the idea is to say look okay
 

4449
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,510
over and so the idea is to say look okay
what a compiler does is it provides a

4450
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:56,520
what a compiler does is it provides a
 

4451
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,450
what a compiler does is it provides a
much more General extensible

4452
01:15:59,450 --> 01:15:59,460
much more General extensible
 

4453
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,689
much more General extensible
uh hackable interface for dealing with

4454
01:16:02,689 --> 01:16:02,699
uh hackable interface for dealing with
 

4455
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:05,990
uh hackable interface for dealing with
the general case right and so

4456
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
the general case right and so
 

4457
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,390
the general case right and so
um within machine learning algorithms

4458
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:08,400
um within machine learning algorithms
 

4459
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,070
um within machine learning algorithms
for example people figured out that hey

4460
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,080
for example people figured out that hey
 

4461
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:12,050
for example people figured out that hey
if I do a matrix multiplication and I do

4462
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:12,060
if I do a matrix multiplication and I do
 

4463
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:15,709
if I do a matrix multiplication and I do
a relu right the classic activation

4464
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:15,719
a relu right the classic activation
 

4465
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:19,310
a relu right the classic activation
function it is way faster to do one pass

4466
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:19,320
function it is way faster to do one pass
 

4467
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,709
function it is way faster to do one pass
over the data and then do the relu on

4468
01:16:21,709 --> 01:16:21,719
over the data and then do the relu on
 

4469
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:23,689
over the data and then do the relu on
the output where I'm writing out the

4470
01:16:23,689 --> 01:16:23,699
the output where I'm writing out the
 

4471
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:25,430
the output where I'm writing out the
data because really is just a maximum

4472
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
data because really is just a maximum
 

4473
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,390
data because really is just a maximum
operation right Max is zero and so

4474
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:28,400
operation right Max is zero and so
 

4475
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,130
operation right Max is zero and so
it's an amazing optimization to take not

4476
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:31,140
it's an amazing optimization to take not
 

4477
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:33,110
it's an amazing optimization to take not
more value squish together in one

4478
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:33,120
more value squish together in one
 

4479
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,270
more value squish together in one
operation now we have Matt morelu

4480
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,280
operation now we have Matt morelu
 

4481
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,729
operation now we have Matt morelu
well wait a second if I do that now I

4482
01:16:37,729 --> 01:16:37,739
well wait a second if I do that now I
 

4483
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:39,470
well wait a second if I do that now I
just went from having you know two

4484
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:39,480
just went from having you know two
 

4485
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,850
just went from having you know two
operators to three

4486
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:40,860
operators to three
 

4487
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:42,470
operators to three
but now I figure out okay well there's a

4488
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
but now I figure out okay well there's a
 

4489
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,290
but now I figure out okay well there's a
lot of activation functions what about

4490
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:44,300
lot of activation functions what about
 

4491
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,810
lot of activation functions what about
uh leaky rally what about like like a

4492
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:47,820
uh leaky rally what about like like a
 

4493
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,010
uh leaky rally what about like like a
million things that are out there right

4494
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:49,020
million things that are out there right
 

4495
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:52,130
million things that are out there right
and so as I start fusing these in now I

4496
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:52,140
and so as I start fusing these in now I
 

4497
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:53,990
and so as I start fusing these in now I
get permutations of all these algorithms

4498
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
get permutations of all these algorithms
 

4499
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,490
get permutations of all these algorithms
right and so what the compiler people

4500
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:55,500
right and so what the compiler people
 

4501
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,290
right and so what the compiler people
said is they said hey cool well I will

4502
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:57,300
said is they said hey cool well I will
 

4503
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,970
said is they said hey cool well I will
go enumerate all the algorithms and I

4504
01:16:58,970 --> 01:16:58,980
go enumerate all the algorithms and I
 

4505
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,410
go enumerate all the algorithms and I
will enumerate all the pairs and I will

4506
01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:00,420
will enumerate all the pairs and I will
 

4507
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,930
will enumerate all the pairs and I will
actually generate a kernel for you and I

4508
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:02,940
actually generate a kernel for you and I
 

4509
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,370
actually generate a kernel for you and I
think that this has been very very

4510
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:04,380
think that this has been very very
 

4511
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:05,930
think that this has been very very
useful for the industry this is one of

4512
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:05,940
useful for the industry this is one of
 

4513
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:08,209
useful for the industry this is one of
the things that powers Google tpus uh

4514
01:17:08,209 --> 01:17:08,219
the things that powers Google tpus uh
 

4515
01:17:08,219 --> 01:17:10,010
the things that powers Google tpus uh
pytorch twos like rolling out really

4516
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,020
pytorch twos like rolling out really
 

4517
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:12,290
pytorch twos like rolling out really
cool compiler stuff with Triton this

4518
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:12,300
cool compiler stuff with Triton this
 

4519
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,550
cool compiler stuff with Triton this
other technology and things like this

4520
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:13,560
other technology and things like this
 

4521
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,890
other technology and things like this
and so the compiler people are kind of

4522
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:15,900
and so the compiler people are kind of
 

4523
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:17,450
and so the compiler people are kind of
coming into their four and saying like

4524
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:17,460
coming into their four and saying like
 

4525
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,709
coming into their four and saying like
awesome this is a competitive problem

4526
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:18,719
awesome this is a competitive problem
 

4527
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,630
awesome this is a competitive problem
we'll compiler it

4528
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
we'll compiler it
 

4529
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,250
we'll compiler it
here's the problem

4530
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:22,260
here's the problem
 

4531
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:24,229
here's the problem
not everybody's compiler person I love

4532
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:24,239
not everybody's compiler person I love
 

4533
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,850
not everybody's compiler person I love
compiler people trust me right but not

4534
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:25,860
compiler people trust me right but not
 

4535
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,709
compiler people trust me right but not
everybody can or should be a compiler

4536
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:27,719
everybody can or should be a compiler
 

4537
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:29,450
everybody can or should be a compiler
person it turns out that there are

4538
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:29,460
person it turns out that there are
 

4539
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,610
person it turns out that there are
people that know analog computers really

4540
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:31,620
people that know analog computers really
 

4541
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,169
people that know analog computers really
well or they know

4542
01:17:33,169 --> 01:17:33,179
well or they know
 

4543
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:35,270
well or they know
some GPU internal architecture thing

4544
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
some GPU internal architecture thing
 

4545
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,130
some GPU internal architecture thing
really well or they know some crazy

4546
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,140
really well or they know some crazy
 

4547
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,830
really well or they know some crazy
sparse numeric interesting algorithm

4548
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:39,840
sparse numeric interesting algorithm
 

4549
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,590
sparse numeric interesting algorithm
that is the cusp of research but they're

4550
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:42,600
that is the cusp of research but they're
 

4551
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,870
that is the cusp of research but they're
not compiler people and so one of the

4552
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880
not compiler people and so one of the
 

4553
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,250
not compiler people and so one of the
challenges with this new wave of

4554
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:46,260
challenges with this new wave of
 

4555
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:47,390
challenges with this new wave of
Technology trying to turn everything

4556
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:47,400
Technology trying to turn everything
 

4557
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:48,950
Technology trying to turn everything
into a compiler

4558
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:48,960
into a compiler
 

4559
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,470
into a compiler
once again it's excluded a ton of people

4560
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:51,480
once again it's excluded a ton of people
 

4561
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,450
once again it's excluded a ton of people
and so you look at what does mojo do

4562
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:53,460
and so you look at what does mojo do
 

4563
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,729
and so you look at what does mojo do
what is the modular stack do it brings

4564
01:17:55,729 --> 01:17:55,739
what is the modular stack do it brings
 

4565
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:57,470
what is the modular stack do it brings
programmability back into this world

4566
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:57,480
programmability back into this world
 

4567
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,990
programmability back into this world
like it enables I wouldn't say normal

4568
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,000
like it enables I wouldn't say normal
 

4569
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,270
like it enables I wouldn't say normal
people but like a new you know different

4570
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:02,280
people but like a new you know different
 

4571
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,370
people but like a new you know different
kind of delightful nerd that cares about

4572
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:04,380
kind of delightful nerd that cares about
 

4573
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,050
kind of delightful nerd that cares about
numerics or cares about Hardware or

4574
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:06,060
numerics or cares about Hardware or
 

4575
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,790
numerics or cares about Hardware or
cares about things like this to be able

4576
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:07,800
cares about things like this to be able
 

4577
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,350
cares about things like this to be able
to express that in the stack and extend

4578
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:09,360
to express that in the stack and extend
 

4579
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:11,630
to express that in the stack and extend
the stack without having to actually go

4580
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:11,640
the stack without having to actually go
 

4581
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,729
the stack without having to actually go
hack the compiler itself to extend the

4582
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:13,739
hack the compiler itself to extend the
 

4583
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:16,430
hack the compiler itself to extend the
stack on the on the algorithm side yeah

4584
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:16,440
stack on the on the algorithm side yeah
 

4585
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,950
stack on the on the algorithm side yeah
and then on the hardware side yeah so

4586
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:18,960
and then on the hardware side yeah so
 

4587
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,390
and then on the hardware side yeah so
again go back to like the simplest

4588
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,400
again go back to like the simplest
 

4589
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,550
again go back to like the simplest
example of int right and so what both

4590
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:22,560
example of int right and so what both
 

4591
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,530
example of int right and so what both
Swift and Mojo and other things like

4592
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:24,540
Swift and Mojo and other things like
 

4593
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,689
Swift and Mojo and other things like
this did is we said okay pull magic out

4594
01:18:26,689 --> 01:18:26,699
this did is we said okay pull magic out
 

4595
01:18:26,699 --> 01:18:27,709
this did is we said okay pull magic out
of the compiler and put it in the

4596
01:18:27,709 --> 01:18:27,719
of the compiler and put it in the
 

4597
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:28,850
of the compiler and put it in the
standard Library

4598
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:28,860
standard Library
 

4599
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:30,950
standard Library
right so what modular is doing with the

4600
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
right so what modular is doing with the
 

4601
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,149
right so what modular is doing with the
engine that we're providing and like

4602
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
engine that we're providing and like
 

4603
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,370
engine that we're providing and like
this this very deep technology stack

4604
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:34,380
this this very deep technology stack
 

4605
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:36,470
this this very deep technology stack
right which goes into heterogeneous run

4606
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:36,480
right which goes into heterogeneous run
 

4607
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,149
right which goes into heterogeneous run
times and like a whole bunch of really

4608
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:38,159
times and like a whole bunch of really
 

4609
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,610
times and like a whole bunch of really
cool really cool things

4610
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:40,620
cool really cool things
 

4611
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,770
cool really cool things
um this this whole stack allows that

4612
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:42,780
um this this whole stack allows that
 

4613
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,410
um this this whole stack allows that
stack to be extended and hacked and

4614
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:45,420
stack to be extended and hacked and
 

4615
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,330
stack to be extended and hacked and
changed by researchers and by Hardware

4616
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:47,340
changed by researchers and by Hardware
 

4617
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,729
changed by researchers and by Hardware
innovators and by people who know things

4618
01:18:49,729 --> 01:18:49,739
innovators and by people who know things
 

4619
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:52,310
innovators and by people who know things
that we don't know because you know

4620
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
that we don't know because you know
 

4621
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,570
that we don't know because you know
modular has some smart people but we

4622
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:53,580
modular has some smart people but we
 

4623
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,890
modular has some smart people but we
don't have all the smart people it turns

4624
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:54,900
don't have all the smart people it turns
 

4625
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,290
don't have all the smart people it turns
out right uh what are heterogeneous

4626
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:57,300
out right uh what are heterogeneous
 

4627
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:00,950
out right uh what are heterogeneous
runtimes yeah so uh so what is

4628
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:00,960
runtimes yeah so uh so what is
 

4629
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,390
runtimes yeah so uh so what is
heterogeneous right so heterogeneous

4630
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:02,400
heterogeneous right so heterogeneous
 

4631
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,830
heterogeneous right so heterogeneous
just means many different kinds of

4632
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:03,840
just means many different kinds of
 

4633
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,169
just means many different kinds of
things together and so the simple

4634
01:19:06,169 --> 01:19:06,179
things together and so the simple
 

4635
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:07,669
things together and so the simple
simplest example you might come up with

4636
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
simplest example you might come up with
 

4637
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,850
simplest example you might come up with
is a CPU and a GPU and so it's a simple

4638
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:10,860
is a CPU and a GPU and so it's a simple
 

4639
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,250
is a CPU and a GPU and so it's a simple
heterogeneous computer to say I'll run

4640
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:13,260
heterogeneous computer to say I'll run
 

4641
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:15,110
heterogeneous computer to say I'll run
my data loading and pre-processing and

4642
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,120
my data loading and pre-processing and
 

4643
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,209
my data loading and pre-processing and
other algorithms on the CPU and then

4644
01:19:17,209 --> 01:19:17,219
other algorithms on the CPU and then
 

4645
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:18,649
other algorithms on the CPU and then
once I get it into the right shape I

4646
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:18,659
once I get it into the right shape I
 

4647
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:20,390
once I get it into the right shape I
shove it into the GPU I do a lot of

4648
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:20,400
shove it into the GPU I do a lot of
 

4649
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,070
shove it into the GPU I do a lot of
Matrix multiplications and convolutions

4650
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:22,080
Matrix multiplications and convolutions
 

4651
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,290
Matrix multiplications and convolutions
and things like this and I get it back

4652
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:24,300
and things like this and I get it back
 

4653
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,689
and things like this and I get it back
out and I do some reductions and

4654
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:26,699
out and I do some reductions and
 

4655
01:19:26,699 --> 01:19:28,130
out and I do some reductions and
summaries and they shove it across the

4656
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:28,140
summaries and they shove it across the
 

4657
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,350
summaries and they shove it across the
wire to across the network to another

4658
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:30,360
wire to across the network to another
 

4659
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,770
wire to across the network to another
machine right and so you've got now what

4660
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:33,780
machine right and so you've got now what
 

4661
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:35,870
machine right and so you've got now what
are effectively two computers

4662
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:35,880
are effectively two computers
 

4663
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,390
are effectively two computers
a CPU and a GPU talking to each other

4664
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:38,400
a CPU and a GPU talking to each other
 

4665
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,950
a CPU and a GPU talking to each other
working together in a heterogeneous

4666
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:39,960
working together in a heterogeneous
 

4667
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,450
working together in a heterogeneous
system

4668
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:41,460
system
 

4669
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:41,990
system
um

4670
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,000
um
 

4671
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,209
um
but that was 10 years ago

4672
01:19:44,209 --> 01:19:44,219
but that was 10 years ago
 

4673
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:47,149
but that was 10 years ago
okay you look at a modern cell phone

4674
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:47,159
okay you look at a modern cell phone
 

4675
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:50,330
okay you look at a modern cell phone
modern cell phone you've got CPUs and

4676
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:50,340
modern cell phone you've got CPUs and
 

4677
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,709
modern cell phone you've got CPUs and
they're not just CPUs there's like Big

4678
01:19:51,709 --> 01:19:51,719
they're not just CPUs there's like Big
 

4679
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:53,810
they're not just CPUs there's like Big
Dot little CPUs and so there's multiple

4680
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:53,820
Dot little CPUs and so there's multiple
 

4681
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,130
Dot little CPUs and so there's multiple
different kinds of CPUs that are again

4682
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:55,140
different kinds of CPUs that are again
 

4683
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:56,930
different kinds of CPUs that are again
working together they're multi-core

4684
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:56,940
working together they're multi-core
 

4685
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:59,810
working together they're multi-core
you've got gpus you've got neural

4686
01:19:59,810 --> 01:19:59,820
you've got gpus you've got neural
 

4687
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:02,689
you've got gpus you've got neural
network accelerators you got dedicated

4688
01:20:02,689 --> 01:20:02,699
network accelerators you got dedicated
 

4689
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:05,090
network accelerators you got dedicated
Hardware blocks for for media so for

4690
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:05,100
Hardware blocks for for media so for
 

4691
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,890
Hardware blocks for for media so for
video decode and jpeg code and things

4692
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:06,900
video decode and jpeg code and things
 

4693
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,330
video decode and jpeg code and things
like this and so you've got this

4694
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:08,340
like this and so you've got this
 

4695
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,830
like this and so you've got this
massively complicated system and this

4696
01:20:09,830 --> 01:20:09,840
massively complicated system and this
 

4697
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,209
massively complicated system and this
isn't just cell phones every laptop

4698
01:20:11,209 --> 01:20:11,219
isn't just cell phones every laptop
 

4699
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:13,550
isn't just cell phones every laptop
these days is doing the same thing and

4700
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:13,560
these days is doing the same thing and
 

4701
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,290
these days is doing the same thing and
all these blocks can run at the same

4702
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:15,300
all these blocks can run at the same
 

4703
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,130
all these blocks can run at the same
time

4704
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:16,140
time
 

4705
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:18,229
time
and need to be

4706
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:18,239
and need to be
 

4707
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:21,169
and need to be
choreographed right and so again one of

4708
01:20:21,169 --> 01:20:21,179
choreographed right and so again one of
 

4709
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:22,250
choreographed right and so again one of
the cool things about machine learning

4710
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:22,260
the cool things about machine learning
 

4711
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:23,930
the cool things about machine learning
is it's moving things to like data flow

4712
01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:23,940
is it's moving things to like data flow
 

4713
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,669
is it's moving things to like data flow
graphs and higher level of abstractions

4714
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679
graphs and higher level of abstractions
 

4715
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:27,890
graphs and higher level of abstractions
and tensors and these things that it

4716
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:27,900
and tensors and these things that it
 

4717
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,110
and tensors and these things that it
doesn't specify here's how to do the

4718
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:30,120
doesn't specify here's how to do the
 

4719
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,149
doesn't specify here's how to do the
algorithm it gives the system a lot more

4720
01:20:32,149 --> 01:20:32,159
algorithm it gives the system a lot more
 

4721
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:33,770
algorithm it gives the system a lot more
flexibility in terms of how to translate

4722
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:33,780
flexibility in terms of how to translate
 

4723
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:36,229
flexibility in terms of how to translate
or map it or compile it onto the system

4724
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:36,239
or map it or compile it onto the system
 

4725
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,390
or map it or compile it onto the system
that you have and so what you need you

4726
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,400
that you have and so what you need you
 

4727
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,010
that you have and so what you need you
know at the bottom is part of the layer

4728
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:40,020
know at the bottom is part of the layer
 

4729
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,229
know at the bottom is part of the layer
there is a way for all these devices to

4730
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:42,239
there is a way for all these devices to
 

4731
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:43,370
there is a way for all these devices to
talk to each other

4732
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:43,380
talk to each other
 

4733
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,990
talk to each other
and so this is one thing that you know

4734
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:45,000
and so this is one thing that you know
 

4735
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,030
and so this is one thing that you know
I'm very passionate about I mean you

4736
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:47,040
I'm very passionate about I mean you
 

4737
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,209
I'm very passionate about I mean you
know I'm a nerd but um but all these all

4738
01:20:50,209 --> 01:20:50,219
know I'm a nerd but um but all these all
 

4739
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:51,770
know I'm a nerd but um but all these all
these machines and all these systems are

4740
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:51,780
these machines and all these systems are
 

4741
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,050
these machines and all these systems are
effectively parallel computers running

4742
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:54,060
effectively parallel computers running
 

4743
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,270
effectively parallel computers running
at the same time sending messages to

4744
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:56,280
at the same time sending messages to
 

4745
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,770
at the same time sending messages to
each other and so they're all fully

4746
01:20:57,770 --> 01:20:57,780
each other and so they're all fully
 

4747
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:00,530
each other and so they're all fully
asynchronous well this is actually a

4748
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:00,540
asynchronous well this is actually a
 

4749
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:01,910
asynchronous well this is actually a
small version of the same problem you

4750
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:01,920
small version of the same problem you
 

4751
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,070
small version of the same problem you
have in a data center right in a data

4752
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,080
have in a data center right in a data
 

4753
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:05,750
have in a data center right in a data
center you now have multiple different

4754
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:05,760
center you now have multiple different
 

4755
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,610
center you now have multiple different
machines sometimes very specialized

4756
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:07,620
machines sometimes very specialized
 

4757
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:10,430
machines sometimes very specialized
sometimes with gpus or tpus in OneNote

4758
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:10,440
sometimes with gpus or tpus in OneNote
 

4759
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,110
sometimes with gpus or tpus in OneNote
and sometimes with disks and other nodes

4760
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:12,120
and sometimes with disks and other nodes
 

4761
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:14,450
and sometimes with disks and other nodes
and so you get a much larger scale

4762
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:14,460
and so you get a much larger scale
 

4763
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,669
and so you get a much larger scale
heterogeneous computer and so what ends

4764
01:21:16,669 --> 01:21:16,679
heterogeneous computer and so what ends
 

4765
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:17,810
heterogeneous computer and so what ends
up happening is you have this like

4766
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:17,820
up happening is you have this like
 

4767
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:20,450
up happening is you have this like
multi-layer abstraction of hierarchical

4768
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:20,460
multi-layer abstraction of hierarchical
 

4769
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,550
multi-layer abstraction of hierarchical
parallelism hierarchical

4770
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
parallelism hierarchical
 

4771
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,250
parallelism hierarchical
asynchronous communication and making

01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:30,179
complexity by getting that away from
 

4777
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:32,090
complexity by getting that away from
being different specialized systems at

4778
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:32,100
being different specialized systems at
 

4779
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,830
being different specialized systems at
every different part of the stack and

4780
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:33,840
every different part of the stack and
 

4781
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,229
every different part of the stack and
having more consistency and uniformity I

4782
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,239
having more consistency and uniformity I
 

4783
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,430
having more consistency and uniformity I
think we can help lift the world and

4784
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:37,440
think we can help lift the world and
 

4785
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,290
think we can help lift the world and
make it much simpler and actually get

4786
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:39,300
make it much simpler and actually get
 

4787
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,149
make it much simpler and actually get
used but how do you leverage like the

4788
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:41,159
used but how do you leverage like the
 

4789
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:42,530
used but how do you leverage like the
strengths of the different specialized

4790
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:42,540
strengths of the different specialized
 

4791
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,570
strengths of the different specialized
systems so looking inside the smartphone

4792
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:44,580
systems so looking inside the smartphone
 

4793
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:47,090
systems so looking inside the smartphone
yeah like there's there's what like I

4794
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:47,100
yeah like there's there's what like I
 

4795
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,290
yeah like there's there's what like I
don't know five six computers

4796
01:21:48,290 --> 01:21:48,300
don't know five six computers
 

4797
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,630
don't know five six computers
essentially inside a smartphone uh how

4798
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:50,640
essentially inside a smartphone uh how
 

4799
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,649
essentially inside a smartphone uh how
do you

4800
01:21:51,649 --> 01:21:51,659
do you
 

4801
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:53,270
do you
without

4802
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:53,280
without
 

4803
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:57,229
without
Trying to minimize the explicit uh

4804
01:21:57,229 --> 01:21:57,239
Trying to minimize the explicit uh
 

4805
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:59,209
Trying to minimize the explicit uh
making it explicit which which computer

4806
01:21:59,209 --> 01:21:59,219
making it explicit which which computer
 

4807
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:00,169
making it explicit which which computer
is supposed to be used for which

4808
01:22:00,169 --> 01:22:00,179
is supposed to be used for which
 

4809
01:22:00,179 --> 01:22:02,330
is supposed to be used for which
operation yeah so there's there's a

4810
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:02,340
operation yeah so there's there's a
 

4811
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:03,770
operation yeah so there's there's a
pretty well known algorithm and what

4812
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:03,780
pretty well known algorithm and what
 

4813
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,030
pretty well known algorithm and what
you're doing is you're looking at two

4814
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:05,040
you're doing is you're looking at two
 

4815
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:06,590
you're doing is you're looking at two
two factors you're looking at the factor

4816
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:06,600
two factors you're looking at the factor
 

4817
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,270
two factors you're looking at the factor
of sending data from one thing to

4818
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:08,280
of sending data from one thing to
 

4819
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,070
of sending data from one thing to
another right because it takes time to

4820
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,080
another right because it takes time to
 

4821
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,390
another right because it takes time to
get it from that side of the chip to

4822
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:11,400
get it from that side of the chip to
 

4823
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,310
get it from that side of the chip to
that side of the Chip and things like

4824
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:13,320
that side of the Chip and things like
 

4825
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,689
that side of the Chip and things like
this and then you're looking at what is

4826
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:14,699
this and then you're looking at what is
 

4827
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:17,030
this and then you're looking at what is
the time it takes to do an operation on

4828
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:17,040
the time it takes to do an operation on
 

4829
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:21,229
the time it takes to do an operation on
a particular block so take CPUs CPUs are

4830
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:21,239
a particular block so take CPUs CPUs are
 

4831
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:23,209
a particular block so take CPUs CPUs are
fully General they can do anything right

4832
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:23,219
fully General they can do anything right
 

4833
01:22:23,219 --> 01:22:24,890
fully General they can do anything right
but then you have a neural net

4834
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:24,900
but then you have a neural net
 

4835
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,209
but then you have a neural net
accelerator that's really good at Matrix

4836
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:26,219
accelerator that's really good at Matrix
 

4837
01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:28,970
accelerator that's really good at Matrix
multiplications okay and so you say okay

4838
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:28,980
multiplications okay and so you say okay
 

4839
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,590
multiplications okay and so you say okay
well if my workload is all Matrix

4840
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:30,600
well if my workload is all Matrix
 

4841
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,930
well if my workload is all Matrix
multiplications I start up I send the

4842
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:32,940
multiplications I start up I send the
 

4843
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,970
multiplications I start up I send the
data over the neural net thing it goes

4844
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:34,980
data over the neural net thing it goes
 

4845
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,350
data over the neural net thing it goes
and does matrix multiplications when

4846
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:36,360
and does matrix multiplications when
 

4847
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,669
and does matrix multiplications when
it's done it sends me back the result

4848
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:37,679
it's done it sends me back the result
 

4849
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:40,250
it's done it sends me back the result
all is good right and so the simplest

4850
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:40,260
all is good right and so the simplest
 

4851
01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:42,890
all is good right and so the simplest
thing is just saying do Matrix do Matrix

4852
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:42,900
thing is just saying do Matrix do Matrix
 

4853
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:45,290
thing is just saying do Matrix do Matrix
operations over there right but then you

4854
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:45,300
operations over there right but then you
 

4855
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,669
operations over there right but then you
realize you get a little bit more

4856
01:22:46,669 --> 01:22:46,679
realize you get a little bit more
 

4857
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:48,050
realize you get a little bit more
complicated because you can do Matrix

4858
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:48,060
complicated because you can do Matrix
 

4859
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:50,149
complicated because you can do Matrix
multiplications on a GPU you can do it

4860
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:50,159
multiplications on a GPU you can do it
 

4861
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:51,470
multiplications on a GPU you can do it
on

4862
01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:51,480
on
 

4863
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,390
on
a neural net accelerator you can do it

4864
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:53,400
a neural net accelerator you can do it
 

4865
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,890
a neural net accelerator you can do it
on CPU and they'll have different

4866
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:54,900
on CPU and they'll have different
 

4867
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,750
on CPU and they'll have different
trade-offs and costs and it's not just

4868
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:56,760
trade-offs and costs and it's not just
 

4869
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:58,790
trade-offs and costs and it's not just
matrix multiplication and so what you

4870
01:22:58,790 --> 01:22:58,800
matrix multiplication and so what you
 

4871
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,010
matrix multiplication and so what you
actually look at is you look at I have

4872
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:01,020
actually look at is you look at I have
 

4873
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:03,590
actually look at is you look at I have
generally a graph of compute I want to

4874
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:03,600
generally a graph of compute I want to
 

4875
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,810
generally a graph of compute I want to
do a partitioning I want to look at the

4876
01:23:05,810 --> 01:23:05,820
do a partitioning I want to look at the
 

4877
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:08,209
do a partitioning I want to look at the
communication the bisection bandwidth

4878
01:23:08,209 --> 01:23:08,219
communication the bisection bandwidth
 

4879
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:09,950
communication the bisection bandwidth
and like the overhead and the sending of

4880
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:09,960
and like the overhead and the sending of
 

4881
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,050
and like the overhead and the sending of
all these different things and and build

4882
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:12,060
all these different things and and build
 

4883
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,090
all these different things and and build
a model for this and then decide okay

4884
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:14,100
a model for this and then decide okay
 

4885
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:15,890
a model for this and then decide okay
it's an optimization problem where do I

4886
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:15,900
it's an optimization problem where do I
 

4887
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,810
it's an optimization problem where do I
want to place this compute

4888
01:23:17,810 --> 01:23:17,820
want to place this compute
 

4889
01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,970
want to place this compute
this is the old school theoretical

4890
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:19,980
this is the old school theoretical
 

4891
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,070
this is the old school theoretical
computer science problem of scheduling

4892
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,080
computer science problem of scheduling
 

4893
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,890
computer science problem of scheduling
and then how does uh

4894
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:24,900
and then how does uh
 

4895
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,229
and then how does uh
presumably it's possible to somehow

4896
01:23:27,229 --> 01:23:27,239
presumably it's possible to somehow
 

4897
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:30,350
presumably it's possible to somehow
magically include autogun into this

4898
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:30,360
magically include autogun into this
 

4899
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,590
magically include autogun into this
absolutely so I mean in my opinion this

4900
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
absolutely so I mean in my opinion this
 

4901
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,870
absolutely so I mean in my opinion this
is an opinion this is not uh not

4902
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:35,880
is an opinion this is not uh not
 

4903
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,130
is an opinion this is not uh not
everybody would agree with this but in

4904
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:37,140
everybody would agree with this but in
 

4905
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:39,709
everybody would agree with this but in
my opinion the world benefits from

4906
01:23:39,709 --> 01:23:39,719
my opinion the world benefits from
 

4907
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:41,510
my opinion the world benefits from
simple and predictable systems at the

4908
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:41,520
simple and predictable systems at the
 

4909
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,610
simple and predictable systems at the
bottom that you can control

4910
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:43,620
bottom that you can control
 

4911
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,950
bottom that you can control
but then once you have a predictable

4912
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:45,960
but then once you have a predictable
 

4913
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,229
but then once you have a predictable
execution layer you can build lots of

4914
01:23:48,229 --> 01:23:48,239
execution layer you can build lots of
 

4915
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,090
execution layer you can build lots of
different policies on top of it right

4916
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:50,100
different policies on top of it right
 

4917
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,310
different policies on top of it right
and so one policy can be that

4918
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
and so one policy can be that
 

4919
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,669
and so one policy can be that
the human programmer says do that here

4920
01:23:55,669 --> 01:23:55,679
the human programmer says do that here
 

4921
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:57,350
the human programmer says do that here
do that here do that here do that here

4922
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:57,360
do that here do that here do that here
 

4923
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:58,729
do that here do that here do that here
and like fully manually controls

4924
01:23:58,729 --> 01:23:58,739
and like fully manually controls
 

4925
01:23:58,739 --> 01:24:00,229
and like fully manually controls
everything

4926
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:00,239
everything
 

4927
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:02,330
everything
and the system should just do it right

4928
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:02,340
and the system should just do it right
 

4929
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:04,189
and the system should just do it right
then you quickly get in the mode of like

4930
01:24:04,189 --> 01:24:04,199
then you quickly get in the mode of like
 

4931
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:05,390
then you quickly get in the mode of like
I don't want to have to tell it to do it

4932
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:05,400
I don't want to have to tell it to do it
 

4933
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,030
I don't want to have to tell it to do it
yeah and so the next logical step that

4934
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:08,040
yeah and so the next logical step that
 

4935
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,229
yeah and so the next logical step that
people typically take because they write

4936
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:09,239
people typically take because they write
 

4937
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:12,110
people typically take because they write
some terrible heuristic oh if it's

4938
01:24:12,110 --> 01:24:12,120
some terrible heuristic oh if it's
 

4939
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,729
some terrible heuristic oh if it's
amazing location do it over there or if

4940
01:24:13,729 --> 01:24:13,739
amazing location do it over there or if
 

4941
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:15,169
amazing location do it over there or if
it's floating Point dude on the GPU if

4942
01:24:15,169 --> 01:24:15,179
it's floating Point dude on the GPU if
 

4943
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:16,370
it's floating Point dude on the GPU if
it's integer due on the CPU like

4944
01:24:16,370 --> 01:24:16,380
it's integer due on the CPU like
 

4945
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,370
it's integer due on the CPU like
something like that right and and then

4946
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:19,380
something like that right and and then
 

4947
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:21,410
something like that right and and then
you you then get into this mode of like

4948
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:21,420
you you then get into this mode of like
 

4949
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:22,490
you you then get into this mode of like
people care more and more and more and

4950
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:22,500
people care more and more and more and
 

4951
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,530
people care more and more and more and
you say okay well let's actually

4952
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:24,540
you say okay well let's actually
 

4953
01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:27,110
you say okay well let's actually
um like make your stick better let's get

4954
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:27,120
um like make your stick better let's get
 

4955
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,689
um like make your stick better let's get
into auto tune let's actually do a

4956
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:29,699
into auto tune let's actually do a
 

4957
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:33,709
into auto tune let's actually do a
search of the space to decide well what

4958
01:24:33,709 --> 01:24:33,719
search of the space to decide well what
 

4959
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:36,229
search of the space to decide well what
is actually better right well then you

4960
01:24:36,229 --> 01:24:36,239
is actually better right well then you
 

4961
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:37,370
is actually better right well then you
get into this problem where you realize

4962
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:37,380
get into this problem where you realize
 

4963
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,290
get into this problem where you realize
this is not a small space this is a many

4964
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:39,300
this is not a small space this is a many
 

4965
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,990
this is not a small space this is a many
dimensional

4966
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:41,000
dimensional
 

4967
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,430
dimensional
hyperdimensional space that you cannot

4968
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:43,440
hyperdimensional space that you cannot
 

4969
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:45,169
hyperdimensional space that you cannot
exhaustively search

4970
01:24:45,169 --> 01:24:45,179
exhaustively search
 

4971
01:24:45,179 --> 01:24:47,209
exhaustively search
so do you know of any algorithms that

4972
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:47,219
so do you know of any algorithms that
 

4973
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:48,470
so do you know of any algorithms that
are good at searching very complicated

4974
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
are good at searching very complicated
 

4975
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,030
are good at searching very complicated
spaces for

4976
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:50,040
spaces for
 

4977
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,830
spaces for
don't tell me you're going to turn this

4978
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:51,840
don't tell me you're going to turn this
 

4979
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,870
don't tell me you're going to turn this
into a machine learning problem so then

4980
01:24:53,870 --> 01:24:53,880
into a machine learning problem so then
 

4981
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,130
into a machine learning problem so then
you turn into a machine learning problem

4982
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:55,140
you turn into a machine learning problem
 

4983
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,110
you turn into a machine learning problem
and then you have a space of genetic

4984
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:57,120
and then you have a space of genetic
 

4985
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,610
and then you have a space of genetic
algorithms and reinforcement learning

4986
01:24:58,610 --> 01:24:58,620
algorithms and reinforcement learning
 

4987
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,590
algorithms and reinforcement learning
and like all these all these what can

4988
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:00,600
and like all these all these what can
 

4989
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,750
and like all these all these what can
you include that into the stack into the

4990
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:02,760
you include that into the stack into the
 

4991
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,510
you include that into the stack into the
into the modulus that yeah yeah where

4992
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:05,520
into the modulus that yeah yeah where
 

4993
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,890
into the modulus that yeah yeah where
does it sit where does it live is it

4994
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:06,900
does it sit where does it live is it
 

4995
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,030
does it sit where does it live is it
separate thing or is it part of the

4996
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:08,040
separate thing or is it part of the
 

4997
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:10,550
separate thing or is it part of the
compilation so you start from simple and

4998
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:10,560
compilation so you start from simple and
 

4999
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,770
compilation so you start from simple and
predictable models and so you can have

5000
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:12,780
predictable models and so you can have
 

5001
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,450
predictable models and so you can have
full control and you can have coarse

5002
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:14,460
full control and you can have coarse
 

5003
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,570
full control and you can have coarse
grain knobs that like nudge system so

5004
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:17,580
grain knobs that like nudge system so
 

5005
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,070
grain knobs that like nudge system so
you don't have to do this but if you

5006
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:19,080
you don't have to do this but if you
 

5007
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,530
you don't have to do this but if you
really care about getting the best you

5008
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:21,540
really care about getting the best you
 

5009
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:22,850
really care about getting the best you
know the last ounce out of a problem

5010
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:22,860
know the last ounce out of a problem
 

5011
01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:25,550
know the last ounce out of a problem
then you can use additional tools and

5012
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:25,560
then you can use additional tools and
 

5013
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,689
then you can use additional tools and
they're the cool thing is you don't want

5014
01:25:26,689 --> 01:25:26,699
they're the cool thing is you don't want
 

5015
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:28,010
they're the cool thing is you don't want
to do this every time you run a model

5016
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:28,020
to do this every time you run a model
 

5017
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:29,810
to do this every time you run a model
you want to figure out the right answer

5018
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:29,820
you want to figure out the right answer
 

5019
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,450
you want to figure out the right answer
and then cache it and once you do that

5020
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:32,460
and then cache it and once you do that
 

5021
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,729
and then cache it and once you do that
you can get you can say okay cool I can

5022
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:34,739
you can get you can say okay cool I can
 

5023
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:36,770
you can get you can say okay cool I can
get up and running very quickly I can

5024
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:36,780
get up and running very quickly I can
 

5025
01:25:36,780 --> 01:25:40,250
get up and running very quickly I can
get good execution out of my system I

5026
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:40,260
get good execution out of my system I
 

5027
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,990
get good execution out of my system I
can decide if something's important and

5028
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,000
can decide if something's important and
 

5029
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,310
can decide if something's important and
if it's important I can go through a

5030
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:43,320
if it's important I can go through a
 

5031
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,870
if it's important I can go through a
bunch of machines at it and do a big

5032
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:44,880
bunch of machines at it and do a big
 

5033
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,729
bunch of machines at it and do a big
expensive search over the space using

5034
01:25:46,729 --> 01:25:46,739
expensive search over the space using
 

5035
01:25:46,739 --> 01:25:48,050
expensive search over the space using
whatever technique I feel like it's

5036
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:48,060
whatever technique I feel like it's
 

5037
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:50,510
whatever technique I feel like it's
further up to the problem and then when

5038
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:50,520
further up to the problem and then when
 

5039
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,890
further up to the problem and then when
I get the right answer cool I can just

5040
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:51,900
I get the right answer cool I can just
 

5041
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,090
I get the right answer cool I can just
start using it

5042
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:53,100
start using it
 

5043
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,310
start using it
right and so you can get out of this um

5044
01:25:55,310 --> 01:25:55,320
right and so you can get out of this um
 

5045
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,470
right and so you can get out of this um
this trade-off between okay am I gonna

5046
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:57,480
this trade-off between okay am I gonna
 

5047
01:25:57,480 --> 01:25:59,270
this trade-off between okay am I gonna
like spend forever doing a thing or do I

5048
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,280
like spend forever doing a thing or do I
 

5049
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,129
like spend forever doing a thing or do I
get up and running quickly and it's a

5050
01:26:01,129 --> 01:26:01,139
get up and running quickly and it's a
 

5051
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:02,390
get up and running quickly and it's a
quality result like these these are

5052
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:02,400
quality result like these these are
 

5053

you started and did a little bit of a

5058
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:09,840
you started and did a little bit of a
 

5059
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,770
you started and did a little bit of a
whirlwind overview of how you get 35 000

5060
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:12,780
whirlwind overview of how you get 35 000

um Jeremy Howard did a really great

5064
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:19,260
um Jeremy Howard did a really great
 

5065
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,229
um Jeremy Howard did a really great
presentation about sort of the basic

5066
01:26:21,229 --> 01:26:21,239
presentation about sort of the basic
 

5067
01:26:21,239 --> 01:26:23,090
presentation about sort of the basic
like look at the code here's how you get

5068
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:23,100
like look at the code here's how you get
 

5069
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,709
like look at the code here's how you get
the speed up like you said that's

5070
01:26:24,709 --> 01:26:24,719
the speed up like you said that's
 

5071
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,390
the speed up like you said that's
something we could uh probably

5072
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:26,400
something we could uh probably
 

5073
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,910
something we could uh probably
developers can do for their own code to

5074
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:28,920
developers can do for their own code to
 

5075
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,649
developers can do for their own code to
see how you can get these gigantic

5076
01:26:30,649 --> 01:26:30,659
see how you can get these gigantic
 

5077
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:32,930
see how you can get these gigantic
Speedos but can you maybe speak to the

5078
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:32,940
Speedos but can you maybe speak to the
 

5079
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:34,490
Speedos but can you maybe speak to the
machine learning task in general how do

5080
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:34,500
machine learning task in general how do
 

5081
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:35,689
machine learning task in general how do
you how do you make some of this code

5082
01:26:35,689 --> 01:26:35,699
you how do you make some of this code
 

5083
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:38,750
you how do you make some of this code
fast and specifics like what would you

5084
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:38,760
fast and specifics like what would you
 

5085
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,530
fast and specifics like what would you
say is the main bottleneck

5086
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:41,540
say is the main bottleneck
 

5087
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:45,290
say is the main bottleneck
uh for uh machine learning tasks so are

5088
01:26:45,290 --> 01:26:45,300
uh for uh machine learning tasks so are
 

5089
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:48,350
uh for uh machine learning tasks so are
we talking about uh Matt Mall matrix

5090
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:48,360
we talking about uh Matt Mall matrix
 

5091
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:49,970
we talking about uh Matt Mall matrix
multiplication how do you make that fast

5092
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:49,980
multiplication how do you make that fast
 

5093
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:52,430
multiplication how do you make that fast
so I mean if you just look at the python

5094
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:52,440
so I mean if you just look at the python
 

5095
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,229
so I mean if you just look at the python
problem right you can say how do I make

5096
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
problem right you can say how do I make
 

5097
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:55,790
problem right you can say how do I make
python faster

5098
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:55,800
python faster
 

5099
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,050
python faster
there's been a lot of people that have

5100
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:57,060
there's been a lot of people that have
 

5101
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,189
there's been a lot of people that have
been working on the

01:26:58,189 --> 01:26:58,199
been working on the
 

5103
01:26:58,199 --> 01:27:00,590
been working on the
okay how to make python 2x faster 10xs

now when you when you just say how how

5130
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:27,300
now when you when you just say how how
 

5131
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,510
now when you when you just say how how
gutsy that is to be in the meeting and

01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,520
gutsy that is to be in the meeting and
 

5133
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,830
gutsy that is to be in the meeting and
as opposed to trying to see how do we

5134
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:30,840
as opposed to trying to see how do we
 

5135
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,510
as opposed to trying to see how do we
get the Improvement it's like what can

5136
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:32,520
get the Improvement it's like what can
 

5137
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,770
get the Improvement it's like what can
the physics do

5138
01:27:33,770 --> 01:27:33,780
the physics do
 

5139
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,050
the physics do
I mean maybe I'm a special kind of nerd

5140
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:36,060
I mean maybe I'm a special kind of nerd
 

5141
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,149
I mean maybe I'm a special kind of nerd
but you look at that what is the limit

5142
01:27:38,149 --> 01:27:38,159
but you look at that what is the limit
 

5143
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:40,189
but you look at that what is the limit
of physics how fast can these things go

5144
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:40,199
of physics how fast can these things go
 

5145
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:41,149
of physics how fast can these things go
right

5146
01:27:41,149 --> 01:27:41,159
right
 

5147
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:43,250
right
when you start looking at that typically

5148
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:43,260
when you start looking at that typically
 

5149
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:45,530
when you start looking at that typically
it ends up being a memory problem right

5150
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:45,540
it ends up being a memory problem right
 

5151
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:48,169
it ends up being a memory problem right
and so today uh particularly with these

5152
01:27:48,169 --> 01:27:48,179
and so today uh particularly with these
 

5153
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:50,149
and so today uh particularly with these
specialized accelerators the problem is

5154
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
specialized accelerators the problem is
 

5155
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:52,189
specialized accelerators the problem is
that you can do a lot of math within

5156
01:27:52,189 --> 01:27:52,199
that you can do a lot of math within
 

5157
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:55,189
that you can do a lot of math within
them but you get bottleneck sending data

5158
01:27:55,189 --> 01:27:55,199
them but you get bottleneck sending data
 

5159
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,169
them but you get bottleneck sending data
back and forth to memory whether it be

5160
01:27:57,169 --> 01:27:57,179
back and forth to memory whether it be
 

5161
01:27:57,179 --> 01:28:00,229
back and forth to memory whether it be
local memory or distant memory or disk

5162
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:00,239
local memory or distant memory or disk
 

5163
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,570
local memory or distant memory or disk
or whatever it is and and that that

5164
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:02,580
or whatever it is and and that that
 

5165
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,430
or whatever it is and and that that
bottleneck particularly is the training

5166
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:04,440
bottleneck particularly is the training
 

5167
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,830
bottleneck particularly is the training
sizes get large as you start doing tons

5168
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:06,840
sizes get large as you start doing tons
 

5169
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,750
sizes get large as you start doing tons
of inferences all over the place like

5170
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:08,760
of inferences all over the place like
 

5171
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,490
of inferences all over the place like
that becomes a huge bottleneck for

5172
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:10,500
that becomes a huge bottleneck for
 

5173
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:11,930
that becomes a huge bottleneck for
people right

5174
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:11,940
people right
 

5175
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:14,149
people right
so again what happened is we went

5176
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
so again what happened is we went
 

5177
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:15,709
so again what happened is we went
through a phase of many years where

5178
01:28:15,709 --> 01:28:15,719
through a phase of many years where
 

5179
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:17,570
through a phase of many years where
people took the special case and hand

5180
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:17,580
people took the special case and hand
 

5181
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,970
people took the special case and hand
tuned it and tweaked it and tricked it

5182
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:19,980
tuned it and tweaked it and tricked it
 

5183
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:20,870
tuned it and tweaked it and tricked it
out and they knew exactly how the

5184
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:20,880
out and they knew exactly how the
 

5185
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:21,830
out and they knew exactly how the
hardware worked and they knew the model

5186
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:21,840
hardware worked and they knew the model
 

5187
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,930
hardware worked and they knew the model
and they made it they made it fast

5188
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:23,940
and they made it they made it fast
 

5189
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:25,490
and they made it they made it fast
didn't generalize

5190
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:25,500
didn't generalize
 

5191
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,649
didn't generalize
and so you can make you know resting at

5192
01:28:27,649 --> 01:28:27,659
and so you can make you know resting at
 

5193
01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:29,570
and so you can make you know resting at
50 or some or Alex net or something

5194
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:29,580
50 or some or Alex net or something
 

5195
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,250
50 or some or Alex net or something
Inception V1 like you can you can do

5196
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:31,260
Inception V1 like you can you can do
 

5197
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:32,930
Inception V1 like you can you can do
that right because the models are small

5198
01:28:32,930 --> 01:28:32,940
that right because the models are small
 

5199
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,930
that right because the models are small
they fit in your head right but as the

5200
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:35,940
they fit in your head right but as the
 

5201
01:28:35,940 --> 01:28:37,669
they fit in your head right but as the
models get bigger more complicated as

5202
01:28:37,669 --> 01:28:37,679
models get bigger more complicated as
 

5203
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,649
models get bigger more complicated as
the machines get more complicated it

5204
01:28:39,649 --> 01:28:39,659
the machines get more complicated it
 

5205
01:28:39,659 --> 01:28:41,810
the machines get more complicated it
stops working right and so this is where

5206
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:41,820
stops working right and so this is where
 

5207
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:44,689
stops working right and so this is where
things like kernel Fusion come in so

5208
01:28:44,689 --> 01:28:44,699
things like kernel Fusion come in so
 

5209
01:28:44,699 --> 01:28:46,370
things like kernel Fusion come in so
what is Chrono Fusion this is this idea

5210
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:46,380
what is Chrono Fusion this is this idea
 

5211
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:48,410
what is Chrono Fusion this is this idea
of saying let's avoid going to memory

5212
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:48,420
of saying let's avoid going to memory
 

5213
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,450
of saying let's avoid going to memory
and let's do that by building a new

5214
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:50,460
and let's do that by building a new
 

5215
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:55,490
and let's do that by building a new
hybrid kernel a numerical algorithm that

5216
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:55,500
hybrid kernel a numerical algorithm that
 

5217
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,010
hybrid kernel a numerical algorithm that
actually keeps things in the accelerator

5218
01:28:58,010 --> 01:28:58,020
actually keeps things in the accelerator
 

5219
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:59,390
actually keeps things in the accelerator
instead of having to write all the way

5220
01:28:59,390 --> 01:28:59,400
instead of having to write all the way
 

5221
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,669
instead of having to write all the way
out to memory all right what's happened

5222
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:01,679
out to memory all right what's happened
 

5223
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,410
out to memory all right what's happened
with with these accelerators now is you

5224
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:03,420
with with these accelerators now is you
 

5225
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,030
with with these accelerators now is you
get multiple levels of memory like in a

5226
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,040
get multiple levels of memory like in a
 

5227
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,590
get multiple levels of memory like in a
GPU for example you'll have Global

5228
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:06,600
GPU for example you'll have Global
 

5229
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,169
GPU for example you'll have Global
memory and local memory and like all

5230
01:29:09,169 --> 01:29:09,179
memory and local memory and like all
 

5231
01:29:09,179 --> 01:29:10,669
memory and local memory and like all
these things

5232
01:29:10,669 --> 01:29:10,679
these things
 

5233
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:12,709
these things
um if you zoom way into how Hardware

5234
01:29:12,709 --> 01:29:12,719
um if you zoom way into how Hardware
 

5235
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:15,290
um if you zoom way into how Hardware
works the register file is actually a

5236
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:15,300
works the register file is actually a
 

5237
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,370
works the register file is actually a
memory

5238
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:16,380
memory
 

5239
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,410
memory
so the registers are like an L zero

5240
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:18,420
so the registers are like an L zero
 

5241
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,709
so the registers are like an L zero
cache and so a lot of taking advantage

5242
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:21,719
cache and so a lot of taking advantage
 

5243
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:24,770
cache and so a lot of taking advantage
of the hardware ends up being fully

5244
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:24,780
of the hardware ends up being fully
 

5245
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:26,570
of the hardware ends up being fully
utilizing the full power

5246
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:26,580
utilizing the full power
 

5247
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:29,870
utilizing the full power
in all of its capability and this has a

5248
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:29,880
in all of its capability and this has a
 

5249
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,310
in all of its capability and this has a
number of problems right one of which is

5250
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:31,320
number of problems right one of which is
 

5251
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,590
number of problems right one of which is
again the complexity of disaster right

5252
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:33,600
again the complexity of disaster right
 

5253
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,570
again the complexity of disaster right
there's too much Hardware even if you

5254
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:35,580
there's too much Hardware even if you
 

5255
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,149
there's too much Hardware even if you
just say let's look at the chips from

5256
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:38,159
just say let's look at the chips from
 

5257
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:40,310
just say let's look at the chips from
one line of vendor like apple or Intel

5258
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
one line of vendor like apple or Intel
 

5259
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,689
one line of vendor like apple or Intel
or whatever it is

5260
01:29:41,689 --> 01:29:41,699
or whatever it is
 

5261
01:29:41,699 --> 01:29:44,149
or whatever it is
each version of the chip comes out with

5262
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:44,159
each version of the chip comes out with
 

5263
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:45,950
each version of the chip comes out with
new features and they change things so

5264
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:45,960
new features and they change things so
 

5265
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,570
new features and they change things so
that it takes more time or less time to

5266
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:47,580
that it takes more time or less time to
 

5267
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:48,590
that it takes more time or less time to
do different things and you can't

5268
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:48,600
do different things and you can't
 

5269
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,689
do different things and you can't
rewrite all the software whenever a new

5270
01:29:50,689 --> 01:29:50,699
rewrite all the software whenever a new
 

5271
01:29:50,699 --> 01:29:52,610
rewrite all the software whenever a new
chip comes out right and so this is

5272
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:52,620
chip comes out right and so this is
 

5273
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,990
chip comes out right and so this is
where you need a much more scalable

5274
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:54,000
where you need a much more scalable
 

5275
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,030
where you need a much more scalable
approach and this is what Mojo and what

5276
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:56,040
approach and this is what Mojo and what
 

5277
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,709
approach and this is what Mojo and what
the modular stack provides is it

5278
01:29:57,709 --> 01:29:57,719
the modular stack provides is it
 

5279
01:29:57,719 --> 01:29:59,930
the modular stack provides is it
provides this infrastructure and the

5280
01:29:59,930 --> 01:29:59,940
provides this infrastructure and the
 

5281
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,850
provides this infrastructure and the
system for factoring all this complexity

5282
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:01,860
system for factoring all this complexity
 

5283
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:03,470
system for factoring all this complexity
and then allowing people to express

5284
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:03,480
and then allowing people to express
 

5285
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,330
and then allowing people to express
algorithms you talk about Auto tuning

5286
01:30:05,330 --> 01:30:05,340
algorithms you talk about Auto tuning
 

5287
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,970
algorithms you talk about Auto tuning
for example Express algorithms in a more

5288
01:30:07,970 --> 01:30:07,980
for example Express algorithms in a more
 

5289
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:10,370
for example Express algorithms in a more
portable way so that when a new chip

5290
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:10,380
portable way so that when a new chip
 

5291
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:11,629
portable way so that when a new chip
comes out you have to you don't have to

5292
01:30:11,629 --> 01:30:11,639
comes out you have to you don't have to
 

5293
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,430
comes out you have to you don't have to
rewrite it all

5294
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:13,440
rewrite it all
 

5295
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,770
rewrite it all
so to me like you know I kind of joke

5296
01:30:15,770 --> 01:30:15,780
so to me like you know I kind of joke
 

5297
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,629
so to me like you know I kind of joke
like what is a compiler well there's

5298
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:17,639
like what is a compiler well there's
 

5299
01:30:17,639 --> 01:30:20,149
like what is a compiler well there's
many ways to explain that you convert

5300
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:20,159
many ways to explain that you convert
 

5301
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:22,610
many ways to explain that you convert
thing a into thing B and you convert

5302
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:22,620
thing a into thing B and you convert
 

5303
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,290
thing a into thing B and you convert
source code to machine code like you can

5304
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:24,300
source code to machine code like you can
 

5305
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:26,090
source code to machine code like you can
talk about many many

5306
01:30:26,090 --> 01:30:26,100
talk about many many
 

5307
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,669
talk about many many
things that compilers do but to me it's

5308
01:30:28,669 --> 01:30:28,679
things that compilers do but to me it's
 

5309
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:31,729
things that compilers do but to me it's
about a bag of tricks it's about a

5310
01:30:31,729 --> 01:30:31,739
about a bag of tricks it's about a
 

5311
01:30:31,739 --> 01:30:33,890
about a bag of tricks it's about a
system and a framework that you can hang

5312
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:33,900
system and a framework that you can hang
 

5313
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,410
system and a framework that you can hang
complexity it's a system that can then

5314
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:36,420
complexity it's a system that can then
 

5315
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:38,090
complexity it's a system that can then

5316
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:38,100
generalize and it can work on problems
 

5317
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,830
generalize and it can work on problems
that are bigger than fit in one human's

5318
01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:39,840
that are bigger than fit in one human's
 

5319
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,070
that are bigger than fit in one human's
head right and so what that means what a

5320
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:43,080
head right and so what that means what a
 

5321
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,350
head right and so what that means what a
good stack and what the modular stack

5322
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:45,360
good stack and what the modular stack
 

5323
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,689
good stack and what the modular stack
provides is the ability to walk up to it

5324
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:47,699
provides is the ability to walk up to it
 

5325
01:30:47,699 --> 01:30:49,550
provides is the ability to walk up to it
with a new problem and it'll generally

5326
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:49,560
with a new problem and it'll generally
 

5327
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,350
with a new problem and it'll generally
work quite well

5328
01:30:51,350 --> 01:30:51,360
work quite well
 

5329
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:52,790
work quite well
and that's something a lot of machine

5330
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
and that's something a lot of machine
 

5331
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,530
and that's something a lot of machine
learning infrastructure and tools and

it's always been this kind of flaky set

5352
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:16,320
it's always been this kind of flaky set
 

5353
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,689
it's always been this kind of flaky set
of tooling that's never been integrated

of tooling that's never been integrated
 

5355
01:31:17,699 --> 01:31:20,149
of tooling that's never been integrated
well and it's been uh never worked

5356
01:31:20,149 --> 01:31:20,159
well and it's been uh never worked
 

5357
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:22,370
well and it's been uh never worked
together and because it's not designed

5358
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:22,380
together and because it's not designed
 

5359
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:24,169

it's built by different Hardware vendors
 

5363
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:26,990
it's built by different Hardware vendors
it's built by different systems it's

that are trying to solve their their
 

5369
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:32,450
that are trying to solve their their
problems right and so that means that we

5370
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:32,460
problems right and so that means that we
 

5371
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:34,370
problems right and so that means that we
get this fragmented terrible mess of

so I mean the specifics of Emily Jeremy

5376
01:31:38,629 --> 01:31:38,639
so I mean the specifics of Emily Jeremy
 

5377
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,490
so I mean the specifics of Emily Jeremy
showed this uh there's the vectorize

5378
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:40,500
showed this uh there's the vectorize
 

5379
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:43,070
showed this uh there's the vectorize
function which I guess is

5380
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:43,080
function which I guess is
 

5381
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,270
function which I guess is
uh built in to the uh into Mojo does

5382
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:47,280
uh built in to the uh into Mojo does
 

5383
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,830
uh built in to the uh into Mojo does
that vectorized as he showed is built

5384
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:48,840
that vectorized as he showed is built
 

5385
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:50,090
that vectorized as he showed is built
into the library into the library

into the library into the library
 

5387
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,070
into the library into the library
instead of the library

5388
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:52,080
instead of the library

um vectorized paralyze

5390
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:54,020
um vectorized paralyze
 

5391
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:56,450
um vectorized paralyze
which vectorizes more low-level

5392
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:56,460
which vectorizes more low-level
 

5393
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:58,850
which vectorizes more low-level
paralyzes higher level there's the

5394
01:31:58,850 --> 01:31:58,860
paralyzes higher level there's the
 

5395
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,169
paralyzes higher level there's the
tiling thing which is how he

5396
01:32:00,169 --> 01:32:00,179
tiling thing which is how he
 

5397
01:32:00,179 --> 01:32:02,410
tiling thing which is how he
demonstrated the um

5398
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:02,420
demonstrated the um
 

5399
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:05,330
demonstrated the um
autotune I think so so think of think

5400
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:05,340
autotune I think so so think of think
 

5401
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,910
autotune I think so so think of think
about this in like levels hierarchical

5402
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:07,920
about this in like levels hierarchical
 

5403
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:11,090
about this in like levels hierarchical
levels of abstraction right and so it at

5404
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:11,100
levels of abstraction right and so it at
 

5405
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:12,830
levels of abstraction right and so it at
the very if you zoom all the way into a

5406
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:12,840
the very if you zoom all the way into a
 

5407
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:14,330
the very if you zoom all the way into a
compute problem you have one floating

5408
01:32:14,330 --> 01:32:14,340
compute problem you have one floating
 

5409
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:16,430
compute problem you have one floating
Point number right so then you say okay

5410
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:16,440
Point number right so then you say okay
 

5411
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,410
Point number right so then you say okay
I want to be I can do things one at a

5412
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:18,420
I want to be I can do things one at a
 

5413
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:21,470
I want to be I can do things one at a
time in an interpreter it's pretty slow

5414
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:21,480
time in an interpreter it's pretty slow
 

5415
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,930
time in an interpreter it's pretty slow
right so I can get to doing one one at a

5416
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:23,940
right so I can get to doing one one at a
 

5417
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:26,570
right so I can get to doing one one at a
time in a compiler I can see then I can

5418
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:26,580
time in a compiler I can see then I can
 

5419
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:29,270
time in a compiler I can see then I can
get to doing four or eight or 16 at a

5420
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:29,280
get to doing four or eight or 16 at a
 

5421
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,189
get to doing four or eight or 16 at a
time with vectors that's called

5422
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:31,199
time with vectors that's called
 

5423
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,629
time with vectors that's called
vectorization

5424
01:32:32,629 --> 01:32:32,639
vectorization
 

5425
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,310
vectorization
then you can say hey I have a whole

5426
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:34,320
then you can say hey I have a whole
 

5427
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:35,629
then you can say hey I have a whole
bunch of different

5428
01:32:35,629 --> 01:32:35,639
bunch of different
 

5429
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:37,550
bunch of different
you know what what a multi-core computer

5430
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:37,560
you know what what a multi-core computer
 

5431
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,709
you know what what a multi-core computer
is is it's basically a bunch of

5432
01:32:39,709 --> 01:32:39,719
is is it's basically a bunch of
 

5433
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:40,669
is is it's basically a bunch of
computers

5434
01:32:40,669 --> 01:32:40,679
computers
 

5435
01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:42,050
computers
right so they're all independent

5436
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:42,060
right so they're all independent
 

5437
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:43,729
right so they're all independent
computers that can talk to each other

5438
01:32:43,729 --> 01:32:43,739
computers that can talk to each other
 

5439
01:32:43,739 --> 01:32:45,830
computers that can talk to each other
and they share memory and so now what

5440
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:45,840
and they share memory and so now what
 

5441
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,629
and they share memory and so now what
parallelized does it says okay run

5442
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:47,639
parallelized does it says okay run
 

5443
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:49,310
parallelized does it says okay run
multiple instances this on different

5444
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:49,320
multiple instances this on different
 

5445
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,410
multiple instances this on different
computers and now they can all work

5446
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:51,420
computers and now they can all work
 

5447
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,729
computers and now they can all work
together on Chrome right and so what

5448
01:32:52,729 --> 01:32:52,739
together on Chrome right and so what
 

5449
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:54,350
together on Chrome right and so what
you're doing is you're saying keep going

5450
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:54,360
you're doing is you're saying keep going
 

5451
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:57,709
you're doing is you're saying keep going
out to the next level out and and as you

5452
01:32:57,709 --> 01:32:57,719
out to the next level out and and as you
 

5453
01:32:57,719 --> 01:32:59,330
out to the next level out and and as you
do that how do I take advantage of this

5454
01:32:59,330 --> 01:32:59,340
do that how do I take advantage of this
 

5455
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:02,570
do that how do I take advantage of this
so tiling is a memory optimization right

5456
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:02,580
so tiling is a memory optimization right
 

5457
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:04,430
so tiling is a memory optimization right
it says okay let's make sure that we're

5458
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:04,440
it says okay let's make sure that we're
 

5459
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,470
it says okay let's make sure that we're
keeping the data close to the compute

5460
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:06,480
keeping the data close to the compute
 

5461
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,810
keeping the data close to the compute
part of the problem instead of sending

5462
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:08,820
part of the problem instead of sending
 

5463
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:10,729
part of the problem instead of sending
it all back and forth through memory

5464
01:33:10,729 --> 01:33:10,739
it all back and forth through memory
 

5465
01:33:10,739 --> 01:33:13,550
it all back and forth through memory
every every time I load a block and the

5466
01:33:13,550 --> 01:33:13,560
every every time I load a block and the
 

5467
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,470
every every time I load a block and the
size of the block size is is all that's

5468
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:15,480
size of the block size is is all that's
 

5469
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,270
size of the block size is is all that's
how you get to the auto tune to make

5470
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:17,280
how you get to the auto tune to make
 

5471
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,129
how you get to the auto tune to make
sure it's optimized yeah well so all of

5472
01:33:19,129 --> 01:33:19,139
sure it's optimized yeah well so all of
 

5473
01:33:19,139 --> 01:33:20,689
sure it's optimized yeah well so all of
these The Details Matter so much to get

5474
01:33:20,689 --> 01:33:20,699
these The Details Matter so much to get
 

5475
01:33:20,699 --> 01:33:23,030
these The Details Matter so much to get
good performance this is another funny

5476
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:23,040
good performance this is another funny
 

5477
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,709
good performance this is another funny
thing about machine learning and high

5478
01:33:24,709 --> 01:33:24,719
thing about machine learning and high
 

5479
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,570
thing about machine learning and high
performance Computing that is very

5480
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:26,580
performance Computing that is very
 

5481
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:29,090
performance Computing that is very
different than C compilers we all grew

5482
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:29,100
different than C compilers we all grew
 

5483
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:31,370
different than C compilers we all grew
up grew up with where you know if you

5484
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:31,380
up grew up with where you know if you
 

5485
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,350
up grew up with where you know if you
get a new version of GCC or new version

5486
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,360
get a new version of GCC or new version
 

5487
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,510
get a new version of GCC or new version
of clang or something like that you know

5488
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:35,520
of clang or something like that you know
 

5489
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,250
of clang or something like that you know
maybe something will go one percent

5490
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:37,260
maybe something will go one percent
 

5491
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:38,689
maybe something will go one percent
faster

5492
01:33:38,689 --> 01:33:38,699
faster
 

5493
01:33:38,699 --> 01:33:41,570
faster
right and so compiler insurers will work

5494
01:33:41,570 --> 01:33:41,580
right and so compiler insurers will work
 

5495
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,250
right and so compiler insurers will work
really really really hard to get half a

5496
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:43,260
really really really hard to get half a
 

5497
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,410
really really really hard to get half a
percent out of your C code something

5498
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:45,420
percent out of your C code something
 

5499
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:47,450
percent out of your C code something
like that but when you're talking about

5500
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:47,460
like that but when you're talking about
 

5501
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:50,209
like that but when you're talking about
an accelerator or an AI application or

5502
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:50,219
an accelerator or an AI application or
 

5503
01:33:50,219 --> 01:33:52,149
an accelerator or an AI application or
you're talking about these kinds of

5504
01:33:52,149 --> 01:33:52,159
you're talking about these kinds of
 

5505
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,290
you're talking about these kinds of
algorithms now these are things people

5506
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:54,300
algorithms now these are things people
 

5507
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,850
algorithms now these are things people
used to write in Fortran for example

5508
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:55,860
used to write in Fortran for example
 

5509
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:56,930
used to write in Fortran for example
right

5510
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:56,940
right
 

5511
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,910
right
if you get it wrong it's not five

5512
01:33:58,910 --> 01:33:58,920
if you get it wrong it's not five
 

5513
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,250
if you get it wrong it's not five
percent or one percent it could be 2X or

5514
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:01,260
percent or one percent it could be 2X or
 

5515
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:04,790
percent or one percent it could be 2X or
10x right if you think about it

5516
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:04,800
10x right if you think about it
 

5517
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,010
10x right if you think about it
um you really want to make use of the

5518
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:07,020
um you really want to make use of the
 

5519
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:08,450
um you really want to make use of the
full memory you have the cash for

5520
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:08,460
full memory you have the cash for
 

5521
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,970
full memory you have the cash for
example but if you use too much space it

5522
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:10,980
example but if you use too much space it
 

5523
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:12,110
example but if you use too much space it
doesn't fit in the cache now you're

5524
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:12,120
doesn't fit in the cache now you're
 

5525
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,370
doesn't fit in the cache now you're
going to be thrashing all the way back

5526
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:13,380
going to be thrashing all the way back
 

5527
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,010
going to be thrashing all the way back
out to main memory and these can be 2x

5528
01:34:16,010 --> 01:34:16,020
out to main memory and these can be 2x
 

5529
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:19,010
out to main memory and these can be 2x
10x Major Performance differences and so

5530
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:19,020
10x Major Performance differences and so
 

5531
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,810
10x Major Performance differences and so
this is where getting these magic

5532
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:20,820
this is where getting these magic
 

5533
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,430
this is where getting these magic
numbers and these things right is really

5534
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:22,440
numbers and these things right is really
 

5535
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,530
numbers and these things right is really
actually quite important so you

5536
01:34:24,530 --> 01:34:24,540
actually quite important so you
 

5537
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,990
actually quite important so you
mentioned that moja is a superset of

5538
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:27,000
mentioned that moja is a superset of
 

5539
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,750
mentioned that moja is a superset of
python

5540
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:29,760

 

5541
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:31,250

can you run

5542
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:31,260
can you run
 

5543
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,530
can you run
python code

5544
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:33,540
python code
 

5545
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:35,930
python code
as if it's Mojo code

5546
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:35,940
as if it's Mojo code
 

5547
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:41,090
as if it's Mojo code
yes yes so and so and this has two sides

5548
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:41,100
yes yes so and so and this has two sides
 

5549
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:43,070
yes yes so and so and this has two sides
of it so Mojo's not done yet so I'll

5550
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:43,080
of it so Mojo's not done yet so I'll
 

5551
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:44,390
of it so Mojo's not done yet so I'll
give you disclaimer mode it's not done

5552
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:44,400
give you disclaimer mode it's not done
 

5553
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,550
give you disclaimer mode it's not done
yet but already we see people that take

5554
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:46,560
yet but already we see people that take
 

5555
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,830
yet but already we see people that take
small pieces of python code move it over

5556
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:48,840
small pieces of python code move it over
 

5557
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,709
small pieces of python code move it over
they don't change it and you can get 12x

5558
01:34:51,709 --> 01:34:51,719
they don't change it and you can get 12x
 

5559
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:53,689
they don't change it and you can get 12x
speedups like somebody's just tweeting

5560
01:34:53,689 --> 01:34:53,699
speedups like somebody's just tweeting
 

5561
01:34:53,699 --> 01:34:55,310
speedups like somebody's just tweeting
about that yesterday which is pretty

5562
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:55,320
about that yesterday which is pretty
 

5563
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,410
about that yesterday which is pretty
cool right and again interpreters

5564
01:34:57,410 --> 01:34:57,420
cool right and again interpreters
 

5565
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:59,750
cool right and again interpreters
compilers right and so without changing

5566
01:34:59,750 --> 01:34:59,760
compilers right and so without changing
 

5567
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:02,090
compilers right and so without changing
any code without also this is not with

5568
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:02,100
any code without also this is not with
 

5569
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:04,129
any code without also this is not with
this is not jit compiling or do any

5570
01:35:04,129 --> 01:35:04,139
this is not jit compiling or do any
 

5571
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:07,189
this is not jit compiling or do any
anything fancy this is just basic stuff

5572
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:07,199
anything fancy this is just basic stuff
 

5573
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,470
anything fancy this is just basic stuff
moving straight over now Mojo will

5574
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:09,480
moving straight over now Mojo will
 

5575
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,149
moving straight over now Mojo will
continue to grow out and as it grows out

5576
01:35:11,149 --> 01:35:11,159
continue to grow out and as it grows out
 

5577
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:12,350
continue to grow out and as it grows out
it will have more and more and more

5578
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:12,360
it will have more and more and more
 

5579
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,990
it will have more and more and more
features and our North Stars to be a

5580
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:15,000
features and our North Stars to be a
 

5581
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,370
features and our North Stars to be a
full super set of python and so you can

5582
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:16,380
full super set of python and so you can
 

5583
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,270
full super set of python and so you can
bring over

5584
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:17,280
bring over
 

5585
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,370
bring over
basically arbitrary python code and have

5586
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:19,380
basically arbitrary python code and have
 

5587
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,290
basically arbitrary python code and have
it just work and it may not always be

5588
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:21,300
it just work and it may not always be
 

5589
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,169
it just work and it may not always be
12x faster but um but it should be at

5590
01:35:24,169 --> 01:35:24,179
12x faster but um but it should be at
 

5591
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:26,270
12x faster but um but it should be at
least as fast and way faster in many

5592
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:26,280
least as fast and way faster in many
 

5593
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:28,729
least as fast and way faster in many
cases this is the goal right

5594
01:35:28,729 --> 01:35:28,739
cases this is the goal right
 

5595
01:35:28,739 --> 01:35:29,330
cases this is the goal right
um

5596
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:29,340
um
 

5597
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:31,550
um
now I'll take time to do that and python

5598
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:31,560
now I'll take time to do that and python
 

5599
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,169
now I'll take time to do that and python
is a complicated language there's not

5600
01:35:33,169 --> 01:35:33,179
is a complicated language there's not
 

5601
01:35:33,179 --> 01:35:35,410
is a complicated language there's not
just the obvious things but there's also

5602
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:35,420
just the obvious things but there's also
 

5603
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:37,729
just the obvious things but there's also
non-obvious things that are complicated

5604
01:35:37,729 --> 01:35:37,739
non-obvious things that are complicated
 

5605
01:35:37,739 --> 01:35:39,169
non-obvious things that are complicated
like we have to be able to talk to C

5606
01:35:39,169 --> 01:35:39,179
like we have to be able to talk to C
 

5607
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:42,169
like we have to be able to talk to C
python packages to talk to the C API and

5608
01:35:42,169 --> 01:35:42,179
python packages to talk to the C API and
 

5609
01:35:42,179 --> 01:35:44,030
python packages to talk to the C API and
there's a bunch of there's a bunch of

5610
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:44,040
there's a bunch of there's a bunch of
 

5611
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:46,970
there's a bunch of there's a bunch of
pieces so you have to I mean to make

5612
01:35:46,970 --> 01:35:46,980
pieces so you have to I mean to make
 

5613
01:35:46,980 --> 01:35:50,090
pieces so you have to I mean to make
explicit the obvious that may not be so

5614
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:50,100
explicit the obvious that may not be so
 

5615
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,070
explicit the obvious that may not be so
obvious until you think about it so you

5616
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:52,080
obvious until you think about it so you
 

5617
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,689
obvious until you think about it so you
know to run python code that means you

5618
01:35:53,689 --> 01:35:53,699
know to run python code that means you
 

5619
01:35:53,699 --> 01:35:56,390
know to run python code that means you
have to run all the python packages and

5620
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:56,400
have to run all the python packages and
 

5621
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,570
have to run all the python packages and
libraries yeah yeah so that means what

5622
01:35:59,570 --> 01:35:59,580
libraries yeah yeah so that means what
 

5623
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:03,290
libraries yeah yeah so that means what
what's the relationship between Mojo and

5624
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:03,300
what's the relationship between Mojo and
 

5625
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:06,370
what's the relationship between Mojo and
C python the The Interpreter that's

5626
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:06,380
C python the The Interpreter that's
 

5627
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:08,750
C python the The Interpreter that's
presumably would be tasked with getting

5628
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:08,760
presumably would be tasked with getting
 

5629
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,610
presumably would be tasked with getting
those packages to work yep so in the

5630
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:10,620
those packages to work yep so in the
 

5631
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:13,729
those packages to work yep so in the
fullness of time Mojo will solve for all

5632
01:36:13,729 --> 01:36:13,739
fullness of time Mojo will solve for all
 

5633
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:14,950
fullness of time Mojo will solve for all
the problems and you'll be able to move

5634
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:14,960
the problems and you'll be able to move
 

5635
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,330
the problems and you'll be able to move
python packages over and run them in

5636
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:17,340
python packages over and run them in
 

5637
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,729
python packages over and run them in
Mojo without the C python without C

5638
01:36:19,729 --> 01:36:19,739
Mojo without the C python without C
 

5639
01:36:19,739 --> 01:36:22,189
Mojo without the C python without C
python someday yeah right it's not today

5640
01:36:22,189 --> 01:36:22,199
python someday yeah right it's not today
 

5641
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:24,590
python someday yeah right it's not today
not someday and that'll be a beautiful

5642
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:24,600
not someday and that'll be a beautiful
 

5643
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,450
not someday and that'll be a beautiful
day because then you'll get a whole

5644
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:26,460
day because then you'll get a whole
 

5645
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:27,770
day because then you'll get a whole
bunch of advantages and you'll get

5646
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:27,780
bunch of advantages and you'll get
 

5647
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:29,090
bunch of advantages and you'll get
massive speed ups and things like this

5648
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:29,100
massive speed ups and things like this
 

5649
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:30,470
massive speed ups and things like this
but you can do that one at a time right

5650
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:30,480
but you can do that one at a time right
 

5651
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,330
but you can do that one at a time right
you can move packages one exactly but

5652
01:36:32,330 --> 01:36:32,340
you can move packages one exactly but
 

5653
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:34,209
you can move packages one exactly but
but we're not willing to wait for that

5654
01:36:34,209 --> 01:36:34,219
but we're not willing to wait for that
 

5655
01:36:34,219 --> 01:36:36,830
but we're not willing to wait for that
python is too important the ecosystem is

5656
01:36:36,830 --> 01:36:36,840
python is too important the ecosystem is
 

5657
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,110
python is too important the ecosystem is
too broad uh we want to both be able to

5658
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:39,120
too broad uh we want to both be able to
 

5659
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:41,570
too broad uh we want to both be able to
build Mojo out we also want to do it the

5660
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:41,580
build Mojo out we also want to do it the
 

5661
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,550
build Mojo out we also want to do it the
right way without time like in without

5662
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:43,560
right way without time like in without
 

5663
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,410
right way without time like in without
intense time pressure we're obviously

5664
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:45,420
intense time pressure we're obviously
 

5665
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:47,270
intense time pressure we're obviously
moving fast but

5666
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:47,280
moving fast but
 

5667
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,770
moving fast but
um and so what we do is we say okay well

5668
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:48,780
um and so what we do is we say okay well
 

5669
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:50,030
um and so what we do is we say okay well
let's make it so you can import an

5670
01:36:50,030 --> 01:36:50,040
let's make it so you can import an
 

5671
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:53,990
let's make it so you can import an
arbitrary existing package

5672
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:54,000
arbitrary existing package
 

5673
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,490
arbitrary existing package
arbitrary

5674
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:55,500
arbitrary
 

5675
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,410
arbitrary
including like you write your own on

5676
01:36:57,410 --> 01:36:57,420
including like you write your own on
 

5677
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,090
including like you write your own on
your local disk or whatever it's not

5678
01:36:59,090 --> 01:36:59,100
your local disk or whatever it's not
 

5679
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:00,290
your local disk or whatever it's not
it's not like a standard like an

5680
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:00,300
it's not like a standard like an
 

5681
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:01,610
it's not like a standard like an
arbitrary package

5682
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:01,620
arbitrary package
 

5683
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:04,850
arbitrary package
and import that using C python because C

5684
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:04,860
and import that using C python because C
 

5685
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,169
and import that using C python because C
python already runs all the packages

5686
01:37:06,169 --> 01:37:06,179
python already runs all the packages
 

5687
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:08,450
python already runs all the packages
right and so what we do is we built an

5688
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:08,460
right and so what we do is we built an
 

5689
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,490
right and so what we do is we built an
integration layer where we can actually

5690
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:10,500
integration layer where we can actually
 

5691
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:15,050
integration layer where we can actually
use C python again I'm practical and to

5692
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:15,060
use C python again I'm practical and to
 

5693
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:16,550
use C python again I'm practical and to
actually just load and use all the

5694
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:16,560
actually just load and use all the
 

5695
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,950
actually just load and use all the
existing packages as they are the

5696
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:18,960
existing packages as they are the
 

5697
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,090
existing packages as they are the
downside of that is you don't get the

5698
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:20,100
downside of that is you don't get the
 

5699
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,410
downside of that is you don't get the
benefits of Mojo for those packages

5700
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:21,420
benefits of Mojo for those packages
 

5701
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,450
benefits of Mojo for those packages
right and so they'll run as fast as they

5702
01:37:23,450 --> 01:37:23,460
right and so they'll run as fast as they
 

5703
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:26,330
right and so they'll run as fast as they
do in the traditional C python way

5704
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:26,340
do in the traditional C python way
 

5705
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,370
do in the traditional C python way
but what that does is that gives you an

5706
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:28,380
but what that does is that gives you an
 

5707
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,350
but what that does is that gives you an
incremental migration path and so if you

5708
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:30,360
incremental migration path and so if you
 

5709
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,870
incremental migration path and so if you
say hey cool well here's a you know the

5710
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:32,880
say hey cool well here's a you know the
 

5711
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,729
say hey cool well here's a you know the
python ecosystem is vast I want all of

5712
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:34,739
python ecosystem is vast I want all of
 

5713
01:37:34,739 --> 01:37:36,590
python ecosystem is vast I want all of
it to just work but there's certain

5714
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:36,600
it to just work but there's certain
 

5715
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,149
it to just work but there's certain
things that are really important and so

5716
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:38,159
things that are really important and so
 

5717
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:40,490
things that are really important and so
if I if I'm doing weather forecasting or

5718
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:40,500
if I if I'm doing weather forecasting or
 

5719
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,590
if I if I'm doing weather forecasting or
something well

5720
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:42,600
something well
 

5721
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,090
something well
I want to be able to load all the data I

5722
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:44,100
I want to be able to load all the data I
 

5723
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:44,990
I want to be able to load all the data I
want to be able to work with it and then

5724
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:45,000
want to be able to work with it and then
 

5725
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,970
want to be able to work with it and then
I have my own crazy algorithm inside of

5726
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:46,980
I have my own crazy algorithm inside of
 

5727
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:48,890
I have my own crazy algorithm inside of
it Well normally I'd write that in C

5728
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:48,900
it Well normally I'd write that in C
 

5729
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,209
it Well normally I'd write that in C
plus plus

5730
01:37:50,209 --> 01:37:50,219
plus plus
 

5731
01:37:50,219 --> 01:37:51,890
plus plus
if I can write in Mojo and have one

5732
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:51,900
if I can write in Mojo and have one
 

5733
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,810
if I can write in Mojo and have one
system that scales well that's way

5734
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:53,820
system that scales well that's way
 

5735
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:55,850
system that scales well that's way
easier to work with is it hard to do

5736
01:37:55,850 --> 01:37:55,860
easier to work with is it hard to do
 

5737
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,950
easier to work with is it hard to do
that to to have that layer

5738
01:37:57,950 --> 01:37:57,960
that to to have that layer
 

5739
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,890
that to to have that layer
that's running C python because is there

5740
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:00,900
that's running C python because is there
 

5741
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:02,689
that's running C python because is there
some communication back and forth yes

5742
01:38:02,689 --> 01:38:02,699
some communication back and forth yes
 

5743
01:38:02,699 --> 01:38:04,970
some communication back and forth yes
it's complicated I mean this is what we

5744
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:04,980
it's complicated I mean this is what we
 

5745
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:07,610
it's complicated I mean this is what we
do so I mean we make it look easy but um

5746
01:38:07,610 --> 01:38:07,620
do so I mean we make it look easy but um
 

5747
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,649
do so I mean we make it look easy but um
it is it is complicated but what we do

5748
01:38:09,649 --> 01:38:09,659
it is it is complicated but what we do
 

5749
01:38:09,659 --> 01:38:10,970
it is it is complicated but what we do
is we use

5750
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:10,980
is we use
 

5751
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:13,729
is we use
the C python existing interpreter so

5752
01:38:13,729 --> 01:38:13,739
the C python existing interpreter so
 

5753
01:38:13,739 --> 01:38:15,229
the C python existing interpreter so
it's running its own byte codes and

5754
01:38:15,229 --> 01:38:15,239
it's running its own byte codes and
 

5755
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:16,010
it's running its own byte codes and
that's how it provides full

5756
01:38:16,010 --> 01:38:16,020
that's how it provides full
 

5757
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:18,770
that's how it provides full
compatibility and then it gives us C

5758
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:18,780
compatibility and then it gives us C
 

5759
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:21,890
compatibility and then it gives us C
python objects and we use those objects

5760
01:38:21,890 --> 01:38:21,900
python objects and we use those objects
 

5761
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:24,590
python objects and we use those objects
as is and so that way we're fully

5762
01:38:24,590 --> 01:38:24,600
as is and so that way we're fully
 

5763
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,570
as is and so that way we're fully
compatible with all the C python objects

5764
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:26,580
compatible with all the C python objects
 

5765
01:38:26,580 --> 01:38:29,090
compatible with all the C python objects
and all the the you know it's not just

5766
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:29,100
and all the the you know it's not just
 

5767
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:31,189
and all the the you know it's not just
the python part it's also the C packages

5768
01:38:31,189 --> 01:38:31,199
the python part it's also the C packages
 

5769
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:33,229
the python part it's also the C packages
the C libraries underneath them because

5770
01:38:33,229 --> 01:38:33,239
the C libraries underneath them because
 

5771
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:35,390
the C libraries underneath them because
they're often hybrid and so we can fully

5772
01:38:35,390 --> 01:38:35,400
they're often hybrid and so we can fully
 

5773
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,709
they're often hybrid and so we can fully
run and we're fully compatible with all

5774
01:38:36,709 --> 01:38:36,719
run and we're fully compatible with all
 

5775
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:38,750
run and we're fully compatible with all
that and the way we do that is that we

5776
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:38,760
that and the way we do that is that we
 

5777
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:40,550
that and the way we do that is that we
have to play by the rules right and so

5778
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:40,560
have to play by the rules right and so
 

5779
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,050
have to play by the rules right and so
we we keep objects in that

5780
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:42,060
we we keep objects in that
 

5781
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:43,910
we we keep objects in that
representation when they're coming from

5782
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:43,920
representation when they're coming from
 

5783
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,470
representation when they're coming from
that world what's the representation

5784
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:45,480
that world what's the representation
 

5785
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:47,810
that world what's the representation
that's being used in memory you'd have

5786
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:47,820
that's being used in memory you'd have
 

5787
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:49,790
that's being used in memory you'd have
to know a lot about how the C python

5788
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:49,800
to know a lot about how the C python
 

5789
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,970
to know a lot about how the C python
interpreter works it has for example

5790
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:52,980
interpreter works it has for example
 

5791
01:38:52,980 --> 01:38:54,350
interpreter works it has for example
reference counting but also different

5792
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:54,360
reference counting but also different
 

5793
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:56,629
reference counting but also different
rules on how to pass pointers around and

5794
01:38:56,629 --> 01:38:56,639
rules on how to pass pointers around and
 

5795
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:58,850
rules on how to pass pointers around and
things like this super low level fiddly

5796
01:38:58,850 --> 01:38:58,860
things like this super low level fiddly
 

5797
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:01,250
things like this super low level fiddly
and it's not like python it's like how

5798
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:01,260
and it's not like python it's like how
 

5799
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:03,590
and it's not like python it's like how
The Interpreter works okay and so that

5800
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:03,600
The Interpreter works okay and so that
 

5801
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,450
The Interpreter works okay and so that
gets all exposed out and then you have

5802
01:39:05,450 --> 01:39:05,460
gets all exposed out and then you have
 

5803
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:07,550
gets all exposed out and then you have
to Define wrappers around the low level

5804
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:07,560
to Define wrappers around the low level
 

5805
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:10,310
to Define wrappers around the low level
C code right and so

5806
01:39:10,310 --> 01:39:10,320
C code right and so
 

5807
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,169
C code right and so
what this means is you have to know not

5808
01:39:12,169 --> 01:39:12,179
what this means is you have to know not
 

5809
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:13,669
what this means is you have to know not
only C

5810
01:39:13,669 --> 01:39:13,679
only C
 

5811
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:15,590
only C
which is a different world from python

5812
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:15,600
which is a different world from python
 

5813
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,410
which is a different world from python
obviously not only python but the

5814
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:18,420
obviously not only python but the
 

5815
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:20,209
obviously not only python but the
rappers but The Interpreter and the

5816
01:39:20,209 --> 01:39:20,219
rappers but The Interpreter and the
 

5817
01:39:20,219 --> 01:39:21,709
rappers but The Interpreter and the
rappers and the implementation details

5818
01:39:21,709 --> 01:39:21,719
rappers and the implementation details
 

5819
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:23,330
rappers and the implementation details
and the conventions and it's just this

5820
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:23,340
and the conventions and it's just this
 

5821
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:25,610
and the conventions and it's just this
really complicated mess and when you do

5822
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:25,620
really complicated mess and when you do
 

5823
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,290
really complicated mess and when you do
that now suddenly you have a debugger

5824
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:27,300
that now suddenly you have a debugger
 

5825
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,570
that now suddenly you have a debugger
that debugs python they can't step into

5826
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:29,580
that debugs python they can't step into
 

5827
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:30,830
that debugs python they can't step into
C code

5828
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:30,840
C code
 

5829
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,270
C code
right so you have this two world problem

5830
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:32,280
right so you have this two world problem
 

5831
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:35,810
right so you have this two world problem
right and so by pulling this all into

5832
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:35,820
right and so by pulling this all into
 

5833
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:38,030
right and so by pulling this all into
Mojo what you get is you get one world

5834
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:38,040
Mojo what you get is you get one world
 

5835
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,270
Mojo what you get is you get one world
you get the ability to say cool I have

5836
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:40,280
you get the ability to say cool I have
 

5837
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:42,950
you get the ability to say cool I have
untyped very Dynamic beautiful simple

5838
01:39:42,950 --> 01:39:42,960
untyped very Dynamic beautiful simple
 

5839
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,149
untyped very Dynamic beautiful simple
code

5840
01:39:44,149 --> 01:39:44,159
code
 

5841
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,010
code
okay I care about performance for

5842
01:39:46,010 --> 01:39:46,020
okay I care about performance for
 

5843
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:47,270
okay I care about performance for
whatever reason right there's lots of

5844
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:47,280
whatever reason right there's lots of
 

5845
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,790
whatever reason right there's lots of
reasons you could you you might care and

5846
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:49,800
reasons you could you you might care and
 

5847
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,530
reasons you could you you might care and
so then you add types you can

5848
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:51,540
so then you add types you can
 

5849
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:52,850
so then you add types you can
parallelize things you can factorize

5850
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:52,860
parallelize things you can factorize
 

5851
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:54,229
parallelize things you can factorize
things you can use these techniques

5852
01:39:54,229 --> 01:39:54,239
things you can use these techniques
 

5853
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:56,629
things you can use these techniques
which are General techniques to solve a

5854
01:39:56,629 --> 01:39:56,639
which are General techniques to solve a
 

5855
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:58,430
which are General techniques to solve a
problem and then you can do that by

5856
01:39:58,430 --> 01:39:58,440
problem and then you can do that by
 

5857
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:01,490
problem and then you can do that by
staying in the system and if you're uh

5858
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:01,500
staying in the system and if you're uh
 

5859
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,530
staying in the system and if you're uh
you have that one python package it's

5860
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:03,540
you have that one python package it's
 

5861
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:04,610
you have that one python package it's
really important to you you can move it

5862
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:04,620
really important to you you can move it
 

5863
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:06,470
really important to you you can move it
to Mojo you get massive performance

5864
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:06,480
to Mojo you get massive performance
 

5865
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,330
to Mojo you get massive performance
benefits on that and other other

5866
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:08,340
benefits on that and other other
 

5867
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:10,370
benefits on that and other other
advantages you know if you like stack

5868
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:10,380
advantages you know if you like stack
 

5869
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,530
advantages you know if you like stack
types it's nice if they're enforced

5870
01:40:12,530 --> 01:40:12,540
types it's nice if they're enforced
 

5871
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:14,330
types it's nice if they're enforced
some people like that right rather than

5872
01:40:14,330 --> 01:40:14,340
some people like that right rather than
 

5873
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:15,709
some people like that right rather than
being hints so there's other advantages

5874
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:15,719
being hints so there's other advantages
 

5875
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:17,629
being hints so there's other advantages
too and then

5876
01:40:17,629 --> 01:40:17,639
too and then
 

5877
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:18,229
too and then
um

5878
01:40:18,229 --> 01:40:18,239
um
 

5879
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:19,970
um
and then you can do that incrementally

5880
01:40:19,970 --> 01:40:19,980
and then you can do that incrementally
 

5881
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:22,129
and then you can do that incrementally
as you go

5882
01:40:22,129 --> 01:40:22,139
as you go
 

5883
01:40:22,139 --> 01:40:25,010
as you go
so one different perspective on this

5884
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:25,020
so one different perspective on this
 

5885
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,870
so one different perspective on this
would be um

5886
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:26,880
would be um
 

5887
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,050
would be um
why Mojo instead of making C python

5888
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:30,060
why Mojo instead of making C python
 

5889
01:40:30,060 --> 01:40:33,350
why Mojo instead of making C python
faster or redesigning C python yeah well

5890
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:33,360
faster or redesigning C python yeah well
 

5891
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,750
faster or redesigning C python yeah well
I mean you can argue Mojo is redesigning

5892
01:40:35,750 --> 01:40:35,760
I mean you can argue Mojo is redesigning
 

5893
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,390
I mean you can argue Mojo is redesigning
C python but but uh but why not make C

5894
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:38,400
C python but but uh but why not make C
 

5895
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,250
C python but but uh but why not make C
python faster and better and other

5896
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:40,260
python faster and better and other
 

5897
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:41,750
python faster and better and other
things like that uh there's lots of

5898
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:41,760
things like that uh there's lots of
 

5899
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,370
things like that uh there's lots of
people working on that so actually

5900
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:43,380
people working on that so actually
 

5901
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,070
people working on that so actually
there's a team at Microsoft that is

5902
01:40:45,070 --> 01:40:45,080
there's a team at Microsoft that is
 

5903
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:48,430
there's a team at Microsoft that is
really improving I think C python

5904
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:48,440
really improving I think C python
 

5905
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:50,810
really improving I think C python
3.11 came out in October or something

5906
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:50,820
3.11 came out in October or something
 

5907
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:53,450
3.11 came out in October or something
like that and it was you know 15 faster

5908
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:53,460
like that and it was you know 15 faster
 

5909
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:56,149
like that and it was you know 15 faster
20 faster across the board

5910
01:40:56,149 --> 01:40:56,159
20 faster across the board
 

5911
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:58,790
20 faster across the board
which is pretty huge given how mature

5912
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:58,800
which is pretty huge given how mature
 

5913
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,970
which is pretty huge given how mature
python is and things like this and so

5914
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:01,980
python is and things like this and so
 

5915
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:03,890
python is and things like this and so
um that's awesome I love it

5916
01:41:03,890 --> 01:41:03,900
um that's awesome I love it
 

5917
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:07,669
um that's awesome I love it
um doesn't run on GPU it doesn't do AI

5918
01:41:07,669 --> 01:41:07,679
um doesn't run on GPU it doesn't do AI
 

5919
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:09,229
um doesn't run on GPU it doesn't do AI
stuff like it doesn't do vectors doesn't

5920
01:41:09,229 --> 01:41:09,239
stuff like it doesn't do vectors doesn't
 

5921
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:10,729
stuff like it doesn't do vectors doesn't
do things

5922
01:41:10,729 --> 01:41:10,739
do things
 

5923
01:41:10,739 --> 01:41:14,209
do things
um I'm 20 is good 35 000 times is better

5924
01:41:14,209 --> 01:41:14,219
um I'm 20 is good 35 000 times is better
 

5925
01:41:14,219 --> 01:41:16,669
um I'm 20 is good 35 000 times is better
right so like they're they're they're

5926
01:41:16,669 --> 01:41:16,679
right so like they're they're they're
 

5927
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:19,129
right so like they're they're they're
definitely I'm a huge fan of that work

5928
01:41:19,129 --> 01:41:19,139
definitely I'm a huge fan of that work
 

5929
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:20,629
definitely I'm a huge fan of that work
by the way and it composes well with

5930
01:41:20,629 --> 01:41:20,639
by the way and it composes well with
 

5931
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:22,490
by the way and it composes well with
what we're doing and so it's not it's

5932
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:22,500
what we're doing and so it's not it's
 

5933
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,870
what we're doing and so it's not it's
not like we're fighting or anything like

5934
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:23,880
not like we're fighting or anything like
 

5935
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,250
not like we're fighting or anything like
that it's actually just general it's

5936
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:25,260
that it's actually just general it's
 

5937
01:41:25,260 --> 01:41:26,930
that it's actually just general it's
goodness for the world but it's just a

5938
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:26,940
goodness for the world but it's just a
 

5939
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:29,270
goodness for the world but it's just a
different path right and again we're not

5940
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:29,280
different path right and again we're not
 

5941
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,550
different path right and again we're not
working forwards from making python a

5942
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:31,560
working forwards from making python a
 

5943
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,530
working forwards from making python a
little bit better we're working

5944
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:32,540
little bit better we're working
 

5945
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:34,370
little bit better we're working
backwards from what is the limit of

5946
01:41:34,370 --> 01:41:34,380
backwards from what is the limit of
 

5947
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:37,189
backwards from what is the limit of
physics what's the process of uh

5948
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:37,199
physics what's the process of uh
 

5949
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,410
physics what's the process of uh
supporting python code to Mojo is there

5950
01:41:39,410 --> 01:41:39,420
supporting python code to Mojo is there
 

5951
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:41,149
supporting python code to Mojo is there
a

5952
01:41:41,149 --> 01:41:41,159
a
 

5953
01:41:41,159 --> 01:41:43,370
a
what's involved in that in the process

5954
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:43,380
what's involved in that in the process
 

5955
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:46,430
what's involved in that in the process
is there tooling for that not yet so um

5956
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:46,440
is there tooling for that not yet so um
 

5957
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:48,169
is there tooling for that not yet so um
we're missing some basic features right

5958
01:41:48,169 --> 01:41:48,179
we're missing some basic features right
 

5959
01:41:48,179 --> 01:41:49,970
we're missing some basic features right
now and so we're continuing to drop out

5960
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:49,980
now and so we're continuing to drop out
 

5961
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:52,850
now and so we're continuing to drop out
new features like on a weekly basis but

5962
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:52,860
new features like on a weekly basis but
 

5963
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:55,310
new features like on a weekly basis but
um you know at the fullness of time give

5964
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:55,320
um you know at the fullness of time give
 

5965
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,370
um you know at the fullness of time give
us a year and a half maybe two years is

5966
01:41:58,370 --> 01:41:58,380
us a year and a half maybe two years is
 

5967
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:01,129
us a year and a half maybe two years is
it an automatable process so when we're

5968
01:42:01,129 --> 01:42:01,139
it an automatable process so when we're
 

5969
01:42:01,139 --> 01:42:03,830
it an automatable process so when we're
ready it'll be very automatable yes is

5970
01:42:03,830 --> 01:42:03,840
ready it'll be very automatable yes is
 

5971
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,510
ready it'll be very automatable yes is
it automatable automate like is it

5972
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:05,520
it automatable automate like is it
 

5973
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,609
it automatable automate like is it
possible to automate

5974
01:42:07,609 --> 01:42:07,619
possible to automate
 

5975
01:42:07,619 --> 01:42:10,189
possible to automate
in the general case the python Mojo

5976
01:42:10,189 --> 01:42:10,199
in the general case the python Mojo
 

5977
01:42:10,199 --> 01:42:11,870
in the general case the python Mojo
conversion yeah well you're saying it's

5978
01:42:11,870 --> 01:42:11,880
conversion yeah well you're saying it's
 

5979
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:14,149
conversion yeah well you're saying it's
possible well so and this is why I mean

5980
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:14,159
possible well so and this is why I mean
 

5981
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:17,090
possible well so and this is why I mean
among other reasons why we use tabs yes

5982
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:17,100
among other reasons why we use tabs yes
 

5983
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:19,370
among other reasons why we use tabs yes
right so first of all by being a

5984
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:19,380
right so first of all by being a
 

5985
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:21,530
right so first of all by being a
superset yep you could it's like C

5986
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:21,540
superset yep you could it's like C
 

5987
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:23,750
superset yep you could it's like C
versus C plus plus can you move C code

5988
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:23,760
versus C plus plus can you move C code
 

5989
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,490
versus C plus plus can you move C code
to C plus plus

5990
01:42:25,490 --> 01:42:25,500
to C plus plus
 

5991
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:28,310
to C plus plus
yes yeah right and you move you you can

5992
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:28,320
yes yeah right and you move you you can
 

5993
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,669
yes yeah right and you move you you can
move C code to C plus plus and uh then

5994
01:42:31,669 --> 01:42:31,679
move C code to C plus plus and uh then
 

5995
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,350
move C code to C plus plus and uh then
you can adopt classes you can add adopt

5996
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:33,360
you can adopt classes you can add adopt
 

5997
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,510
you can adopt classes you can add adopt
templates you can adopt other references

5998
01:42:35,510 --> 01:42:35,520
templates you can adopt other references
 

5999
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,310
templates you can adopt other references
or whatever C plus features you want

6000
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:37,320
or whatever C plus features you want
 

6001
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:39,770
or whatever C plus features you want
after you move C to C code to C plus

6002
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:39,780
after you move C to C code to C plus
 

6003
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:42,169
after you move C to C code to C plus
plus like you can't use templates in C

6004
01:42:42,169 --> 01:42:42,179
plus like you can't use templates in C
 

6005
01:42:42,179 --> 01:42:44,510
plus like you can't use templates in C
right and so if you leave it a c fine

6006
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:44,520
right and so if you leave it a c fine
 

6007
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,010
right and so if you leave it a c fine
you can't use the cool features but it

6008
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:46,020
you can't use the cool features but it
 

6009
01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:47,990
you can't use the cool features but it
still works right and C and C plus plus

6010
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,000
still works right and C and C plus plus
 

6011
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,850
still works right and C and C plus plus
code work together and so that's the

6012
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:49,860
code work together and so that's the
 

6013
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:52,550
code work together and so that's the
analogy right now

6014
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:52,560
analogy right now
 

6015
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,570
analogy right now
um here right you you you

6016
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:55,580
um here right you you you
 

6017
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:58,669
um here right you you you
there's not a python is bad and the Mojo

6018
01:42:58,669 --> 01:42:58,679
there's not a python is bad and the Mojo
 

6019
01:42:58,679 --> 01:42:59,990
there's not a python is bad and the Mojo
is good

6020
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:00,000
is good
 

6021
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,669
is good
right Mojo just gives you superpowers

6022
01:43:01,669 --> 01:43:01,679
right Mojo just gives you superpowers
 

6023
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,350
right Mojo just gives you superpowers
right and so if you want to stay with

6024
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:03,360
right and so if you want to stay with
 

6025
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:06,169
right and so if you want to stay with
python that's cool uh but the tooling

6026
01:43:06,169 --> 01:43:06,179
python that's cool uh but the tooling
 

6027
01:43:06,179 --> 01:43:08,330
python that's cool uh but the tooling
should be actually very beautiful and

6028
01:43:08,330 --> 01:43:08,340
should be actually very beautiful and
 

6029
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,430
should be actually very beautiful and
simple because we're doing the hard work

6030
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:10,440
simple because we're doing the hard work
 

6031
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:13,370
simple because we're doing the hard work
of defining a superset right so you're

6032
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:13,380
of defining a superset right so you're
 

6033
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:15,530
of defining a superset right so you're
right so there's several things to say

6034
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:15,540
right so there's several things to say
 

6035
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,209
right so there's several things to say
there but also the conversion tooling

6036
01:43:17,209 --> 01:43:17,219
there but also the conversion tooling
 

6037
01:43:17,219 --> 01:43:19,370
there but also the conversion tooling
should probably give you hints as to

6038
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:19,380
should probably give you hints as to
 

6039
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,810
should probably give you hints as to
like how you can improve the code and

6040
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:20,820
like how you can improve the code and
 

6041
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,430
like how you can improve the code and
then yeah exactly once you're in the new

6042
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:22,440
then yeah exactly once you're in the new
 

6043
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:23,750
then yeah exactly once you're in the new
world then you can build all kinds of

6044
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:23,760
world then you can build all kinds of
 

6045
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:25,430
world then you can build all kinds of
cool tools to say like hey should you

6046
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:25,440
cool tools to say like hey should you
 

6047
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,229
cool tools to say like hey should you
adopt this feature or like and we

6048
01:43:27,229 --> 01:43:27,239
adopt this feature or like and we
 

6049
01:43:27,239 --> 01:43:28,490
adopt this feature or like and we
haven't built those tools yet but I

6050
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:28,500
haven't built those tools yet but I
 

6051
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,050
haven't built those tools yet but I
fully expect those tools will exist and

6052
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:30,060
fully expect those tools will exist and
 

6053
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:31,550
fully expect those tools will exist and
then you can like you know quote

6054
01:43:31,550 --> 01:43:31,560
then you can like you know quote
 

6055
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:33,470
then you can like you know quote
modernize your code or however you want

6056
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:33,480
modernize your code or however you want
 

6057
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:35,510
modernize your code or however you want
to look at it right so I mean one of the

6058
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:35,520
to look at it right so I mean one of the
 

6059
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:36,350
to look at it right so I mean one of the
things that I think is really

6060
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:36,360
things that I think is really
 

6061
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:38,810
things that I think is really
interesting about Mojo is that there

6062
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:38,820
interesting about Mojo is that there
 

6063
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:40,850
interesting about Mojo is that there
have been a lot of projects to improve

6064
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:40,860
have been a lot of projects to improve
 

6065
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:42,830
have been a lot of projects to improve
python over the years

6066
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:42,840
python over the years
 

6067
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,270
python over the years
um everything from you know getting

6068
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:44,280
um everything from you know getting
 

6069
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:46,310
um everything from you know getting
python to run on the Java virtual

6070
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:46,320
python to run on the Java virtual
 

6071
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,890
python to run on the Java virtual
machine uh Pi Pi which is the jit

6072
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:48,900
machine uh Pi Pi which is the jit
 

6073
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:50,689
machine uh Pi Pi which is the jit
compiler there's tons of these projects

6074
01:43:50,689 --> 01:43:50,699
compiler there's tons of these projects
 

6075
01:43:50,699 --> 01:43:51,709
compiler there's tons of these projects
out there that have been working on

6076
01:43:51,709 --> 01:43:51,719
out there that have been working on
 

6077
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:54,350
out there that have been working on
improving python in various ways

6078
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:54,360
improving python in various ways
 

6079
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:57,350
improving python in various ways
they founded one or two camps so pipei

6080
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:57,360
they founded one or two camps so pipei
 

6081
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,149
they founded one or two camps so pipei
is a great example of a camp that is

6082
01:43:59,149 --> 01:43:59,159
is a great example of a camp that is
 

6083
01:43:59,159 --> 01:44:01,370
is a great example of a camp that is
trying to be compatible with python

6084
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:01,380
trying to be compatible with python
 

6085
01:44:01,380 --> 01:44:03,229
trying to be compatible with python
even there not really it doesn't work

6086
01:44:03,229 --> 01:44:03,239
even there not really it doesn't work
 

6087
01:44:03,239 --> 01:44:05,030
even there not really it doesn't work
with all the C packages and stuff like

6088
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,040
with all the C packages and stuff like
 

6089
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,129
with all the C packages and stuff like
that but um but they're trying to be

6090
01:44:07,129 --> 01:44:07,139
that but um but they're trying to be
 

6091
01:44:07,139 --> 01:44:08,810
that but um but they're trying to be
compatible with python there's also

6092
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:08,820
compatible with python there's also
 

6093
01:44:08,820 --> 01:44:10,430
compatible with python there's also
another category of these things where

6094
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:10,440
another category of these things where
 

6095
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:11,870
another category of these things where
they're saying well python is too

6096
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:11,880
they're saying well python is too
 

6097
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,189
they're saying well python is too
complicated

6098
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:13,199
complicated
 

6099
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:15,649
complicated
and you know I'm gonna cheat on the

6100
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:15,659
and you know I'm gonna cheat on the
 

6101
01:44:15,659 --> 01:44:18,350
and you know I'm gonna cheat on the
edges and it you know like integers in

6102
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:18,360
edges and it you know like integers in
 

6103
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,990
edges and it you know like integers in
Python can be an arbitrary size integer

6104
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:21,000
Python can be an arbitrary size integer
 

6105
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,910
Python can be an arbitrary size integer
like if you care about it fitting in a

6106
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:22,920
like if you care about it fitting in a
 

6107
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,950
like if you care about it fitting in a
going fast on a register and a computer

6108
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:24,960
going fast on a register and a computer
 

6109
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,709
going fast on a register and a computer
that's really annoying right and so you

6110
01:44:27,709 --> 01:44:27,719
that's really annoying right and so you
 

6111
01:44:27,719 --> 01:44:29,750
that's really annoying right and so you
can you can choose to pass on that right

6112
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:29,760
can you can choose to pass on that right
 

6113
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,850
can you can choose to pass on that right
you can say well people don't really use

6114
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:31,860
you can say well people don't really use
 

6115
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:33,649
you can say well people don't really use
big integers that often therefore I'm

6116
01:44:33,649 --> 01:44:33,659
big integers that often therefore I'm
 

6117
01:44:33,659 --> 01:44:36,129
big integers that often therefore I'm
gonna just not do it and it'll be fine

6118
01:44:36,129 --> 01:44:36,139
gonna just not do it and it'll be fine
 

6119
01:44:36,139 --> 01:44:39,770
gonna just not do it and it'll be fine
not not a python superset or you can do

6120
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:39,780
not not a python superset or you can do
 

6121
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:41,270
not not a python superset or you can do
the hard thing and say okay this is

6122
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
the hard thing and say okay this is
 

6123
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,350
the hard thing and say okay this is
python

6124
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:42,360
python
 

6125
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:44,030
python
you can't be a super set of python

6126
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:44,040
you can't be a super set of python
 

6127
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,350
you can't be a super set of python
without

6128
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:45,360
without
 

6129
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:48,050
without
being a super set of python and that's a

6130
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:48,060
being a super set of python and that's a
 

6131
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,689
being a super set of python and that's a
really hard technical problem but it's

6132
01:44:50,689 --> 01:44:50,699
really hard technical problem but it's
 

6133
01:44:50,699 --> 01:44:52,790
really hard technical problem but it's
in my opinion worth it right and it's

6134
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:52,800
in my opinion worth it right and it's
 

6135
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,310
in my opinion worth it right and it's
worth it because it's not about any one

6136
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:55,320
worth it because it's not about any one
 

6137
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,990
worth it because it's not about any one
package it's about this ecosystem it's

6138
01:44:56,990 --> 01:44:57,000
package it's about this ecosystem it's
 

6139
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,669
package it's about this ecosystem it's
about what python means for the world

6140
01:44:58,669 --> 01:44:58,679
about what python means for the world
 

6141
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:00,770
about what python means for the world
and it also means we don't want to

6142
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:00,780
and it also means we don't want to
 

6143
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,270
and it also means we don't want to
repeat the python 2 to Python 3

6144
01:45:02,270 --> 01:45:02,280
repeat the python 2 to Python 3
 

6145
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,310
repeat the python 2 to Python 3
transition like we want we want people

6146
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:04,320
transition like we want we want people
 

6147
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,530
transition like we want we want people
to be able to adopt this stuff quickly

6148
01:45:06,530 --> 01:45:06,540
to be able to adopt this stuff quickly
 

6149
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:08,870
to be able to adopt this stuff quickly
and so by doing that work we can help

6150
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:08,880
and so by doing that work we can help
 

6151
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:11,330
and so by doing that work we can help
lift people yeah the challenge it's

6152
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:11,340
lift people yeah the challenge it's
 

6153
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:12,290
lift people yeah the challenge it's
really interesting technical

6154
01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:12,300
really interesting technical
 

6155
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,590
really interesting technical
philosophical challenge of

6156
01:45:14,590 --> 01:45:14,600
philosophical challenge of
 

6157
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:17,450
philosophical challenge of
really making a language a superset of

6158
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:17,460
really making a language a superset of
 

6159
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:19,850
really making a language a superset of
another language

6160
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:19,860
another language
 

6161
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:21,350
another language
that's breaking my brain a little bit

6162
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:21,360
that's breaking my brain a little bit
 

6163
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:23,930
that's breaking my brain a little bit
well it paints you in the corners so

6164
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:23,940
well it paints you in the corners so
 

6165
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,430
well it paints you in the corners so
um again I'm very happy with python

6166
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:25,440
um again I'm very happy with python
 

6167
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,830
um again I'm very happy with python
right so joking all joking aside I think

6168
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:27,840
right so joking all joking aside I think
 

6169
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,169
right so joking all joking aside I think
that the indentation thing is not the

6170
01:45:30,169 --> 01:45:30,179
that the indentation thing is not the
 

6171
01:45:30,179 --> 01:45:32,270
that the indentation thing is not the
actual important part of the problem yes

6172
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:32,280
actual important part of the problem yes
 

6173
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:35,090
actual important part of the problem yes
right but the the fact that python has

6174
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:35,100
right but the the fact that python has
 

6175
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:36,590
right but the the fact that python has
amazing Dynamic meta programming

6176
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:36,600
amazing Dynamic meta programming
 

6177
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,629
amazing Dynamic meta programming
features and they translate to beautiful

6178
01:45:38,629 --> 01:45:38,639
features and they translate to beautiful
 

6179
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,550
features and they translate to beautiful
static meta programming features I think

6180
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:40,560
static meta programming features I think
 

6181
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,250
static meta programming features I think
is profound I think that's huge right

6182
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:43,260
is profound I think that's huge right
 

6183
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,590
is profound I think that's huge right
and so python I've talked with Guido

6184
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:45,600
and so python I've talked with Guido
 

6185
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,050
and so python I've talked with Guido
about this it's it's like it was not

6186
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:48,060
about this it's it's like it was not
 

6187
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:50,330
about this it's it's like it was not
designed to do what we're doing that was

6188
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:50,340
designed to do what we're doing that was
 

6189
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:51,590
designed to do what we're doing that was
not the reason they built it this way

6190
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:51,600
not the reason they built it this way
 

6191
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,209
not the reason they built it this way
but because they really cared and they

6192
01:45:53,209 --> 01:45:53,219
but because they really cared and they
 

6193
01:45:53,219 --> 01:45:54,290
but because they really cared and they
were very thoughtful about how they

6194
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:54,300
were very thoughtful about how they
 

6195
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:56,450
were very thoughtful about how they
designed the language it scales very

6196
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:56,460
designed the language it scales very
 

6197
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,729
designed the language it scales very
elegantly in the space but if you look

6198
01:45:58,729 --> 01:45:58,739
elegantly in the space but if you look
 

6199
01:45:58,739 --> 01:46:00,649
elegantly in the space but if you look
at other languages for example C and C

6200
01:46:00,649 --> 01:46:00,659
at other languages for example C and C
 

6201
01:46:00,659 --> 01:46:01,729
at other languages for example C and C
plus plus

6202
01:46:01,729 --> 01:46:01,739
plus plus
 

6203
01:46:01,739 --> 01:46:04,910
plus plus
right if you're building a superset you

6204
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:04,920
right if you're building a superset you
 

6205
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,370
right if you're building a superset you
get stuck with the design decisions of

6206
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:07,380
get stuck with the design decisions of
 

6207
01:46:07,380 --> 01:46:09,050
get stuck with the design decisions of
the subset

6208
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:09,060
the subset
 

6209
01:46:09,060 --> 01:46:12,830
the subset
right and so you know C plus plus is way

6210
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:12,840
right and so you know C plus plus is way
 

6211
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:14,750
right and so you know C plus plus is way
more complicated because of C in the

6212
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:14,760
more complicated because of C in the
 

6213
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:16,669
more complicated because of C in the
Legacy than it would have been if they

6214
01:46:16,669 --> 01:46:16,679
Legacy than it would have been if they
 

6215
01:46:16,679 --> 01:46:18,470
Legacy than it would have been if they
would have theoretically designed a from

6216
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:18,480
would have theoretically designed a from
 

6217
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,149
would have theoretically designed a from
scratch thing

6218
01:46:20,149 --> 01:46:20,159
scratch thing
 

6219
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:21,649
scratch thing
and there's lots of people right now

6220
01:46:21,649 --> 01:46:21,659
and there's lots of people right now
 

6221
01:46:21,659 --> 01:46:23,390
and there's lots of people right now
that are trying to make C plus plus

6222
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:23,400
that are trying to make C plus plus
 

6223
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,550
that are trying to make C plus plus
better and recent tax C plus plus it's

6224
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:25,560
better and recent tax C plus plus it's
 

6225
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,750
better and recent tax C plus plus it's
gonna be great we'll just change all the

6226
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:26,760
gonna be great we'll just change all the
 

6227
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:27,590
gonna be great we'll just change all the
syntax

6228
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:27,600
syntax
 

6229
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,390
syntax
uh but if you do that now suddenly you

6230
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:29,400
uh but if you do that now suddenly you
 

6231
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:31,070
uh but if you do that now suddenly you
have zero packages

6232
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:31,080
have zero packages
 

6233
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:32,750
have zero packages
so you don't have compatibility so what

6234
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:32,760
so you don't have compatibility so what
 

6235
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:35,870
so you don't have compatibility so what
what are the if you could just uh Linger

6236
01:46:35,870 --> 01:46:35,880
what are the if you could just uh Linger
 

6237
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:37,129
what are the if you could just uh Linger
on that what are the

6238
01:46:37,129 --> 01:46:37,139
on that what are the
 

6239
01:46:37,139 --> 01:46:39,050
on that what are the
biggest challenges of keeping that

6240
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:39,060
biggest challenges of keeping that
 

6241
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:40,790
biggest challenges of keeping that
superset status

6242
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:40,800
superset status
 

6243
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,290
superset status
what are the things you're struggling

6244
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:42,300
what are the things you're struggling
 

6245
01:46:42,300 --> 01:46:44,330
what are the things you're struggling
with is it all boil down to having a big

6246
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:44,340
with is it all boil down to having a big
 

6247
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:45,530
with is it all boil down to having a big
integer

6248
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:45,540
integer
 

6249
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:47,390
integer
no I mean it's it's one of the other

6250
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:47,400
no I mean it's it's one of the other
 

6251
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:50,090
no I mean it's it's one of the other
things usually it's the um it's a long

6252
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:50,100
things usually it's the um it's a long
 

6253
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,070
things usually it's the um it's a long
tail weird things so let me give you a

6254
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:52,080
tail weird things so let me give you a
 

6255
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,709
tail weird things so let me give you a
war story okay so War story in the space

6256
01:46:54,709 --> 01:46:54,719
war story okay so War story in the space
 

6257
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:55,850
war story okay so War story in the space
is

6258
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:55,860
is
 

6259
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,550
is
um you go way back in time project I

6260
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:58,560
um you go way back in time project I
 

6261
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,910
um you go way back in time project I
worked on is called clang clang what it

6262
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:01,920
worked on is called clang clang what it
 

6263
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:04,550
worked on is called clang clang what it
is it's a cc plus plus parser right and

6264
01:47:04,550 --> 01:47:04,560
is it's a cc plus plus parser right and
 

6265
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,430
is it's a cc plus plus parser right and
when I start working on clang

6266
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:07,440
when I start working on clang
 

6267
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,910
when I start working on clang
spent like 2006 or something was 2007 in

6268
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:10,920
spent like 2006 or something was 2007 in
 

6269
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,649
spent like 2006 or something was 2007 in
2006 when I first started working on it

6270
01:47:12,649 --> 01:47:12,659
2006 when I first started working on it
 

6271
01:47:12,659 --> 01:47:13,790
2006 when I first started working on it
right

6272
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:13,800
right
 

6273
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,970
right
um it's funny how time flies yeah the uh

6274
01:47:16,970 --> 01:47:16,980
um it's funny how time flies yeah the uh
 

6275
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:19,189
um it's funny how time flies yeah the uh
uh I started that project and I'm like

6276
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:19,199
uh I started that project and I'm like
 

6277
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:22,490
uh I started that project and I'm like
okay well I want to build a c parser C

6278
01:47:22,490 --> 01:47:22,500
okay well I want to build a c parser C
 

6279
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:25,609
okay well I want to build a c parser C
plus plus parser for lvm it's gonna be

6280
01:47:25,609 --> 01:47:25,619
plus plus parser for lvm it's gonna be
 

6281
01:47:25,619 --> 01:47:29,629
plus plus parser for lvm it's gonna be
the work GCC is yucky you know this is

6282
01:47:29,629 --> 01:47:29,639
the work GCC is yucky you know this is
 

6283
01:47:29,639 --> 01:47:32,570
the work GCC is yucky you know this is
mean earlier times it's yucky it's on

6284
01:47:32,570 --> 01:47:32,580
mean earlier times it's yucky it's on
 

6285
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,649
mean earlier times it's yucky it's on
principled it has all these weird

6286
01:47:33,649 --> 01:47:33,659
principled it has all these weird
 

6287
01:47:33,659 --> 01:47:36,709
principled it has all these weird
features like all these bugs like

6288
01:47:36,709 --> 01:47:36,719
features like all these bugs like
 

6289
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:38,930
features like all these bugs like
it's yucky so I'm going to build a

6290
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:38,940
it's yucky so I'm going to build a
 

6291
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:41,390
it's yucky so I'm going to build a
standard compliant C and C plus parser

6292
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:41,400
standard compliant C and C plus parser
 

6293
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:43,790
standard compliant C and C plus parser
it's gonna be beautiful it'll be amazing

6294
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:43,800
it's gonna be beautiful it'll be amazing
 

6295
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,229
it's gonna be beautiful it'll be amazing
well engineered all the cool things an

6296
01:47:45,229 --> 01:47:45,239
well engineered all the cool things an
 

6297
01:47:45,239 --> 01:47:46,550
well engineered all the cool things an
engineer wants to do

6298
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:46,560
engineer wants to do
 

6299
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,050
engineer wants to do
and so I started implementing building

6300
01:47:48,050 --> 01:47:48,060
and so I started implementing building
 

6301
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:49,729
and so I started implementing building
it out building on building out and then

6302
01:47:49,729 --> 01:47:49,739
it out building on building out and then
 

6303
01:47:49,739 --> 01:47:53,930
it out building on building out and then
I got to include standardio.h

6304
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:53,940
I got to include standardio.h
 

6305
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:56,330
I got to include standardio.h
and all of the headers in the world use

6306
01:47:56,330 --> 01:47:56,340
and all of the headers in the world use
 

6307
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:58,609
and all of the headers in the world use
all the GCC stuff

6308
01:47:58,609 --> 01:47:58,619
all the GCC stuff
 

6309
01:47:58,619 --> 01:48:01,669
all the GCC stuff
okay this and so again come back away

6310
01:48:01,669 --> 01:48:01,679
okay this and so again come back away
 

6311
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:02,870
okay this and so again come back away
from

6312
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:02,880
from
 

6313
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:07,010
from
Theory back to reality right I had I was

6314
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:07,020
Theory back to reality right I had I was
 

6315
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:08,990
Theory back to reality right I had I was
in a fork on the road I could have built

6316
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:09,000
in a fork on the road I could have built
 

6317
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,090
in a fork on the road I could have built
an amazingly beautiful academic thing

6318
01:48:11,090 --> 01:48:11,100
an amazingly beautiful academic thing
 

6319
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:13,430
an amazingly beautiful academic thing
that nobody would ever use

6320
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:13,440
that nobody would ever use
 

6321
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,910
that nobody would ever use
or I could say well it's yucky in

6322
01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:16,920
or I could say well it's yucky in
 

6323
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:19,669
or I could say well it's yucky in
various ways all these design mistakes

6324
01:48:19,669 --> 01:48:19,679
various ways all these design mistakes
 

6325
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:21,950
various ways all these design mistakes
accents of History the Legacy at that

6326
01:48:21,950 --> 01:48:21,960
accents of History the Legacy at that
 

6327
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,189
accents of History the Legacy at that
point GCC was like over 20 years old

6328
01:48:24,189 --> 01:48:24,199
point GCC was like over 20 years old
 

6329
01:48:24,199 --> 01:48:27,169
point GCC was like over 20 years old
which by the way yeah now lvm's over 20

6330
01:48:27,169 --> 01:48:27,179
which by the way yeah now lvm's over 20
 

6331
01:48:27,179 --> 01:48:29,090
which by the way yeah now lvm's over 20
years old yeah that's funny how yeah

6332
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:29,100
years old yeah that's funny how yeah
 

6333
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,550
years old yeah that's funny how yeah
time catches up to you right and so

6334
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:31,560
time catches up to you right and so
 

6335
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:34,790
time catches up to you right and so
um you you say okay well what what is

6336
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:34,800
um you you say okay well what what is
 

6337
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,950
um you you say okay well what what is
easier right I mean as an engineer it's

6338
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:36,960
easier right I mean as an engineer it's
 

6339
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,810
easier right I mean as an engineer it's
it's actually much easier for me to go

6340
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:38,820
it's actually much easier for me to go
 

6341
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:41,270
it's actually much easier for me to go
Implement long tail compatibility weird

6342
01:48:41,270 --> 01:48:41,280
Implement long tail compatibility weird
 

6343
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,430
Implement long tail compatibility weird
features even if they're distasteful and

6344
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440
features even if they're distasteful and
 

6345
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,129
features even if they're distasteful and
just do the hard work and like figure it

6346
01:48:46,129 --> 01:48:46,139
just do the hard work and like figure it
 

6347
01:48:46,139 --> 01:48:47,870
just do the hard work and like figure it
out reverse engineer understand what it

6348
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:47,880
out reverse engineer understand what it
 

6349
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,430
out reverse engineer understand what it
is write a bunch of test cases like try

6350
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:49,440
is write a bunch of test cases like try
 

6351
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:51,050
is write a bunch of test cases like try
to understand Behavior

6352
01:48:51,050 --> 01:48:51,060
to understand Behavior
 

6353
01:48:51,060 --> 01:48:53,030
to understand Behavior
it's way easier to do all that work as

6354
01:48:53,030 --> 01:48:53,040
it's way easier to do all that work as
 

6355
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:55,070
it's way easier to do all that work as
an engineer than it is to go talk to all

6356
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:55,080
an engineer than it is to go talk to all
 

6357
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:56,750
an engineer than it is to go talk to all
C programmers and get argue with them

6358
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:56,760
C programmers and get argue with them
 

6359
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,129
C programmers and get argue with them
and try to get them to rewrite their

6360
01:48:58,129 --> 01:48:58,139
and try to get them to rewrite their
 

6361
01:48:58,139 --> 01:48:59,810
and try to get them to rewrite their
code yeah

6362
01:48:59,810 --> 01:48:59,820
code yeah
 

6363
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:02,330
code yeah
right and because that breaks a lot more

6364
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:02,340
right and because that breaks a lot more
 

6365
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,910
right and because that breaks a lot more
things yeah and and you have realities

6366
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:04,920
things yeah and and you have realities
 

6367
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,350
things yeah and and you have realities
like nobody actually even understands

6368
01:49:06,350 --> 01:49:06,360
like nobody actually even understands
 

6369
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:08,330
like nobody actually even understands
how the code works because it was

6370
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:08,340
how the code works because it was
 

6371
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:10,310
how the code works because it was
written by the person who quit 10 years

6372
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:10,320
written by the person who quit 10 years
 

6373
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:13,850
written by the person who quit 10 years
ago right and so this is this software

6374
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:13,860
ago right and so this is this software
 

6375
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:16,729
ago right and so this is this software
has kind of frustrating that way but

6376
01:49:16,729 --> 01:49:16,739
has kind of frustrating that way but
 

6377
01:49:16,739 --> 01:49:19,129
has kind of frustrating that way but
it's that's how the world works right

6378
01:49:19,129 --> 01:49:19,139
it's that's how the world works right
 

6379
01:49:19,139 --> 01:49:21,350
it's that's how the world works right
yeah unfortunately it can never be this

6380
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:21,360
yeah unfortunately it can never be this
 

6381
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,930
yeah unfortunately it can never be this
perfect beautiful thing well there there

6382
01:49:23,930 --> 01:49:23,940
perfect beautiful thing well there there
 

6383
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:26,090
perfect beautiful thing well there there
are occasions in which you get to build

6384
01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:26,100
are occasions in which you get to build
 

6385
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,010
are occasions in which you get to build
like you know you invent a new

6386
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:28,020
like you know you invent a new
 

6387
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,629
like you know you invent a new
data structure or something like that or

6388
01:49:29,629 --> 01:49:29,639
data structure or something like that or
 

6389
01:49:29,639 --> 01:49:31,129
data structure or something like that or
there's this beautiful algorithm that

6390
01:49:31,129 --> 01:49:31,139
there's this beautiful algorithm that
 

6391
01:49:31,139 --> 01:49:33,169
there's this beautiful algorithm that
just like makes you super happy right I

6392
01:49:33,169 --> 01:49:33,179
just like makes you super happy right I
 

6393
01:49:33,179 --> 01:49:34,850
just like makes you super happy right I
I love that moment but but when you're

6394
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:34,860
I love that moment but but when you're
 

6395
01:49:34,860 --> 01:49:36,649
I love that moment but but when you're
working with people yeah and you're

6396
01:49:36,649 --> 01:49:36,659
working with people yeah and you're
 

6397
01:49:36,659 --> 01:49:38,450
working with people yeah and you're
working with code and Dusty that code

6398
01:49:38,450 --> 01:49:38,460
working with code and Dusty that code
 

6399
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:40,370
working with code and Dusty that code
bases and things like this right

6400
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:40,380
bases and things like this right
 

6401
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:42,590
bases and things like this right
it's not about what's theoretically

6402
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:42,600
it's not about what's theoretically
 

6403
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:44,030
it's not about what's theoretically
beautiful it's about what's practical

6404
01:49:44,030 --> 01:49:44,040
beautiful it's about what's practical
 

6405
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:45,229
beautiful it's about what's practical
what's real what people will actually

6406
01:49:45,229 --> 01:49:45,239
what's real what people will actually
 

6407
01:49:45,239 --> 01:49:47,870
what's real what people will actually
use and I don't meet a lot of people

6408
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:47,880
use and I don't meet a lot of people
 

6409
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:50,570
use and I don't meet a lot of people
that say I want to rewrite all my code

6410
01:49:50,570 --> 01:49:50,580
that say I want to rewrite all my code
 

6411
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:52,430
that say I want to rewrite all my code
just for the sake of it

6412
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:52,440
just for the sake of it
 

6413
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:53,750
just for the sake of it
by the way there could be interesting

6414
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:53,760
by the way there could be interesting
 

6415
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,129
by the way there could be interesting
possibilities and we'll probably talk

6416
01:49:55,129 --> 01:49:55,139
possibilities and we'll probably talk
 

6417
01:49:55,139 --> 01:49:57,229
possibilities and we'll probably talk
about it where AI can help rewrite some

6418
01:49:57,229 --> 01:49:57,239
about it where AI can help rewrite some
 

6419
01:49:57,239 --> 01:50:00,050
about it where AI can help rewrite some
code that might be farther out future

6420
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:00,060
code that might be farther out future
 

6421
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,729
code that might be farther out future
but it's a really interesting one how

6422
01:50:01,729 --> 01:50:01,739
but it's a really interesting one how
 

6423
01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:03,850
but it's a really interesting one how
that could create more

6424
01:50:03,850 --> 01:50:03,860
that could create more
 

6425
01:50:03,860 --> 01:50:07,729
that could create more
be a a tool in the battle against this

6426
01:50:07,729 --> 01:50:07,739
be a a tool in the battle against this
 

6427
01:50:07,739 --> 01:50:09,709
be a a tool in the battle against this
monster of complexity that you mentioned

6428
01:50:09,709 --> 01:50:09,719
monster of complexity that you mentioned
 

6429
01:50:09,719 --> 01:50:11,290
monster of complexity that you mentioned
yeah

6430
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:11,300
yeah
 

6431
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:14,930
yeah
foreign Guido the the benevolent

6432
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:14,940
foreign Guido the the benevolent
 

6433
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:17,870
foreign Guido the the benevolent
dictator for life of python what does he

6434
01:50:17,870 --> 01:50:17,880
dictator for life of python what does he
 

6435
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:20,030
dictator for life of python what does he
think about Mojo have you talk too much

6436
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:20,040
think about Mojo have you talk too much
 

6437
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:22,250
think about Mojo have you talk too much
about it uh I have talked with him about

6438
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:22,260
about it uh I have talked with him about
 

6439
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:23,990
about it uh I have talked with him about
it he found it very interesting

6440
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:24,000
it he found it very interesting
 

6441
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,550
it he found it very interesting
um we actually talked with Guido before

6442
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:25,560
um we actually talked with Guido before
 

6443
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:27,109
um we actually talked with Guido before
it launched and so he was aware of it

6444
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:27,119
it launched and so he was aware of it
 

6445
01:50:27,119 --> 01:50:28,790
it launched and so he was aware of it
before it went public

6446
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:28,800
before it went public
 

6447
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,229
before it went public
um I have a ton of respect for Credo for

6448
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:30,239
um I have a ton of respect for Credo for
 

6449
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:31,729
um I have a ton of respect for Credo for
a bunch of different reasons you talk

6450
01:50:31,729 --> 01:50:31,739
a bunch of different reasons you talk
 

6451
01:50:31,739 --> 01:50:35,270
a bunch of different reasons you talk
about walrus operator and like Guido's

6452
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:35,280
about walrus operator and like Guido's
 

6453
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:37,930
about walrus operator and like Guido's
pretty amazing in terms of

6454
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:37,940
pretty amazing in terms of
 

6455
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:40,550
pretty amazing in terms of
steering such a huge and diverse

6456
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:40,560
steering such a huge and diverse
 

6457
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,169
steering such a huge and diverse
community and and

6458
01:50:42,169 --> 01:50:42,179
community and and
 

6459
01:50:42,179 --> 01:50:42,729
community and and
and

6460
01:50:42,729 --> 01:50:42,739
and
 

6461
01:50:42,739 --> 01:50:45,950
and
like driving forward and I think python

6462
01:50:45,950 --> 01:50:45,960
like driving forward and I think python
 

6463
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:48,950
like driving forward and I think python
is what it is thanks to him right and so

6464
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:48,960
is what it is thanks to him right and so
 

6465
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,050
is what it is thanks to him right and so
to me it was really important starting

6466
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:51,060
to me it was really important starting
 

6467
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:53,209
to me it was really important starting
to work on Mojo to get his feedback and

6468
01:50:53,209 --> 01:50:53,219
to work on Mojo to get his feedback and
 

6469
01:50:53,219 --> 01:50:55,310
to work on Mojo to get his feedback and
get his input and get his eyes on this

6470
01:50:55,310 --> 01:50:55,320
get his input and get his eyes on this
 

6471
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,410
get his input and get his eyes on this
right now

6472
01:50:57,410 --> 01:50:57,420
right now
 

6473
01:50:57,420 --> 01:51:00,290
right now
um a lot of what Guido was is wasn't as

6474
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:00,300
um a lot of what Guido was is wasn't as
 

6475
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:02,390
um a lot of what Guido was is wasn't as
I think concerned about is how do we not

6476
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:02,400
I think concerned about is how do we not
 

6477
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,370
I think concerned about is how do we not
fragment the community yeah we don't

6478
01:51:04,370 --> 01:51:04,380
fragment the community yeah we don't
 

6479
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:05,930
fragment the community yeah we don't
want to python to Python 3 thing like

6480
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:05,940
want to python to Python 3 thing like
 

6481
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:07,970
want to python to Python 3 thing like
that was that was really painful for

6482
01:51:07,970 --> 01:51:07,980
that was that was really painful for
 

6483
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:10,070
that was that was really painful for
everybody involved and so we spent quite

6484
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:10,080
everybody involved and so we spent quite
 

6485
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,390
everybody involved and so we spent quite
a bit of time talking about that and

6486
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:11,400
a bit of time talking about that and
 

6487
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,590
a bit of time talking about that and
some of the tricks I learned from Swift

6488
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:12,600
some of the tricks I learned from Swift
 

6489
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,930
some of the tricks I learned from Swift
for example so in the migration from

6490
01:51:14,930 --> 01:51:14,940
for example so in the migration from
 

6491
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:17,270
for example so in the migration from
Swift we managed to like not just

6492
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:17,280
Swift we managed to like not just
 

6493
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:18,830
Swift we managed to like not just
convert

6494
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:18,840
convert
 

6495
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,930
convert
Objective C into a slightly prettier

6496
01:51:20,930 --> 01:51:20,940
Objective C into a slightly prettier
 

6497
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:23,350
Objective C into a slightly prettier
Objective C which we did we then

6498
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:23,360
Objective C which we did we then
 

6499
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:26,330
Objective C which we did we then
converted not entirely but almost an

6500
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:26,340
converted not entirely but almost an
 

6501
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:28,250
converted not entirely but almost an
entire Community to completely different

6502
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:28,260
entire Community to completely different
 

6503
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:29,229
entire Community to completely different
language

6504
01:51:29,229 --> 01:51:29,239
language
 

6505
01:51:29,239 --> 01:51:31,609
language
right and so there's a bunch of tricks

6506
01:51:31,609 --> 01:51:31,619
right and so there's a bunch of tricks
 

6507
01:51:31,619 --> 01:51:33,410
right and so there's a bunch of tricks
that you learn along the way that are

6508
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:33,420
that you learn along the way that are
 

6509
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:35,270
that you learn along the way that are
directly relevant to what we do and so

6510
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
directly relevant to what we do and so
 

6511
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,729
directly relevant to what we do and so
this is where for example the you

6512
01:51:37,729 --> 01:51:37,739
this is where for example the you
 

6513
01:51:37,739 --> 01:51:39,470
this is where for example the you
leverage C python

6514
01:51:39,470 --> 01:51:39,480
leverage C python
 

6515
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,390
leverage C python
while bringing up the new thing like

6516
01:51:41,390 --> 01:51:41,400
while bringing up the new thing like
 

6517
01:51:41,400 --> 01:51:43,729
while bringing up the new thing like
that that approach is I think proven and

6518
01:51:43,729 --> 01:51:43,739
that that approach is I think proven and
 

6519
01:51:43,739 --> 01:51:46,010
that that approach is I think proven and
and comes from experience and so Guido

6520
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:46,020
and comes from experience and so Guido
 

6521
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:47,990
and comes from experience and so Guido
is very interested in like okay cool

6522
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:48,000
is very interested in like okay cool
 

6523
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,970
is very interested in like okay cool
like I think that python is really his

6524
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:49,980
like I think that python is really his
 

6525
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,430
like I think that python is really his
legacy it's his baby I have ton tons of

6526
01:51:52,430 --> 01:51:52,440
legacy it's his baby I have ton tons of
 

6527
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:54,109
legacy it's his baby I have ton tons of
respect for that incidentally I see mojo

6528
01:51:54,109 --> 01:51:54,119
respect for that incidentally I see mojo
 

6529
01:51:54,119 --> 01:51:56,330
respect for that incidentally I see mojo
as a member of the Python family I'm not

6530
01:51:56,330 --> 01:51:56,340
as a member of the Python family I'm not
 

6531
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:57,709
as a member of the Python family I'm not
trying to take python away from Guido

6532
01:51:57,709 --> 01:51:57,719
trying to take python away from Guido
 

6533
01:51:57,719 --> 01:52:00,050
trying to take python away from Guido
and from the python Community

6534
01:52:00,050 --> 01:52:00,060
and from the python Community
 

6535
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:02,870
and from the python Community
um uh and so uh to me it's really

6536
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:02,880
um uh and so uh to me it's really
 

6537
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,850
um uh and so uh to me it's really
important that we're a good member of

6538
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:04,860
important that we're a good member of
 

6539
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:06,709
important that we're a good member of
that community and so yeah I think that

6540
01:52:06,709 --> 01:52:06,719
that community and so yeah I think that
 

6541
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:08,570
that community and so yeah I think that
again you would have to ask Guido this

6542
01:52:08,570 --> 01:52:08,580
again you would have to ask Guido this
 

6543
01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:10,070
again you would have to ask Guido this
but I think that he was very interested

6544
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:10,080
but I think that he was very interested
 

6545
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,930
but I think that he was very interested
in this notion of like

6546
01:52:11,930 --> 01:52:11,940
in this notion of like
 

6547
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:13,970
in this notion of like
cool but I think it's been up for being

6548
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:13,980
cool but I think it's been up for being
 

6549
01:52:13,980 --> 01:52:15,649
cool but I think it's been up for being
slow

6550
01:52:15,649 --> 01:52:15,659
slow
 

6551
01:52:15,659 --> 01:52:18,229
slow
maybe there's a path out of that

6552
01:52:18,229 --> 01:52:18,239
maybe there's a path out of that
 

6553
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:22,310
maybe there's a path out of that
right and that you know if the future is

6554
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:22,320
right and that you know if the future is
 

6555
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,470
right and that you know if the future is
python right I mean look look at the the

6556
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:24,480
python right I mean look look at the the
 

6557
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,109
python right I mean look look at the the
far outside

6558
01:52:27,109 --> 01:52:27,119
far outside
 

6559
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:29,390
far outside
case on this right and I'm not saying

6560
01:52:29,390 --> 01:52:29,400
case on this right and I'm not saying
 

6561
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:31,070
case on this right and I'm not saying
this is Guido's perspective but you know

6562
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:31,080
this is Guido's perspective but you know
 

6563
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:33,229
this is Guido's perspective but you know
there's this path of saying like Okay

6564
01:52:33,229 --> 01:52:33,239
there's this path of saying like Okay
 

6565
01:52:33,239 --> 01:52:35,810
there's this path of saying like Okay
well suddenly python can suddenly go all

6566
01:52:35,810 --> 01:52:35,820
well suddenly python can suddenly go all
 

6567
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:37,310
well suddenly python can suddenly go all
the places it's never been able to go

6568
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:37,320
the places it's never been able to go
 

6569
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:38,330
the places it's never been able to go
before

6570
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:38,340
before
 

6571
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:39,950
before
right and that means the python can go

6572
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:39,960
right and that means the python can go
 

6573
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,390
right and that means the python can go
even further and can have even more

6574
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:41,400
even further and can have even more
 

6575
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:44,689
even further and can have even more
impact on the world so in some sense

6576
01:52:44,689 --> 01:52:44,699
impact on the world so in some sense
 

6577
01:52:44,699 --> 01:52:47,990
impact on the world so in some sense
Mojo could be seen as python 4.0

6578
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:48,000
Mojo could be seen as python 4.0
 

6579
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,030
Mojo could be seen as python 4.0
I would not say that I think that would

6580
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:50,040
I would not say that I think that would
 

6581
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:51,290
I would not say that I think that would
drive a lot of people really crazy

6582
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:51,300
drive a lot of people really crazy
 

6583
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:54,470
drive a lot of people really crazy
because of the PTSD of the 3.02. I'm

6584
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:54,480
because of the PTSD of the 3.02. I'm
 

6585
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,910
because of the PTSD of the 3.02. I'm
willing to annoy people about emacs

6586
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:55,920
willing to annoy people about emacs
 

6587
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:58,490
willing to annoy people about emacs
versus Bim versus spaces that's that one

6588
01:52:58,490 --> 01:52:58,500
versus Bim versus spaces that's that one
 

6589
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:59,810
versus Bim versus spaces that's that one
I don't know that might be a little bit

6590
01:52:59,810 --> 01:52:59,820
I don't know that might be a little bit
 

6591
01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:01,669
I don't know that might be a little bit
far even for me like my my skin may not

6592
01:53:01,669 --> 01:53:01,679
far even for me like my my skin may not
 

6593
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,830
far even for me like my my skin may not
be that thick but the point is the step

6594
01:53:03,830 --> 01:53:03,840
be that thick but the point is the step
 

6595
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,830
be that thick but the point is the step
to it being a superset and allowing all

6596
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:06,840
to it being a superset and allowing all
 

6597
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:09,169
to it being a superset and allowing all
these capabilities I think is the

6598
01:53:09,169 --> 01:53:09,179
these capabilities I think is the
 

6599
01:53:09,179 --> 01:53:11,149
these capabilities I think is the
evolution of a language it feels like an

so he he's interested by the ideas that

6604
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:16,080
so he he's interested by the ideas that
 

6605
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:17,510
so he he's interested by the ideas that
you're playing with but also concerned

6606
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:17,520
you're playing with but also concerned
 

6607
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,910
you're playing with but also concerned
about the fragmentation so how what are

6608
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:19,920
about the fragmentation so how what are
 

6609
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:21,530
about the fragmentation so how what are
the ideas you've learned what are you

6610
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:21,540
the ideas you've learned what are you
 

6611
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:22,790
the ideas you've learned what are you
thinking about how do we avoid

6612
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:22,800
thinking about how do we avoid
 

6613
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,229
thinking about how do we avoid
fragmenting the community where the the

6614
01:53:26,229 --> 01:53:26,239
fragmenting the community where the the
 

6615
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:29,750
fragmenting the community where the the
pythonistas and the

6616
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:29,760
pythonistas and the
 

6617
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,490
pythonistas and the
uh I don't know what to call the Mojo

6618
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:31,500
uh I don't know what to call the Mojo
 

6619
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:34,310
uh I don't know what to call the Mojo
people uh magicians The Magicians yeah I

6620
01:53:34,310 --> 01:53:34,320
people uh magicians The Magicians yeah I
 

6621
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:37,790

like it uh can coexist happily and and

6622
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:37,800
like it uh can coexist happily and and
 

6623
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,590
like it uh can coexist happily and and
share a code and basically just have

6624
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:39,600
share a code and basically just have
 

6625
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:42,770
share a code and basically just have
these big code bases that are using uh C

6626
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:42,780
these big code bases that are using uh C
 

6627
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:45,709
these big code bases that are using uh C
Python and more and more moving towards

6628
01:53:45,709 --> 01:53:45,719
Python and more and more moving towards
 

6629
01:53:45,719 --> 01:53:47,689
Python and more and more moving towards
Mojo well so again these are lessons I

6630
01:53:47,689 --> 01:53:47,699
Mojo well so again these are lessons I
 

6631
01:53:47,699 --> 01:53:49,850
Mojo well so again these are lessons I
learned from Swift and and here we Face

6632
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:49,860
learned from Swift and and here we Face
 

6633
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:51,649
learned from Swift and and here we Face
very similar problems right and Swift

6634
01:53:51,649 --> 01:53:51,659
very similar problems right and Swift
 

6635
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:56,290
very similar problems right and Swift
you have Objective C super Dynamic uh

6636
01:53:56,290 --> 01:53:56,300
you have Objective C super Dynamic uh
 

6637
01:53:56,300 --> 01:54:00,290
you have Objective C super Dynamic uh
they're very different syntax right but

6638
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:00,300
they're very different syntax right but
 

6639
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:01,790
they're very different syntax right but
you're talking to people who have large

6640
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:01,800
you're talking to people who have large
 

6641
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:05,149
you're talking to people who have large
scale code bases I mean Apple's got the

6642
01:54:05,149 --> 01:54:05,159
scale code bases I mean Apple's got the
 

6643
01:54:05,159 --> 01:54:06,590
scale code bases I mean Apple's got the
biggest largest scale code base of

6644
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:06,600
biggest largest scale code base of
 

6645
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:09,169
biggest largest scale code base of
objective c code right and so you know

6646
01:54:09,169 --> 01:54:09,179
objective c code right and so you know
 

6647
01:54:09,179 --> 01:54:10,729
objective c code right and so you know
none of the companies none of the iOS

6648
01:54:10,729 --> 01:54:10,739
none of the companies none of the iOS
 

6649
01:54:10,739 --> 01:54:12,229
none of the companies none of the iOS
developers none of the other developers

6650
01:54:12,229 --> 01:54:12,239
developers none of the other developers
 

6651
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:13,669
developers none of the other developers
want to rewrite everything all at once

6652
01:54:13,669 --> 01:54:13,679
want to rewrite everything all at once
 

6653
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:14,930
want to rewrite everything all at once
and so you want to be able to adopt

6654
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:14,940
and so you want to be able to adopt
 

6655
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:17,390
and so you want to be able to adopt
things piece at a time and so a thing

6656
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:17,400
things piece at a time and so a thing
 

6657
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,530
things piece at a time and so a thing
that I found that worked very well in

6658
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:18,540
that I found that worked very well in
 

6659
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:20,810
that I found that worked very well in
the Swift Community was saying okay cool

6660
01:54:20,810 --> 01:54:20,820
the Swift Community was saying okay cool
 

6661
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:22,970
the Swift Community was saying okay cool
and this is when switch was very young

6662
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:22,980
and this is when switch was very young
 

6663
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:25,729
and this is when switch was very young
as you say okay you have a million line

6664
01:54:25,729 --> 01:54:25,739
as you say okay you have a million line
 

6665
01:54:25,739 --> 01:54:27,830
as you say okay you have a million line
of code Objective C app

6666
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:27,840
of code Objective C app
 

6667
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,930
of code Objective C app
don't rewrite it all but when you

6668
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:29,940
don't rewrite it all but when you
 

6669
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:31,850
don't rewrite it all but when you
implement a new feature go Implement

6670
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:31,860
implement a new feature go Implement
 

6671
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:33,050
implement a new feature go Implement
that new class

6672
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:33,060
that new class
 

6673
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:36,590
that new class
using Swift right and so now this turns

6674
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:36,600
using Swift right and so now this turns
 

6675
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:39,050
using Swift right and so now this turns
out is a very wonderful thing for an app

6676
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:39,060
out is a very wonderful thing for an app
 

6677
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:40,370
out is a very wonderful thing for an app
developer

6678
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:40,380
developer
 

6679
01:54:40,380 --> 01:54:42,410
developer
but it's a huge challenge for this

6680
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:42,420
but it's a huge challenge for this
 

6681
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:44,330
but it's a huge challenge for this
compiler team and the systems people

6682
01:54:44,330 --> 01:54:44,340
compiler team and the systems people
 

6683
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:45,770
compiler team and the systems people
that are implementing that's right and

6684
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:45,780
that are implementing that's right and
 

6685
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:47,629
that are implementing that's right and
this comes back to what is this

6686
01:54:47,629 --> 01:54:47,639
this comes back to what is this
 

6687
01:54:47,639 --> 01:54:49,250
this comes back to what is this
trade-off between doing the hard thing

6688
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:49,260
trade-off between doing the hard thing
 

6689
01:54:49,260 --> 01:54:52,370
trade-off between doing the hard thing
that enables scale versus doing the

6690
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:52,380
that enables scale versus doing the
 

6691
01:54:52,380 --> 01:54:54,050
that enables scale versus doing the
theoretically pure and ideal thing right

6692
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:54,060
theoretically pure and ideal thing right
 

6693
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:57,050
theoretically pure and ideal thing right
and so Swift adopted and built a lot of

6694
01:54:57,050 --> 01:54:57,060
and so Swift adopted and built a lot of
 

6695
01:54:57,060 --> 01:54:58,910
and so Swift adopted and built a lot of
different Machinery to deeply integrate

6696
01:54:58,910 --> 01:54:58,920
different Machinery to deeply integrate
 

6697
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,590
different Machinery to deeply integrate
with the objective runtime and we're

6698
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:00,600
with the objective runtime and we're
 

6699
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:02,270
with the objective runtime and we're
doing the same thing with python right

6700
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:02,280
doing the same thing with python right
 

6701
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:04,310
doing the same thing with python right
now what what happened in the case with

6702
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:04,320
now what what happened in the case with
 

6703
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,570
now what what happened in the case with
swift is that

6704
01:55:05,570 --> 01:55:05,580
swift is that
 

6705
01:55:05,580 --> 01:55:07,850
swift is that
Swift as the language got more and more

6706
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:07,860
Swift as the language got more and more
 

6707
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:10,370
Swift as the language got more and more
and more mature over time right and

6708
01:55:10,370 --> 01:55:10,380
and more mature over time right and
 

6709
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:12,050
and more mature over time right and
incidentally Mojo is a much simpler

6710
01:55:12,050 --> 01:55:12,060
incidentally Mojo is a much simpler
 

6711
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:13,729
incidentally Mojo is a much simpler
language than Swift in many ways and so

6712
01:55:13,729 --> 01:55:13,739
language than Swift in many ways and so
 

6713
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:15,290
language than Swift in many ways and so
I think that Mojo will develop way

6714
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:15,300
I think that Mojo will develop way
 

6715
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:16,550
I think that Mojo will develop way
faster than Swift for a variety of

6716
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:16,560
faster than Swift for a variety of
 

6717
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:19,010
faster than Swift for a variety of
reasons but as the language gets more

6718
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:19,020
reasons but as the language gets more
 

6719
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:20,510
reasons but as the language gets more
mature in parallel with that you have

6720
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:20,520
mature in parallel with that you have
 

6721
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:23,149
mature in parallel with that you have
new people starting new projects

6722
01:55:23,149 --> 01:55:23,159
new people starting new projects
 

6723
01:55:23,159 --> 01:55:25,189
new people starting new projects
right and stuff when the language is

6724
01:55:25,189 --> 01:55:25,199
right and stuff when the language is
 

6725
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:26,629
right and stuff when the language is
mature and somebody's starting a new

6726
01:55:26,629 --> 01:55:26,639
mature and somebody's starting a new
 

6727
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:27,830
mature and somebody's starting a new
project that's when they say okay cool

6728
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:27,840
project that's when they say okay cool
 

6729
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:29,810
project that's when they say okay cool
I'm not dealing with a million lines of

6730
01:55:29,810 --> 01:55:29,820
I'm not dealing with a million lines of
 

6731
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:31,430
I'm not dealing with a million lines of
code I'll just start and use the new

6732
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:31,440
code I'll just start and use the new
 

6733
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:33,770
code I'll just start and use the new
thing for my whole stack now the problem

6734
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:33,780
thing for my whole stack now the problem
 

6735
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:35,570
thing for my whole stack now the problem
is again you come back to where

6736
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:35,580
is again you come back to where
 

6737
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,250
is again you come back to where
communities and we're

6738
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:37,260
communities and we're
 

6739
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:39,470
communities and we're
people that work together you build new

6740
01:55:39,470 --> 01:55:39,480
people that work together you build new
 

6741
01:55:39,480 --> 01:55:41,450
people that work together you build new
subsystem or a new feature or new thing

6742
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:41,460
subsystem or a new feature or new thing
 

6743
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:44,990
subsystem or a new feature or new thing
in Swift or you build new thing in Mojo

6744
01:55:44,990 --> 01:55:45,000
in Swift or you build new thing in Mojo
 

6745
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,209
in Swift or you build new thing in Mojo
then you want to be end up being used on

6746
01:55:47,209 --> 01:55:47,219
then you want to be end up being used on
 

6747
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:48,490
then you want to be end up being used on
the other side

6748
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:48,500
the other side
 

6749
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:50,870
the other side
right and so then you need to work on

6750
01:55:50,870 --> 01:55:50,880
right and so then you need to work on
 

6751
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,729
right and so then you need to work on
integration back the other way

6752
01:55:52,729 --> 01:55:52,739
integration back the other way
 

6753
01:55:52,739 --> 01:55:55,430
integration back the other way
and so it's not just Mojo talking python

6754
01:55:55,430 --> 01:55:55,440
and so it's not just Mojo talking python
 

6755
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:58,010
and so it's not just Mojo talking python
it's also python talking to Mojo right

6756
01:55:58,010 --> 01:55:58,020
it's also python talking to Mojo right
 

6757
01:55:58,020 --> 01:55:59,990
it's also python talking to Mojo right
and so what I would love to see and I

6758
01:55:59,990 --> 01:56:00,000
and so what I would love to see and I
 

6759
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,310
and so what I would love to see and I
don't want to see this next month right

6760
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:01,320
don't want to see this next month right
 

6761
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:02,510
don't want to see this next month right
but what I want to see over the course

6762
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:02,520
but what I want to see over the course
 

6763
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:04,970
but what I want to see over the course
of time is I would love to see people

6764
01:56:04,970 --> 01:56:04,980
of time is I would love to see people
 

6765
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:06,890
of time is I would love to see people
that are building these packages like

6766
01:56:06,890 --> 01:56:06,900
that are building these packages like
 

6767
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:10,550
that are building these packages like
you know numpy or uh you know tensorflow

6768
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:10,560
you know numpy or uh you know tensorflow
 

6769
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,350
you know numpy or uh you know tensorflow
or what you know these packages that are

6770
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:12,360
or what you know these packages that are
 

6771
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:14,990
or what you know these packages that are
half python half C plus plus

6772
01:56:14,990 --> 01:56:15,000
half python half C plus plus
 

6773
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,870
half python half C plus plus
and if you say okay cool I want to get

6774
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:17,880
and if you say okay cool I want to get
 

6775
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,810
and if you say okay cool I want to get
out of this python C plus plus world

6776
01:56:20,810 --> 01:56:20,820
out of this python C plus plus world
 

6777
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:22,970
out of this python C plus plus world
into a unified role and so I can move to

6778
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:22,980
into a unified role and so I can move to
 

6779
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:23,810
into a unified role and so I can move to
Mojo

6780
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:23,820
Mojo
 

6781
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:26,470
Mojo
but I can't give up on my python clients

6782
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:26,480
but I can't give up on my python clients
 

6783
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:29,330
but I can't give up on my python clients
because they're like these libraries get

6784
01:56:29,330 --> 01:56:29,340
because they're like these libraries get
 

6785
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:30,649
because they're like these libraries get
used by everybody and they're not all

6786
01:56:30,649 --> 01:56:30,659
used by everybody and they're not all
 

6787
01:56:30,659 --> 01:56:32,689
used by everybody and they're not all
going to switch ever all you know all

6788
01:56:32,689 --> 01:56:32,699
going to switch ever all you know all
 

6789
01:56:32,699 --> 01:56:35,629
going to switch ever all you know all
once and maybe never right well so the

6790
01:56:35,629 --> 01:56:35,639
once and maybe never right well so the
 

6791
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:37,129
once and maybe never right well so the
way we should do that is we should vend

6792
01:56:37,129 --> 01:56:37,139
way we should do that is we should vend
 

6793
01:56:37,139 --> 01:56:40,850
way we should do that is we should vend
python interfaces to the Mojo types

6794
01:56:40,850 --> 01:56:40,860
python interfaces to the Mojo types
 

6795
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:42,350
python interfaces to the Mojo types
and that's what we did in Swift and

6796
01:56:42,350 --> 01:56:42,360
and that's what we did in Swift and
 

6797
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:43,970
and that's what we did in Swift and
we're great I mean it was a huge

6798
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:43,980
we're great I mean it was a huge
 

6799
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,109
we're great I mean it was a huge
implementation challenge for the

6800
01:56:45,109 --> 01:56:45,119
implementation challenge for the
 

6801
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:47,450
implementation challenge for the
compiler people right but um there's

6802
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:47,460
compiler people right but um there's
 

6803
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:49,370
compiler people right but um there's
only a dozen of those compiler people

6804
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:49,380
only a dozen of those compiler people
 

6805
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:51,530
only a dozen of those compiler people
and there are millions of users and so

6806
01:56:51,530 --> 01:56:51,540
and there are millions of users and so
 

6807
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:54,649
and there are millions of users and so
it's a very expensive Capital intensive

6808
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:54,659
it's a very expensive Capital intensive
 

6809
01:56:54,659 --> 01:56:57,709
it's a very expensive Capital intensive
like skill set intensive problem but

6810
01:56:57,709 --> 01:56:57,719
like skill set intensive problem but
 

6811
01:56:57,719 --> 01:56:59,450
like skill set intensive problem but
once you solve that problem it really

6812
01:56:59,450 --> 01:56:59,460
once you solve that problem it really
 

6813
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:01,010
once you solve that problem it really
helps adoption it really helps the

6814
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:01,020
helps adoption it really helps the
 

6815
01:57:01,020 --> 01:57:02,570
helps adoption it really helps the
community progressively adopt

6816
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:02,580
community progressively adopt
 

6817
01:57:02,580 --> 01:57:04,370
community progressively adopt
Technologies and so I think that this

6818
01:57:04,370 --> 01:57:04,380
Technologies and so I think that this
 

6819
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:05,629
Technologies and so I think that this
approach will work quite well with with

6820
01:57:05,629 --> 01:57:05,639
approach will work quite well with with
 

6821
01:57:05,639 --> 01:57:07,850
approach will work quite well with with
the Python and the Mojo world so for a

6822
01:57:07,850 --> 01:57:07,860
the Python and the Mojo world so for a
 

6823
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:10,790
the Python and the Mojo world so for a
package ported to Mojo and then create a

6824
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:10,800
package ported to Mojo and then create a
 

6825
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:13,910
package ported to Mojo and then create a
python interface yep

6826
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
python interface yep
 

6827
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,490
python interface yep
so how do just the Linger on these

6828
01:57:16,490 --> 01:57:16,500
so how do just the Linger on these
 

6829
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:19,490
so how do just the Linger on these
packages numpy Pi torch and tensorflow

6830
01:57:19,490 --> 01:57:19,500
packages numpy Pi torch and tensorflow
 

6831
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:21,950
packages numpy Pi torch and tensorflow
yeah how do they play nicely together so

6832
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:21,960
yeah how do they play nicely together so
 

6833
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:24,649
yeah how do they play nicely together so
is uh Mojo supposed to be let's talk

6834
01:57:24,649 --> 01:57:24,659
is uh Mojo supposed to be let's talk
 

6835
01:57:24,659 --> 01:57:26,689
is uh Mojo supposed to be let's talk
about the machine learning ones

6836
01:57:26,689 --> 01:57:26,699
about the machine learning ones
 

6837
01:57:26,699 --> 01:57:29,990
about the machine learning ones
is Mojo kind of vision to replace ply

6838
01:57:29,990 --> 01:57:30,000
is Mojo kind of vision to replace ply
 

6839
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,810
is Mojo kind of vision to replace ply
torture tensorflow uh to incorporate it

6840
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:32,820
torture tensorflow uh to incorporate it
 

6841
01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:34,790
torture tensorflow uh to incorporate it
what's what's the relationship in this

6842
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:34,800
what's what's the relationship in this
 

6843
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:37,189
what's what's the relationship in this
all right so um dance so take a step

6844
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:37,199
all right so um dance so take a step
 

6845
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:40,910
all right so um dance so take a step
back so I wear many hats so you're

6846
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:40,920
back so I wear many hats so you're
 

6847
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:43,430
back so I wear many hats so you're
you're angling it on the Mojo side yes

6848
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:43,440
you're angling it on the Mojo side yes
 

6849
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:45,770
you're angling it on the Mojo side yes
Mojo is a programming language and so it

6850
01:57:45,770 --> 01:57:45,780
Mojo is a programming language and so it
 

6851
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:49,010
Mojo is a programming language and so it
can help solve the C C plus plus python

6852
01:57:49,010 --> 01:57:49,020
can help solve the C C plus plus python
 

6853
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:51,470
can help solve the C C plus plus python
Feud that's happening the fire Emoji got

6854
01:57:51,470 --> 01:57:51,480
Feud that's happening the fire Emoji got
 

6855
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:53,209
Feud that's happening the fire Emoji got
me I'm sorry we should be talking about

6856
01:57:53,209 --> 01:57:53,219
me I'm sorry we should be talking about
 

6857
01:57:53,219 --> 01:57:55,370
me I'm sorry we should be talking about
modular yes yes yes okay so the fire

6858
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:55,380
modular yes yes yes okay so the fire
 

6859
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:58,609
modular yes yes yes okay so the fire
Emoji is amazing I love it uh it's it's

6860
01:57:58,609 --> 01:57:58,619
Emoji is amazing I love it uh it's it's
 

6861
01:57:58,619 --> 01:58:01,129
Emoji is amazing I love it uh it's it's
a big deal the other side of this is the

6862
01:58:01,129 --> 01:58:01,139
a big deal the other side of this is the
 

6863
01:58:01,139 --> 01:58:03,589
a big deal the other side of this is the
fire Emoji is in service of solving some

6864
01:58:03,589 --> 01:58:03,599
fire Emoji is in service of solving some
 

6865
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:05,930
fire Emoji is in service of solving some
big AI problems yes right and so the big

6866
01:58:05,930 --> 01:58:05,940
big AI problems yes right and so the big
 

6867
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:08,149
big AI problems yes right and so the big
AI problems are again this fragmentation

6868
01:58:08,149 --> 01:58:08,159
AI problems are again this fragmentation
 

6869
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:11,030
AI problems are again this fragmentation
this Hardware nightmare this uh this

6870
01:58:11,030 --> 01:58:11,040
this Hardware nightmare this uh this
 

6871
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,490
this Hardware nightmare this uh this
explosion of new potential but that's

6872
01:58:13,490 --> 01:58:13,500
explosion of new potential but that's
 

6873
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:15,890
explosion of new potential but that's
not getting felt by the industry right

6874
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:15,900
not getting felt by the industry right
 

6875
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:17,930
not getting felt by the industry right
and so when you look at how does the

6876
01:58:17,930 --> 01:58:17,940
and so when you look at how does the
 

6877
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:20,270
and so when you look at how does the
modular engine help tensile and pytorch

6878
01:58:20,270 --> 01:58:20,280
modular engine help tensile and pytorch
 

6879
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:22,609
modular engine help tensile and pytorch
right it's not replacing them right in

6880
01:58:22,609 --> 01:58:22,619
right it's not replacing them right in
 

6881
01:58:22,619 --> 01:58:24,589
right it's not replacing them right in
fact when I talk to the people again

6882
01:58:24,589 --> 01:58:24,599
fact when I talk to the people again
 

6883
01:58:24,599 --> 01:58:25,790
fact when I talk to the people again
they don't like to rewrite all their

6884
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:25,800
they don't like to rewrite all their
 

6885
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:27,950
they don't like to rewrite all their
code you have people that are using a

6886
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:27,960
code you have people that are using a
 

6887
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:29,089
code you have people that are using a
bunch of high torch a bunch of

6888
01:58:29,089 --> 01:58:29,099
bunch of high torch a bunch of
 

6889
01:58:29,099 --> 01:58:31,310
bunch of high torch a bunch of
tensorflow they have models that they've

6890
01:58:31,310 --> 01:58:31,320
tensorflow they have models that they've
 

6891
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:32,450
tensorflow they have models that they've
been building over the course of many

6892
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:32,460
been building over the course of many
 

6893
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,390
been building over the course of many
years right and when I talk to them

6894
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:34,400
years right and when I talk to them
 

6895
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,649
years right and when I talk to them
there's a few exceptions but generally

6896
01:58:36,649 --> 01:58:36,659
there's a few exceptions but generally
 

6897
01:58:36,659 --> 01:58:38,089
there's a few exceptions but generally
they don't want to rewrite all their

6898
01:58:38,089 --> 01:58:38,099
they don't want to rewrite all their
 

6899
01:58:38,099 --> 01:58:39,109
they don't want to rewrite all their
code

6900
01:58:39,109 --> 01:58:39,119
code
 

6901
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:40,609
code
right and so what we're doing is we're

6902
01:58:40,609 --> 01:58:40,619
right and so what we're doing is we're
 

6903
01:58:40,619 --> 01:58:41,750
right and so what we're doing is we're
saying okay well you don't have to

6904
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:41,760
saying okay well you don't have to
 

6905
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,790
saying okay well you don't have to
rewrite all your code what happens is

6906
01:58:43,790 --> 01:58:43,800
rewrite all your code what happens is
 

6907
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:45,290
rewrite all your code what happens is
the modular engine goes in there and

6908
01:58:45,290 --> 01:58:45,300
the modular engine goes in there and
 

6909
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,030
the modular engine goes in there and
goes underneath tensorflow and Pi torch

6910
01:58:47,030 --> 01:58:47,040
goes underneath tensorflow and Pi torch
 

6911
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,609
goes underneath tensorflow and Pi torch
it's fully compatible and just provides

6912
01:58:49,609 --> 01:58:49,619
it's fully compatible and just provides
 

6913
01:58:49,619 --> 01:58:51,109
it's fully compatible and just provides
better performance better predictability

6914
01:58:51,109 --> 01:58:51,119
better performance better predictability
 

6915
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:52,669
better performance better predictability
better tooling

6916
01:58:52,669 --> 01:58:52,679
better tooling
 

6917
01:58:52,679 --> 01:58:54,770
better tooling
it's a better experience that helps lift

6918
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:54,780
it's a better experience that helps lift
 

6919
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:56,089
it's a better experience that helps lift
tensorflow and pytorch and make them

6920
01:58:56,089 --> 01:58:56,099
tensorflow and pytorch and make them
 

6921
01:58:56,099 --> 01:58:58,370
tensorflow and pytorch and make them
even better I love python I love

6922
01:58:58,370 --> 01:58:58,380
even better I love python I love
 

6923
01:58:58,380 --> 01:59:00,589
even better I love python I love
tensorflow I love by torch right this is

6924
01:59:00,589 --> 01:59:00,599
tensorflow I love by torch right this is
 

6925
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:02,870
tensorflow I love by torch right this is
about making the world better because we

6926
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:02,880
about making the world better because we
 

6927
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:05,870
about making the world better because we
need AI to go further but if I have a

6928
01:59:05,870 --> 01:59:05,880
need AI to go further but if I have a
 

6929
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:07,729
need AI to go further but if I have a
process that trains a model and have a

6930
01:59:07,729 --> 01:59:07,739
process that trains a model and have a
 

6931
01:59:07,739 --> 01:59:09,589
process that trains a model and have a
process that performs inference on that

6932
01:59:09,589 --> 01:59:09,599
process that performs inference on that
 

6933
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:12,050
process that performs inference on that
model and have the model itself

6934
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:12,060
model and have the model itself
 

6935
01:59:12,060 --> 01:59:14,629
model and have the model itself
uh what should I do with that in the

6936
01:59:14,629 --> 01:59:14,639
uh what should I do with that in the
 

6937
01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:16,189
uh what should I do with that in the
long Arc of History

6938
01:59:16,189 --> 01:59:16,199
long Arc of History
 

6939
01:59:16,199 --> 01:59:19,250
long Arc of History
in terms of if I use Pi torch to train

6940
01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:19,260
in terms of if I use Pi torch to train
 

6941
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:22,550
in terms of if I use Pi torch to train
it should I rewrite stuff in Mojo would

6942
01:59:22,550 --> 01:59:22,560
it should I rewrite stuff in Mojo would
 

6943
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:25,010
it should I rewrite stuff in Mojo would
that if I care about performance well so

6944
01:59:25,010 --> 01:59:25,020
that if I care about performance well so
 

6945
01:59:25,020 --> 01:59:27,410
that if I care about performance well so
I mean again it depends so if you care

6946
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:27,420
I mean again it depends so if you care
 

6947
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:29,330
I mean again it depends so if you care
about performance then writing and mojos

6948
01:59:29,330 --> 01:59:29,340
about performance then writing and mojos
 

6949
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:30,770
about performance then writing and mojos
can be way better than writing in Python

6950
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:30,780
can be way better than writing in Python
 

6951
01:59:30,780 --> 01:59:32,390
can be way better than writing in Python
but if you look at

6952
01:59:32,390 --> 01:59:32,400
but if you look at
 

6953
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:34,250
but if you look at
um if you look at llm companies for

6954
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:34,260
um if you look at llm companies for
 

6955
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:36,530
um if you look at llm companies for
example so you look at open AI rumored

6956
01:59:36,530 --> 01:59:36,540
example so you look at open AI rumored
 

6957
01:59:36,540 --> 01:59:37,910
example so you look at open AI rumored
and you look at many of the other folks

6958
01:59:37,910 --> 01:59:37,920
and you look at many of the other folks
 

6959
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:40,910
and you look at many of the other folks
that are working on maybe these many of

6960
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:40,920
that are working on maybe these many of
 

6961
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,950
that are working on maybe these many of
these LMS and other like Innovative

6962
01:59:42,950 --> 01:59:42,960
these LMS and other like Innovative
 

6963
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:45,050
these LMS and other like Innovative
machine learning models on the one hand

6964
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:45,060
machine learning models on the one hand
 

6965
01:59:45,060 --> 01:59:46,490
machine learning models on the one hand
they're innovating in the data

6966
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:46,500
they're innovating in the data
 

6967
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:48,290
they're innovating in the data
collection and the model billions of

6968
01:59:48,290 --> 01:59:48,300
collection and the model billions of
 

6969
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:50,209
collection and the model billions of
parameters in the model architecture and

6970
01:59:50,209 --> 01:59:50,219
parameters in the model architecture and
 

6971
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:54,290
parameters in the model architecture and
the RL HF and the the like all these all

6972
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:54,300
the RL HF and the the like all these all
 

6973
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:55,490
the RL HF and the the like all these all
the cool things that people are talking

6974
01:59:55,490 --> 01:59:55,500
the cool things that people are talking
 

6975
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:56,209
the cool things that people are talking
about

6976
01:59:56,209 --> 01:59:56,219
about
 

6977
01:59:56,219 --> 01:59:58,189
about
but on the other hand they're spending a

6978
01:59:58,189 --> 01:59:58,199
but on the other hand they're spending a
 

6979
01:59:58,199 --> 02:00:02,030
but on the other hand they're spending a
lot of time writing Cuda girls

6980
02:00:02,030 --> 02:00:02,040

 

6981
02:00:02,040 --> 02:00:04,310

so you say wait a second how much faster

6982
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:04,320
so you say wait a second how much faster
 

6983
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,050
so you say wait a second how much faster
could all this progress go if they were

6984
02:00:06,050 --> 02:00:06,060
could all this progress go if they were
 

6985
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:07,669
could all this progress go if they were
not having to handwrite all these Cuda

6986
02:00:07,669 --> 02:00:07,679
not having to handwrite all these Cuda
 

6987
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:09,410
not having to handwrite all these Cuda
kernels right and so there are a few

6988
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:09,420
kernels right and so there are a few
 

6989
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:10,669
kernels right and so there are a few
technologies that are out there and

6990
02:00:10,669 --> 02:00:10,679
technologies that are out there and
 

6991
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:12,229
technologies that are out there and
people have been working on this problem

6992
02:00:12,229 --> 02:00:12,239
people have been working on this problem
 

6993
02:00:12,239 --> 02:00:13,729
people have been working on this problem
for a while and

6994
02:00:13,729 --> 02:00:13,739
for a while and
 

6995
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:15,169
for a while and
um and they're trying to solve subsets

6996
02:00:15,169 --> 02:00:15,179
um and they're trying to solve subsets
 

6997
02:00:15,179 --> 02:00:16,669
um and they're trying to solve subsets
the problem again kind of fragmenting

6998
02:00:16,669 --> 02:00:16,679
the problem again kind of fragmenting
 

6999
02:00:16,679 --> 02:00:18,589
the problem again kind of fragmenting
the space and so what Mojo provides for

7000
02:00:18,589 --> 02:00:18,599
the space and so what Mojo provides for
 

7001
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:20,270
the space and so what Mojo provides for
these kinds of companies is the ability

7002
02:00:20,270 --> 02:00:20,280
these kinds of companies is the ability
 

7003
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:23,149
these kinds of companies is the ability
to say cool I can have a unifying Theory

7004
02:00:23,149 --> 02:00:23,159
to say cool I can have a unifying Theory
 

7005
02:00:23,159 --> 02:00:25,609
to say cool I can have a unifying Theory
right again this the The Better Together

7006
02:00:25,609 --> 02:00:25,619
right again this the The Better Together
 

7007
02:00:25,619 --> 02:00:27,770
right again this the The Better Together
the unifying Theory the the two world

7008
02:00:27,770 --> 02:00:27,780
the unifying Theory the the two world
 

7009
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:29,149
the unifying Theory the the two world
problem or the three world problem or

7010
02:00:29,149 --> 02:00:29,159
problem or the three world problem or
 

7011
02:00:29,159 --> 02:00:30,890
problem or the three world problem or
the enrolled problem like this is the

7012
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:30,900
the enrolled problem like this is the
 

7013
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:32,750
the enrolled problem like this is the
thing that is slowing people down and so

7014
02:00:32,750 --> 02:00:32,760
thing that is slowing people down and so
 

7015
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:34,430
thing that is slowing people down and so
as we help solve this problem I think

7016
02:00:34,430 --> 02:00:34,440
as we help solve this problem I think
 

7017
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:36,530
as we help solve this problem I think
it'll be very helpful for making this

7018
02:00:36,530 --> 02:00:36,540
it'll be very helpful for making this
 

7019
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:38,089
it'll be very helpful for making this
whole cycle go faster

7020
02:00:38,089 --> 02:00:38,099
whole cycle go faster
 

7021
02:00:38,099 --> 02:00:39,950
whole cycle go faster
so obviously we've talked about the

7022
02:00:39,950 --> 02:00:39,960
so obviously we've talked about the
 

7023
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:42,470
so obviously we've talked about the
transition from Objective C to Swift if

7024
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:42,480
transition from Objective C to Swift if
 

7025
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:45,290
transition from Objective C to Swift if
designed this uh programming language

7026
02:00:45,290 --> 02:00:45,300
designed this uh programming language
 

7027
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:47,390
designed this uh programming language
and you've also talked uh quite a bit

7028
02:00:47,390 --> 02:00:47,400
and you've also talked uh quite a bit
 

7029
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:48,890
and you've also talked uh quite a bit
about the use of Swift for machine

7030
02:00:48,890 --> 02:00:48,900
about the use of Swift for machine
 

7031
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:52,149
about the use of Swift for machine
learning uh context

7032
02:00:52,149 --> 02:00:52,159
learning uh context
 

7033
02:00:52,159 --> 02:00:56,390
learning uh context
why have you decided to move away from

7034
02:00:56,390 --> 02:00:56,400
why have you decided to move away from
 

7035
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:59,810
why have you decided to move away from
uh maybe an intense focus on Swift for

7036
02:00:59,810 --> 02:00:59,820
uh maybe an intense focus on Swift for
 

7037
02:00:59,820 --> 02:01:01,490
uh maybe an intense focus on Swift for
the machine learning context versus sort

7038
02:01:01,490 --> 02:01:01,500
the machine learning context versus sort
 

7039
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,729
the machine learning context versus sort
of Designing a new programming language

7040
02:01:04,729 --> 02:01:04,739
of Designing a new programming language
 

7041
02:01:04,739 --> 02:01:07,070
of Designing a new programming language
that happens to be a superstar this is

7042
02:01:07,070 --> 02:01:07,080
that happens to be a superstar this is
 

7043
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:09,970
that happens to be a superstar this is
an irrational set of Life Choices I make

7044
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:09,980
an irrational set of Life Choices I make
 

7045
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:13,070
an irrational set of Life Choices I make
I go to the desert and did you meditate

7046
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:13,080
I go to the desert and did you meditate
 

7047
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:16,250
I go to the desert and did you meditate
on it okay all right no it was Bull it

7048
02:01:16,250 --> 02:01:16,260
on it okay all right no it was Bull it
 

7049
02:01:16,260 --> 02:01:18,950
on it okay all right no it was Bull it
was bold and needed and I think uh I

7050
02:01:18,950 --> 02:01:18,960
was bold and needed and I think uh I
 

7051
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:20,629
was bold and needed and I think uh I
mean it's just bold and sometimes to

7052
02:01:20,629 --> 02:01:20,639
mean it's just bold and sometimes to
 

7053
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:22,609
mean it's just bold and sometimes to
take those leaps is a difficult leap to

7054
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:22,619
take those leaps is a difficult leap to
 

7055
02:01:22,619 --> 02:01:24,770
take those leaps is a difficult leap to
take yeah well so okay I mean I think

7056
02:01:24,770 --> 02:01:24,780
take yeah well so okay I mean I think
 

7057
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:26,870
take yeah well so okay I mean I think
there's a couple of different things so

7058
02:01:26,870 --> 02:01:26,880
there's a couple of different things so
 

7059
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:28,609
there's a couple of different things so
um actually I left apple back in 2017

7060
02:01:28,609 --> 02:01:28,619
um actually I left apple back in 2017
 

7061
02:01:28,619 --> 02:01:32,270
um actually I left apple back in 2017
like January 2017. so it's been a number

7062
02:01:32,270 --> 02:01:32,280
like January 2017. so it's been a number
 

7063
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:34,669
like January 2017. so it's been a number
of years that I left apple and the

7064
02:01:34,669 --> 02:01:34,679
of years that I left apple and the
 

7065
02:01:34,679 --> 02:01:38,750
of years that I left apple and the
reason I left Apple was to do AI

7066
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:38,760

 

7067
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:41,510

okay so and again I won't comment on

7068
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:41,520
okay so and again I won't comment on
 

7069
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:44,810
okay so and again I won't comment on
Apple and AI but the uh uh at the time

7070
02:01:44,810 --> 02:01:44,820
Apple and AI but the uh uh at the time
 

7071
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:47,089
Apple and AI but the uh uh at the time
right I want to get into and understand

7072
02:01:47,089 --> 02:01:47,099
right I want to get into and understand
 

7073
02:01:47,099 --> 02:01:48,770
right I want to get into and understand
and understand the technology understand

7074
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:48,780
and understand the technology understand
 

7075
02:01:48,780 --> 02:01:50,750
and understand the technology understand
the applications the workloads and so I

7076
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:50,760
the applications the workloads and so I
 

7077
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:52,370
the applications the workloads and so I
was like okay I'm gonna go dive deep

7078
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:52,380
was like okay I'm gonna go dive deep
 

7079
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:54,470
was like okay I'm gonna go dive deep
into applied and Ai and then the

7080
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:54,480
into applied and Ai and then the
 

7081
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:56,990
into applied and Ai and then the
technology underneath it right

7082
02:01:56,990 --> 02:01:57,000
technology underneath it right
 

7083
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:57,589
technology underneath it right
um

7084
02:01:57,589 --> 02:01:57,599
um
 

7085
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:59,209
um
I found myself a Google

7086
02:01:59,209 --> 02:01:59,219
I found myself a Google
 

7087
02:01:59,219 --> 02:02:01,790
I found myself a Google
and that was like when tpus were yep

7088
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:01,800
and that was like when tpus were yep
 

7089
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:03,830
and that was like when tpus were yep
waking up exactly and so I found myself

7090
02:02:03,830 --> 02:02:03,840
waking up exactly and so I found myself
 

7091
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:07,729
waking up exactly and so I found myself
at Google and uh Jeff Dean who's a rock

7092
02:02:07,729 --> 02:02:07,739
at Google and uh Jeff Dean who's a rock
 

7093
02:02:07,739 --> 02:02:10,850
at Google and uh Jeff Dean who's a rock
star as you know right and the and in

7094
02:02:10,850 --> 02:02:10,860
star as you know right and the and in
 

7095
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:13,370
star as you know right and the and in
2017 tens flow is like really taking off

7096
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:13,380
2017 tens flow is like really taking off
 

7097
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:15,709
2017 tens flow is like really taking off
and doing incredible things and I was

7098
02:02:15,709 --> 02:02:15,719
and doing incredible things and I was
 

7099
02:02:15,719 --> 02:02:17,209
and doing incredible things and I was
attracted to Google to help them with

7100
02:02:17,209 --> 02:02:17,219
attracted to Google to help them with
 

7101
02:02:17,219 --> 02:02:19,189
attracted to Google to help them with
the tpus right and tpus are an

7102
02:02:19,189 --> 02:02:19,199
the tpus right and tpus are an
 

7103
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:21,010
the tpus right and tpus are an
Innovative Hardware accelerator platform

7104
02:02:21,010 --> 02:02:21,020
Innovative Hardware accelerator platform
 

7105
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:23,450
Innovative Hardware accelerator platform
uh have now I mean I think proven

7106
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:23,460
uh have now I mean I think proven
 

7107
02:02:23,460 --> 02:02:25,550
uh have now I mean I think proven
massive scale and like done incredible

7108
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:25,560
massive scale and like done incredible
 

7109
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:28,310
massive scale and like done incredible
things right and so one of the things

7110
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:28,320
things right and so one of the things
 

7111
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,589
things right and so one of the things
that this led into is a bunch of

7112
02:02:30,589 --> 02:02:30,599
that this led into is a bunch of
 

7113
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:31,850
that this led into is a bunch of
different projects which I'll skip over

7114
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:31,860
different projects which I'll skip over
 

7115
02:02:31,860 --> 02:02:34,189
different projects which I'll skip over
right one of which was this Swift for

7116
02:02:34,189 --> 02:02:34,199
right one of which was this Swift for
 

7117
02:02:34,199 --> 02:02:36,709
right one of which was this Swift for
tensorflow project right and so that

7118
02:02:36,709 --> 02:02:36,719
tensorflow project right and so that
 

7119
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:38,990
tensorflow project right and so that
project was a research project and so

7120
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:39,000
project was a research project and so
 

7121
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,390
project was a research project and so
the idea of that is say okay well let's

7122
02:02:41,390 --> 02:02:41,400
the idea of that is say okay well let's
 

7123
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,950
the idea of that is say okay well let's
look at Innovative new programming

7124
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:42,960
look at Innovative new programming
 

7125
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:45,169
look at Innovative new programming
models where we can get a fast

7126
02:02:45,169 --> 02:02:45,179
models where we can get a fast
 

7127
02:02:45,179 --> 02:02:46,750
models where we can get a fast
programming language we can get

7128
02:02:46,750 --> 02:02:46,760
programming language we can get
 

7129
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:48,770
programming language we can get
automatic differentiation into the

7130
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:48,780
automatic differentiation into the
 

7131
02:02:48,780 --> 02:02:50,510
automatic differentiation into the
language let's push the boundaries of

7132
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:50,520
language let's push the boundaries of
 

7133
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:52,629
language let's push the boundaries of
these things in a research setting right

7134
02:02:52,629 --> 02:02:52,639
these things in a research setting right
 

7135
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:56,270
these things in a research setting right
now that project I think lasted two

7136
02:02:56,270 --> 02:02:56,280
now that project I think lasted two
 

7137
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:57,890
now that project I think lasted two
three years there's some really cool

7138
02:02:57,890 --> 02:02:57,900
three years there's some really cool
 

7139
02:02:57,900 --> 02:02:59,870
three years there's some really cool
outcomes of that so one of things that's

7140
02:02:59,870 --> 02:02:59,880
outcomes of that so one of things that's
 

7141
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:01,790
outcomes of that so one of things that's
really interesting is um

7142
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:01,800
really interesting is um
 

7143
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:05,089
really interesting is um
I published a talk at an LM conference

7144
02:03:05,089 --> 02:03:05,099
I published a talk at an LM conference
 

7145
02:03:05,099 --> 02:03:07,370
I published a talk at an LM conference
in 2018 again that seems like so long

7146
02:03:07,370 --> 02:03:07,380
in 2018 again that seems like so long
 

7147
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:09,950
in 2018 again that seems like so long
ago about graph program abstraction

7148
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:09,960
ago about graph program abstraction
 

7149
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:11,750
ago about graph program abstraction
which is basically the thing that's in

7150
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:11,760
which is basically the thing that's in
 

7151
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,010
which is basically the thing that's in
pytorch too

7152
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:13,020
pytorch too
 

7153
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:15,109
pytorch too
and so Pi Torch 2 with all this Dynamo

7154
02:03:15,109 --> 02:03:15,119
and so Pi Torch 2 with all this Dynamo
 

7155
02:03:15,119 --> 02:03:16,430
and so Pi Torch 2 with all this Dynamo
real thing it's all about this graph

7156
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:16,440
real thing it's all about this graph
 

7157
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:18,410
real thing it's all about this graph
program abstraction thing from Python

7158
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:18,420
program abstraction thing from Python
 

7159
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:20,450
program abstraction thing from Python
bytecodes and so a lot of the research

7160
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:20,460
bytecodes and so a lot of the research
 

7161
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:22,010
bytecodes and so a lot of the research
that was done

7162
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:22,020
that was done
 

7163
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:24,290
that was done
um ended up pursuing and going out

7164
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:24,300
um ended up pursuing and going out
 

7165
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:25,729
um ended up pursuing and going out
through the industry and influencing

7166
02:03:25,729 --> 02:03:25,739
through the industry and influencing
 

7167
02:03:25,739 --> 02:03:27,109
through the industry and influencing
things and I think it's super exciting

7168
02:03:27,109 --> 02:03:27,119
things and I think it's super exciting
 

7169
02:03:27,119 --> 02:03:28,790
things and I think it's super exciting
and awesome to see that

7170
02:03:28,790 --> 02:03:28,800
and awesome to see that
 

7171
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:30,410
and awesome to see that
but the software testflow project itself

7172
02:03:30,410 --> 02:03:30,420
but the software testflow project itself
 

7173
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:32,149
but the software testflow project itself
did not work out super well and so

7174
02:03:32,149 --> 02:03:32,159
did not work out super well and so
 

7175
02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:33,410
did not work out super well and so
there's a couple of different problems

7176
02:03:33,410 --> 02:03:33,420
there's a couple of different problems
 

7177
02:03:33,420 --> 02:03:36,169
there's a couple of different problems
with that one of which is that you may

7178
02:03:36,169 --> 02:03:36,179
with that one of which is that you may
 

7179
02:03:36,179 --> 02:03:38,770
with that one of which is that you may
have noticed Swift is not python

7180
02:03:38,770 --> 02:03:38,780
have noticed Swift is not python
 

7181
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:41,450
have noticed Swift is not python
there's a few people that write python

7182
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:41,460
there's a few people that write python
 

7183
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:44,510
there's a few people that write python
code yes and so it turns out that all of

7184
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:44,520
code yes and so it turns out that all of
 

7185
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:46,790
code yes and so it turns out that all of
ml is pretty happy with python it's

7186
02:03:46,790 --> 02:03:46,800
ml is pretty happy with python it's
 

7187
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,169
ml is pretty happy with python it's
actually a problem that other

7188
02:03:48,169 --> 02:03:48,179
actually a problem that other
 

7189
02:03:48,179 --> 02:03:50,450
actually a problem that other
programming languages have as well that

7190
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:50,460
programming languages have as well that
 

7191
02:03:50,460 --> 02:03:52,669
programming languages have as well that
they're not python well probably maybe

7192
02:03:52,669 --> 02:03:52,679
they're not python well probably maybe
 

7193
02:03:52,679 --> 02:03:55,189
they're not python well probably maybe
briefly talk about Julia was a very

7194
02:03:55,189 --> 02:03:55,199
briefly talk about Julia was a very
 

7195
02:03:55,199 --> 02:03:56,930
briefly talk about Julia was a very
interesting uh beautiful programming

7196
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:56,940
interesting uh beautiful programming
 

7197
02:03:56,940 --> 02:03:58,970
interesting uh beautiful programming
language but it's not python exactly

7198
02:03:58,970 --> 02:03:58,980
language but it's not python exactly
 

7199
02:03:58,980 --> 02:04:00,589
language but it's not python exactly
well and so if and so like if you're

7200
02:04:00,589 --> 02:04:00,599
well and so if and so like if you're
 

7201
02:04:00,599 --> 02:04:02,810
well and so if and so like if you're
saying I'm going to solve a machine

7202
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:02,820
saying I'm going to solve a machine
 

7203
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:04,430
saying I'm going to solve a machine
learning problem where all the

7204
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:04,440
learning problem where all the
 

7205
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:06,290
learning problem where all the
programmers are python Pro programmers

7206
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:06,300
programmers are python Pro programmers
 

7207
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:08,030
programmers are python Pro programmers
yeah and you say the first thing you

7208
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:08,040
yeah and you say the first thing you
 

7209
02:04:08,040 --> 02:04:09,050
yeah and you say the first thing you
have to do is switch to a different

7210
02:04:09,050 --> 02:04:09,060
have to do is switch to a different
 

7211
02:04:09,060 --> 02:04:10,370
have to do is switch to a different
language

7212
02:04:10,370 --> 02:04:10,380
language
 

7213
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:12,830
language
well your new thing may be good or bad

7214
02:04:12,830 --> 02:04:12,840
well your new thing may be good or bad
 

7215
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:15,169
well your new thing may be good or bad
or whatever but if it's a new thing the

7216
02:04:15,169 --> 02:04:15,179
or whatever but if it's a new thing the
 

7217
02:04:15,179 --> 02:04:18,050
or whatever but if it's a new thing the
adoption barrier is massive it's still

7218
02:04:18,050 --> 02:04:18,060
adoption barrier is massive it's still
 

7219
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,790
adoption barrier is massive it's still
possible still possible yeah absolutely

7220
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:19,800
possible still possible yeah absolutely
 

7221
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:21,410
possible still possible yeah absolutely
the world changes and evolves and

7222
02:04:21,410 --> 02:04:21,420
the world changes and evolves and
 

7223
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:23,149
the world changes and evolves and
there's definitely room for new new and

7224
02:04:23,149 --> 02:04:23,159
there's definitely room for new new and
 

7225
02:04:23,159 --> 02:04:24,950
there's definitely room for new new and
good ideas but it just makes it so much

7226
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:24,960
good ideas but it just makes it so much
 

7227
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,589
good ideas but it just makes it so much
harder right and so

7228
02:04:27,589 --> 02:04:27,599
harder right and so
 

7229
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:29,810
harder right and so
lesson learned Swift is not Python and

7230
02:04:29,810 --> 02:04:29,820
lesson learned Swift is not Python and
 

7231
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:31,609
lesson learned Swift is not Python and
people are not always in search of like

7232
02:04:31,609 --> 02:04:31,619
people are not always in search of like
 

7233
02:04:31,619 --> 02:04:32,810
people are not always in search of like
learning a new thing for the sake of

7234
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:32,820
learning a new thing for the sake of
 

7235
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:34,550
learning a new thing for the sake of
learning a new thing and if you want to

7236
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:34,560
learning a new thing and if you want to
 

7237
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:35,750
learning a new thing and if you want to
be compatible with all the world's code

7238
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:35,760
be compatible with all the world's code
 

7239
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:37,490
be compatible with all the world's code
turns out

7240
02:04:37,490 --> 02:04:37,500
turns out
 

7241
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:40,310
turns out
meet the world where it is right second

7242
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:40,320
meet the world where it is right second
 

7243
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,050
meet the world where it is right second
thing is that

7244
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:42,060
thing is that
 

7245
02:04:42,060 --> 02:04:44,209
thing is that
um you know a lesson learned is that uh

7246
02:04:44,209 --> 02:04:44,219
um you know a lesson learned is that uh
 

7247
02:04:44,219 --> 02:04:46,070
um you know a lesson learned is that uh
Swift as a very fast and efficient

7248
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:46,080
Swift as a very fast and efficient
 

7249
02:04:46,080 --> 02:04:48,530
Swift as a very fast and efficient
language kind of like Mojo but a

7250
02:04:48,530 --> 02:04:48,540
language kind of like Mojo but a
 

7251
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:51,109
language kind of like Mojo but a
different a different take on it still

7252
02:04:51,109 --> 02:04:51,119
different a different take on it still
 

7253
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:51,709
different a different take on it still
um

7254
02:04:51,709 --> 02:04:51,719
um
 

7255
02:04:51,719 --> 02:04:54,530
um
really worked well with eager mode

7256
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:54,540
really worked well with eager mode
 

7257
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:56,750
really worked well with eager mode
and so eager mode is something that

7258
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:56,760
and so eager mode is something that
 

7259
02:04:56,760 --> 02:04:58,370
and so eager mode is something that
pytorch does and it proved out really

7260
02:04:58,370 --> 02:04:58,380
pytorch does and it proved out really
 

7261
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:01,070
pytorch does and it proved out really
well and it enables really expressive

7262
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:01,080
well and it enables really expressive
 

7263
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:03,290
well and it enables really expressive
and dynamic and easy to debug

7264
02:05:03,290 --> 02:05:03,300
and dynamic and easy to debug
 

7265
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:05,030
and dynamic and easy to debug
programming

7266
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:05,040
programming
 

7267
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:07,010
programming
um tensorflow at the time was not set up

7268
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:07,020
um tensorflow at the time was not set up
 

7269
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:08,209
um tensorflow at the time was not set up
for that

7270
02:05:08,209 --> 02:05:08,219
for that
 

7271
02:05:08,219 --> 02:05:10,189
for that
let's say that was not the timing is

7272
02:05:10,189 --> 02:05:10,199
let's say that was not the timing is
 

7273
02:05:10,199 --> 02:05:12,350
let's say that was not the timing is
also important in this world yeah yeah

7274
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:12,360
also important in this world yeah yeah
 

7275
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,669
also important in this world yeah yeah
intensive flow is a good thing and it

7276
02:05:13,669 --> 02:05:13,679
intensive flow is a good thing and it
 

7277
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:18,169
intensive flow is a good thing and it
has many many strengths but uh

7278
02:05:18,169 --> 02:05:18,179
has many many strengths but uh
 

7279
02:05:18,179 --> 02:05:20,450
has many many strengths but uh
you could say Swift potential is a good

7280
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:20,460
you could say Swift potential is a good
 

7281
02:05:20,460 --> 02:05:21,890
you could say Swift potential is a good
idea except for the Swift and except for

7282
02:05:21,890 --> 02:05:21,900
idea except for the Swift and except for
 

7283
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:24,589
idea except for the Swift and except for
the tensorflow part

7284
02:05:24,589 --> 02:05:24,599
the tensorflow part
 

7285
02:05:24,599 --> 02:05:26,510
the tensorflow part
sell it because it's not Python and

7286
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:26,520
sell it because it's not Python and
 

7287
02:05:26,520 --> 02:05:27,950
sell it because it's not Python and
tensorflow because it's not it wasn't

7288
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:27,960
tensorflow because it's not it wasn't
 

7289
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:29,510
tensorflow because it's not it wasn't
set up for eager mode at the time yeah

7290
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:29,520
set up for eager mode at the time yeah
 

7291
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:32,270
set up for eager mode at the time yeah
it was 1.0 exactly yeah and so one of

7292
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:32,280
it was 1.0 exactly yeah and so one of
 

7293
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:34,550
it was 1.0 exactly yeah and so one of
the so one of the things about that is

7294
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:34,560
the so one of the things about that is
 

7295
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,109
the so one of the things about that is
in the context of it being a research

7296
02:05:36,109 --> 02:05:36,119
in the context of it being a research
 

7297
02:05:36,119 --> 02:05:37,850
in the context of it being a research
project I'm very happy with the fact

7298
02:05:37,850 --> 02:05:37,860
project I'm very happy with the fact
 

7299
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:39,890
project I'm very happy with the fact
that we built a lot of really cool

7300
02:05:39,890 --> 02:05:39,900
that we built a lot of really cool
 

7301
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:41,990
that we built a lot of really cool
technology we learned a lot of things I

7302
02:05:41,990 --> 02:05:42,000
technology we learned a lot of things I
 

7303
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,189
technology we learned a lot of things I
think the ideas went on to have

7304
02:05:43,189 --> 02:05:43,199
think the ideas went on to have
 

7305
02:05:43,199 --> 02:05:44,810
think the ideas went on to have
influence and other systems like pytorch

7306
02:05:44,810 --> 02:05:44,820
influence and other systems like pytorch
 

7307
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:46,609
influence and other systems like pytorch
a few people use that right here right

7308
02:05:46,609 --> 02:05:46,619
a few people use that right here right
 

7309
02:05:46,619 --> 02:05:49,010
a few people use that right here right
and so I think that's super cool and for

7310
02:05:49,010 --> 02:05:49,020
and so I think that's super cool and for
 

7311
02:05:49,020 --> 02:05:51,169
and so I think that's super cool and for
me personally I learned so much from it

7312
02:05:51,169 --> 02:05:51,179
me personally I learned so much from it
 

7313
02:05:51,179 --> 02:05:52,910
me personally I learned so much from it
right and I think a lot of the engineers

7314
02:05:52,910 --> 02:05:52,920
right and I think a lot of the engineers
 

7315
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:54,470
right and I think a lot of the engineers
that worked on it also learned a

7316
02:05:54,470 --> 02:05:54,480
that worked on it also learned a
 

7317
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:56,450
that worked on it also learned a
tremendous amount and so you know I

7318
02:05:56,450 --> 02:05:56,460
tremendous amount and so you know I
 

7319
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:57,589
tremendous amount and so you know I
think that

7320
02:05:57,589 --> 02:05:57,599
think that
 

7321
02:05:57,599 --> 02:05:59,149
think that
um that's just really exciting to see

7322
02:05:59,149 --> 02:05:59,159
um that's just really exciting to see
 

7323
02:05:59,159 --> 02:06:00,770
um that's just really exciting to see
and and you know I'm sorry that the

7324
02:06:00,770 --> 02:06:00,780
and and you know I'm sorry that the
 

7325
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:02,510
and and you know I'm sorry that the
project didn't work out I wish it did of

7326
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:02,520
project didn't work out I wish it did of
 

7327
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,669
project didn't work out I wish it did of
course right but um

7328
02:06:04,669 --> 02:06:04,679
course right but um
 

7329
02:06:04,679 --> 02:06:07,430
course right but um
uh but you know it's it's a research

7330
02:06:07,430 --> 02:06:07,440
uh but you know it's it's a research
 

7331
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:08,810
uh but you know it's it's a research
project and so you're there to learn

7332
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:08,820
project and so you're there to learn
 

7333
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:10,490
project and so you're there to learn
from it but it's interesting to think

7334
02:06:10,490 --> 02:06:10,500
from it but it's interesting to think
 

7335
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:11,649
from it but it's interesting to think
about

7336
02:06:11,649 --> 02:06:11,659
about
 

7337
02:06:11,659 --> 02:06:15,350
about
uh the evolution of programming

7338
02:06:15,350 --> 02:06:15,360
uh the evolution of programming
 

7339
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:18,890
uh the evolution of programming
as we come up with these whole new set

7340
02:06:18,890 --> 02:06:18,900
as we come up with these whole new set
 

7341
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:20,990
as we come up with these whole new set
of algorithms in machine learning in

7342
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:21,000
of algorithms in machine learning in
 

7343
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,970
of algorithms in machine learning in
artificial intelligence and what's going

7344
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:22,980
artificial intelligence and what's going
 

7345
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:24,830
artificial intelligence and what's going
to win out because it could be a new

7346
02:06:24,830 --> 02:06:24,840
to win out because it could be a new
 

7347
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:27,350
to win out because it could be a new
programming language yeah it could be

7348
02:06:27,350 --> 02:06:27,360
programming language yeah it could be
 

7349
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:31,189
programming language yeah it could be
um I mean we I just mentioned Julia I

7350
02:06:31,189 --> 02:06:31,199
um I mean we I just mentioned Julia I
 

7351
02:06:31,199 --> 02:06:32,930
um I mean we I just mentioned Julia I
think there's a lot of ideas behind

7352
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:32,940
think there's a lot of ideas behind
 

7353
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:34,930
think there's a lot of ideas behind
Julia that

7354
02:06:34,930 --> 02:06:34,940
Julia that
 

7355
02:06:34,940 --> 02:06:37,129
Julia that
Mojo shares

7356
02:06:37,129 --> 02:06:37,139
Mojo shares
 

7357
02:06:37,139 --> 02:06:38,510
Mojo shares
um what what are your thoughts about

7358
02:06:38,510 --> 02:06:38,520
um what what are your thoughts about
 

7359
02:06:38,520 --> 02:06:40,010
um what what are your thoughts about
Julia in general

7360
02:06:40,010 --> 02:06:40,020
Julia in general
 

7361
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:40,729
Julia in general
um

7362
02:06:40,729 --> 02:06:40,739
um
 

7363
02:06:40,739 --> 02:06:42,470
um
um so I would I will have to say that

7364
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:42,480
um so I would I will have to say that
 

7365
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,990
um so I would I will have to say that
when we launched Mojo the

7366
02:06:44,990 --> 02:06:45,000
when we launched Mojo the
 

7367
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,189
when we launched Mojo the
one of the biggest things I didn't

7368
02:06:46,189 --> 02:06:46,199
one of the biggest things I didn't
 

7369
02:06:46,199 --> 02:06:47,870
one of the biggest things I didn't
predict was the response from the Julia

7370
02:06:47,870 --> 02:06:47,880
predict was the response from the Julia
 

7371
02:06:47,880 --> 02:06:50,030
predict was the response from the Julia
community and so

7372
02:06:50,030 --> 02:06:50,040
community and so
 

7373
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:52,669
community and so
um I was not I mean I've okay let me

7374
02:06:52,669 --> 02:06:52,679
um I was not I mean I've okay let me
 

7375
02:06:52,679 --> 02:06:54,530
um I was not I mean I've okay let me
take a step back I've known the Julia

7376
02:06:54,530 --> 02:06:54,540
take a step back I've known the Julia
 

7377
02:06:54,540 --> 02:06:56,629
take a step back I've known the Julia
folks for a really long time they were

7378
02:06:56,629 --> 02:06:56,639
folks for a really long time they were
 

7379
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:58,669
folks for a really long time they were
they're an adopter of llvm a long time

7380
02:06:58,669 --> 02:06:58,679
they're an adopter of llvm a long time
 

7381
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:00,589
they're an adopter of llvm a long time
ago they've been pushing state of the

7382
02:07:00,589 --> 02:07:00,599
ago they've been pushing state of the
 

7383
02:07:00,599 --> 02:07:02,270
ago they've been pushing state of the
art in a bunch of different ways Julie

7384
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:02,280
art in a bunch of different ways Julie
 

7385
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:04,850
art in a bunch of different ways Julie
is a really cool system

7386
02:07:04,850 --> 02:07:04,860
is a really cool system
 

7387
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:06,050
is a really cool system
um I had always thought of Julia as

7388
02:07:06,050 --> 02:07:06,060
um I had always thought of Julia as
 

7389
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:07,790
um I had always thought of Julia as
being mostly a scientific Computing

7390
02:07:07,790 --> 02:07:07,800
being mostly a scientific Computing
 

7391
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:10,910
being mostly a scientific Computing
focused environment right and and I

7392
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:10,920
focused environment right and and I
 

7393
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:12,649
focused environment right and and I
thought that was its focus

7394
02:07:12,649 --> 02:07:12,659
thought that was its focus
 

7395
02:07:12,659 --> 02:07:14,030
thought that was its focus
um I neglected

7396
02:07:14,030 --> 02:07:14,040
um I neglected
 

7397
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:16,070
um I neglected
to understand that one of their missions

7398
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:16,080
to understand that one of their missions
 

7399
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:19,129
to understand that one of their missions
is to like help make python work end to

7400
02:07:19,129 --> 02:07:19,139
is to like help make python work end to
 

7401
02:07:19,139 --> 02:07:22,310
is to like help make python work end to
end and so I think that was my my error

7402
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:22,320
end and so I think that was my my error
 

7403
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:23,629
end and so I think that was my my error
for not understanding that and so I

7404
02:07:23,629 --> 02:07:23,639
for not understanding that and so I
 

7405
02:07:23,639 --> 02:07:25,070
for not understanding that and so I
could have been maybe more sensitive to

7406
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:25,080
could have been maybe more sensitive to
 

7407
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:27,229
could have been maybe more sensitive to
that but um but there's major

7408
02:07:27,229 --> 02:07:27,239
that but um but there's major
 

7409
02:07:27,239 --> 02:07:29,089
that but um but there's major
differences between what Mojo's doing

7410
02:07:29,089 --> 02:07:29,099
differences between what Mojo's doing
 

7411
02:07:29,099 --> 02:07:31,490
differences between what Mojo's doing
what Julie is doing so as you say Julia

7412
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:31,500
what Julie is doing so as you say Julia
 

7413
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:32,810
what Julie is doing so as you say Julia
is not python

7414
02:07:32,810 --> 02:07:32,820
is not python
 

7415
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:35,270
is not python
right and so one of the things that a

7416
02:07:35,270 --> 02:07:35,280
right and so one of the things that a
 

7417
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,010
right and so one of the things that a
lot of the Julia people came out and

7418
02:07:37,010 --> 02:07:37,020
lot of the Julia people came out and
 

7419
02:07:37,020 --> 02:07:39,589
lot of the Julia people came out and
said is like okay well if we put a ton

7420
02:07:39,589 --> 02:07:39,599
said is like okay well if we put a ton
 

7421
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:41,930
said is like okay well if we put a ton
of more energy and ton more money or

7422
02:07:41,930 --> 02:07:41,940
of more energy and ton more money or
 

7423
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:44,629
of more energy and ton more money or
engineering or whatever into Julia maybe

7424
02:07:44,629 --> 02:07:44,639
engineering or whatever into Julia maybe
 

7425
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:46,430
engineering or whatever into Julia maybe
uh that would be better than starting

7426
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:46,440
uh that would be better than starting
 

7427
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,229
uh that would be better than starting
Mojo right

7428
02:07:48,229 --> 02:07:48,239
Mojo right
 

7429
02:07:48,239 --> 02:07:50,089
Mojo right
well I mean maybe that's true but it

7430
02:07:50,089 --> 02:07:50,099
well I mean maybe that's true but it
 

7431
02:07:50,099 --> 02:07:52,669
well I mean maybe that's true but it
still wouldn't make Julian to python so

7432
02:07:52,669 --> 02:07:52,679
still wouldn't make Julian to python so
 

7433
02:07:52,679 --> 02:07:54,050
still wouldn't make Julian to python so
if you've worked backwards from the goal

7434
02:07:54,050 --> 02:07:54,060
if you've worked backwards from the goal
 

7435
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:56,629
if you've worked backwards from the goal
of let's build something for python

7436
02:07:56,629 --> 02:07:56,639
of let's build something for python
 

7437
02:07:56,639 --> 02:07:58,790
of let's build something for python
programmers without requiring them to

7438
02:07:58,790 --> 02:07:58,800
programmers without requiring them to
 

7439
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:01,310
programmers without requiring them to
relearn syntax

7440
02:08:01,310 --> 02:08:01,320
relearn syntax
 

7441
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:03,830
relearn syntax
then Julia just isn't

7442
02:08:03,830 --> 02:08:03,840
then Julia just isn't
 

7443
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,149
then Julia just isn't
there right I mean that's a different

7444
02:08:05,149 --> 02:08:05,159
there right I mean that's a different
 

7445
02:08:05,159 --> 02:08:08,629
there right I mean that's a different
thing right and so if you anchor on I

7446
02:08:08,629 --> 02:08:08,639
thing right and so if you anchor on I
 

7447
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:10,070
thing right and so if you anchor on I
love Julia and I want Julia to go

7448
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:10,080
love Julia and I want Julia to go
 

7449
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:11,570
love Julia and I want Julia to go
further then you can you can look at it

7450
02:08:11,570 --> 02:08:11,580
further then you can you can look at it
 

7451
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:13,189
further then you can you can look at it
from a different lens But the lens we

7452
02:08:13,189 --> 02:08:13,199
from a different lens But the lens we
 

7453
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:15,470
from a different lens But the lens we
were coming at it was hey everybody is

7454
02:08:15,470 --> 02:08:15,480
were coming at it was hey everybody is
 

7455
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:17,870
were coming at it was hey everybody is
using python python isn't syntax isn't

7456
02:08:17,870 --> 02:08:17,880
using python python isn't syntax isn't
 

7457
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:19,850
using python python isn't syntax isn't
broken let's take what's great about

7458
02:08:19,850 --> 02:08:19,860
broken let's take what's great about
 

7459
02:08:19,860 --> 02:08:21,589
broken let's take what's great about
Python and make it even better and so

7460
02:08:21,589 --> 02:08:21,599
Python and make it even better and so
 

7461
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:23,450
Python and make it even better and so
it's just a different starting point so

7462
02:08:23,450 --> 02:08:23,460
it's just a different starting point so
 

7463
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:24,830
it's just a different starting point so
I think Julie is a great language the

7464
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:24,840
I think Julie is a great language the
 

7465
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:26,450
I think Julie is a great language the
community is a lovely Community they're

7466
02:08:26,450 --> 02:08:26,460
community is a lovely Community they're
 

7467
02:08:26,460 --> 02:08:28,129
community is a lovely Community they're
doing really cool stuff but it's just a

7468
02:08:28,129 --> 02:08:28,139
doing really cool stuff but it's just a
 

7469
02:08:28,139 --> 02:08:30,169
doing really cool stuff but it's just a
different a slightly different angle

7470
02:08:30,169 --> 02:08:30,179
different a slightly different angle
 

7471
02:08:30,179 --> 02:08:32,330
different a slightly different angle
but it does seem that python is quite

7472
02:08:32,330 --> 02:08:32,340
but it does seem that python is quite
 

7473
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:35,290
but it does seem that python is quite
sticky uh is there some

7474
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:35,300
sticky uh is there some
 

7475
02:08:35,300 --> 02:08:37,850
sticky uh is there some
uh philosophical almost thing you could

7476
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:37,860
uh philosophical almost thing you could
 

7477
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:40,129
uh philosophical almost thing you could
say about why python by many measures

7478
02:08:40,129 --> 02:08:40,139
say about why python by many measures
 

7479
02:08:40,139 --> 02:08:41,990
say about why python by many measures
seems to be the most popular programming

7480
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:42,000
seems to be the most popular programming
 

7481
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,669
seems to be the most popular programming
language in the world well I can tell

7482
02:08:43,669 --> 02:08:43,679
language in the world well I can tell
 

7483
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:45,410
language in the world well I can tell
you things I love about it maybe that's

7484
02:08:45,410 --> 02:08:45,420
you things I love about it maybe that's
 

7485
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:47,270
you things I love about it maybe that's
one way to answer the question right so

7486
02:08:47,270 --> 02:08:47,280
one way to answer the question right so
 

7487
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:49,729
one way to answer the question right so
huge package ecosystem

7488
02:08:49,729 --> 02:08:49,739
huge package ecosystem
 

7489
02:08:49,739 --> 02:08:51,470
huge package ecosystem
super lightweight and easy to integrate

7490
02:08:51,470 --> 02:08:51,480
super lightweight and easy to integrate
 

7491
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:54,470
super lightweight and easy to integrate
it has very low startup time

7492
02:08:54,470 --> 02:08:54,480
it has very low startup time
 

7493
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:56,149
it has very low startup time
right so what startup time you mean

7494
02:08:56,149 --> 02:08:56,159
right so what startup time you mean
 

7495
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:58,070
right so what startup time you mean
money curve or what yeah so if you if

7496
02:08:58,070 --> 02:08:58,080
money curve or what yeah so if you if
 

7497
02:08:58,080 --> 02:08:59,450
money curve or what yeah so if you if
you look at certain other languages that

7498
02:08:59,450 --> 02:08:59,460
you look at certain other languages that
 

7499
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:02,149
you look at certain other languages that
you know you say like go and it just

7500
02:09:02,149 --> 02:09:02,159
you know you say like go and it just
 

7501
02:09:02,159 --> 02:09:04,310
you know you say like go and it just
takes a like Java for example it takes a

7502
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:04,320
takes a like Java for example it takes a
 

7503
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:06,290
takes a like Java for example it takes a
long time to compile all the things and

7504
02:09:06,290 --> 02:09:06,300
long time to compile all the things and
 

7505
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:08,390
long time to compile all the things and
and then the the VM starts up and the

7506
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:08,400
and then the the VM starts up and the
 

7507
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:09,890
and then the the VM starts up and the
garbage clusters kicks in and then it

7508
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:09,900
garbage clusters kicks in and then it
 

7509
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:11,390
garbage clusters kicks in and then it
revs its engines and then it can plow

7510
02:09:11,390 --> 02:09:11,400
revs its engines and then it can plow
 

7511
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:12,649
revs its engines and then it can plow
through a lot of Internet stuff or

7512
02:09:12,649 --> 02:09:12,659
through a lot of Internet stuff or
 

7513
02:09:12,659 --> 02:09:13,970
through a lot of Internet stuff or
whatever right

7514
02:09:13,970 --> 02:09:13,980
whatever right
 

7515
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:16,490
whatever right
um python is like scripting like it's it

7516
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:16,500
um python is like scripting like it's it
 

7517
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:18,530
um python is like scripting like it's it
just goes right python has very low

7518
02:09:18,530 --> 02:09:18,540
just goes right python has very low
 

7519
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:20,450
just goes right python has very low
compile time like so you're not sitting

7520
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:20,460
compile time like so you're not sitting
 

7521
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:22,070
compile time like so you're not sitting
there waiting python integrates into

7522
02:09:22,070 --> 02:09:22,080
there waiting python integrates into
 

7523
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:24,169
there waiting python integrates into
notebooks in a very elegant way that

7524
02:09:24,169 --> 02:09:24,179
notebooks in a very elegant way that
 

7525
02:09:24,179 --> 02:09:26,510
notebooks in a very elegant way that
makes exploration super interactive and

7526
02:09:26,510 --> 02:09:26,520
makes exploration super interactive and
 

7527
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:29,270
makes exploration super interactive and
it's awesome right python is also um

7528
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:29,280
it's awesome right python is also um
 

7529
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:31,910
it's awesome right python is also um
it's like almost the glue of computing

7530
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:31,920
it's like almost the glue of computing
 

7531
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:34,189
it's like almost the glue of computing
because it has such a simple object

7532
02:09:34,189 --> 02:09:34,199
because it has such a simple object
 

7533
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:36,649
because it has such a simple object
representation a lot of things plug into

7534
02:09:36,649 --> 02:09:36,659
representation a lot of things plug into
 

7535
02:09:36,659 --> 02:09:38,750
representation a lot of things plug into
it that Dynamic meta programming thing

7536
02:09:38,750 --> 02:09:38,760
it that Dynamic meta programming thing
 

7537
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:40,129
it that Dynamic meta programming thing
we were talking about also enables

7538
02:09:40,129 --> 02:09:40,139
we were talking about also enables
 

7539
02:09:40,139 --> 02:09:41,810
we were talking about also enables
really expressive and beautiful apis

7540
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:41,820
really expressive and beautiful apis
 

7541
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:43,729
really expressive and beautiful apis
right so there's lots of reasons that

7542
02:09:43,729 --> 02:09:43,739
right so there's lots of reasons that
 

7543
02:09:43,739 --> 02:09:45,589
right so there's lots of reasons that
you can look at

7544
02:09:45,589 --> 02:09:45,599
you can look at
 

7545
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:47,570
you can look at
technical things that python has done

7546
02:09:47,570 --> 02:09:47,580
technical things that python has done
 

7547
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:49,310
technical things that python has done
and say like okay well this is actually

7548
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:49,320
and say like okay well this is actually
 

7549
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:51,109
and say like okay well this is actually
a pretty amazing thing and any one of

7550
02:09:51,109 --> 02:09:51,119
a pretty amazing thing and any one of
 

7551
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:53,870
a pretty amazing thing and any one of
those you can neglect people all just

7552
02:09:53,870 --> 02:09:53,880
those you can neglect people all just
 

7553
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:55,430
those you can neglect people all just
talk about indentation

7554
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:55,440
talk about indentation
 

7555
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:57,350
talk about indentation
and ignore like the fundamental things

7556
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:57,360
and ignore like the fundamental things
 

7557
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:59,510
and ignore like the fundamental things
but then you also look at the community

7558
02:09:59,510 --> 02:09:59,520
but then you also look at the community
 

7559
02:09:59,520 --> 02:10:01,669
but then you also look at the community
side right so python owns machine

7560
02:10:01,669 --> 02:10:01,679
side right so python owns machine
 

7561
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:02,990
side right so python owns machine
learning

7562
02:10:02,990 --> 02:10:03,000
learning
 

7563
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,490
learning
machine learning is pretty big yeah and

7564
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:04,500
machine learning is pretty big yeah and
 

7565
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:06,050
machine learning is pretty big yeah and
it's growing and it's growing right and

7566
02:10:06,050 --> 02:10:06,060
it's growing and it's growing right and
 

7567
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:07,550
it's growing and it's growing right and
it's growing in importance right and so

7568
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:07,560
it's growing in importance right and so
 

7569
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,470
it's growing in importance right and so
and there's a reputation of prestige to

7570
02:10:09,470 --> 02:10:09,480
and there's a reputation of prestige to
 

7571
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:12,169
and there's a reputation of prestige to
machine learning to where like if you're

7572
02:10:12,169 --> 02:10:12,179
machine learning to where like if you're
 

7573
02:10:12,179 --> 02:10:13,550
machine learning to where like if you're
a new programmer you're thinking about

7574
02:10:13,550 --> 02:10:13,560
a new programmer you're thinking about
 

7575
02:10:13,560 --> 02:10:16,370
a new programmer you're thinking about
like which programming language do I use

7576
02:10:16,370 --> 02:10:16,380
like which programming language do I use
 

7577
02:10:16,380 --> 02:10:17,570
like which programming language do I use
well I should probably care about

7578
02:10:17,570 --> 02:10:17,580
well I should probably care about
 

7579
02:10:17,580 --> 02:10:19,609
well I should probably care about
machine learning therefore let me try

7580
02:10:19,609 --> 02:10:19,619
machine learning therefore let me try
 

7581
02:10:19,619 --> 02:10:21,109
machine learning therefore let me try
Python and what kind of builds and

7582
02:10:21,109 --> 02:10:21,119
Python and what kind of builds and
 

7583
02:10:21,119 --> 02:10:23,810
Python and what kind of builds and
builds a bit and even go go back before

7584
02:10:23,810 --> 02:10:23,820
builds a bit and even go go back before
 

7585
02:10:23,820 --> 02:10:27,290
builds a bit and even go go back before
that like my kids Learn Python

7586
02:10:27,290 --> 02:10:27,300
that like my kids Learn Python
 

7587
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:28,729
that like my kids Learn Python
probably not because I'm telling them to

7588
02:10:28,729 --> 02:10:28,739
probably not because I'm telling them to
 

7589
02:10:28,739 --> 02:10:30,290
probably not because I'm telling them to
Learn Python but because were they

7590
02:10:30,290 --> 02:10:30,300
Learn Python but because were they
 

7591
02:10:30,300 --> 02:10:32,750
Learn Python but because were they
replying against you or what no no well

7592
02:10:32,750 --> 02:10:32,760
replying against you or what no no well
 

7593
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:34,490
replying against you or what no no well
they also learn scratch right and things

7594
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:34,500
they also learn scratch right and things
 

7595
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:36,290
they also learn scratch right and things
like this too but it's because python is

7596
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:36,300
like this too but it's because python is
 

7597
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:37,970
like this too but it's because python is
taught everywhere right because it's

7598
02:10:37,970 --> 02:10:37,980
taught everywhere right because it's
 

7599
02:10:37,980 --> 02:10:39,589
taught everywhere right because it's
easy to learn right and because it's

7600
02:10:39,589 --> 02:10:39,599
easy to learn right and because it's
 

7601
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:41,870
easy to learn right and because it's
pervasive right and there's like my day

7602
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:41,880
pervasive right and there's like my day
 

7603
02:10:41,880 --> 02:10:45,770
pervasive right and there's like my day
we learned Java and C plus plus yeah but

7604
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:45,780
we learned Java and C plus plus yeah but
 

7605
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:48,530
we learned Java and C plus plus yeah but
uphill both directions but yes I guess

7606
02:10:48,530 --> 02:10:48,540
uphill both directions but yes I guess
 

7607
02:10:48,540 --> 02:10:50,629
uphill both directions but yes I guess
python is the main language of teaching

7608
02:10:50,629 --> 02:10:50,639
python is the main language of teaching
 

7609
02:10:50,639 --> 02:10:52,189
python is the main language of teaching
software engineering schools now yeah

7610
02:10:52,189 --> 02:10:52,199
software engineering schools now yeah
 

7611
02:10:52,199 --> 02:10:53,629
software engineering schools now yeah
well if you look at if you look at this

7612
02:10:53,629 --> 02:10:53,639
well if you look at if you look at this
 

7613
02:10:53,639 --> 02:10:56,689
well if you look at if you look at this
there's these growth Cycles right if you

7614
02:10:56,689 --> 02:10:56,699
there's these growth Cycles right if you
 

7615
02:10:56,699 --> 02:10:58,790
there's these growth Cycles right if you
look at what causes things to become

7616
02:10:58,790 --> 02:10:58,800
look at what causes things to become
 

7617
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:00,950
look at what causes things to become
popular and then gain in popularity

7618
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:00,960
popular and then gain in popularity
 

7619
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:03,050
popular and then gain in popularity
there's reinforcing feedback loops and

7620
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:03,060
there's reinforcing feedback loops and
 

7621
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:04,430
there's reinforcing feedback loops and
things like this and I think python has

7622
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:04,440
things like this and I think python has
 

7623
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:06,410
things like this and I think python has
done again the whole Community has done

7624
02:11:06,410 --> 02:11:06,420
done again the whole Community has done
 

7625
02:11:06,420 --> 02:11:07,609
done again the whole Community has done
a really good job of building those

7626
02:11:07,609 --> 02:11:07,619
a really good job of building those
 

7627
02:11:07,619 --> 02:11:09,530
a really good job of building those
growth loops and help Propel the

7628
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:09,540
growth loops and help Propel the
 

7629
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:11,089
growth loops and help Propel the
ecosystem and I think that again you

7630
02:11:11,089 --> 02:11:11,099
ecosystem and I think that again you
 

7631
02:11:11,099 --> 02:11:12,770
ecosystem and I think that again you
look at what you can get done with just

7632
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:12,780
look at what you can get done with just
 

7633
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:15,470
look at what you can get done with just
a few lines of code it's amazing so this

7634
02:11:15,470 --> 02:11:15,480
a few lines of code it's amazing so this
 

7635
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:17,089
a few lines of code it's amazing so this
kind of self

7636
02:11:17,089 --> 02:11:17,099
kind of self
 

7637
02:11:17,099 --> 02:11:19,430
kind of self
building Loop

7638
02:11:19,430 --> 02:11:19,440
building Loop
 

7639
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:21,229
building Loop
it's interesting to understand because

7640
02:11:21,229 --> 02:11:21,239
it's interesting to understand because
 

7641
02:11:21,239 --> 02:11:23,810
it's interesting to understand because
when you look at Mojo what it stands for

7642
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:23,820
when you look at Mojo what it stands for
 

7643
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:25,729
when you look at Mojo what it stands for
some of the features

7644
02:11:25,729 --> 02:11:25,739
some of the features
 

7645
02:11:25,739 --> 02:11:28,970
some of the features
it seems sort of clear that this is a

7646
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:28,980
it seems sort of clear that this is a
 

7647
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:30,709
it seems sort of clear that this is a
good direction for programming languages

7648
02:11:30,709 --> 02:11:30,719
good direction for programming languages
 

7649
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:32,689
good direction for programming languages
to evolve in the machine Learning

7650
02:11:32,689 --> 02:11:32,699
to evolve in the machine Learning
 

7651
02:11:32,699 --> 02:11:34,669
to evolve in the machine Learning
Community but it's still not obvious

7652
02:11:34,669 --> 02:11:34,679
Community but it's still not obvious
 

7653
02:11:34,679 --> 02:11:37,430
Community but it's still not obvious
that it will because of this

7654
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
that it will because of this
 

7655
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,770
that it will because of this
whatever the engine of popularity of

02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:41,390
whatever the engine of popularity of
virality

7658
02:11:41,390 --> 02:11:41,400
virality
 

7659
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:42,530
virality
um is there something you could speak to

7660
02:11:42,530 --> 02:11:42,540
um is there something you could speak to
 

7661
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:45,229
um is there something you could speak to
like how how do you get people to switch

7662
02:11:45,229 --> 02:11:45,239
like how how do you get people to switch
 

7663
02:11:45,239 --> 02:11:47,390
like how how do you get people to switch
Yeah well I mean I think that the the

7664
02:11:47,390 --> 02:11:47,400
Yeah well I mean I think that the the
 

7665
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:49,490
Yeah well I mean I think that the the
the the viral growth Loop is to switch

7666
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:49,500
the the viral growth Loop is to switch
 

7667
02:11:49,500 --> 02:11:51,649
the the viral growth Loop is to switch
people to Unicode yeah I think the

7668
02:11:51,649 --> 02:11:51,659
people to Unicode yeah I think the
 

7669
02:11:51,659 --> 02:11:52,910
people to Unicode yeah I think the
Unicode file extensions are what I'm

7670
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:52,920
Unicode file extensions are what I'm
 

7671
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:54,169
Unicode file extensions are what I'm
betting on I think that's going to be

7672
02:11:54,169 --> 02:11:54,179
betting on I think that's going to be
 

7673
02:11:54,179 --> 02:11:57,050
betting on I think that's going to be
the thing yeah tell the kids that you

7674
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:57,060
the thing yeah tell the kids that you
 

7675
02:11:57,060 --> 02:11:58,970
the thing yeah tell the kids that you
could use the fire emojis exactly what

7676
02:11:58,970 --> 02:11:58,980
could use the fire emojis exactly what
 

7677
02:11:58,980 --> 02:12:00,490
could use the fire emojis exactly what
exactly

7678
02:12:00,490 --> 02:12:00,500
exactly
 

7679
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:03,830
exactly
uh well in all seriousness like I mean I

7680
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:03,840
uh well in all seriousness like I mean I
 

7681
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,570
uh well in all seriousness like I mean I
think there's really I'll give you two

7682
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:05,580
think there's really I'll give you two
 

7683
02:12:05,580 --> 02:12:08,689
think there's really I'll give you two
opposite answers one is

7684
02:12:08,689 --> 02:12:08,699
opposite answers one is
 

7685
02:12:08,699 --> 02:12:10,669
opposite answers one is
I hope if it's useful if it solves

7686
02:12:10,669 --> 02:12:10,679
I hope if it's useful if it solves
 

7687
02:12:10,679 --> 02:12:12,350
I hope if it's useful if it solves
problems and if people care about those

7688
02:12:12,350 --> 02:12:12,360
problems and if people care about those
 

7689
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:13,910
problems and if people care about those
problems being solved

7690
02:12:13,910 --> 02:12:13,920
problems being solved
 

7691
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:15,649
problems being solved
they'll adopt the tech

7692
02:12:15,649 --> 02:12:15,659
they'll adopt the tech
 

7693
02:12:15,659 --> 02:12:17,450
they'll adopt the tech
right that's that's kind of the simple

7694
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:17,460
right that's that's kind of the simple
 

7695
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:19,129
right that's that's kind of the simple
answer and when you're looking to get

7696
02:12:19,129 --> 02:12:19,139
answer and when you're looking to get
 

7697
02:12:19,139 --> 02:12:21,770
answer and when you're looking to get
Tech adopted the question is is it

7698
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:21,780
Tech adopted the question is is it
 

7699
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:23,089
Tech adopted the question is is it
solving an important problem people need

7700
02:12:23,089 --> 02:12:23,099
solving an important problem people need
 

7701
02:12:23,099 --> 02:12:26,810
solving an important problem people need
solved and is the adoption cost low

7702
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:26,820
solved and is the adoption cost low
 

7703
02:12:26,820 --> 02:12:28,850
solved and is the adoption cost low
enough that they're willing to make the

7704
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:28,860
enough that they're willing to make the
 

7705
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:31,669
enough that they're willing to make the
switch and cut over and do do the pain

7706
02:12:31,669 --> 02:12:31,679
switch and cut over and do do the pain
 

7707
02:12:31,679 --> 02:12:33,229
switch and cut over and do do the pain
up front so they can actually do it

7708
02:12:33,229 --> 02:12:33,239
up front so they can actually do it
 

7709
02:12:33,239 --> 02:12:34,430
up front so they can actually do it
right

7710
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:34,440
right
 

7711
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:36,890
right
and so hopefully Mojo will be that for a

7712
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:36,900
and so hopefully Mojo will be that for a
 

7713
02:12:36,900 --> 02:12:39,169
and so hopefully Mojo will be that for a
bunch of people and you know people

7714
02:12:39,169 --> 02:12:39,179
bunch of people and you know people
 

7715
02:12:39,179 --> 02:12:40,550
bunch of people and you know people
building these hybrid packages are

7716
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:40,560
building these hybrid packages are
 

7717
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:43,250
building these hybrid packages are
suffering it's really painful and so I

7718
02:12:43,250 --> 02:12:43,260
suffering it's really painful and so I
 

7719
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:44,209
suffering it's really painful and so I
think that we have a good shot of

7720
02:12:44,209 --> 02:12:44,219
think that we have a good shot of
 

7721
02:12:44,219 --> 02:12:46,070
think that we have a good shot of
helping people but the other side is

7722
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:46,080
helping people but the other side is
 

7723
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,830
helping people but the other side is
like it's okay if people don't use Mojo

7724
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:47,840
like it's okay if people don't use Mojo
 

7725
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:49,910
like it's okay if people don't use Mojo
like it's not my job to say like

7726
02:12:49,910 --> 02:12:49,920
like it's not my job to say like
 

7727
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,470
like it's not my job to say like
everybody should do this like I'm not

7728
02:12:51,470 --> 02:12:51,480
everybody should do this like I'm not
 

7729
02:12:51,480 --> 02:12:53,209
everybody should do this like I'm not
saying python is bad like I hope python

7730
02:12:53,209 --> 02:12:53,219
saying python is bad like I hope python
 

7731
02:12:53,219 --> 02:12:54,770
saying python is bad like I hope python
see python like all these

7732
02:12:54,770 --> 02:12:54,780
see python like all these
 

7733
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:56,209
see python like all these
implementations because python ecosystem

7734
02:12:56,209 --> 02:12:56,219
implementations because python ecosystem
 

7735
02:12:56,219 --> 02:12:58,550
implementations because python ecosystem
is not just C python it's also a bunch

7736
02:12:58,550 --> 02:12:58,560
is not just C python it's also a bunch
 

7737
02:12:58,560 --> 02:12:59,689
is not just C python it's also a bunch
of different implementations with

7738
02:12:59,689 --> 02:12:59,699
of different implementations with
 

7739
02:12:59,699 --> 02:13:01,069
of different implementations with
different trade-offs and this ecosystem

7740
02:13:01,069 --> 02:13:01,079
different trade-offs and this ecosystem
 

7741
02:13:01,079 --> 02:13:04,069
different trade-offs and this ecosystem
is really powerful and exciting

7742
02:13:04,069 --> 02:13:04,079
is really powerful and exciting
 

7743
02:13:04,079 --> 02:13:05,510
is really powerful and exciting
um as are other programming languages

7744
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:05,520
um as are other programming languages
 

7745
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:07,910
um as are other programming languages
it's not like typescript or something is

7746
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:07,920
it's not like typescript or something is
 

7747
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:10,010
it's not like typescript or something is
going to go away right and so it's not a

7748
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:10,020
going to go away right and so it's not a
 

7749
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:12,050
going to go away right and so it's not a
there's not a winner take all thing and

7750
02:13:12,050 --> 02:13:12,060
there's not a winner take all thing and
 

7751
02:13:12,060 --> 02:13:13,729
there's not a winner take all thing and
so I hope that Mojo is exciting and

7752
02:13:13,729 --> 02:13:13,739
so I hope that Mojo is exciting and
 

7753
02:13:13,739 --> 02:13:15,109
so I hope that Mojo is exciting and
useful to people but if it's not that's

7754
02:13:15,109 --> 02:13:15,119
useful to people but if it's not that's
 

7755
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:18,530
useful to people but if it's not that's
also fine but I also wonder what uh

7756
02:13:18,530 --> 02:13:18,540
also fine but I also wonder what uh
 

7757
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:20,750
also fine but I also wonder what uh
the use case

7758
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:20,760
the use case
 

7759
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:24,050
the use case
for why you should try Mojo would be so

7760
02:13:24,050 --> 02:13:24,060
for why you should try Mojo would be so
 

7761
02:13:24,060 --> 02:13:27,189
for why you should try Mojo would be so
practically speaking Yeah it seems like

7762
02:13:27,189 --> 02:13:27,199
practically speaking Yeah it seems like
 

7763
02:13:27,199 --> 02:13:30,290
practically speaking Yeah it seems like
uh so there's entertainment there's a

7764
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:30,300
uh so there's entertainment there's a
 

7765
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:32,750
uh so there's entertainment there's a
dopamine hit of saying holy this is

7766
02:13:32,750 --> 02:13:32,760
dopamine hit of saying holy this is
 

7767
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,490
dopamine hit of saying holy this is
10 times faster

7768
02:13:34,490 --> 02:13:34,500
10 times faster
 

7769
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:36,589
10 times faster
uh this little piece of code is 10 times

7770
02:13:36,589 --> 02:13:36,599
uh this little piece of code is 10 times
 

7771
02:13:36,599 --> 02:13:38,990
uh this little piece of code is 10 times
faster in Mojo out of the box before you

7772
02:13:38,990 --> 02:13:39,000
faster in Mojo out of the box before you
 

7773
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,990
faster in Mojo out of the box before you
get to 35 000. exactly I mean just even

7774
02:13:41,990 --> 02:13:42,000
get to 35 000. exactly I mean just even
 

7775
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,169
get to 35 000. exactly I mean just even
that I mean that's the dopamine hit that

7776
02:13:45,169 --> 02:13:45,179
that I mean that's the dopamine hit that
 

7777
02:13:45,179 --> 02:13:47,990
that I mean that's the dopamine hit that
uh every programmer sort of dreams of is

7778
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,000
uh every programmer sort of dreams of is
 

7779
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,810
uh every programmer sort of dreams of is
uh the optimization it's it's also the

7780
02:13:50,810 --> 02:13:50,820
uh the optimization it's it's also the
 

7781
02:13:50,820 --> 02:13:54,169
uh the optimization it's it's also the
drug that can uh pull you in and have

7782
02:13:54,169 --> 02:13:54,179
drug that can uh pull you in and have
 

7783
02:13:54,179 --> 02:13:56,149
drug that can uh pull you in and have
you waste way too much of your life

7784
02:13:56,149 --> 02:13:56,159
you waste way too much of your life
 

7785
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:58,370
you waste way too much of your life
without optimizing and over optimizing

7786
02:13:58,370 --> 02:13:58,380
without optimizing and over optimizing
 

7787
02:13:58,380 --> 02:13:59,689
without optimizing and over optimizing
right

7788
02:13:59,689 --> 02:13:59,699
right
 

7789
02:13:59,699 --> 02:14:02,510
right
um but so what uh what do you see it

7790
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:02,520
um but so what uh what do you see it
 

7791
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:04,010
um but so what uh what do you see it
would be like comedy is this very hard

7792
02:14:04,010 --> 02:14:04,020
would be like comedy is this very hard
 

7793
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:06,109
would be like comedy is this very hard
to predict of course but

7794
02:14:06,109 --> 02:14:06,119
to predict of course but
 

7795
02:14:06,119 --> 02:14:08,030
to predict of course but
um you know if you look 10 years from

7796
02:14:08,030 --> 02:14:08,040
um you know if you look 10 years from
 

7797
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:11,089
um you know if you look 10 years from
now on Mojo's uh super successful what

7798
02:14:11,089 --> 02:14:11,099
now on Mojo's uh super successful what
 

7799
02:14:11,099 --> 02:14:12,950
now on Mojo's uh super successful what
do you think would be the thing

7800
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:12,960
do you think would be the thing
 

7801
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:16,189
do you think would be the thing
where people like try it and then use it

7802
02:14:16,189 --> 02:14:16,199
where people like try it and then use it
 

7803
02:14:16,199 --> 02:14:18,050
where people like try it and then use it
regularly and it kind of grows and grows

7804
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:18,060
regularly and it kind of grows and grows
 

7805
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:19,189
regularly and it kind of grows and grows
and grows well let's say you talk about

7806
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:19,199
and grows well let's say you talk about
 

7807
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:22,069
and grows well let's say you talk about
dopamine hit and so what again humans

7808
02:14:22,069 --> 02:14:22,079
dopamine hit and so what again humans
 

7809
02:14:22,079 --> 02:14:25,310
dopamine hit and so what again humans
are not one thing and

7810
02:14:25,310 --> 02:14:25,320
are not one thing and
 

7811
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:27,169
are not one thing and
some people love rewriting their code

7812
02:14:27,169 --> 02:14:27,179
some people love rewriting their code
 

7813
02:14:27,179 --> 02:14:28,430
some people love rewriting their code
and learning new things and throwing

7814
02:14:28,430 --> 02:14:28,440
and learning new things and throwing
 

7815
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:29,390
and learning new things and throwing
themselves in the deep end and trying

7816
02:14:29,390 --> 02:14:29,400
themselves in the deep end and trying
 

7817
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:32,089
themselves in the deep end and trying
out a new thing in my experience most

7818
02:14:32,089 --> 02:14:32,099
out a new thing in my experience most
 

7819
02:14:32,099 --> 02:14:33,530
out a new thing in my experience most
people don't

7820
02:14:33,530 --> 02:14:33,540
people don't
 

7821
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:35,149
people don't
like they're too busy they have other

7822
02:14:35,149 --> 02:14:35,159
like they're too busy they have other
 

7823
02:14:35,159 --> 02:14:36,890
like they're too busy they have other
things going on

7824
02:14:36,890 --> 02:14:36,900
things going on
 

7825
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:39,290
things going on
um by number most people don't want like

7826
02:14:39,290 --> 02:14:39,300
um by number most people don't want like
 

7827
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:42,470
um by number most people don't want like
this I want to rewrite all my code

7828
02:14:42,470 --> 02:14:42,480
this I want to rewrite all my code
 

7829
02:14:42,480 --> 02:14:43,609
this I want to rewrite all my code
but

7830
02:14:43,609 --> 02:14:43,619
but
 

7831
02:14:43,619 --> 02:14:45,709
but
even those people the two busy people

7832
02:14:45,709 --> 02:14:45,719
even those people the two busy people
 

7833
02:14:45,719 --> 02:14:47,870
even those people the two busy people
the people that uh don't actually care

7834
02:14:47,870 --> 02:14:47,880
the people that uh don't actually care
 

7835
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:49,310
the people that uh don't actually care
about the language that just care about

7836
02:14:49,310 --> 02:14:49,320
about the language that just care about
 

7837
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:51,530
about the language that just care about
getting stuff done those people do like

7838
02:14:51,530 --> 02:14:51,540
getting stuff done those people do like
 

7839
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:53,390
getting stuff done those people do like
learning new things

7840
02:14:53,390 --> 02:14:53,400
learning new things
 

7841
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:55,310
learning new things
right and so you talk about the dopamine

7842
02:14:55,310 --> 02:14:55,320
right and so you talk about the dopamine
 

7843
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:57,290
right and so you talk about the dopamine
Rush of 10x faster wow that's cool I

7844
02:14:57,290 --> 02:14:57,300
Rush of 10x faster wow that's cool I
 

7845
02:14:57,300 --> 02:14:58,910
Rush of 10x faster wow that's cool I
want to do that again well it's also

7846
02:14:58,910 --> 02:14:58,920
want to do that again well it's also
 

7847
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:00,410
want to do that again well it's also
like here's here's the thing I've heard

7848
02:15:00,410 --> 02:15:00,420
like here's here's the thing I've heard
 

7849
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:02,209
like here's here's the thing I've heard
about in a different domain and I don't

7850
02:15:02,209 --> 02:15:02,219
about in a different domain and I don't
 

7851
02:15:02,219 --> 02:15:03,649
about in a different domain and I don't
have to write all my code I can learn a

7852
02:15:03,649 --> 02:15:03,659
have to write all my code I can learn a
 

7853
02:15:03,659 --> 02:15:05,990
have to write all my code I can learn a
new trick right well that's called

7854
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:06,000
new trick right well that's called
 

7855
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,109
new trick right well that's called
growth you know and so and so one thing

7856
02:15:09,109 --> 02:15:09,119
growth you know and so and so one thing
 

7857
02:15:09,119 --> 02:15:11,390
growth you know and so and so one thing
that I think is cool about Mojo and

7858
02:15:11,390 --> 02:15:11,400
that I think is cool about Mojo and
 

7859
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:12,770
that I think is cool about Mojo and
again those will take a little bit of

7860
02:15:12,770 --> 02:15:12,780
again those will take a little bit of
 

7861
02:15:12,780 --> 02:15:15,350
again those will take a little bit of
time for for example the blog posts and

7862
02:15:15,350 --> 02:15:15,360
time for for example the blog posts and
 

7863
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,729
time for for example the blog posts and
the books and like all that kind of

7864
02:15:16,729 --> 02:15:16,739
the books and like all that kind of
 

7865
02:15:16,739 --> 02:15:18,290
the books and like all that kind of
stuff develop and the languages get

7866
02:15:18,290 --> 02:15:18,300
stuff develop and the languages get
 

7867
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:20,510
stuff develop and the languages get
further along but what we're doing you

7868
02:15:20,510 --> 02:15:20,520
further along but what we're doing you
 

7869
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:22,430
further along but what we're doing you
talk about types like you can say look

7870
02:15:22,430 --> 02:15:22,440
talk about types like you can say look
 

7871
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:23,930
talk about types like you can say look
you can start with the world you already

7872
02:15:23,930 --> 02:15:23,940
you can start with the world you already
 

7873
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:26,390
you can start with the world you already
know and you can progressively learn new

7874
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:26,400
know and you can progressively learn new
 

7875
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:27,589
know and you can progressively learn new
things and adopt them where it makes

7876
02:15:27,589 --> 02:15:27,599
things and adopt them where it makes
 

7877
02:15:27,599 --> 02:15:28,370
things and adopt them where it makes
sense

7878
02:15:28,370 --> 02:15:28,380
sense
 

7879
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:30,290
sense
if you never do that

7880
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:30,300
if you never do that
 

7881
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:32,589
if you never do that
that's cool you're not a bad person

7882
02:15:32,589 --> 02:15:32,599
that's cool you're not a bad person
 

7883
02:15:32,599 --> 02:15:34,850
that's cool you're not a bad person
if you if you get really excited about

7884
02:15:34,850 --> 02:15:34,860
if you if you get really excited about
 

7885
02:15:34,860 --> 02:15:35,870
if you if you get really excited about
and want to go all the way in the deep

7886
02:15:35,870 --> 02:15:35,880
and want to go all the way in the deep
 

7887
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:37,550
and want to go all the way in the deep
end and want to rewrite everything and

7888
02:15:37,550 --> 02:15:37,560
end and want to rewrite everything and
 

7889
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:39,890
end and want to rewrite everything and
like whatever that's cool right but I

7890
02:15:39,890 --> 02:15:39,900
like whatever that's cool right but I
 

7891
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:41,149
like whatever that's cool right but I
think the middle path is actually the

7892
02:15:41,149 --> 02:15:41,159
think the middle path is actually the
 

7893
02:15:41,159 --> 02:15:43,729
think the middle path is actually the
more likely one where it's um you know

7894
02:15:43,729 --> 02:15:43,739
more likely one where it's um you know
 

7895
02:15:43,739 --> 02:15:46,250
more likely one where it's um you know
you you come out with a new a new idea

7896
02:15:46,250 --> 02:15:46,260
you you come out with a new a new idea
 

7897
02:15:46,260 --> 02:15:47,990
you you come out with a new a new idea
and you discover wow that makes my code

7898
02:15:47,990 --> 02:15:48,000
and you discover wow that makes my code
 

7899
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,729
and you discover wow that makes my code
way simpler way more beautiful way

7900
02:15:49,729 --> 02:15:49,739
way simpler way more beautiful way
 

7901
02:15:49,739 --> 02:15:51,770
way simpler way more beautiful way
faster way whatever and I think that's

7902
02:15:51,770 --> 02:15:51,780
faster way whatever and I think that's
 

7903
02:15:51,780 --> 02:15:54,709
faster way whatever and I think that's
what people like now if you fast forward

7904
02:15:54,709 --> 02:15:54,719
what people like now if you fast forward
 

7905
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:58,310
what people like now if you fast forward
and you said like 10 years out right uh

7906
02:15:58,310 --> 02:15:58,320
and you said like 10 years out right uh
 

7907
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:59,330
and you said like 10 years out right uh
I can give you a very different answer

7908
02:15:59,330 --> 02:15:59,340
I can give you a very different answer
 

7909
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:01,250
I can give you a very different answer
on that which is I mean

7910
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:01,260
on that which is I mean
 

7911
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:02,750
on that which is I mean
if you go back and look at what

7912
02:16:02,750 --> 02:16:02,760
if you go back and look at what
 

7913
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:05,209
if you go back and look at what
computers look like 20 years ago

7914
02:16:05,209 --> 02:16:05,219
computers look like 20 years ago
 

7915
02:16:05,219 --> 02:16:08,050
computers look like 20 years ago
every 18 months they got faster for free

7916
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:08,060
every 18 months they got faster for free
 

7917
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:11,030
every 18 months they got faster for free
right 2x faster every 18 months it was

7918
02:16:11,030 --> 02:16:11,040
right 2x faster every 18 months it was
 

7919
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:12,830
right 2x faster every 18 months it was
like clockwork it was it was free right

7920
02:16:12,830 --> 02:16:12,840
like clockwork it was it was free right
 

7921
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:15,290
like clockwork it was it was free right
you go back 10 years ago and we entered

7922
02:16:15,290 --> 02:16:15,300
you go back 10 years ago and we entered
 

7923
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:16,910
you go back 10 years ago and we entered
in this world where suddenly we had

7924
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:16,920
in this world where suddenly we had
 

7925
02:16:16,920 --> 02:16:19,669
in this world where suddenly we had
multi-core CPUs and we had gpus

7926
02:16:19,669 --> 02:16:19,679
multi-core CPUs and we had gpus
 

7927
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:22,010
multi-core CPUs and we had gpus
and if you squint and turn your head

7928
02:16:22,010 --> 02:16:22,020
and if you squint and turn your head
 

7929
02:16:22,020 --> 02:16:24,649
and if you squint and turn your head
what a GPU is it's just a many core or

7930
02:16:24,649 --> 02:16:24,659
what a GPU is it's just a many core or
 

7931
02:16:24,659 --> 02:16:27,350
what a GPU is it's just a many core or
very simple CPU thing kind of right and

7932
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:27,360
very simple CPU thing kind of right and
 

7933
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,430
very simple CPU thing kind of right and
so

7934
02:16:28,430 --> 02:16:28,440
so
 

7935
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:30,770
so
um and 10 years ago it was CPUs and gpus

7936
02:16:30,770 --> 02:16:30,780
um and 10 years ago it was CPUs and gpus
 

7937
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:33,889
um and 10 years ago it was CPUs and gpus
and graphics

7938
02:16:33,889 --> 02:16:33,899

 

7939
02:16:33,899 --> 02:16:38,450

today we have CPS gpus graphics

7940
02:16:38,450 --> 02:16:38,460
today we have CPS gpus graphics
 

7941
02:16:38,460 --> 02:16:40,730
today we have CPS gpus graphics
and AI because it's so important because

7942
02:16:40,730 --> 02:16:40,740
and AI because it's so important because
 

7943
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:42,950
and AI because it's so important because
the compute is so demanding because of

7944
02:16:42,950 --> 02:16:42,960
the compute is so demanding because of
 

7945
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:44,690
the compute is so demanding because of
the smart cameras and the watches and

7946
02:16:44,690 --> 02:16:44,700
the smart cameras and the watches and
 

7947
02:16:44,700 --> 02:16:46,669
the smart cameras and the watches and
all the different places the AI needs to

7948
02:16:46,669 --> 02:16:46,679
all the different places the AI needs to
 

7949
02:16:46,679 --> 02:16:49,009
all the different places the AI needs to
to work on our lives it's caused this

7950
02:16:49,009 --> 02:16:49,019
to work on our lives it's caused this
 

7951
02:16:49,019 --> 02:16:50,450
to work on our lives it's caused this
explosion of hardware

7952
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:50,460
explosion of hardware
 

7953
02:16:50,460 --> 02:16:52,910
explosion of hardware
and so part of my thesis part of my

7954
02:16:52,910 --> 02:16:52,920
and so part of my thesis part of my
 

7955
02:16:52,920 --> 02:16:54,589
and so part of my thesis part of my
belief of where Computing goes if you

7956
02:16:54,589 --> 02:16:54,599
belief of where Computing goes if you
 

7957
02:16:54,599 --> 02:16:56,810
belief of where Computing goes if you
look out 10 years from now it's not

7958
02:16:56,810 --> 02:16:56,820
look out 10 years from now it's not
 

7959
02:16:56,820 --> 02:16:58,429
look out 10 years from now it's not
going to get simpler

7960
02:16:58,429 --> 02:16:58,439
going to get simpler
 

7961
02:16:58,439 --> 02:16:59,870
going to get simpler
physics isn't going back to where we

7962
02:16:59,870 --> 02:16:59,880
physics isn't going back to where we
 

7963
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:01,910
physics isn't going back to where we
came from it's only going to get weirder

7964
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:01,920
came from it's only going to get weirder
 

7965
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:04,790
came from it's only going to get weirder
from here on out right and so to me the

7966
02:17:04,790 --> 02:17:04,800
from here on out right and so to me the
 

7967
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:06,230
from here on out right and so to me the
exciting part about what we're building

7968
02:17:06,230 --> 02:17:06,240
exciting part about what we're building
 

7969
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:09,530
exciting part about what we're building
is it's about building that Universal

7970
02:17:09,530 --> 02:17:09,540
is it's about building that Universal
 

7971
02:17:09,540 --> 02:17:12,290
is it's about building that Universal
platform which the world can continue to

7972
02:17:12,290 --> 02:17:12,300
platform which the world can continue to
 

7973
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:13,669
platform which the world can continue to
get weird because again I don't think

7974
02:17:13,669 --> 02:17:13,679
get weird because again I don't think
 

7975
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:16,190
get weird because again I don't think
it's avoidable it's physics but we can

7976
02:17:16,190 --> 02:17:16,200
it's avoidable it's physics but we can
 

7977
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:18,290
it's avoidable it's physics but we can
help lift people's scale do things with

7978
02:17:18,290 --> 02:17:18,300
help lift people's scale do things with
 

7979
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:19,250
help lift people's scale do things with
it and they don't have to rewrite their

7980
02:17:19,250 --> 02:17:19,260
it and they don't have to rewrite their
 

7981
02:17:19,260 --> 02:17:20,629
it and they don't have to rewrite their
code every time a new device comes out

7982
02:17:20,629 --> 02:17:20,639
code every time a new device comes out
 

7983
02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:22,969
code every time a new device comes out
and I think that's pretty cool and so if

7984
02:17:22,969 --> 02:17:22,979
and I think that's pretty cool and so if
 

7985
02:17:22,979 --> 02:17:24,889
and I think that's pretty cool and so if
Mojo can help with that problem then I

7986
02:17:24,889 --> 02:17:24,899
Mojo can help with that problem then I
 

7987
02:17:24,899 --> 02:17:26,810
Mojo can help with that problem then I
think that it will be hopefully quite

7988
02:17:26,810 --> 02:17:26,820
think that it will be hopefully quite
 

7989
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:28,190
think that it will be hopefully quite
interesting and quite useful to a wide

7990
02:17:28,190 --> 02:17:28,200
interesting and quite useful to a wide
 

7991
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:30,589
interesting and quite useful to a wide
range of people because there's so much

7992
02:17:30,589 --> 02:17:30,599
range of people because there's so much
 

7993
02:17:30,599 --> 02:17:32,330
range of people because there's so much
potential and like there's someone you

7994
02:17:32,330 --> 02:17:32,340
potential and like there's someone you
 

7995
02:17:32,340 --> 02:17:34,429
potential and like there's someone you
know maybe analog computers will become

7996
02:17:34,429 --> 02:17:34,439
know maybe analog computers will become
 

7997
02:17:34,439 --> 02:17:35,990
know maybe analog computers will become
a thing or something right and we need

7998
02:17:35,990 --> 02:17:36,000
a thing or something right and we need
 

7999
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,150
a thing or something right and we need
to be able to get into a mode where we

8000
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:38,160
to be able to get into a mode where we
 

8001
02:17:38,160 --> 02:17:39,950
to be able to get into a mode where we
can move this programming model forward

8002
02:17:39,950 --> 02:17:39,960
can move this programming model forward
 

8003
02:17:39,960 --> 02:17:41,690
can move this programming model forward
but do so in a way where we're lifting

8004
02:17:41,690 --> 02:17:41,700
but do so in a way where we're lifting
 

8005
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:44,389
but do so in a way where we're lifting
people and and growing them instead of

8006
02:17:44,389 --> 02:17:44,399
people and and growing them instead of
 

8007
02:17:44,399 --> 02:17:45,950
people and and growing them instead of
forcing them to write all their code and

8008
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:45,960
forcing them to write all their code and
 

8009
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:47,570
forcing them to write all their code and
exploding them do you think there will

8010
02:17:47,570 --> 02:17:47,580
exploding them do you think there will
 

8011
02:17:47,580 --> 02:17:50,450
exploding them do you think there will
be a few major libraries that go Mojo

8012
02:17:50,450 --> 02:17:50,460
be a few major libraries that go Mojo
 

8013
02:17:50,460 --> 02:17:52,929
be a few major libraries that go Mojo
first

8014
02:17:52,929 --> 02:17:52,939

 

8015
02:17:52,939 --> 02:17:55,310

uh well so I mean the modular engines

8016
02:17:55,310 --> 02:17:55,320
uh well so I mean the modular engines
 

8017
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:58,610
uh well so I mean the modular engines
all Mojo so I can't come back to like

8018
02:17:58,610 --> 02:17:58,620
all Mojo so I can't come back to like
 

8019
02:17:58,620 --> 02:17:59,929
all Mojo so I can't come back to like
we're not building Mojo because it's fun

8020
02:17:59,929 --> 02:17:59,939
we're not building Mojo because it's fun
 

8021
02:17:59,939 --> 02:18:01,790
we're not building Mojo because it's fun
we're building Mojo because we had to to

8022
02:18:01,790 --> 02:18:01,800
we're building Mojo because we had to to
 

8023
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:03,169
we're building Mojo because we had to to
solve these accelerators that's the

8024
02:18:03,169 --> 02:18:03,179
solve these accelerators that's the
 

8025
02:18:03,179 --> 02:18:04,849
solve these accelerators that's the
origin story but I mean ones that are

8026
02:18:04,849 --> 02:18:04,859
origin story but I mean ones that are
 

8027
02:18:04,859 --> 02:18:06,589
origin story but I mean ones that are
currently in Python yeah so I think that

8028
02:18:06,589 --> 02:18:06,599
currently in Python yeah so I think that
 

8029
02:18:06,599 --> 02:18:08,030
currently in Python yeah so I think that
a number of these projects will and so

8030
02:18:08,030 --> 02:18:08,040
a number of these projects will and so
 

8031
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:09,589
a number of these projects will and so
one one of the things again this is just

8032
02:18:09,589 --> 02:18:09,599
one one of the things again this is just
 

8033
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:11,330
one one of the things again this is just
my best guess like each of the package

8034
02:18:11,330 --> 02:18:11,340
my best guess like each of the package
 

8035
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:13,669
my best guess like each of the package
maintainers also has I'm sure plenty of

8036
02:18:13,669 --> 02:18:13,679
maintainers also has I'm sure plenty of
 

8037
02:18:13,679 --> 02:18:15,410
maintainers also has I'm sure plenty of
other things going on people don't like

8038
02:18:15,410 --> 02:18:15,420
other things going on people don't like
 

8039
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:16,790
other things going on people don't like
really don't like rewriting code just

8040
02:18:16,790 --> 02:18:16,800
really don't like rewriting code just
 

8041
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:18,830
really don't like rewriting code just
for the sake of rewriting code

8042
02:18:18,830 --> 02:18:18,840
for the sake of rewriting code
 

8043
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:21,950
for the sake of rewriting code
um but sometimes like people are excited

8044
02:18:21,950 --> 02:18:21,960
um but sometimes like people are excited
 

8045
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:24,889
um but sometimes like people are excited
about like adopting a new idea yeah it

8046
02:18:24,889 --> 02:18:24,899
about like adopting a new idea yeah it
 

8047
02:18:24,899 --> 02:18:26,750
about like adopting a new idea yeah it
turns out that while rewriting code is

8048
02:18:26,750 --> 02:18:26,760
turns out that while rewriting code is
 

8049
02:18:26,760 --> 02:18:28,849
turns out that while rewriting code is
generally not People's First

8050
02:18:28,849 --> 02:18:28,859
generally not People's First
 

8051
02:18:28,859 --> 02:18:31,490
generally not People's First
thing turns out that redesigning

8052
02:18:31,490 --> 02:18:31,500
thing turns out that redesigning
 

8053
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:33,469
thing turns out that redesigning
something while you rewrite it and using

8054
02:18:33,469 --> 02:18:33,479
something while you rewrite it and using
 

8055
02:18:33,479 --> 02:18:36,049
something while you rewrite it and using
a rewrite as an excuse to redesign can

8056
02:18:36,049 --> 02:18:36,059
a rewrite as an excuse to redesign can
 

8057
02:18:36,059 --> 02:18:38,990
a rewrite as an excuse to redesign can
lead to the 2.0 of your thing that's way

8058
02:18:38,990 --> 02:18:39,000
lead to the 2.0 of your thing that's way
 

8059
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,230
lead to the 2.0 of your thing that's way
better than the 1.0 right and so I have

8060
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:42,240
better than the 1.0 right and so I have
 

8061
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:44,030
better than the 1.0 right and so I have
no idea I can't predict that but there's

8062
02:18:44,030 --> 02:18:44,040
no idea I can't predict that but there's
 

8063
02:18:44,040 --> 02:18:46,429
no idea I can't predict that but there's
a lot of these places where again if you

8064
02:18:46,429 --> 02:18:46,439
a lot of these places where again if you
 

8065
02:18:46,439 --> 02:18:48,410
a lot of these places where again if you
have a package that is half C and half

8066
02:18:48,410 --> 02:18:48,420
have a package that is half C and half
 

8067
02:18:48,420 --> 02:18:51,349
have a package that is half C and half
python right it it just solve the pain

8068
02:18:51,349 --> 02:18:51,359
python right it it just solve the pain
 

8069
02:18:51,359 --> 02:18:52,790
python right it it just solve the pain
make it easier to move things faster

8070
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:52,800
make it easier to move things faster
 

8071
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,889
make it easier to move things faster
make it easier to debug and evolve your

8072
02:18:54,889 --> 02:18:54,899
make it easier to debug and evolve your
 

8073
02:18:54,899 --> 02:18:57,530
make it easier to debug and evolve your
Tech adopting Mojo kind of makes sense

8074
02:18:57,530 --> 02:18:57,540
Tech adopting Mojo kind of makes sense
 

8075
02:18:57,540 --> 02:18:58,730
Tech adopting Mojo kind of makes sense
to start with and then it gives you this

8076
02:18:58,730 --> 02:18:58,740
to start with and then it gives you this
 

8077
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:00,530
to start with and then it gives you this
opportunity to rethink these things so

8078
02:19:00,530 --> 02:19:00,540
opportunity to rethink these things so
 

8079
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:03,049
opportunity to rethink these things so
the two big gains are that the there's a

8080
02:19:03,049 --> 02:19:03,059
the two big gains are that the there's a
 

8081
02:19:03,059 --> 02:19:04,669
the two big gains are that the there's a
performance gain

8082
02:19:04,669 --> 02:19:04,679
performance gain
 

8083
02:19:04,679 --> 02:19:06,110
performance gain
and then

8084
02:19:06,110 --> 02:19:06,120
and then
 

8085
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:07,849
and then
um there's the

8086
02:19:07,849 --> 02:19:07,859
um there's the
 

8087
02:19:07,859 --> 02:19:09,650
um there's the
portability to all kinds of different

8088
02:19:09,650 --> 02:19:09,660
portability to all kinds of different
 

8089
02:19:09,660 --> 02:19:12,049
portability to all kinds of different
devices and their safety right so you

8090
02:19:12,049 --> 02:19:12,059
devices and their safety right so you
 

8091
02:19:12,059 --> 02:19:13,910
devices and their safety right so you
talk about real types

8092
02:19:13,910 --> 02:19:13,920
talk about real types
 

8093
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:15,889
talk about real types
I mean not saying this is for everybody

8094
02:19:15,889 --> 02:19:15,899
I mean not saying this is for everybody
 

8095
02:19:15,899 --> 02:19:17,629
I mean not saying this is for everybody
but that's actually a pretty big thing

8096
02:19:17,629 --> 02:19:17,639
but that's actually a pretty big thing
 

8097
02:19:17,639 --> 02:19:20,030
but that's actually a pretty big thing
right yeah types are and and so there's

8098
02:19:20,030 --> 02:19:20,040
right yeah types are and and so there's
 

8099
02:19:20,040 --> 02:19:21,530
right yeah types are and and so there's
a bunch of different aspects of what you

8100
02:19:21,530 --> 02:19:21,540
a bunch of different aspects of what you
 

8101
02:19:21,540 --> 02:19:23,570
a bunch of different aspects of what you
know what value Mojo provides and so I

8102
02:19:23,570 --> 02:19:23,580
know what value Mojo provides and so I
 

8103
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:24,889
know what value Mojo provides and so I
mean it's funny for me like I've been

8104
02:19:24,889 --> 02:19:24,899
mean it's funny for me like I've been
 

8105
02:19:24,899 --> 02:19:27,049
mean it's funny for me like I've been
working on these kinds of Technologies

8106
02:19:27,049 --> 02:19:27,059
working on these kinds of Technologies
 

8107
02:19:27,059 --> 02:19:30,469
working on these kinds of Technologies
and tools for too many years now

8108
02:19:30,469 --> 02:19:30,479
and tools for too many years now
 

8109
02:19:30,479 --> 02:19:32,450
and tools for too many years now
um but you look at Swift right and we

8110
02:19:32,450 --> 02:19:32,460
um but you look at Swift right and we
 

8111
02:19:32,460 --> 02:19:33,650
um but you look at Swift right and we
talked about Swift for tensorflow but

8112
02:19:33,650 --> 02:19:33,660
talked about Swift for tensorflow but
 

8113
02:19:33,660 --> 02:19:35,389
talked about Swift for tensorflow but
Swift as a programming language right

8114
02:19:35,389 --> 02:19:35,399
Swift as a programming language right
 

8115
02:19:35,399 --> 02:19:38,089
Swift as a programming language right
for Swift snow

8116
02:19:38,089 --> 02:19:38,099
for Swift snow
 

8117
02:19:38,099 --> 02:19:41,750
for Swift snow
13 years old from when I started it yeah

8118
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:41,760
13 years old from when I started it yeah
 

8119
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:43,969
13 years old from when I started it yeah
so because I started in 2010 if I

8120
02:19:43,969 --> 02:19:43,979
so because I started in 2010 if I
 

8121
02:19:43,979 --> 02:19:45,770
so because I started in 2010 if I
remember and so

8122
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:45,780
remember and so
 

8123
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:48,049
remember and so
that that project and I was involved

8124
02:19:48,049 --> 02:19:48,059
that that project and I was involved
 

8125
02:19:48,059 --> 02:19:50,210
that that project and I was involved
with it for 12 years or something right

8126
02:19:50,210 --> 02:19:50,220
with it for 12 years or something right
 

8127
02:19:50,220 --> 02:19:52,070
with it for 12 years or something right
that that project has gone through its

8128
02:19:52,070 --> 02:19:52,080
that that project has gone through its
 

8129
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:53,690
that that project has gone through its
own really interesting story arc right

8130
02:19:53,690 --> 02:19:53,700
own really interesting story arc right
 

8131
02:19:53,700 --> 02:19:55,910
own really interesting story arc right
and it's a mature successful used by

8132
02:19:55,910 --> 02:19:55,920
and it's a mature successful used by
 

8133
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:58,070
and it's a mature successful used by
millions of people system right uh

8134
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,080
millions of people system right uh
 

8135
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,170
millions of people system right uh
certainly not dead yet right but but

8136
02:20:00,170 --> 02:20:00,180
certainly not dead yet right but but
 

8137
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:02,270
certainly not dead yet right but but
also going through that story arc I

8138
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:02,280
also going through that story arc I
 

8139
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:03,410
also going through that story arc I
learned a tremendous amount about

8140
02:20:03,410 --> 02:20:03,420
learned a tremendous amount about
 

8141
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:04,730
learned a tremendous amount about
building languages about building

8142
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:04,740
building languages about building
 

8143
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:06,349
building languages about building
compilers about working with community

8144
02:20:06,349 --> 02:20:06,359
compilers about working with community
 

8145
02:20:06,359 --> 02:20:08,810
compilers about working with community
and things like this and so that

8146
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:08,820
and things like this and so that
 

8147
02:20:08,820 --> 02:20:10,610
and things like this and so that
experience like I'm helping Channel and

8148
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:10,620
experience like I'm helping Channel and
 

8149
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:12,830
experience like I'm helping Channel and
bring directly into Mojo and you know

8150
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:12,840
bring directly into Mojo and you know
 

8151
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:14,630
bring directly into Mojo and you know
other systems same thing like apparently

8152
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:14,640
other systems same thing like apparently
 

8153
02:20:14,640 --> 02:20:16,670
other systems same thing like apparently
I like building building and iterating

8154
02:20:16,670 --> 02:20:16,680
I like building building and iterating
 

8155
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:18,170
I like building building and iterating
and evolving things and so you look at

8156
02:20:18,170 --> 02:20:18,180
and evolving things and so you look at
 

8157
02:20:18,180 --> 02:20:20,389
and evolving things and so you look at
this lvm thing I worked on 20 years ago

8158
02:20:20,389 --> 02:20:20,399
this lvm thing I worked on 20 years ago
 

8159
02:20:20,399 --> 02:20:23,450
this lvm thing I worked on 20 years ago
you look at mlir right and so a lot of

8160
02:20:23,450 --> 02:20:23,460
you look at mlir right and so a lot of
 

8161
02:20:23,460 --> 02:20:25,790
you look at mlir right and so a lot of
the Lessons Learned in llvm got fed into

8162
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:25,800
the Lessons Learned in llvm got fed into
 

8163
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:27,950
the Lessons Learned in llvm got fed into
mlir and I think that mlr is a way

8164
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:27,960
mlir and I think that mlr is a way
 

8165
02:20:27,960 --> 02:20:30,530
mlir and I think that mlr is a way
better system than lvm was and you know

8166
02:20:30,530 --> 02:20:30,540
better system than lvm was and you know
 

8167
02:20:30,540 --> 02:20:32,150
better system than lvm was and you know
Swift is a really good system and it's

8168
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:32,160
Swift is a really good system and it's
 

8169
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,969
Swift is a really good system and it's
it's amazing but I hope that Mojo will

8170
02:20:34,969 --> 02:20:34,979
it's amazing but I hope that Mojo will
 

8171
02:20:34,979 --> 02:20:36,710
it's amazing but I hope that Mojo will
take the next step for

8172
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:36,720
take the next step for
 

8173
02:20:36,720 --> 02:20:40,270
take the next step for
step forward in terms of design

8174
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:40,280
step forward in terms of design
 

8175
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:43,250
step forward in terms of design
in terms of running Mojo people can play

8176
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:43,260
in terms of running Mojo people can play
 

8177
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:45,889
in terms of running Mojo people can play
with it what's uh Mojo playground yeah

8178
02:20:45,889 --> 02:20:45,899
with it what's uh Mojo playground yeah
 

8179
02:20:45,899 --> 02:20:47,389
with it what's uh Mojo playground yeah
and uh

8180
02:20:47,389 --> 02:20:47,399
and uh
 

8181
02:20:47,399 --> 02:20:50,090
and uh
from the interface perspective and from

8182
02:20:50,090 --> 02:20:50,100
from the interface perspective and from
 

8183
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:52,150
from the interface perspective and from
the hardware perspective what's this

8184
02:20:52,150 --> 02:20:52,160
the hardware perspective what's this
 

8185
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:55,070
the hardware perspective what's this
incredible thing running on yeah so

8186
02:20:55,070 --> 02:20:55,080
incredible thing running on yeah so
 

8187
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:57,170
incredible thing running on yeah so
right now so here we are two weeks after

8188
02:20:57,170 --> 02:20:57,180
right now so here we are two weeks after
 

8189
02:20:57,180 --> 02:20:59,929
right now so here we are two weeks after
launch yes we decided that okay we're we

8190
02:20:59,929 --> 02:20:59,939
launch yes we decided that okay we're we
 

8191
02:20:59,939 --> 02:21:01,309
launch yes we decided that okay we're we
have this incredible set of technology

8192
02:21:01,309 --> 02:21:01,319
have this incredible set of technology
 

8193
02:21:01,319 --> 02:21:02,270
have this incredible set of technology
that

8194
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:02,280
that
 

8195
02:21:02,280 --> 02:21:04,190
that
we think might be good but we have not

8196
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:04,200
we think might be good but we have not
 

8197
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:07,070
we think might be good but we have not
given it to lots of people yet and so

8198
02:21:07,070 --> 02:21:07,080
given it to lots of people yet and so
 

8199
02:21:07,080 --> 02:21:08,750
given it to lots of people yet and so
we're very conservative and said let's

8200
02:21:08,750 --> 02:21:08,760
we're very conservative and said let's
 

8201
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,490
we're very conservative and said let's
put it in a workbook so that if it

8202
02:21:10,490 --> 02:21:10,500
put it in a workbook so that if it
 

8203
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:12,170
put it in a workbook so that if it
crashes we can do something about it we

8204
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:12,180
crashes we can do something about it we
 

8205
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:14,929
crashes we can do something about it we
can monitor and track that right so

8206
02:21:14,929 --> 02:21:14,939
can monitor and track that right so
 

8207
02:21:14,939 --> 02:21:16,429
can monitor and track that right so
um again things are still super early

8208
02:21:16,429 --> 02:21:16,439
um again things are still super early
 

8209
02:21:16,439 --> 02:21:19,250
um again things are still super early
but we're having like one person a

8210
02:21:19,250 --> 02:21:19,260
but we're having like one person a
 

8211
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:20,090
but we're having like one person a
minute

8212
02:21:20,090 --> 02:21:20,100
minute
 

8213
02:21:20,100 --> 02:21:24,770
minute
sign up with over 70 000 people two

8214
02:21:24,770 --> 02:21:24,780
sign up with over 70 000 people two
 

8215
02:21:24,780 --> 02:21:26,990
sign up with over 70 000 people two
weeks in it's kind of crazy so you you

8216
02:21:26,990 --> 02:21:27,000
weeks in it's kind of crazy so you you
 

8217
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,790
weeks in it's kind of crazy so you you
can sign up to playground and you can

8218
02:21:28,790 --> 02:21:28,800
can sign up to playground and you can
 

8219
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:31,670
can sign up to playground and you can
use it in in the cloud yeah in your

8220
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:31,680
use it in in the cloud yeah in your
 

8221
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:33,469
use it in in the cloud yeah in your
browser and so what that's running on

8222
02:21:33,469 --> 02:21:33,479
browser and so what that's running on
 

8223
02:21:33,479 --> 02:21:34,910
browser and so what that's running on
Notebook yeah what that's running on is

8224
02:21:34,910 --> 02:21:34,920
Notebook yeah what that's running on is
 

8225
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:36,230
Notebook yeah what that's running on is
that's running on

8226
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:36,240
that's running on
 

8227
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:39,349
that's running on
um Cloud VMS and so you share a machine

8228
02:21:39,349 --> 02:21:39,359
um Cloud VMS and so you share a machine
 

8229
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:41,570
um Cloud VMS and so you share a machine
with a bunch of other people but turns

8230
02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:41,580
with a bunch of other people but turns
 

8231
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:42,650
with a bunch of other people but turns
out there's a bunch of them now because

8232
02:21:42,650 --> 02:21:42,660
out there's a bunch of them now because
 

8233
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:44,929
out there's a bunch of them now because
there's a lot of people and so what

8234
02:21:44,929 --> 02:21:44,939
there's a lot of people and so what
 

8235
02:21:44,939 --> 02:21:45,770
there's a lot of people and so what
you're doing is you're getting free

8236
02:21:45,770 --> 02:21:45,780
you're doing is you're getting free
 

8237
02:21:45,780 --> 02:21:46,969
you're doing is you're getting free
compute and you're getting a play with

8238
02:21:46,969 --> 02:21:46,979
compute and you're getting a play with
 

8239
02:21:46,979 --> 02:21:48,889
compute and you're getting a play with
this thing and kind of a limited

8240
02:21:48,889 --> 02:21:48,899
this thing and kind of a limited
 

8241
02:21:48,899 --> 02:21:50,750
this thing and kind of a limited
controlled way so that we can make sure

8242
02:21:50,750 --> 02:21:50,760
controlled way so that we can make sure
 

8243
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:52,070
controlled way so that we can make sure
that it doesn't

8244
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:52,080
that it doesn't
 

8245
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:53,809
that it doesn't
totally crashing

8246
02:21:53,809 --> 02:21:53,819
totally crashing
 

8247
02:21:53,819 --> 02:21:56,750
totally crashing
be embarrassing right yeah so um now a

8248
02:21:56,750 --> 02:21:56,760
be embarrassing right yeah so um now a
 

8249
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:57,650
be embarrassing right yeah so um now a
lot of the feedback we've gotten is

8250
02:21:57,650 --> 02:21:57,660
lot of the feedback we've gotten is
 

8251
02:21:57,660 --> 02:21:58,490
lot of the feedback we've gotten is
people want to download it around

8252
02:21:58,490 --> 02:21:58,500
people want to download it around
 

8253
02:21:58,500 --> 02:21:59,750
people want to download it around
locally so we're working on that right

8254
02:21:59,750 --> 02:21:59,760
locally so we're working on that right
 

8255
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:01,550
locally so we're working on that right
now and so that's that's the goal to be

8256
02:22:01,550 --> 02:22:01,560
now and so that's that's the goal to be
 

8257
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:03,889
now and so that's that's the goal to be
able to download locally yeah that's

8258
02:22:03,889 --> 02:22:03,899
able to download locally yeah that's
 

8259
02:22:03,899 --> 02:22:05,150
able to download locally yeah that's
what everybody expects and so we're

8260
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:05,160
what everybody expects and so we're
 

8261
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:06,650
what everybody expects and so we're
working on that right now and so we just

8262
02:22:06,650 --> 02:22:06,660
working on that right now and so we just
 

8263
02:22:06,660 --> 02:22:07,670
working on that right now and so we just
want to make sure that we do it right

8264
02:22:07,670 --> 02:22:07,680
want to make sure that we do it right
 

8265
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:09,830
want to make sure that we do it right
and I think this is this is one of the

8266
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:09,840
and I think this is this is one of the
 

8267
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:11,690
and I think this is this is one of the
lessons I learned from Swift also by the

8268
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:11,700
lessons I learned from Swift also by the
 

8269
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,530
lessons I learned from Swift also by the
way

8270
02:22:12,530 --> 02:22:12,540
way
 

8271
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:15,349
way
is it when we launch Swift uh gosh it

8272
02:22:15,349 --> 02:22:15,359
is it when we launch Swift uh gosh it
 

8273
02:22:15,359 --> 02:22:18,710
is it when we launch Swift uh gosh it
feels like forever ago it's 2014. and uh

8274
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:18,720
feels like forever ago it's 2014. and uh
 

8275
02:22:18,720 --> 02:22:21,770
feels like forever ago it's 2014. and uh
we I mean it was super exciting I and we

8276
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:21,780
we I mean it was super exciting I and we
 

8277
02:22:21,780 --> 02:22:23,389
we I mean it was super exciting I and we
the team had worked on Swift for a

8278
02:22:23,389 --> 02:22:23,399
the team had worked on Swift for a
 

8279
02:22:23,399 --> 02:22:27,230
the team had worked on Swift for a
number of years in secrecy okay and we

8280
02:22:27,230 --> 02:22:27,240
number of years in secrecy okay and we
 

8281
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:29,330
number of years in secrecy okay and we
uh four years into this development

8282
02:22:29,330 --> 02:22:29,340
uh four years into this development
 

8283
02:22:29,340 --> 02:22:31,849
uh four years into this development
roughly of working on this thing

8284
02:22:31,849 --> 02:22:31,859
roughly of working on this thing
 

8285
02:22:31,859 --> 02:22:33,950
roughly of working on this thing
at that point about 250 people at Apple

8286
02:22:33,950 --> 02:22:33,960
at that point about 250 people at Apple
 

8287
02:22:33,960 --> 02:22:36,590
at that point about 250 people at Apple
knew about it yeah okay so secret

8288
02:22:36,590 --> 02:22:36,600
knew about it yeah okay so secret
 

8289
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:38,389
knew about it yeah okay so secret
Apple's good at secrecy and it was a

8290
02:22:38,389 --> 02:22:38,399
Apple's good at secrecy and it was a
 

8291
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:40,010
Apple's good at secrecy and it was a
secret project and so we launched this

8292
02:22:40,010 --> 02:22:40,020
secret project and so we launched this
 

8293
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:42,889
secret project and so we launched this
at wwc a bunch of hoopla and excitement

8294
02:22:42,889 --> 02:22:42,899
at wwc a bunch of hoopla and excitement
 

8295
02:22:42,899 --> 02:22:44,990
at wwc a bunch of hoopla and excitement
and said developers are going to be able

8296
02:22:44,990 --> 02:22:45,000
and said developers are going to be able
 

8297
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,730
and said developers are going to be able
to develop and submit apps the App Store

8298
02:22:46,730 --> 02:22:46,740
to develop and submit apps the App Store
 

8299
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:50,389
to develop and submit apps the App Store
in three months okay well several

8300
02:22:50,389 --> 02:22:50,399
in three months okay well several
 

8301
02:22:50,399 --> 02:22:52,010
in three months okay well several
interesting things happened right so

8302
02:22:52,010 --> 02:22:52,020
interesting things happened right so
 

8303
02:22:52,020 --> 02:22:54,349
interesting things happened right so
first of all we learned that a it had a

8304
02:22:54,349 --> 02:22:54,359
first of all we learned that a it had a
 

8305
02:22:54,359 --> 02:22:56,990
first of all we learned that a it had a
lot of bugs and it was not actually

8306
02:22:56,990 --> 02:22:57,000
lot of bugs and it was not actually
 

8307
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,510
lot of bugs and it was not actually
production quality and it was extremely

8308
02:22:59,510 --> 02:22:59,520
production quality and it was extremely
 

8309
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,790
production quality and it was extremely
stressful in terms of like trying to get

8310
02:23:01,790 --> 02:23:01,800
stressful in terms of like trying to get
 

8311
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:04,250
stressful in terms of like trying to get
it working for a bunch of people and so

8312
02:23:04,250 --> 02:23:04,260
it working for a bunch of people and so
 

8313
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:05,929
it working for a bunch of people and so
what happened was we went from zero to

8314
02:23:05,929 --> 02:23:05,939
what happened was we went from zero to
 

8315
02:23:05,939 --> 02:23:07,550
what happened was we went from zero to
you know I don't know how many

8316
02:23:07,550 --> 02:23:07,560
you know I don't know how many
 

8317
02:23:07,560 --> 02:23:09,110
you know I don't know how many
developers Apple had at the time but a

8318
02:23:09,110 --> 02:23:09,120
developers Apple had at the time but a
 

8319
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:12,170
developers Apple had at the time but a
lot of developers overnight and they ran

8320
02:23:12,170 --> 02:23:12,180
lot of developers overnight and they ran
 

8321
02:23:12,180 --> 02:23:13,370
lot of developers overnight and they ran
into a lot of bugs and it was really

8322
02:23:13,370 --> 02:23:13,380
into a lot of bugs and it was really
 

8323
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:15,230
into a lot of bugs and it was really
embarrassing and it was very stressful

8324
02:23:15,230 --> 02:23:15,240
embarrassing and it was very stressful
 

8325
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:17,150
embarrassing and it was very stressful
for everybody involved right it was also

8326
02:23:17,150 --> 02:23:17,160
for everybody involved right it was also
 

8327
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:18,650
for everybody involved right it was also
very exciting because everybody was

8328
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:18,660
very exciting because everybody was
 

8329
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:20,510
very exciting because everybody was
excited about that the other thing I

8330
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:20,520
excited about that the other thing I
 

8331
02:23:20,520 --> 02:23:21,830
excited about that the other thing I
learned is that when that happened

8332
02:23:21,830 --> 02:23:21,840
learned is that when that happened
 

8333
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:23,870
learned is that when that happened
roughly every software engineer who did

8334
02:23:23,870 --> 02:23:23,880
roughly every software engineer who did
 

8335
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:25,130
roughly every software engineer who did
not know about the project at Apple

8336
02:23:25,130 --> 02:23:25,140
not know about the project at Apple
 

8337
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:27,349
not know about the project at Apple
their head exploded when it was launched

8338
02:23:27,349 --> 02:23:27,359
their head exploded when it was launched
 

8339
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:28,849
their head exploded when it was launched
because they didn't know it was coming

8340
02:23:28,849 --> 02:23:28,859
because they didn't know it was coming
 

8341
02:23:28,859 --> 02:23:31,429
because they didn't know it was coming
and so they're like wait what is this I

8342
02:23:31,429 --> 02:23:31,439
and so they're like wait what is this I
 

8343
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:32,809
and so they're like wait what is this I
I signed up to work for Apple because I

8344
02:23:32,809 --> 02:23:32,819
I signed up to work for Apple because I
 

8345
02:23:32,819 --> 02:23:34,250
I signed up to work for Apple because I
love Objective C why is there a new

8346
02:23:34,250 --> 02:23:34,260
love Objective C why is there a new
 

8347
02:23:34,260 --> 02:23:37,130
love Objective C why is there a new
thing right and so uh

8348
02:23:37,130 --> 02:23:37,140
thing right and so uh
 

8349
02:23:37,140 --> 02:23:39,650
thing right and so uh
now what that meant practically is that

8350
02:23:39,650 --> 02:23:39,660
now what that meant practically is that
 

8351
02:23:39,660 --> 02:23:43,010
now what that meant practically is that
the push from launch to first of all the

8352
02:23:43,010 --> 02:23:43,020
the push from launch to first of all the
 

8353
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:45,110
the push from launch to first of all the
fall but then to 2.0 and 3.0 and like

8354
02:23:45,110 --> 02:23:45,120
fall but then to 2.0 and 3.0 and like
 

8355
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:47,990
fall but then to 2.0 and 3.0 and like
ever All the Way Forward was

8356
02:23:47,990 --> 02:23:48,000
ever All the Way Forward was
 

8357
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,969
ever All the Way Forward was
super painful for the engineering team

8358
02:23:49,969 --> 02:23:49,979
super painful for the engineering team
 

8359
02:23:49,979 --> 02:23:53,330
super painful for the engineering team
and myself it was very stressful the

8360
02:23:53,330 --> 02:23:53,340
and myself it was very stressful the
 

8361
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:54,770
and myself it was very stressful the
developer Community was very grumpy

8362
02:23:54,770 --> 02:23:54,780
developer Community was very grumpy
 

8363
02:23:54,780 --> 02:23:56,090
developer Community was very grumpy
about it because they're like okay well

8364
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:56,100
about it because they're like okay well
 

8365
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:57,230
about it because they're like okay well
wait a second you're changing and

8366
02:23:57,230 --> 02:23:57,240
wait a second you're changing and
 

8367
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:59,389
wait a second you're changing and
breaking my code and like we have to fix

8368
02:23:59,389 --> 02:23:59,399
breaking my code and like we have to fix
 

8369
02:23:59,399 --> 02:24:01,849
breaking my code and like we have to fix
the bugs and it was just like a lot of

8370
02:24:01,849 --> 02:24:01,859
the bugs and it was just like a lot of
 

8371
02:24:01,859 --> 02:24:04,730
the bugs and it was just like a lot of
tension and friction on all sides

8372
02:24:04,730 --> 02:24:04,740
tension and friction on all sides
 

8373
02:24:04,740 --> 02:24:06,710
tension and friction on all sides
um uh there's a lot of technical debt in

8374
02:24:06,710 --> 02:24:06,720
um uh there's a lot of technical debt in
 

8375
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:08,929
um uh there's a lot of technical debt in
the compiler because we have to run

8376
02:24:08,929 --> 02:24:08,939
the compiler because we have to run
 

8377
02:24:08,939 --> 02:24:10,250
the compiler because we have to run
really fast you have to go implement the

8378
02:24:10,250 --> 02:24:10,260
really fast you have to go implement the
 

8379
02:24:10,260 --> 02:24:11,570
really fast you have to go implement the
thing and unblock the use case and do

8380
02:24:11,570 --> 02:24:11,580
thing and unblock the use case and do
 

8381
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:13,010
thing and unblock the use case and do
the thing and and you know it's not

8382
02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:13,020
the thing and and you know it's not
 

8383
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:14,330
the thing and and you know it's not
right but you never have time to go back

8384
02:24:14,330 --> 02:24:14,340
right but you never have time to go back
 

8385
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:17,090
right but you never have time to go back
and do it right and I'm very proud of

8386
02:24:17,090 --> 02:24:17,100
and do it right and I'm very proud of
 

8387
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:18,889
and do it right and I'm very proud of
the Swift team because they've come

8388
02:24:18,889 --> 02:24:18,899
the Swift team because they've come
 

8389
02:24:18,899 --> 02:24:23,630
the Swift team because they've come
I mean we but they came so far and made

8390
02:24:23,630 --> 02:24:23,640
I mean we but they came so far and made
 

8391
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:25,429
I mean we but they came so far and made
so much progress over over this time

8392
02:24:25,429 --> 02:24:25,439
so much progress over over this time
 

8393
02:24:25,439 --> 02:24:27,349
so much progress over over this time
since launch it's pretty incredible and

8394
02:24:27,349 --> 02:24:27,359
since launch it's pretty incredible and
 

8395
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:29,809
since launch it's pretty incredible and
Swift is a very very good thing but I

8396
02:24:29,809 --> 02:24:29,819
Swift is a very very good thing but I
 

8397
02:24:29,819 --> 02:24:31,010
Swift is a very very good thing but I
just don't want to do that again right

8398
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:31,020
just don't want to do that again right
 

8399
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:34,730
just don't want to do that again right
and so a more iterate more through the

8400
02:24:34,730 --> 02:24:34,740
and so a more iterate more through the
 

8401
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:36,170
and so a more iterate more through the
development process and so what we're

8402
02:24:36,170 --> 02:24:36,180
development process and so what we're
 

8403
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:37,670
development process and so what we're
doing is we're not launching it when

8404
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:37,680
doing is we're not launching it when
 

8405
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:40,010
doing is we're not launching it when
it's hopefully is 0.9 with no testers

8406
02:24:40,010 --> 02:24:40,020
it's hopefully is 0.9 with no testers
 

8407
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:42,770
it's hopefully is 0.9 with no testers
we're launching it and saying it's 0.1

8408
02:24:42,770 --> 02:24:42,780
we're launching it and saying it's 0.1
 

8409
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:44,570
we're launching it and saying it's 0.1
right and so we're setting expectations

8410
02:24:44,570 --> 02:24:44,580
right and so we're setting expectations
 

8411
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:46,429
right and so we're setting expectations
of saying like Okay well don't use this

8412
02:24:46,429 --> 02:24:46,439
of saying like Okay well don't use this
 

8413
02:24:46,439 --> 02:24:47,750
of saying like Okay well don't use this
for production

8414
02:24:47,750 --> 02:24:47,760
for production
 

8415
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:49,490
for production
right if you're interested in what we're

8416
02:24:49,490 --> 02:24:49,500
right if you're interested in what we're
 

8417
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:52,190
right if you're interested in what we're
doing we'll do it in an open way and we

8418
02:24:52,190 --> 02:24:52,200
doing we'll do it in an open way and we
 

8419
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:54,170
doing we'll do it in an open way and we
can do it together but don't use it in

8420
02:24:54,170 --> 02:24:54,180
can do it together but don't use it in
 

8421
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:56,030
can do it together but don't use it in
production yet like we'll get there but

8422
02:24:56,030 --> 02:24:56,040
production yet like we'll get there but
 

8423
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:58,130
production yet like we'll get there but
let's let's do it the right way and I'm

8424
02:24:58,130 --> 02:24:58,140
let's let's do it the right way and I'm
 

8425
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:00,950
let's let's do it the right way and I'm
also saying we're not in a race

8426
02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:00,960
also saying we're not in a race
 

8427
02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:03,110
also saying we're not in a race
the thing that I want to do is build the

8428
02:25:03,110 --> 02:25:03,120
the thing that I want to do is build the
 

8429
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:06,110
the thing that I want to do is build the
world's best thing yeah right because if

8430
02:25:06,110 --> 02:25:06,120
world's best thing yeah right because if
 

8431
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:07,429
world's best thing yeah right because if
you do it right and it lifts the

8432
02:25:07,429 --> 02:25:07,439
you do it right and it lifts the
 

8433
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:09,230
you do it right and it lifts the
industry it doesn't matter if it takes

8434
02:25:09,230 --> 02:25:09,240
industry it doesn't matter if it takes
 

8435
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:11,090
industry it doesn't matter if it takes
an extra two months yeah like two months

8436
02:25:11,090 --> 02:25:11,100
an extra two months yeah like two months
 

8437
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:13,790
an extra two months yeah like two months
is worth waiting and so doing it right

8438
02:25:13,790 --> 02:25:13,800
is worth waiting and so doing it right
 

8439
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:15,889
is worth waiting and so doing it right
and not being overwhelmed with technical

8440
02:25:15,889 --> 02:25:15,899
and not being overwhelmed with technical
 

8441
02:25:15,899 --> 02:25:18,170
and not being overwhelmed with technical
debt and things like this is like again

8442
02:25:18,170 --> 02:25:18,180
debt and things like this is like again
 

8443
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:19,969
debt and things like this is like again

War wounds
 

8445
02:25:19,979 --> 02:25:22,010
War wounds
um Lessons Learned uh whatever you want

8446
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:22,020
um Lessons Learned uh whatever you want
 

8447
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:23,630
um Lessons Learned uh whatever you want
to say I think is absolutely the right

thing to do even though right now people
 

8451
02:25:25,260 --> 02:25:26,690
thing to do even though right now people
are very frustrated that you know you

8452
02:25:26,690 --> 02:25:26,700
are very frustrated that you know you
 

8453
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:28,429
are very frustrated that you know you
can't download it or it doesn't have

8454
02:25:28,429 --> 02:25:28,439
can't download it or it doesn't have
 

8455
02:25:28,439 --> 02:25:30,650
can't download it or it doesn't have
feature X or something like this and so

8456
02:25:30,650 --> 02:25:30,660
feature X or something like this and so
 

8457
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:33,770
feature X or something like this and so
what have you learned in the in a little

02:25:33,770 --> 02:25:33,780
what have you learned in the in a little
 

8459
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:35,830
what have you learned in the in a little
bit of time since it's been

8460
02:25:35,830 --> 02:25:35,840
bit of time since it's been
 

8461
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:38,870
bit of time since it's been
released into the wild or that people

8462
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:38,880
released into the wild or that people
 

8463
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:40,969
released into the wild or that people
have been complaining about future X or

8464
02:25:40,969 --> 02:25:40,979
have been complaining about future X or
 

8465
02:25:40,979 --> 02:25:43,070
have been complaining about future X or
Y or Z what have they been complaining

8466
02:25:43,070 --> 02:25:43,080
Y or Z what have they been complaining
 

8467
02:25:43,080 --> 02:25:44,929
Y or Z what have they been complaining
about what they have been

8468
02:25:44,929 --> 02:25:44,939
about what they have been
 

8469
02:25:44,939 --> 02:25:47,630
about what they have been
uh excited about like yeah almost like

8470
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:47,640
uh excited about like yeah almost like
 

8471
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:50,210
uh excited about like yeah almost like
detailed things versus a big I think

8472
02:25:50,210 --> 02:25:50,220
detailed things versus a big I think
 

8473
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:52,250
detailed things versus a big I think
everyone would be very excited about the

8474
02:25:52,250 --> 02:25:52,260
everyone would be very excited about the
 

8475
02:25:52,260 --> 02:25:54,110
everyone would be very excited about the
big Vision yeah yeah well so I mean I've

8476
02:25:54,110 --> 02:25:54,120
big Vision yeah yeah well so I mean I've
 

8477
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:55,730
big Vision yeah yeah well so I mean I've
been very pleased and in fact I mean

8478
02:25:55,730 --> 02:25:55,740
been very pleased and in fact I mean
 

8479
02:25:55,740 --> 02:25:57,710
been very pleased and in fact I mean
we've been massively overwhelmed with

8480
02:25:57,710 --> 02:25:57,720
we've been massively overwhelmed with
 

8481
02:25:57,720 --> 02:26:00,050
we've been massively overwhelmed with
response which is um a good problem to

8482
02:26:00,050 --> 02:26:00,060
response which is um a good problem to
 

8483
02:26:00,060 --> 02:26:01,849
response which is um a good problem to
have um it's kind of like a success

8484
02:26:01,849 --> 02:26:01,859
have um it's kind of like a success
 

8485
02:26:01,859 --> 02:26:04,730
have um it's kind of like a success
disaster yeah in a sense right

8486
02:26:04,730 --> 02:26:04,740
disaster yeah in a sense right
 

8487
02:26:04,740 --> 02:26:07,969
disaster yeah in a sense right
um and um so I mean if you go back in

8488
02:26:07,969 --> 02:26:07,979
um and um so I mean if you go back in
 

8489
02:26:07,979 --> 02:26:09,710
um and um so I mean if you go back in
time when we started modular which is

8490
02:26:09,710 --> 02:26:09,720
time when we started modular which is
 

8491
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:10,490
time when we started modular which is
just

8492
02:26:10,490 --> 02:26:10,500
just
 

8493
02:26:10,500 --> 02:26:12,710
just
um not yet a year and a half ago so it's

8494
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:12,720
um not yet a year and a half ago so it's
 

8495
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:14,630
um not yet a year and a half ago so it's
still a pretty new company new team

8496
02:26:14,630 --> 02:26:14,640
still a pretty new company new team
 

8497
02:26:14,640 --> 02:26:17,990
still a pretty new company new team
small but very good team of people like

8498
02:26:17,990 --> 02:26:18,000
small but very good team of people like
 

8499
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,510
small but very good team of people like
we started with extreme conviction that

8500
02:26:20,510 --> 02:26:20,520
we started with extreme conviction that
 

8501
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:22,130
we started with extreme conviction that
there's a set of problems we need to

8502
02:26:22,130 --> 02:26:22,140
there's a set of problems we need to
 

8503
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:23,990
there's a set of problems we need to
solve and if we solve it then people

8504
02:26:23,990 --> 02:26:24,000
solve and if we solve it then people
 

8505
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,190
solve and if we solve it then people
will be interested in what we're doing

8506
02:26:25,190 --> 02:26:25,200
will be interested in what we're doing
 

8507
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:27,710
will be interested in what we're doing
right but but again you're building in

8508
02:26:27,710 --> 02:26:27,720
right but but again you're building in
 

8509
02:26:27,720 --> 02:26:30,590
right but but again you're building in
basically secret right you're trying to

8510
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:30,600
basically secret right you're trying to
 

8511
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:32,630
basically secret right you're trying to
figure it out it's the creation's a

8512
02:26:32,630 --> 02:26:32,640
figure it out it's the creation's a
 

8513
02:26:32,640 --> 02:26:33,950
figure it out it's the creation's a
messy process you're having to go

8514
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:33,960
messy process you're having to go
 

8515
02:26:33,960 --> 02:26:35,630
messy process you're having to go
through different paths and understand

8516
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:35,640
through different paths and understand
 

8517
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:37,070
through different paths and understand
what you want to do and how to explain

8518
02:26:37,070 --> 02:26:37,080
what you want to do and how to explain
 

8519
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:38,870
what you want to do and how to explain
it often when you're doing disruptive

8520
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:38,880
it often when you're doing disruptive
 

8521
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:40,790
it often when you're doing disruptive
and new kinds of things

8522
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:40,800
and new kinds of things
 

8523
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:42,710
and new kinds of things
just knowing how to explain it is super

8524
02:26:42,710 --> 02:26:42,720
just knowing how to explain it is super
 

8525
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:44,570
just knowing how to explain it is super
difficult right

8526
02:26:44,570 --> 02:26:44,580
difficult right
 

8527
02:26:44,580 --> 02:26:46,730
difficult right
um and so when we launched we hope

8528
02:26:46,730 --> 02:26:46,740
um and so when we launched we hope
 

8529
02:26:46,740 --> 02:26:49,490
um and so when we launched we hope
people would be excited but you know I'm

8530
02:26:49,490 --> 02:26:49,500
people would be excited but you know I'm
 

8531
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:52,010
people would be excited but you know I'm
I'm an optimist but I'm also like don't

8532
02:26:52,010 --> 02:26:52,020
I'm an optimist but I'm also like don't
 

8533
02:26:52,020 --> 02:26:54,410
I'm an optimist but I'm also like don't
want to get ahead of myself and so when

8534
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:54,420
want to get ahead of myself and so when
 

8535
02:26:54,420 --> 02:26:55,910
want to get ahead of myself and so when
people found out about Mojo I think

8536
02:26:55,910 --> 02:26:55,920
people found out about Mojo I think
 

8537
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:58,610
people found out about Mojo I think
their heads exploded a little bit right

8538
02:26:58,610 --> 02:26:58,620
their heads exploded a little bit right
 

8539
02:26:58,620 --> 02:27:00,710
their heads exploded a little bit right
and you know here here's a I think a

8540
02:27:00,710 --> 02:27:00,720
and you know here here's a I think a
 

8541
02:27:00,720 --> 02:27:02,210
and you know here here's a I think a
pretty credible team that has built some

8542
02:27:02,210 --> 02:27:02,220
pretty credible team that has built some
 

8543
02:27:02,220 --> 02:27:03,889
pretty credible team that has built some
languages and some tools before and so

8544
02:27:03,889 --> 02:27:03,899
languages and some tools before and so
 

8545
02:27:03,899 --> 02:27:06,710
languages and some tools before and so
they have some lessons learned and are

8546
02:27:06,710 --> 02:27:06,720
they have some lessons learned and are
 

8547
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:08,570
they have some lessons learned and are
tackling some of the deep problems in

8548
02:27:08,570 --> 02:27:08,580
tackling some of the deep problems in
 

8549
02:27:08,580 --> 02:27:10,250
tackling some of the deep problems in
the python ecosystem and giving it the

8550
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:10,260
the python ecosystem and giving it the
 

8551
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:11,750
the python ecosystem and giving it the
love and attention that it should be

8552
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:11,760
love and attention that it should be
 

8553
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:13,429
love and attention that it should be
getting and I think people got very

8554
02:27:13,429 --> 02:27:13,439
getting and I think people got very
 

8555
02:27:13,439 --> 02:27:15,050
getting and I think people got very
excited about that and so if you look at

8556
02:27:15,050 --> 02:27:15,060
excited about that and so if you look at
 

8557
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:16,610
excited about that and so if you look at
that I mean I think people are excited

8558
02:27:16,610 --> 02:27:16,620
that I mean I think people are excited
 

8559
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:18,710
that I mean I think people are excited
about ownership and taking a Step Beyond

8560
02:27:18,710 --> 02:27:18,720
about ownership and taking a Step Beyond
 

8561
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:20,270
about ownership and taking a Step Beyond
rust right there's people that are very

hate writing stuff in C plus plus save
 

8577
02:27:34,380 --> 02:27:36,110
hate writing stuff in C plus plus save
me like systems and you're they're like

02:27:38,460 --> 02:27:41,450
stepping up like yeah yes so that's
that's that's that's me by the way also

8582
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:41,460
that's that's that's me by the way also
 

8583
02:27:41,460 --> 02:27:43,730
that's that's that's me by the way also
um I really want to stop writing C plus

8584
02:27:43,730 --> 02:27:43,740
um I really want to stop writing C plus
 

8585
02:27:43,740 --> 02:27:46,670
um I really want to stop writing C plus
plus but the um I get third person

8586
02:27:46,670 --> 02:27:46,680
plus but the um I get third person
 

8587
02:27:46,680 --> 02:27:50,210
plus but the um I get third person
excitement when people tweet here I made

8588
02:27:50,210 --> 02:27:50,220
excitement when people tweet here I made
 

8589
02:27:50,220 --> 02:27:52,250
excitement when people tweet here I made
this code Game of Life or whatever it's

8590
02:27:52,250 --> 02:27:52,260
this code Game of Life or whatever it's
 

8591
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:54,889
this code Game of Life or whatever it's
faster and you're like yeah yeah and and

8592
02:27:54,889 --> 02:27:54,899
faster and you're like yeah yeah and and
 

8593
02:27:54,899 --> 02:27:58,130
faster and you're like yeah yeah and and
also like um well I would also say that

8594
02:27:58,130 --> 02:27:58,140
also like um well I would also say that
 

8595
02:27:58,140 --> 02:28:00,770
also like um well I would also say that
um Let me let me cast blame out to

8596
02:28:00,770 --> 02:28:00,780
um Let me let me cast blame out to
 

8597
02:28:00,780 --> 02:28:02,990
um Let me let me cast blame out to
people who deserve it sure these

8598
02:28:02,990 --> 02:28:03,000
people who deserve it sure these
 

8599
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,330
people who deserve it sure these
terrible people who convinced me to do

8600
02:28:05,330 --> 02:28:05,340
terrible people who convinced me to do
 

8601
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:08,450
terrible people who convinced me to do
some of this yes Jeremy Howard yes that

8602
02:28:08,450 --> 02:28:08,460
some of this yes Jeremy Howard yes that
 

8603
02:28:08,460 --> 02:28:09,530
some of this yes Jeremy Howard yes that
guy

8604
02:28:09,530 --> 02:28:09,540
guy
 

8605
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:11,270
guy
well he's been pushing for this kind of

8606
02:28:11,270 --> 02:28:11,280
well he's been pushing for this kind of
 

8607
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:13,429
well he's been pushing for this kind of
thing he's one of this for years yeah

8608
02:28:13,429 --> 02:28:13,439
thing he's one of this for years yeah
 

8609
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:14,870
thing he's one of this for years yeah
he's wanted this for a long time he's

8610
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:14,880
he's wanted this for a long time he's
 

8611
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:16,670
he's wanted this for a long time he's
won this for years and so for people who

8612
02:28:16,670 --> 02:28:16,680
won this for years and so for people who
 

8613
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:18,469
won this for years and so for people who
don't know Jimmy Howard he's like one of

8614
02:28:18,469 --> 02:28:18,479
don't know Jimmy Howard he's like one of
 

8615
02:28:18,479 --> 02:28:19,610
don't know Jimmy Howard he's like one of
the most legit people in the machine

8616
02:28:19,610 --> 02:28:19,620
the most legit people in the machine
 

8617
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:22,429
the most legit people in the machine
Learning Community he's uh has a

8618
02:28:22,429 --> 02:28:22,439
Learning Community he's uh has a
 

8619
02:28:22,439 --> 02:28:25,250
Learning Community he's uh has a
Grassroots he really teaches he's an

8620
02:28:25,250 --> 02:28:25,260
Grassroots he really teaches he's an
 

8621
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:26,630
Grassroots he really teaches he's an
incredible educator he's an incredible

8622
02:28:26,630 --> 02:28:26,640
incredible educator he's an incredible
 

8623
02:28:26,640 --> 02:28:29,210
incredible educator he's an incredible
teacher but also legit uh in terms of a

8624
02:28:29,210 --> 02:28:29,220
teacher but also legit uh in terms of a
 

8625
02:28:29,220 --> 02:28:31,250
teacher but also legit uh in terms of a
machine learning engineer himself yeah I

8626
02:28:31,250 --> 02:28:31,260
machine learning engineer himself yeah I
 

8627
02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:33,050
machine learning engineer himself yeah I
think he's been running the fast uh dot

8628
02:28:33,050 --> 02:28:33,060
think he's been running the fast uh dot
 

8629
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:36,110
think he's been running the fast uh dot
Ai and looking I think for uh exactly

8630
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:36,120
Ai and looking I think for uh exactly
 

8631
02:28:36,120 --> 02:28:38,809
Ai and looking I think for uh exactly
what you've done exactly so and so um I

8632
02:28:38,809 --> 02:28:38,819
what you've done exactly so and so um I
 

8633
02:28:38,819 --> 02:28:41,389
what you've done exactly so and so um I
mean the first time so I met Jeremy

8634
02:28:41,389 --> 02:28:41,399
mean the first time so I met Jeremy
 

8635
02:28:41,399 --> 02:28:44,570
mean the first time so I met Jeremy
pretty early on but the first time I sat

8636
02:28:44,570 --> 02:28:44,580
pretty early on but the first time I sat
 

8637
02:28:44,580 --> 02:28:46,130
pretty early on but the first time I sat
up and I'm like

8638
02:28:46,130 --> 02:28:46,140
up and I'm like
 

8639
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:49,010
up and I'm like
this guy is ridiculous is when I was at

8640
02:28:49,010 --> 02:28:49,020
this guy is ridiculous is when I was at
 

8641
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:50,990
this guy is ridiculous is when I was at
Google and we're bringing up tpus and we

8642
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:51,000
Google and we're bringing up tpus and we
 

8643
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,389
Google and we're bringing up tpus and we
had a whole team of people and we're

had a whole team of people and we're
 

8645
02:28:53,399 --> 02:28:55,790
had a whole team of people and we're
there was this competition called Don

8646
02:28:55,790 --> 02:28:55,800
there was this competition called Don

Progressive imagery sizing was the right

8662
02:29:15,410 --> 02:29:15,420
Progressive imagery sizing was the right
 

8663
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:16,790
Progressive imagery sizing was the right
way to train the model and if you're

8664
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:16,800
way to train the model and if you're
 

8665
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:19,250

go vroom right yep and I'm like this guy
is incredible right so you can say

8670
02:29:25,490 --> 02:29:25,500
is incredible right so you can say
 

8671
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:27,230
is incredible right so you can say
anyways come back to you know where's

Mojo coming from Chris finally listened
 

8675
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:31,510
Mojo coming from Chris finally listened
to Jeremy

8676
02:29:31,510 --> 02:29:31,520
to Jeremy
 

8677
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:34,070
to Jeremy
it's all his fault well there's a kind

8678
02:29:34,070 --> 02:29:34,080
it's all his fault well there's a kind
 

8679
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:36,309
it's all his fault well there's a kind
of very uh

8680
02:29:36,309 --> 02:29:36,319
of very uh
 

8681
02:29:36,319 --> 02:29:39,410

refreshing uh pragmatic view that he has

8682
02:29:39,410 --> 02:29:39,420
refreshing uh pragmatic view that he has
 

8683
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:42,469
refreshing uh pragmatic view that he has
about machine learning that

8684
02:29:42,469 --> 02:29:42,479
about machine learning that
 

8685
02:29:42,479 --> 02:29:46,490
about machine learning that
um I don't know if it's like this mix of

8686
02:29:46,490 --> 02:29:46,500
um I don't know if it's like this mix of
 

8687
02:29:46,500 --> 02:29:48,790
um I don't know if it's like this mix of
a desire for efficiency But ultimately

8688
02:29:48,790 --> 02:29:48,800
a desire for efficiency But ultimately
 

8689
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:51,710
a desire for efficiency But ultimately
grounded in a desired to make uh machine

8690
02:29:51,710 --> 02:29:51,720
grounded in a desired to make uh machine
 

8691
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:53,270
grounded in a desired to make uh machine
learning more accessible to a lot of

8692
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:53,280
learning more accessible to a lot of
 

8693
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:55,130
learning more accessible to a lot of
people I don't know what that is I guess

8694
02:29:55,130 --> 02:29:55,140
people I don't know what that is I guess
 

8695
02:29:55,140 --> 02:29:57,349
people I don't know what that is I guess
that's coupled with efficiency and

8696
02:29:57,349 --> 02:29:57,359
that's coupled with efficiency and
 

8697
02:29:57,359 --> 02:29:59,870
that's coupled with efficiency and
performance but it's not just obsessed

8698
02:29:59,870 --> 02:29:59,880
performance but it's not just obsessed
 

8699
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:02,210
performance but it's not just obsessed
about performance well so so a lot of AI

8700
02:30:02,210 --> 02:30:02,220
about performance well so so a lot of AI
 

8701
02:30:02,220 --> 02:30:04,490
about performance well so so a lot of AI
and AI research ends up being that it

8702
02:30:04,490 --> 02:30:04,500
and AI research ends up being that it
 

8703
02:30:04,500 --> 02:30:07,670
and AI research ends up being that it
has to go fast enough to get scale so a

8704
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:07,680
has to go fast enough to get scale so a
 

8705
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:08,870
has to go fast enough to get scale so a
lot of people don't actually care about

8706
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:08,880
lot of people don't actually care about
 

8707
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:10,370
lot of people don't actually care about
performance particularly on the research

8708
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:10,380
performance particularly on the research
 

8709
02:30:10,380 --> 02:30:12,410
performance particularly on the research
side until it allows them to have more a

8710
02:30:12,410 --> 02:30:12,420
side until it allows them to have more a
 

8711
02:30:12,420 --> 02:30:13,610
side until it allows them to have more a
bigger data set

8712
02:30:13,610 --> 02:30:13,620
bigger data set
 

8713
02:30:13,620 --> 02:30:15,590
bigger data set
right and so suddenly now you care about

8714
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:15,600
right and so suddenly now you care about
 

8715
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:17,809
right and so suddenly now you care about
distributed compute and like all these

8716
02:30:17,809 --> 02:30:17,819
distributed compute and like all these
 

8717
02:30:17,819 --> 02:30:19,670
distributed compute and like all these
exotic HPC like you don't actually want

8718
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:19,680
exotic HPC like you don't actually want
 

8719
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:21,650
exotic HPC like you don't actually want
to know about that you just want to be

8720
02:30:21,650 --> 02:30:21,660
to know about that you just want to be
 

8721
02:30:21,660 --> 02:30:23,210
to know about that you just want to be
able to do more experiments faster and

8722
02:30:23,210 --> 02:30:23,220
able to do more experiments faster and
 

8723
02:30:23,220 --> 02:30:25,490
able to do more experiments faster and
do so with bigger data sets right and so

8724
02:30:25,490 --> 02:30:25,500
do so with bigger data sets right and so
 

8725
02:30:25,500 --> 02:30:27,889
do so with bigger data sets right and so
Jeremy has been really pushing limits

8726
02:30:27,889 --> 02:30:27,899
Jeremy has been really pushing limits
 

8727
02:30:27,899 --> 02:30:28,849
Jeremy has been really pushing limits
and one of the things I'll say about

8728
02:30:28,849 --> 02:30:28,859
and one of the things I'll say about
 

8729
02:30:28,859 --> 02:30:31,010
and one of the things I'll say about
Jeremy and there's many things I could

8730
02:30:31,010 --> 02:30:31,020
Jeremy and there's many things I could
 

8731
02:30:31,020 --> 02:30:32,630
Jeremy and there's many things I could
say about Jeremy because I'm a fanboy of

8732
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:32,640
say about Jeremy because I'm a fanboy of
 

8733
02:30:32,640 --> 02:30:36,650
say about Jeremy because I'm a fanboy of
his but uh he uh it fits in his head

8734
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:36,660
his but uh he uh it fits in his head
 

8735
02:30:36,660 --> 02:30:38,570
his but uh he uh it fits in his head
and Jeremy actually takes the time where

8736
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:38,580
and Jeremy actually takes the time where
 

8737
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:40,969
and Jeremy actually takes the time where
many people don't to really dive deep

8738
02:30:40,969 --> 02:30:40,979
many people don't to really dive deep
 

8739
02:30:40,979 --> 02:30:43,670
many people don't to really dive deep
into why is the beta parameter of the

8740
02:30:43,670 --> 02:30:43,680
into why is the beta parameter of the
 

8741
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:46,309
into why is the beta parameter of the
atom Optimizer equal to this yeah right

8742
02:30:46,309 --> 02:30:46,319
atom Optimizer equal to this yeah right
 

8743
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:49,550
atom Optimizer equal to this yeah right
and he'll go survey and understand what

8744
02:30:49,550 --> 02:30:49,560
and he'll go survey and understand what
 

8745
02:30:49,560 --> 02:30:50,990
and he'll go survey and understand what
are all the activation functions in the

8746
02:30:50,990 --> 02:30:51,000
are all the activation functions in the
 

8747
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,309
are all the activation functions in the
trade-offs and why is it that everybody

8748
02:30:52,309 --> 02:30:52,319
trade-offs and why is it that everybody
 

8749
02:30:52,319 --> 02:30:55,010
trade-offs and why is it that everybody
that does uh you know this model pick

8750
02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:55,020
that does uh you know this model pick
 

8751
02:30:55,020 --> 02:30:57,710
that does uh you know this model pick
that thing so the why not just trying

8752
02:30:57,710 --> 02:30:57,720
that thing so the why not just trying
 

8753
02:30:57,720 --> 02:31:00,230
that thing so the why not just trying
different values like really what is

8754
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:00,240
different values like really what is
 

8755
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:01,969
different values like really what is
going on here right and so as a

8756
02:31:01,969 --> 02:31:01,979
going on here right and so as a
 

8757
02:31:01,979 --> 02:31:03,830
going on here right and so as a
consequence of that like he's always he

8758
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:03,840
consequence of that like he's always he
 

8759
02:31:03,840 --> 02:31:06,410
consequence of that like he's always he
again he makes time but he he spends

8760
02:31:06,410 --> 02:31:06,420
again he makes time but he he spends
 

8761
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:08,389
again he makes time but he he spends
time to understand things that are depth

8762
02:31:08,389 --> 02:31:08,399
time to understand things that are depth
 

8763
02:31:08,399 --> 02:31:10,309
time to understand things that are depth
that a lot of people don't and as you

8764
02:31:10,309 --> 02:31:10,319
that a lot of people don't and as you
 

8765
02:31:10,319 --> 02:31:12,349
that a lot of people don't and as you
say he then brings it and teaches people

8766
02:31:12,349 --> 02:31:12,359
say he then brings it and teaches people
 

8767
02:31:12,359 --> 02:31:16,309
say he then brings it and teaches people
and he's his mission is to help lift you

8768
02:31:16,309 --> 02:31:16,319
and he's his mission is to help lift you
 

8769
02:31:16,319 --> 02:31:18,590
and he's his mission is to help lift you
know his website says making AI uncool

8770
02:31:18,590 --> 02:31:18,600
know his website says making AI uncool
 

8771
02:31:18,600 --> 02:31:20,630
know his website says making AI uncool
again like it's about like forget about

8772
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:20,640
again like it's about like forget about
 

8773
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:22,130
again like it's about like forget about
the hype list it's actually practical

8774
02:31:22,130 --> 02:31:22,140
the hype list it's actually practical
 

8775
02:31:22,140 --> 02:31:23,809
the hype list it's actually practical
and useful let's teach people how to do

8776
02:31:23,809 --> 02:31:23,819
and useful let's teach people how to do
 

8777
02:31:23,819 --> 02:31:25,790
and useful let's teach people how to do
this right now the problem Jeremy

8778
02:31:25,790 --> 02:31:25,800
this right now the problem Jeremy
 

8779
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:27,290
this right now the problem Jeremy
struggled with is he's pushing the

8780
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:27,300
struggled with is he's pushing the
 

8781
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:28,190
struggled with is he's pushing the
envelope

8782
02:31:28,190 --> 02:31:28,200
envelope
 

8783
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:29,929
envelope
right research isn't about doing the

8784
02:31:29,929 --> 02:31:29,939
right research isn't about doing the
 

8785
02:31:29,939 --> 02:31:31,610
right research isn't about doing the
thing that is staying on the happy path

8786
02:31:31,610 --> 02:31:31,620
thing that is staying on the happy path
 

8787
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:34,790
thing that is staying on the happy path
or the the well-paved road right and so

8788
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:34,800
or the the well-paved road right and so
 

8789
02:31:34,800 --> 02:31:36,349
or the the well-paved road right and so
a lot of the systems today have been

8790
02:31:36,349 --> 02:31:36,359
a lot of the systems today have been
 

8791
02:31:36,359 --> 02:31:38,510
a lot of the systems today have been
these really frag fragile fragmented

8792
02:31:38,510 --> 02:31:38,520
these really frag fragile fragmented
 

8793
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:39,950
these really frag fragile fragmented
things or special case in this happy

8794
02:31:39,950 --> 02:31:39,960
things or special case in this happy
 

8795
02:31:39,960 --> 02:31:41,510
things or special case in this happy
path and if you fall off the happy path

8796
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:41,520
path and if you fall off the happy path
 

8797
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:44,330
path and if you fall off the happy path
you get eaten by an alligator

8798
02:31:44,330 --> 02:31:44,340
you get eaten by an alligator
 

8799
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:47,150
you get eaten by an alligator
so

8800
02:31:47,150 --> 02:31:47,160
so
 

8801
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:50,929
so
what about uh so python has this giant

8802
02:31:50,929 --> 02:31:50,939
what about uh so python has this giant
 

8803
02:31:50,939 --> 02:31:53,570
what about uh so python has this giant
ecosystem of packages uh and there's a

8804
02:31:53,570 --> 02:31:53,580
ecosystem of packages uh and there's a
 

8805
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:55,670
ecosystem of packages uh and there's a
package repository do you have ideas of

8806
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:55,680
package repository do you have ideas of
 

8807
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:58,250
package repository do you have ideas of
how to do that well for Mojo

8808
02:31:58,250 --> 02:31:58,260
how to do that well for Mojo
 

8809
02:31:58,260 --> 02:32:00,410
how to do that well for Mojo
yeah how to do a repository of packages

8810
02:32:00,410 --> 02:32:00,420
yeah how to do a repository of packages
 

8811
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:01,790
yeah how to do a repository of packages
well so that's another really

8812
02:32:01,790 --> 02:32:01,800
well so that's another really
 

8813
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:04,070
well so that's another really
interesting problem that I knew about

8814
02:32:04,070 --> 02:32:04,080
interesting problem that I knew about
 

8815
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:06,050
interesting problem that I knew about
but I didn't understand how big of a

8816
02:32:06,050 --> 02:32:06,060
but I didn't understand how big of a
 

8817
02:32:06,060 --> 02:32:09,290
but I didn't understand how big of a
problem it was uh python Packaging

8818
02:32:09,290 --> 02:32:09,300
problem it was uh python Packaging
 

8819
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:10,849
problem it was uh python Packaging
a lot of people have very big pain

8820
02:32:10,849 --> 02:32:10,859
a lot of people have very big pain
 

8821
02:32:10,859 --> 02:32:12,590
a lot of people have very big pain
points and a lot of scars with python

8822
02:32:12,590 --> 02:32:12,600
points and a lot of scars with python
 

8823
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:14,510
points and a lot of scars with python
packaging Oh you mean uh so there's

8824
02:32:14,510 --> 02:32:14,520
packaging Oh you mean uh so there's
 

8825
02:32:14,520 --> 02:32:16,130
packaging Oh you mean uh so there's
several things building and distributing

8826
02:32:16,130 --> 02:32:16,140
several things building and distributing
 

8827
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:18,889
several things building and distributing
yes managing dependencies and versioning

8828
02:32:18,889 --> 02:32:18,899
yes managing dependencies and versioning
 

8829
02:32:18,899 --> 02:32:20,630
yes managing dependencies and versioning
and all this stuff so from the

8830
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:20,640
and all this stuff so from the
 

8831
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:22,370
and all this stuff so from the
perspective of if you want to create

8832
02:32:22,370 --> 02:32:22,380
perspective of if you want to create
 

8833
02:32:22,380 --> 02:32:24,410
perspective of if you want to create
your own package yes yeah and then or

8834
02:32:24,410 --> 02:32:24,420
your own package yes yeah and then or
 

8835
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:25,969
your own package yes yeah and then or
you want to build on top of a bunch of

8836
02:32:25,969 --> 02:32:25,979
you want to build on top of a bunch of
 

8837
02:32:25,979 --> 02:32:27,349
you want to build on top of a bunch of
other people's packages and then they

8838
02:32:27,349 --> 02:32:27,359
other people's packages and then they
 

8839
02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:29,750
other people's packages and then they
get updated and it's like this now I'm

8840
02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:29,760
get updated and it's like this now I'm
 

8841
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:32,690
get updated and it's like this now I'm
not an expert in this so I don't know

8842
02:32:32,690 --> 02:32:32,700
not an expert in this so I don't know
 

8843
02:32:32,700 --> 02:32:34,790
not an expert in this so I don't know
the answer I think this is one of the

8844
02:32:34,790 --> 02:32:34,800
the answer I think this is one of the
 

8845
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:36,530
the answer I think this is one of the
reasons why it's great that we work as a

8846
02:32:36,530 --> 02:32:36,540
reasons why it's great that we work as a
 

8847
02:32:36,540 --> 02:32:38,330
reasons why it's great that we work as a
team and there's other really good and

8848
02:32:38,330 --> 02:32:38,340
team and there's other really good and
 

8849
02:32:38,340 --> 02:32:39,950
team and there's other really good and
smart people involved

8850
02:32:39,950 --> 02:32:39,960
smart people involved
 

8851
02:32:39,960 --> 02:32:42,349
smart people involved
um the uh but one of my

8852
02:32:42,349 --> 02:32:42,359
um the uh but one of my
 

8853
02:32:42,359 --> 02:32:44,210
um the uh but one of my
one of the things I've heard from smart

8854
02:32:44,210 --> 02:32:44,220
one of the things I've heard from smart
 

8855
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:46,610
one of the things I've heard from smart
people who've done a lot of this is that

8856
02:32:46,610 --> 02:32:46,620
people who've done a lot of this is that
 

8857
02:32:46,620 --> 02:32:48,469
people who've done a lot of this is that
the packaging becomes a huge disaster

8858
02:32:48,469 --> 02:32:48,479
the packaging becomes a huge disaster
 

8859
02:32:48,479 --> 02:32:50,349
the packaging becomes a huge disaster
when you get the python and C together

8860
02:32:50,349 --> 02:32:50,359
when you get the python and C together
 

8861
02:32:50,359 --> 02:32:52,730
when you get the python and C together
and so if you have this problem where

8862
02:32:52,730 --> 02:32:52,740
and so if you have this problem where
 

8863
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:55,550
and so if you have this problem where
you have code split between Python and C

8864
02:32:55,550 --> 02:32:55,560
you have code split between Python and C
 

8865
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:57,830
you have code split between Python and C
now not only do you have to package the

8866
02:32:57,830 --> 02:32:57,840
now not only do you have to package the
 

8867
02:32:57,840 --> 02:33:00,469
now not only do you have to package the
C code you have to build the C code C

8868
02:33:00,469 --> 02:33:00,479
C code you have to build the C code C
 

8869
02:33:00,479 --> 02:33:02,690
C code you have to build the C code C
doesn't have a package manager right C

8870
02:33:02,690 --> 02:33:02,700
doesn't have a package manager right C
 

8871
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:04,190
doesn't have a package manager right C
doesn't have a dependency versioning

8872
02:33:04,190 --> 02:33:04,200
doesn't have a dependency versioning
 

8873
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:07,330
doesn't have a dependency versioning
management system right and so I'm not

8874
02:33:07,330 --> 02:33:07,340
management system right and so I'm not
 

8875
02:33:07,340 --> 02:33:10,490
management system right and so I'm not
experiencing the state of the art and uh

8876
02:33:10,490 --> 02:33:10,500
experiencing the state of the art and uh
 

8877
02:33:10,500 --> 02:33:12,110
experiencing the state of the art and uh
all the different python package

8878
02:33:12,110 --> 02:33:12,120
all the different python package
 

8879
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:13,670
all the different python package
managers but my understanding is that's

8880
02:33:13,670 --> 02:33:13,680
managers but my understanding is that's
 

8881
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:16,250
managers but my understanding is that's
a massive part of the problem and I

8882
02:33:16,250 --> 02:33:16,260
a massive part of the problem and I
 

8883
02:33:16,260 --> 02:33:17,570
a massive part of the problem and I
think Mojo solves that part of the

8884
02:33:17,570 --> 02:33:17,580
think Mojo solves that part of the
 

8885
02:33:17,580 --> 02:33:20,389
think Mojo solves that part of the
problem directly heads on now one of the

8886
02:33:20,389 --> 02:33:20,399
problem directly heads on now one of the
 

8887
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:21,349
problem directly heads on now one of the
things I think we'll do with the

8888
02:33:21,349 --> 02:33:21,359
things I think we'll do with the
 

8889
02:33:21,359 --> 02:33:24,050
things I think we'll do with the
community and this isn't again we're not

8890
02:33:24,050 --> 02:33:24,060
community and this isn't again we're not
 

8891
02:33:24,060 --> 02:33:25,309
community and this isn't again we're not
solving all the world's problems at once

8892
02:33:25,309 --> 02:33:25,319
solving all the world's problems at once
 

8893
02:33:25,319 --> 02:33:26,929
solving all the world's problems at once
we have to be kind of focused start with

8894
02:33:26,929 --> 02:33:26,939
we have to be kind of focused start with
 

8895
02:33:26,939 --> 02:33:29,389
we have to be kind of focused start with
is that I think that we will have an

8896
02:33:29,389 --> 02:33:29,399
is that I think that we will have an
 

8897
02:33:29,399 --> 02:33:31,730
is that I think that we will have an
opportunity to reevaluate Packaging

8898
02:33:31,730 --> 02:33:31,740
opportunity to reevaluate Packaging
 

8899
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:33,349
opportunity to reevaluate Packaging
right and so I think that we can come

8900
02:33:33,349 --> 02:33:33,359
right and so I think that we can come
 

8901
02:33:33,359 --> 02:33:35,389
right and so I think that we can come
back and say okay well given the new

8902
02:33:35,389 --> 02:33:35,399
back and say okay well given the new
 

8903
02:33:35,399 --> 02:33:36,770
back and say okay well given the new
tools and Technologies and the cool

8904
02:33:36,770 --> 02:33:36,780
tools and Technologies and the cool
 

8905
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:38,030
tools and Technologies and the cool
things we have that we've built up

8906
02:33:38,030 --> 02:33:38,040
things we have that we've built up
 

8907
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:40,250
things we have that we've built up
because we have not just syntax we have

8908
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:40,260
because we have not just syntax we have
 

8909
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:41,750
because we have not just syntax we have
an entirely new compiler stack that

8910
02:33:41,750 --> 02:33:41,760
an entirely new compiler stack that
 

8911
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:43,849
an entirely new compiler stack that
works in a new way maybe there's other

8912
02:33:43,849 --> 02:33:43,859
works in a new way maybe there's other
 

8913
02:33:43,859 --> 02:33:45,230
works in a new way maybe there's other
Innovations we can bring together and

8914
02:33:45,230 --> 02:33:45,240
Innovations we can bring together and
 

8915
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:47,270
Innovations we can bring together and
maybe we can help solve that problem so

8916
02:33:47,270 --> 02:33:47,280
maybe we can help solve that problem so
 

8917
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:49,010
maybe we can help solve that problem so
almost a tangent to that question from

8918
02:33:49,010 --> 02:33:49,020
almost a tangent to that question from
 

8919
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:51,770
almost a tangent to that question from
the user perspective of packages

8920
02:33:51,770 --> 02:33:51,780
the user perspective of packages
 

8921
02:33:51,780 --> 02:33:54,130
the user perspective of packages
it was always surprising to me

8922
02:33:54,130 --> 02:33:54,140
it was always surprising to me
 

8923
02:33:54,140 --> 02:33:56,870
it was always surprising to me
that it was not easier to sort of

8924
02:33:56,870 --> 02:33:56,880
that it was not easier to sort of
 

8925
02:33:56,880 --> 02:34:00,650
that it was not easier to sort of
explore and find packages

8926
02:34:00,650 --> 02:34:00,660

 

8927
02:34:00,660 --> 02:34:03,290

you know with with Pip install and it

8928
02:34:03,290 --> 02:34:03,300
you know with with Pip install and it
 

8929
02:34:03,300 --> 02:34:05,450
you know with with Pip install and it
just it feels uh it's an incredible

8930
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:05,460
just it feels uh it's an incredible
 

8931
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:08,870
just it feels uh it's an incredible
ecosystem it's just uh interesting that

8932
02:34:08,870 --> 02:34:08,880
ecosystem it's just uh interesting that
 

8933
02:34:08,880 --> 02:34:11,210
ecosystem it's just uh interesting that
it wasn't made it's still I think not

8934
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:11,220
it wasn't made it's still I think not
 

8935
02:34:11,220 --> 02:34:13,309
it wasn't made it's still I think not
made easier to discover packages to do

8936
02:34:13,309 --> 02:34:13,319
made easier to discover packages to do
 

8937
02:34:13,319 --> 02:34:15,550
made easier to discover packages to do
yeah like uh

8938
02:34:15,550 --> 02:34:15,560
yeah like uh
 

8939
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:19,730
yeah like uh
uh search and Discovery as YouTube calls

8940
02:34:19,730 --> 02:34:19,740
uh search and Discovery as YouTube calls
 

8941
02:34:19,740 --> 02:34:21,230
uh search and Discovery as YouTube calls
it well I mean it's kind of funny

8942
02:34:21,230 --> 02:34:21,240
it well I mean it's kind of funny
 

8943
02:34:21,240 --> 02:34:23,150
it well I mean it's kind of funny
because this is one of the challenges of

8944
02:34:23,150 --> 02:34:23,160
because this is one of the challenges of
 

8945
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:24,370
because this is one of the challenges of
these like

8946
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:24,380
these like
 

8947
02:34:24,380 --> 02:34:26,690
these like
intentionally decentralized communities

8948
02:34:26,690 --> 02:34:26,700
intentionally decentralized communities
 

8949
02:34:26,700 --> 02:34:28,550
intentionally decentralized communities
and so I don't know what the right

8950
02:34:28,550 --> 02:34:28,560
and so I don't know what the right
 

8951
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:30,349
and so I don't know what the right
answer is for python I mean there are

8952
02:34:30,349 --> 02:34:30,359
answer is for python I mean there are
 

8953
02:34:30,359 --> 02:34:31,730
answer is for python I mean there are
many people that

8954
02:34:31,730 --> 02:34:31,740
many people that
 

8955
02:34:31,740 --> 02:34:33,410
many people that
or I don't even know the right answer

8956
02:34:33,410 --> 02:34:33,420
or I don't even know the right answer
 

8957
02:34:33,420 --> 02:34:34,969
or I don't even know the right answer
for Mojo

8958
02:34:34,969 --> 02:34:34,979
for Mojo
 

8959
02:34:34,979 --> 02:34:37,250
for Mojo
so there are many people that would have

8960
02:34:37,250 --> 02:34:37,260
so there are many people that would have
 

8961
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:38,630
so there are many people that would have
much more informed opinions than I do

8962
02:34:38,630 --> 02:34:38,640
much more informed opinions than I do
 

8963
02:34:38,640 --> 02:34:40,250
much more informed opinions than I do
but but it's interesting if you look at

8964
02:34:40,250 --> 02:34:40,260
but but it's interesting if you look at
 

8965
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:42,830
but but it's interesting if you look at
this right open source communities

8966
02:34:42,830 --> 02:34:42,840
this right open source communities
 

8967
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:45,230
this right open source communities
um you know there's git git is a fully

8968
02:34:45,230 --> 02:34:45,240
um you know there's git git is a fully
 

8969
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:46,910
um you know there's git git is a fully
decentralized anybody could do it any

8970
02:34:46,910 --> 02:34:46,920
decentralized anybody could do it any
 

8971
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:49,070
decentralized anybody could do it any
way they want but then there's GitHub

8972
02:34:49,070 --> 02:34:49,080
way they want but then there's GitHub
 

8973
02:34:49,080 --> 02:34:51,889
way they want but then there's GitHub
right and GitHub centralized commercial

8974
02:34:51,889 --> 02:34:51,899
right and GitHub centralized commercial
 

8975
02:34:51,899 --> 02:34:54,950
right and GitHub centralized commercial
in that case right thing uh really help

8976
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:54,960
in that case right thing uh really help
 

8977
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:56,389
in that case right thing uh really help
pull together and help solve some of the

8978
02:34:56,389 --> 02:34:56,399
pull together and help solve some of the
 

8979
02:34:56,399 --> 02:34:58,990
pull together and help solve some of the
discovery problems and help build a more

8980
02:34:58,990 --> 02:34:59,000
discovery problems and help build a more
 

8981
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,950
discovery problems and help build a more
consistent community and so maybe

8982
02:35:00,950 --> 02:35:00,960
consistent community and so maybe
 

8983
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:02,809
consistent community and so maybe
there's opportunities for something like

8984
02:35:02,809 --> 02:35:02,819
there's opportunities for something like
 

8985
02:35:02,819 --> 02:35:05,870
there's opportunities for something like
a GitHub yeah although even GitHub I

8986
02:35:05,870 --> 02:35:05,880
a GitHub yeah although even GitHub I
 

8987
02:35:05,880 --> 02:35:07,429
a GitHub yeah although even GitHub I
might be wrong on this but the search

8988
02:35:07,429 --> 02:35:07,439
might be wrong on this but the search
 

8989
02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:09,710
might be wrong on this but the search
and Discovery for GitHub is not that

8990
02:35:09,710 --> 02:35:09,720
and Discovery for GitHub is not that
 

8991
02:35:09,720 --> 02:35:13,010
and Discovery for GitHub is not that
great like I still use Google Search

8992
02:35:13,010 --> 02:35:13,020
great like I still use Google Search
 

8993
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:15,290
great like I still use Google Search
yeah well I mean make it maybe that's

8994
02:35:15,290 --> 02:35:15,300
yeah well I mean make it maybe that's
 

8995
02:35:15,300 --> 02:35:16,370
yeah well I mean make it maybe that's
because GitHub doesn't want to replace

8996
02:35:16,370 --> 02:35:16,380
because GitHub doesn't want to replace
 

8997
02:35:16,380 --> 02:35:19,610
because GitHub doesn't want to replace
Google Search right and I think there is

8998
02:35:19,610 --> 02:35:19,620
Google Search right and I think there is
 

8999
02:35:19,620 --> 02:35:21,830
Google Search right and I think there is
room for specialized solutions to

9000
02:35:21,830 --> 02:35:21,840
room for specialized solutions to
 

9001
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:23,809
room for specialized solutions to
specific problems but sure I don't know

9002
02:35:23,809 --> 02:35:23,819
specific problems but sure I don't know
 

9003
02:35:23,819 --> 02:35:25,070
specific problems but sure I don't know
I don't know the right answer for GitHub

9004
02:35:25,070 --> 02:35:25,080
I don't know the right answer for GitHub
 

9005
02:35:25,080 --> 02:35:27,469
I don't know the right answer for GitHub
either that's I think they can go figure

9006
02:35:27,469 --> 02:35:27,479
either that's I think they can go figure
 

9007
02:35:27,479 --> 02:35:30,110
either that's I think they can go figure
that out but the point is to have an

9008
02:35:30,110 --> 02:35:30,120
that out but the point is to have an
 

9009
02:35:30,120 --> 02:35:31,309
that out but the point is to have an
interface that's usable that's

9010
02:35:31,309 --> 02:35:31,319
interface that's usable that's
 

9011
02:35:31,319 --> 02:35:32,630
interface that's usable that's
accessible to people of all different

9012
02:35:32,630 --> 02:35:32,640
accessible to people of all different
 

9013
02:35:32,640 --> 02:35:34,670
accessible to people of all different
skill levels well well and again like

9014
02:35:34,670 --> 02:35:34,680
skill levels well well and again like
 

9015
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:36,050
skill levels well well and again like
what what are the benefit of Standards

9016
02:35:36,050 --> 02:35:36,060
what what are the benefit of Standards
 

9017
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:37,910
what what are the benefit of Standards
right standards allow you to build these

9018
02:35:37,910 --> 02:35:37,920
right standards allow you to build these
 

9019
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:40,250
right standards allow you to build these
next level up ecosystem next level of

9020
02:35:40,250 --> 02:35:40,260
next level up ecosystem next level of
 

9021
02:35:40,260 --> 02:35:42,050
next level up ecosystem next level of
infrastructure or next level of things

9022
02:35:42,050 --> 02:35:42,060
infrastructure or next level of things
 

9023
02:35:42,060 --> 02:35:43,490
infrastructure or next level of things
and so

9024
02:35:43,490 --> 02:35:43,500
and so
 

9025
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:46,150
and so
um again come back to I hate complexity

9026
02:35:46,150 --> 02:35:46,160
um again come back to I hate complexity
 

9027
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:49,670
um again come back to I hate complexity
see C plus python is complicated it

9028
02:35:49,670 --> 02:35:49,680
see C plus python is complicated it
 

9029
02:35:49,680 --> 02:35:51,170
see C plus python is complicated it
makes everything more difficult to deal

9030
02:35:51,170 --> 02:35:51,180
makes everything more difficult to deal
 

9031
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:52,969
makes everything more difficult to deal
with it makes it difficult to Port move

9032
02:35:52,969 --> 02:35:52,979
with it makes it difficult to Port move
 

9033
02:35:52,979 --> 02:35:55,309
with it makes it difficult to Port move
code around work with all these things

9034
02:35:55,309 --> 02:35:55,319
code around work with all these things
 

9035
02:35:55,319 --> 02:35:57,830
code around work with all these things
get more complicated and so I mean I'm

9036
02:35:57,830 --> 02:35:57,840
get more complicated and so I mean I'm
 

9037
02:35:57,840 --> 02:35:59,630
get more complicated and so I mean I'm
not an expert but maybe Mojo can help a

9038
02:35:59,630 --> 02:35:59,640
not an expert but maybe Mojo can help a
 

9039
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:01,550
not an expert but maybe Mojo can help a
little bit by helping reduce the amount

9040
02:36:01,550 --> 02:36:01,560
little bit by helping reduce the amount
 

9041
02:36:01,560 --> 02:36:03,290
little bit by helping reduce the amount
of C in this ecosystem and make it

9042
02:36:03,290 --> 02:36:03,300
of C in this ecosystem and make it
 

9043
02:36:03,300 --> 02:36:04,610
of C in this ecosystem and make it
therefore scale better so any kind of

9044
02:36:04,610 --> 02:36:04,620
therefore scale better so any kind of
 

9045
02:36:04,620 --> 02:36:07,429
therefore scale better so any kind of
packages that are hybrid in nature would

9046
02:36:07,429 --> 02:36:07,439
packages that are hybrid in nature would
 

9047
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:09,770
packages that are hybrid in nature would
be a natural fit to move to Mojo which

9048
02:36:09,770 --> 02:36:09,780
be a natural fit to move to Mojo which
 

9049
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:12,290
be a natural fit to move to Mojo which
is a lot of them by the way yeah

9050
02:36:12,290 --> 02:36:12,300
is a lot of them by the way yeah
 

9051
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:14,090
is a lot of them by the way yeah
a lot of them especially they're doing

9052
02:36:14,090 --> 02:36:14,100
a lot of them especially they're doing
 

9053
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:15,469
a lot of them especially they're doing
some interesting stuff computational

9054
02:36:15,469 --> 02:36:15,479
some interesting stuff computational
 

9055
02:36:15,479 --> 02:36:16,910
some interesting stuff computational
wise

9056
02:36:16,910 --> 02:36:16,920
wise
 

9057
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:19,250
wise
let me ask you about some features yeah

9058
02:36:19,250 --> 02:36:19,260
let me ask you about some features yeah
 

9059
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:21,710
let me ask you about some features yeah
so we talked about obviously the

9060
02:36:21,710 --> 02:36:21,720
so we talked about obviously the
 

9061
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:24,349
so we talked about obviously the
indentation that it's a type language or

9062
02:36:24,349 --> 02:36:24,359
indentation that it's a type language or
 

9063
02:36:24,359 --> 02:36:25,910
indentation that it's a type language or
optionally typed

9064
02:36:25,910 --> 02:36:25,920
optionally typed
 

9065
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:27,530
optionally typed
is that the right way to say it it's

9066
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:27,540
is that the right way to say it it's
 

9067
02:36:27,540 --> 02:36:29,150
is that the right way to say it it's
either optionally or progressively or

9068
02:36:29,150 --> 02:36:29,160
either optionally or progressively or
 

9069
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:31,670
either optionally or progressively or
aggressively I think so so so people

9070
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:31,680
aggressively I think so so so people
 

9071
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:32,929
aggressively I think so so so people
have very strong opinions on the right

9072
02:36:32,929 --> 02:36:32,939
have very strong opinions on the right
 

9073
02:36:32,939 --> 02:36:35,450
have very strong opinions on the right
word to use yeah I don't know I look

9074
02:36:35,450 --> 02:36:35,460
word to use yeah I don't know I look
 

9075
02:36:35,460 --> 02:36:38,330
word to use yeah I don't know I look
forward to your letters uh so there's

9076
02:36:38,330 --> 02:36:38,340
forward to your letters uh so there's
 

9077
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:40,730
forward to your letters uh so there's
the the VAR versus let but let is for

9078
02:36:40,730 --> 02:36:40,740
the the VAR versus let but let is for
 

9079
02:36:40,740 --> 02:36:44,630
the the VAR versus let but let is for
constants uh VAR is an optional uh yeah

9080
02:36:44,630 --> 02:36:44,640
constants uh VAR is an optional uh yeah
 

9081
02:36:44,640 --> 02:36:46,969
constants uh VAR is an optional uh yeah
makes it mutable so you can reassign

9082
02:36:46,969 --> 02:36:46,979
makes it mutable so you can reassign
 

9083
02:36:46,979 --> 02:36:50,750
makes it mutable so you can reassign
okay uh then there's uh

9084
02:36:50,750 --> 02:36:50,760
okay uh then there's uh
 

9085
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:54,770
okay uh then there's uh
function overloading oh okay yeah so I

9086
02:36:54,770 --> 02:36:54,780
function overloading oh okay yeah so I
 

9087
02:36:54,780 --> 02:36:55,849
function overloading oh okay yeah so I
mean there's a lot of source of

9088
02:36:55,849 --> 02:36:55,859
mean there's a lot of source of
 

9089
02:36:55,859 --> 02:36:56,929
mean there's a lot of source of
happiness for me but function

9090
02:36:56,929 --> 02:36:56,939
happiness for me but function
 

9091
02:36:56,939 --> 02:36:58,969
happiness for me but function
overloading that's

9092
02:36:58,969 --> 02:36:58,979
overloading that's
 

9093
02:36:58,979 --> 02:37:02,870
overloading that's
um I guess is that is that for

9094
02:37:02,870 --> 02:37:02,880
um I guess is that is that for
 

9095
02:37:02,880 --> 02:37:04,910
um I guess is that is that for
performance or is that why does python

9096
02:37:04,910 --> 02:37:04,920
performance or is that why does python
 

9097
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:07,070
performance or is that why does python
not have function overloading

9098
02:37:07,070 --> 02:37:07,080
not have function overloading
 

9099
02:37:07,080 --> 02:37:09,650
not have function overloading
so I can speculate so um python is a

9100
02:37:09,650 --> 02:37:09,660
so I can speculate so um python is a
 

9101
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:11,870
so I can speculate so um python is a
dynamic language the way it works is

9102
02:37:11,870 --> 02:37:11,880
dynamic language the way it works is
 

9103
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:13,849
dynamic language the way it works is
that um

9104
02:37:13,849 --> 02:37:13,859
that um
 

9105
02:37:13,859 --> 02:37:16,550
that um
uh python Objective C are actually

9106
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:16,560
uh python Objective C are actually
 

9107
02:37:16,560 --> 02:37:20,450
uh python Objective C are actually
very similar worlds if you ignore syntax

9108
02:37:20,450 --> 02:37:20,460
very similar worlds if you ignore syntax
 

9109
02:37:20,460 --> 02:37:22,130
very similar worlds if you ignore syntax
and so

9110
02:37:22,130 --> 02:37:22,140
and so
 

9111
02:37:22,140 --> 02:37:25,010
and so
uh Objective C is straight line derived

9112
02:37:25,010 --> 02:37:25,020
uh Objective C is straight line derived
 

9113
02:37:25,020 --> 02:37:26,809
uh Objective C is straight line derived
from small talk

9114
02:37:26,809 --> 02:37:26,819
from small talk
 

9115
02:37:26,819 --> 02:37:29,410
from small talk
they're really venerable interesting

9116
02:37:29,410 --> 02:37:29,420
they're really venerable interesting
 

9117
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:31,370
they're really venerable interesting
language that much of the world has

9118
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:31,380
language that much of the world has
 

9119
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:32,570
language that much of the world has
forgotten about but the people that

9120
02:37:32,570 --> 02:37:32,580
forgotten about but the people that
 

9121
02:37:32,580 --> 02:37:35,510
forgotten about but the people that
remember it love it generally and the

9122
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:35,520
remember it love it generally and the
 

9123
02:37:35,520 --> 02:37:37,010
remember it love it generally and the
way that Small Talk Works is that every

9124
02:37:37,010 --> 02:37:37,020
way that Small Talk Works is that every
 

9125
02:37:37,020 --> 02:37:39,590
way that Small Talk Works is that every
object has a dictionary in it and the

9126
02:37:39,590 --> 02:37:39,600
object has a dictionary in it and the
 

9127
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:41,030
object has a dictionary in it and the
dictionary maps from the name of a

9128
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:41,040
dictionary maps from the name of a
 

9129
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:43,010
dictionary maps from the name of a
function or the name of a value within

9130
02:37:43,010 --> 02:37:43,020
function or the name of a value within
 

9131
02:37:43,020 --> 02:37:45,530
function or the name of a value within
an object to its implementation

9132
02:37:45,530 --> 02:37:45,540
an object to its implementation
 

9133
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:47,510
an object to its implementation
and so the way you call a method in

9134
02:37:47,510 --> 02:37:47,520
and so the way you call a method in
 

9135
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:50,450
and so the way you call a method in
Objective C is you say go look up the

9136
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:50,460
Objective C is you say go look up the
 

9137
02:37:50,460 --> 02:37:52,429
Objective C is you say go look up the
way I call Foose I go look up Foo I get

9138
02:37:52,429 --> 02:37:52,439
way I call Foose I go look up Foo I get
 

9139
02:37:52,439 --> 02:37:53,510
way I call Foose I go look up Foo I get
a pointer to the function back and then

9140
02:37:53,510 --> 02:37:53,520
a pointer to the function back and then
 

9141
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:56,570
a pointer to the function back and then
I call it okay that's how python works

9142
02:37:56,570 --> 02:37:56,580
I call it okay that's how python works
 

9143
02:37:56,580 --> 02:37:58,130
I call it okay that's how python works
right and so now the problem with that

9144
02:37:58,130 --> 02:37:58,140
right and so now the problem with that
 

9145
02:37:58,140 --> 02:37:59,270
right and so now the problem with that
is that

9146
02:37:59,270 --> 02:37:59,280
is that
 

9147
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:01,010
is that
the dictionary within a python object

9148
02:38:01,010 --> 02:38:01,020
the dictionary within a python object
 

9149
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:03,469
the dictionary within a python object
all the keys are strings

9150
02:38:03,469 --> 02:38:03,479
all the keys are strings
 

9151
02:38:03,479 --> 02:38:05,330
all the keys are strings
and it's a dictionary yeah so you can

9152
02:38:05,330 --> 02:38:05,340
and it's a dictionary yeah so you can
 

9153
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:07,010
and it's a dictionary yeah so you can
only have one entry per name you think

9154
02:38:07,010 --> 02:38:07,020
only have one entry per name you think
 

9155
02:38:07,020 --> 02:38:08,690
only have one entry per name you think
it's as simple as that I think it's as

9156
02:38:08,690 --> 02:38:08,700
it's as simple as that I think it's as
 

9157
02:38:08,700 --> 02:38:11,630
it's as simple as that I think it's as
simple as that and so now why do they

9158
02:38:11,630 --> 02:38:11,640
simple as that and so now why do they
 

9159
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:13,849
simple as that and so now why do they
never fix this like why do they not

9160
02:38:13,849 --> 02:38:13,859
never fix this like why do they not
 

9161
02:38:13,859 --> 02:38:16,730
never fix this like why do they not
change it to not be a dictionary like do

9162
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:16,740
change it to not be a dictionary like do
 

9163
02:38:16,740 --> 02:38:17,690
change it to not be a dictionary like do
other things

9164
02:38:17,690 --> 02:38:17,700
other things
 

9165
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:20,150
other things
um well you don't really have to in

9166
02:38:20,150 --> 02:38:20,160
um well you don't really have to in
 

9167
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:22,190
um well you don't really have to in
Python because it's Dynamic and so you

9168
02:38:22,190 --> 02:38:22,200
Python because it's Dynamic and so you
 

9169
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:24,950
Python because it's Dynamic and so you
can say I get into the function now if I

9170
02:38:24,950 --> 02:38:24,960
can say I get into the function now if I
 

9171
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:26,690
can say I get into the function now if I
got past an integer do some Dynamic

9172
02:38:26,690 --> 02:38:26,700
got past an integer do some Dynamic
 

9173
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:28,910
got past an integer do some Dynamic
tests for it if it's a string go do

9174
02:38:28,910 --> 02:38:28,920
tests for it if it's a string go do
 

9175
02:38:28,920 --> 02:38:31,250
tests for it if it's a string go do
another thing there's another additional

9176
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:31,260
another thing there's another additional
 

9177
02:38:31,260 --> 02:38:32,630
another thing there's another additional
challenge which is even if you did

9178
02:38:32,630 --> 02:38:32,640
challenge which is even if you did
 

9179
02:38:32,640 --> 02:38:34,190
challenge which is even if you did
support overloading you're saying okay

9180
02:38:34,190 --> 02:38:34,200
support overloading you're saying okay
 

9181
02:38:34,200 --> 02:38:35,929
support overloading you're saying okay
well here's a version of a function for

9182
02:38:35,929 --> 02:38:35,939
well here's a version of a function for
 

9183
02:38:35,939 --> 02:38:38,450
well here's a version of a function for
integers and a function for Strings well

9184
02:38:38,450 --> 02:38:38,460
integers and a function for Strings well
 

9185
02:38:38,460 --> 02:38:39,889
integers and a function for Strings well
you'd have even if you could put it in

9186
02:38:39,889 --> 02:38:39,899
you'd have even if you could put it in
 

9187
02:38:39,899 --> 02:38:41,330
you'd have even if you could put it in
that dictionary you'd have to have the

9188
02:38:41,330 --> 02:38:41,340
that dictionary you'd have to have the
 

9189
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:44,030
that dictionary you'd have to have the
caller do the dispatch and so every time

9190
02:38:44,030 --> 02:38:44,040
caller do the dispatch and so every time
 

9191
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:45,050
caller do the dispatch and so every time
you call the function you'd have to say

9192
02:38:45,050 --> 02:38:45,060
you call the function you'd have to say
 

9193
02:38:45,060 --> 02:38:46,910
you call the function you'd have to say
like is an integer is it a string and so

9194
02:38:46,910 --> 02:38:46,920
like is an integer is it a string and so
 

9195
02:38:46,920 --> 02:38:48,110
like is an integer is it a string and so
you have to figure out where to do that

9196
02:38:48,110 --> 02:38:48,120
you have to figure out where to do that
 

9197
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:51,290
you have to figure out where to do that
test and so in a dynamic language

9198
02:38:51,290 --> 02:38:51,300
test and so in a dynamic language
 

9199
02:38:51,300 --> 02:38:52,730
test and so in a dynamic language
um overloading is something you

9200
02:38:52,730 --> 02:38:52,740
um overloading is something you
 

9201
02:38:52,740 --> 02:38:55,969
um overloading is something you
generally you don't have to have so

9202
02:38:55,969 --> 02:38:55,979
generally you don't have to have so
 

9203
02:38:55,979 --> 02:38:58,550
generally you don't have to have so
but now you get into a type language and

9204
02:38:58,550 --> 02:38:58,560
but now you get into a type language and
 

9205
02:38:58,560 --> 02:39:01,309
but now you get into a type language and
you know in Python if you subscript with

9206
02:39:01,309 --> 02:39:01,319
you know in Python if you subscript with
 

9207
02:39:01,319 --> 02:39:02,570
you know in Python if you subscript with
an integer

9208
02:39:02,570 --> 02:39:02,580
an integer
 

9209
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:05,270
an integer
then you get typically one element out

9210
02:39:05,270 --> 02:39:05,280
then you get typically one element out
 

9211
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:07,429
then you get typically one element out
of a collection if you subscript with a

9212
02:39:07,429 --> 02:39:07,439
of a collection if you subscript with a
 

9213
02:39:07,439 --> 02:39:09,590
of a collection if you subscript with a
range you get a different thing out

9214
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:09,600
range you get a different thing out
 

9215
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:12,230
range you get a different thing out
right and so often in type languages

9216
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:12,240
right and so often in type languages
 

9217
02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:13,550
right and so often in type languages
you'll want to be able to express the

9218
02:39:13,550 --> 02:39:13,560
you'll want to be able to express the
 

9219
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:16,370
you'll want to be able to express the
fact that cool I have different Behavior

9220
02:39:16,370 --> 02:39:16,380
fact that cool I have different Behavior
 

9221
02:39:16,380 --> 02:39:18,349
fact that cool I have different Behavior
depending on what I actually pass into

9222
02:39:18,349 --> 02:39:18,359
depending on what I actually pass into
 

9223
02:39:18,359 --> 02:39:20,150
depending on what I actually pass into
this thing if you can model that it can

9224
02:39:20,150 --> 02:39:20,160
this thing if you can model that it can
 

9225
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:21,710
this thing if you can model that it can
make it safer and more predictable and

9226
02:39:21,710 --> 02:39:21,720
make it safer and more predictable and
 

9227
02:39:21,720 --> 02:39:24,170
make it safer and more predictable and
faster and like all these things it

9228
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:24,180
faster and like all these things it
 

9229
02:39:24,180 --> 02:39:27,170
faster and like all these things it
somehow feels safer yes but also feels

9230
02:39:27,170 --> 02:39:27,180
somehow feels safer yes but also feels
 

9231
02:39:27,180 --> 02:39:29,870
somehow feels safer yes but also feels
empowering like in terms of clarity like

9232
02:39:29,870 --> 02:39:29,880
empowering like in terms of clarity like
 

9233
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:31,790
empowering like in terms of clarity like
you don't have to design hold different

9234
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:31,800
you don't have to design hold different
 

9235
02:39:31,800 --> 02:39:33,950
you don't have to design hold different
functions yeah well this is also one of

9236
02:39:33,950 --> 02:39:33,960
functions yeah well this is also one of
 

9237
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:36,290
functions yeah well this is also one of
the the challenges with the existing

9238
02:39:36,290 --> 02:39:36,300
the the challenges with the existing
 

9239
02:39:36,300 --> 02:39:39,830
the the challenges with the existing
python typing systems is that in

9240
02:39:39,830 --> 02:39:39,840
python typing systems is that in
 

9241
02:39:39,840 --> 02:39:41,809
python typing systems is that in
practice like you take subscript like in

9242
02:39:41,809 --> 02:39:41,819
practice like you take subscript like in
 

9243
02:39:41,819 --> 02:39:43,670
practice like you take subscript like in
practice a lot of these functions they

9244
02:39:43,670 --> 02:39:43,680
practice a lot of these functions they
 

9245
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:46,010
practice a lot of these functions they
don't have one signature right they

9246
02:39:46,010 --> 02:39:46,020
don't have one signature right they
 

9247
02:39:46,020 --> 02:39:47,090
don't have one signature right they
actually have different behavior in

9248
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:47,100
actually have different behavior in
 

9249
02:39:47,100 --> 02:39:49,190
actually have different behavior in
different cases and so this is why it's

9250
02:39:49,190 --> 02:39:49,200
different cases and so this is why it's
 

9251
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:50,990
different cases and so this is why it's
difficult to like retrofit this into

9252
02:39:50,990 --> 02:39:51,000
difficult to like retrofit this into
 

9253
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,270
difficult to like retrofit this into
existing python code and make it

9254
02:39:53,270 --> 02:39:53,280
existing python code and make it
 

9255
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:56,270
existing python code and make it
uh play well with typing you kind of

9256
02:39:56,270 --> 02:39:56,280
uh play well with typing you kind of
 

9257
02:39:56,280 --> 02:39:58,250
uh play well with typing you kind of
have to design for that okay so there's

9258
02:39:58,250 --> 02:39:58,260
have to design for that okay so there's
 

9259
02:39:58,260 --> 02:40:00,230
have to design for that okay so there's
a interesting distinction

9260
02:40:00,230 --> 02:40:00,240
a interesting distinction
 

9261
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:02,270
a interesting distinction
that people the program python might be

9262
02:40:02,270 --> 02:40:02,280
that people the program python might be
 

9263
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:05,450
that people the program python might be
interested in is def versus FN

9264
02:40:05,450 --> 02:40:05,460
interested in is def versus FN
 

9265
02:40:05,460 --> 02:40:07,429
interested in is def versus FN
so it's two different ways to define a

9266
02:40:07,429 --> 02:40:07,439
so it's two different ways to define a
 

9267
02:40:07,439 --> 02:40:08,270
so it's two different ways to define a
function

9268
02:40:08,270 --> 02:40:08,280
function
 

9269
02:40:08,280 --> 02:40:13,130
function
yeah and uh FN is uh a stricter version

9270
02:40:13,130 --> 02:40:13,140
yeah and uh FN is uh a stricter version
 

9271
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:15,110
yeah and uh FN is uh a stricter version
of death what's the coolness that comes

9272
02:40:15,110 --> 02:40:15,120
of death what's the coolness that comes
 

9273
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:17,510
of death what's the coolness that comes
from the strictness so here you get into

9274
02:40:17,510 --> 02:40:17,520
from the strictness so here you get into
 

9275
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:19,370
from the strictness so here you get into
what is the trade-off with the superset

9276
02:40:19,370 --> 02:40:19,380
what is the trade-off with the superset
 

9277
02:40:19,380 --> 02:40:23,690
what is the trade-off with the superset
yes okay so superset you have to or you

9278
02:40:23,690 --> 02:40:23,700
yes okay so superset you have to or you
 

9279
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:26,030
yes okay so superset you have to or you
really want to be compatible if like if

9280
02:40:26,030 --> 02:40:26,040
really want to be compatible if like if
 

9281
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:28,010
really want to be compatible if like if
you're doing a superset you've decided

9282
02:40:28,010 --> 02:40:28,020
you're doing a superset you've decided
 

9283
02:40:28,020 --> 02:40:30,590
you're doing a superset you've decided
compatibility with existing code is the

9284
02:40:30,590 --> 02:40:30,600
compatibility with existing code is the
 

9285
02:40:30,600 --> 02:40:32,450
compatibility with existing code is the
important thing even if some of the

9286
02:40:32,450 --> 02:40:32,460
important thing even if some of the
 

9287
02:40:32,460 --> 02:40:33,889
important thing even if some of the
decisions they made were maybe not what

9288
02:40:33,889 --> 02:40:33,899
decisions they made were maybe not what
 

9289
02:40:33,899 --> 02:40:36,770
decisions they made were maybe not what
you choose yeah okay so that means you

9290
02:40:36,770 --> 02:40:36,780
you choose yeah okay so that means you
 

9291
02:40:36,780 --> 02:40:38,690
you choose yeah okay so that means you
put a lot of time into compatibility and

9292
02:40:38,690 --> 02:40:38,700
put a lot of time into compatibility and
 

9293
02:40:38,700 --> 02:40:39,889
put a lot of time into compatibility and
it means that you get locked into

9294
02:40:39,889 --> 02:40:39,899
it means that you get locked into
 

9295
02:40:39,899 --> 02:40:41,809
it means that you get locked into
decisions of the past

9296
02:40:41,809 --> 02:40:41,819
decisions of the past
 

9297
02:40:41,819 --> 02:40:43,790
decisions of the past
even if they may not have been a good

9298
02:40:43,790 --> 02:40:43,800
even if they may not have been a good
 

9299
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:46,370
even if they may not have been a good
thing right now systems programmers

9300
02:40:46,370 --> 02:40:46,380
thing right now systems programmers
 

9301
02:40:46,380 --> 02:40:49,250
thing right now systems programmers
typically like to control things right

9302
02:40:49,250 --> 02:40:49,260
typically like to control things right
 

9303
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:51,170
typically like to control things right
and they want to make sure that you know

9304
02:40:51,170 --> 02:40:51,180
and they want to make sure that you know
 

9305
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:53,090
and they want to make sure that you know
not not all cases of course and no and

9306
02:40:53,090 --> 02:40:53,100
not not all cases of course and no and
 

9307
02:40:53,100 --> 02:40:54,710
not not all cases of course and no and
even systems programmers are not one

9308
02:40:54,710 --> 02:40:54,720
even systems programmers are not one
 

9309
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:56,630
even systems programmers are not one
thing right but but often you want

9310
02:40:56,630 --> 02:40:56,640
thing right but but often you want
 

9311
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:58,610
thing right but but often you want
predictability and so one of one of the

9312
02:40:58,610 --> 02:40:58,620
predictability and so one of one of the
 

9313
02:40:58,620 --> 02:41:00,590
predictability and so one of one of the
things that python has for example as

9314
02:41:00,590 --> 02:41:00,600
things that python has for example as
 

9315
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:02,330
things that python has for example as
you know is that if you find a variable

9316
02:41:02,330 --> 02:41:02,340
you know is that if you find a variable
 

9317
02:41:02,340 --> 02:41:04,550
you know is that if you find a variable
you just say x equals four I have a

9318
02:41:04,550 --> 02:41:04,560
you just say x equals four I have a
 

9319
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:06,590
you just say x equals four I have a
variable name to X

9320
02:41:06,590 --> 02:41:06,600
variable name to X
 

9321
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:08,870
variable name to X
now I say some long method some some

9322
02:41:08,870 --> 02:41:08,880
now I say some long method some some
 

9323
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:11,270
now I say some long method some some
long name equals 17.

9324
02:41:11,270 --> 02:41:11,280
long name equals 17.
 

9325
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:13,309
long name equals 17.
print out some long name

9326
02:41:13,309 --> 02:41:13,319
print out some long name
 

9327
02:41:13,319 --> 02:41:16,070
print out some long name
oops but I typoed it right well the

9328
02:41:16,070 --> 02:41:16,080
oops but I typoed it right well the
 

9329
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:17,690
oops but I typoed it right well the
compiler the python compiler doesn't

9330
02:41:17,690 --> 02:41:17,700
compiler the python compiler doesn't
 

9331
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:20,389
compiler the python compiler doesn't
know in all cases what you're defining

9332
02:41:20,389 --> 02:41:20,399
know in all cases what you're defining
 

9333
02:41:20,399 --> 02:41:22,610
know in all cases what you're defining
what you're using and did you typo the

9334
02:41:22,610 --> 02:41:22,620
what you're using and did you typo the
 

9335
02:41:22,620 --> 02:41:25,849
what you're using and did you typo the
use of it or the definition right and so

9336
02:41:25,849 --> 02:41:25,859
use of it or the definition right and so
 

9337
02:41:25,859 --> 02:41:28,030
use of it or the definition right and so
for people coming from type languages

9338
02:41:28,030 --> 02:41:28,040
for people coming from type languages
 

9339
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:30,110
for people coming from type languages
again I'm not saying they're right or

9340
02:41:30,110 --> 02:41:30,120
again I'm not saying they're right or
 

9341
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:31,969
again I'm not saying they're right or
wrong but that drives them crazy because

9342
02:41:31,969 --> 02:41:31,979
wrong but that drives them crazy because
 

9343
02:41:31,979 --> 02:41:33,410
wrong but that drives them crazy because
they want the compiler to tell them you

9344
02:41:33,410 --> 02:41:33,420
they want the compiler to tell them you
 

9345
02:41:33,420 --> 02:41:35,750
they want the compiler to tell them you
typo the name of this thing right and so

9346
02:41:35,750 --> 02:41:35,760
typo the name of this thing right and so
 

9347
02:41:35,760 --> 02:41:37,790
typo the name of this thing right and so
what FN does is it turns on as you say

9348
02:41:37,790 --> 02:41:37,800
what FN does is it turns on as you say
 

9349
02:41:37,800 --> 02:41:39,530
what FN does is it turns on as you say
it's a strict mode and so it says okay

9350
02:41:39,530 --> 02:41:39,540
it's a strict mode and so it says okay
 

9351
02:41:39,540 --> 02:41:41,330
it's a strict mode and so it says okay
well you have to actually declare

9352
02:41:41,330 --> 02:41:41,340
well you have to actually declare
 

9353
02:41:41,340 --> 02:41:42,590
well you have to actually declare
intentionally declare your variables

9354
02:41:42,590 --> 02:41:42,600
intentionally declare your variables
 

9355
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:44,270
intentionally declare your variables
before you use them that gives you more

9356
02:41:44,270 --> 02:41:44,280
before you use them that gives you more
 

9357
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:46,849
before you use them that gives you more
predictability more error checking and

9358
02:41:46,849 --> 02:41:46,859
predictability more error checking and
 

9359
02:41:46,859 --> 02:41:49,070
predictability more error checking and
things like this but you don't have to

9360
02:41:49,070 --> 02:41:49,080
things like this but you don't have to
 

9361
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:52,670
things like this but you don't have to
uh you don't have to use it and this is

9362
02:41:52,670 --> 02:41:52,680
uh you don't have to use it and this is
 

9363
02:41:52,680 --> 02:41:55,070
uh you don't have to use it and this is
a way that Mojo is both compatible

9364
02:41:55,070 --> 02:41:55,080
a way that Mojo is both compatible
 

9365
02:41:55,080 --> 02:41:56,450
a way that Mojo is both compatible
because deaths work the same way that

9366
02:41:56,450 --> 02:41:56,460
because deaths work the same way that
 

9367
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:58,550
because deaths work the same way that
deaths have already always worked but it

9368
02:41:58,550 --> 02:41:58,560
deaths have already always worked but it
 

9369
02:41:58,560 --> 02:41:59,809
deaths have already always worked but it
provides a new alternative that gives

9370
02:41:59,809 --> 02:41:59,819
provides a new alternative that gives
 

9371
02:41:59,819 --> 02:42:01,610
provides a new alternative that gives
you more control and allows certain

9372
02:42:01,610 --> 02:42:01,620
you more control and allows certain
 

9373
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:02,750
you more control and allows certain
kinds of people that have a different

9374
02:42:02,750 --> 02:42:02,760
kinds of people that have a different
 

9375
02:42:02,760 --> 02:42:04,130
kinds of people that have a different
philosophy to be able to express that

9376
02:42:04,130 --> 02:42:04,140
philosophy to be able to express that
 

9377
02:42:04,140 --> 02:42:07,250
philosophy to be able to express that
and get that but usually if you're

9378
02:42:07,250 --> 02:42:07,260
and get that but usually if you're
 

9379
02:42:07,260 --> 02:42:09,290
and get that but usually if you're
writing Mojo code from scratch you'll be

9380
02:42:09,290 --> 02:42:09,300
writing Mojo code from scratch you'll be
 

9381
02:42:09,300 --> 02:42:10,670
writing Mojo code from scratch you'll be
using FN

9382
02:42:10,670 --> 02:42:10,680
using FN
 

9383
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:12,590
using FN
it depends again it depends on your

9384
02:42:12,590 --> 02:42:12,600
it depends again it depends on your
 

9385
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:14,570
it depends again it depends on your
mentality right it's not it's not the

9386
02:42:14,570 --> 02:42:14,580
mentality right it's not it's not the
 

9387
02:42:14,580 --> 02:42:18,469
mentality right it's not it's not the
deafest python and FN is Mojo Mojo has

9388
02:42:18,469 --> 02:42:18,479
deafest python and FN is Mojo Mojo has
 

9389
02:42:18,479 --> 02:42:20,090
deafest python and FN is Mojo Mojo has
both and it loves both right it really

9390
02:42:20,090 --> 02:42:20,100
both and it loves both right it really
 

9391
02:42:20,100 --> 02:42:22,309
both and it loves both right it really
depends on it's just strict yeah exactly

9392
02:42:22,309 --> 02:42:22,319
depends on it's just strict yeah exactly
 

9393
02:42:22,319 --> 02:42:24,230
depends on it's just strict yeah exactly
do you are you playing around and

9394
02:42:24,230 --> 02:42:24,240
do you are you playing around and
 

9395
02:42:24,240 --> 02:42:26,030
do you are you playing around and
scripting something out is it a one-off

9396
02:42:26,030 --> 02:42:26,040
scripting something out is it a one-off
 

9397
02:42:26,040 --> 02:42:28,730
scripting something out is it a one-off
throwaway script cool like python is

9398
02:42:28,730 --> 02:42:28,740
throwaway script cool like python is
 

9399
02:42:28,740 --> 02:42:30,290
throwaway script cool like python is
great at that I'll still be using

9400
02:42:30,290 --> 02:42:30,300
great at that I'll still be using
 

9401
02:42:30,300 --> 02:42:32,510
great at that I'll still be using
nothing but yeah well so I I love

9402
02:42:32,510 --> 02:42:32,520
nothing but yeah well so I I love
 

9403
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:35,630
nothing but yeah well so I I love
strickness okay well so control Power

9404
02:42:35,630 --> 02:42:35,640
strickness okay well so control Power
 

9405
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:39,469
strickness okay well so control Power
you also like suffering right yes go

9406
02:42:39,469 --> 02:42:39,479
you also like suffering right yes go
 

9407
02:42:39,479 --> 02:42:42,530
you also like suffering right yes go
hand in hand how many how many pull-ups

9408
02:42:42,530 --> 02:42:42,540
hand in hand how many how many pull-ups
 

9409
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:45,770
hand in hand how many how many pull-ups
I have lost count at this yeah at this

9410
02:42:45,770 --> 02:42:45,780
I have lost count at this yeah at this
 

9411
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:47,570
I have lost count at this yeah at this
point so I mean that's cool I love you

9412
02:42:47,570 --> 02:42:47,580
point so I mean that's cool I love you
 

9413
02:42:47,580 --> 02:42:49,130
point so I mean that's cool I love you
for that yeah some and I love other

9414
02:42:49,130 --> 02:42:49,140
for that yeah some and I love other
 

9415
02:42:49,140 --> 02:42:51,110
for that yeah some and I love other
people like strict things right but but

9416
02:42:51,110 --> 02:42:51,120
people like strict things right but but
 

9417
02:42:51,120 --> 02:42:53,090
people like strict things right but but
I don't want to say that that's the

9418
02:42:53,090 --> 02:42:53,100
I don't want to say that that's the
 

9419
02:42:53,100 --> 02:42:54,950
I don't want to say that that's the
right thing because Python's also very

9420
02:42:54,950 --> 02:42:54,960
right thing because Python's also very
 

9421
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:56,330
right thing because Python's also very
beautiful for hacking around and doing

9422
02:42:56,330 --> 02:42:56,340
beautiful for hacking around and doing
 

9423
02:42:56,340 --> 02:42:58,429
beautiful for hacking around and doing
stuff and research and these other cases

9424
02:42:58,429 --> 02:42:58,439
stuff and research and these other cases
 

9425
02:42:58,439 --> 02:43:00,170
stuff and research and these other cases
where you may not want that you see I

9426
02:43:00,170 --> 02:43:00,180
where you may not want that you see I
 

9427
02:43:00,180 --> 02:43:01,309
where you may not want that you see I
just feel like

9428
02:43:01,309 --> 02:43:01,319
just feel like
 

9429
02:43:01,319 --> 02:43:02,990
just feel like
uh maybe I'm wrong with that but it

9430
02:43:02,990 --> 02:43:03,000
uh maybe I'm wrong with that but it
 

9431
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,790
uh maybe I'm wrong with that but it
feels like strictness leads to faster

9432
02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:04,800
feels like strictness leads to faster
 

9433
02:43:04,800 --> 02:43:07,730
feels like strictness leads to faster
debugging so in terms of going from

9434
02:43:07,730 --> 02:43:07,740
debugging so in terms of going from
 

9435
02:43:07,740 --> 02:43:10,190
debugging so in terms of going from
even on a small project from zero to

9436
02:43:10,190 --> 02:43:10,200
even on a small project from zero to
 

9437
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:12,950
even on a small project from zero to
completion it's just I guess it depends

9438
02:43:12,950 --> 02:43:12,960
completion it's just I guess it depends
 

9439
02:43:12,960 --> 02:43:15,230
completion it's just I guess it depends
how many bugs you generate usually well

9440
02:43:15,230 --> 02:43:15,240
how many bugs you generate usually well
 

9441
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:17,150
how many bugs you generate usually well
so I mean if it's again Lessons Learned

9442
02:43:17,150 --> 02:43:17,160
so I mean if it's again Lessons Learned
 

9443
02:43:17,160 --> 02:43:19,309
so I mean if it's again Lessons Learned
in looking at the ecosystem it's really

9444
02:43:19,309 --> 02:43:19,319
in looking at the ecosystem it's really
 

9445
02:43:19,319 --> 02:43:20,570
in looking at the ecosystem it's really
I mean I think it's

9446
02:43:20,570 --> 02:43:20,580
I mean I think it's
 

9447
02:43:20,580 --> 02:43:22,190
I mean I think it's
if you study some of these languages

9448
02:43:22,190 --> 02:43:22,200
if you study some of these languages
 

9449
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:24,590
if you study some of these languages
over time like the Ruby Community for

9450
02:43:24,590 --> 02:43:24,600
over time like the Ruby Community for
 

9451
02:43:24,600 --> 02:43:26,750
over time like the Ruby Community for
example now Ruby is a pretty well

9452
02:43:26,750 --> 02:43:26,760
example now Ruby is a pretty well
 

9453
02:43:26,760 --> 02:43:28,130
example now Ruby is a pretty well
developed pretty established Community

9454
02:43:28,130 --> 02:43:28,140
developed pretty established Community
 

9455
02:43:28,140 --> 02:43:30,170
developed pretty established Community
but along their path they really

9456
02:43:30,170 --> 02:43:30,180
but along their path they really
 

9457
02:43:30,180 --> 02:43:31,969
but along their path they really
invested in unit testing

9458
02:43:31,969 --> 02:43:31,979
invested in unit testing
 

9459
02:43:31,979 --> 02:43:33,410
invested in unit testing
like so I think that the Ruby Community

9460
02:43:33,410 --> 02:43:33,420
like so I think that the Ruby Community
 

9461
02:43:33,420 --> 02:43:35,929
like so I think that the Ruby Community
is really pushed forward the state of

9462
02:43:35,929 --> 02:43:35,939
is really pushed forward the state of
 

9463
02:43:35,939 --> 02:43:37,969
is really pushed forward the state of
the art of testing because they didn't

9464
02:43:37,969 --> 02:43:37,979
the art of testing because they didn't
 

9465
02:43:37,979 --> 02:43:39,710
the art of testing because they didn't
have a type system that caught a lot of

9466
02:43:39,710 --> 02:43:39,720
have a type system that caught a lot of
 

9467
02:43:39,720 --> 02:43:42,469
have a type system that caught a lot of
bugs at compel time right and so you can

9468
02:43:42,469 --> 02:43:42,479
bugs at compel time right and so you can
 

9469
02:43:42,479 --> 02:43:43,490
bugs at compel time right and so you can
have the best of both worlds you can

9470
02:43:43,490 --> 02:43:43,500
have the best of both worlds you can
 

9471
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:44,929
have the best of both worlds you can
have good testing and good types right

9472
02:43:44,929 --> 02:43:44,939
have good testing and good types right
 

9473
02:43:44,939 --> 02:43:46,610
have good testing and good types right
and things like this but but I thought

9474
02:43:46,610 --> 02:43:46,620
and things like this but but I thought
 

9475
02:43:46,620 --> 02:43:47,990
and things like this but but I thought
that that it was really interesting to

9476
02:43:47,990 --> 02:43:48,000
that that it was really interesting to
 

9477
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,969
that that it was really interesting to
see how certain challenges get solved

9478
02:43:49,969 --> 02:43:49,979
see how certain challenges get solved
 

9479
02:43:49,979 --> 02:43:51,830
see how certain challenges get solved
and in Python for example

9480
02:43:51,830 --> 02:43:51,840
and in Python for example
 

9481
02:43:51,840 --> 02:43:53,510
and in Python for example
the interactive notebook kind of

9482
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:53,520
the interactive notebook kind of
 

9483
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:54,889
the interactive notebook kind of
experiences and stuff like this are

9484
02:43:54,889 --> 02:43:54,899
experiences and stuff like this are
 

9485
02:43:54,899 --> 02:43:57,530
experiences and stuff like this are
really amazing if you typo something it

9486
02:43:57,530 --> 02:43:57,540
really amazing if you typo something it
 

9487
02:43:57,540 --> 02:43:58,730
really amazing if you typo something it
doesn't matter it just tells you that's

9488
02:43:58,730 --> 02:43:58,740
doesn't matter it just tells you that's
 

9489
02:43:58,740 --> 02:44:00,469
doesn't matter it just tells you that's
fine right and so I think that the

9490
02:44:00,469 --> 02:44:00,479
fine right and so I think that the
 

9491
02:44:00,479 --> 02:44:01,550
fine right and so I think that the
tryouts are very different if you're

9492
02:44:01,550 --> 02:44:01,560
tryouts are very different if you're
 

9493
02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:03,110
tryouts are very different if you're
building a

9494
02:44:03,110 --> 02:44:03,120
building a
 

9495
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:04,370
building a
um you know large scale production

9496
02:44:04,370 --> 02:44:04,380
um you know large scale production
 

9497
02:44:04,380 --> 02:44:05,990
um you know large scale production
system versus you're building and

9498
02:44:05,990 --> 02:44:06,000
system versus you're building and
 

9499
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,270
system versus you're building and
exploring a notebook and the speaking of

9500
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:08,280
exploring a notebook and the speaking of
 

9501
02:44:08,280 --> 02:44:09,650
exploring a notebook and the speaking of
control the hilarious thing if you look

9502
02:44:09,650 --> 02:44:09,660
control the hilarious thing if you look
 

9503
02:44:09,660 --> 02:44:11,570
control the hilarious thing if you look
at code I write just for myself for fun

9504
02:44:11,570 --> 02:44:11,580
at code I write just for myself for fun
 

9505
02:44:11,580 --> 02:44:13,910
at code I write just for myself for fun
it's like littered with asserts

9506
02:44:13,910 --> 02:44:13,920
it's like littered with asserts
 

9507
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:15,730
it's like littered with asserts
everywhere okay

9508
02:44:15,730 --> 02:44:15,740
everywhere okay
 

9509
02:44:15,740 --> 02:44:18,469
everywhere okay
it's a kind of yeah you would like to

9510
02:44:18,469 --> 02:44:18,479
it's a kind of yeah you would like to
 

9511
02:44:18,479 --> 02:44:23,510
it's a kind of yeah you would like to
ask it's basically saying uh in a

9512
02:44:23,510 --> 02:44:23,520
ask it's basically saying uh in a
 

9513
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:25,429
ask it's basically saying uh in a
dictatorial way this should be true now

9514
02:44:25,429 --> 02:44:25,439
dictatorial way this should be true now
 

9515
02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:29,030
dictatorial way this should be true now
otherwise everything stops and that that

9516
02:44:29,030 --> 02:44:29,040
otherwise everything stops and that that
 

9517
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:33,290
otherwise everything stops and that that
is the sign I love you man but that is a

9518
02:44:33,290 --> 02:44:33,300
is the sign I love you man but that is a
 

9519
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:34,910
is the sign I love you man but that is a
sign of somebody who likes control yeah

9520
02:44:34,910 --> 02:44:34,920
sign of somebody who likes control yeah
 

9521
02:44:34,920 --> 02:44:37,849
sign of somebody who likes control yeah
and so yes I think that you'll like I

9522
02:44:37,849 --> 02:44:37,859
and so yes I think that you'll like I
 

9523
02:44:37,859 --> 02:44:39,770
and so yes I think that you'll like I
think you're like Mojo therapy session

9524
02:44:39,770 --> 02:44:39,780
think you're like Mojo therapy session
 

9525
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:43,010
think you're like Mojo therapy session
yes I definitely will uh uh speaking of

9526
02:44:43,010 --> 02:44:43,020
yes I definitely will uh uh speaking of
 

9527
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:45,950
yes I definitely will uh uh speaking of
asserts uh exceptions are called errors

9528
02:44:45,950 --> 02:44:45,960
asserts uh exceptions are called errors
 

9529
02:44:45,960 --> 02:44:48,410
asserts uh exceptions are called errors
why is it called errors so we I mean we

9530
02:44:48,410 --> 02:44:48,420
why is it called errors so we I mean we
 

9531
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:51,050
why is it called errors so we I mean we
we use the same we're the same as python

9532
02:44:51,050 --> 02:44:51,060
we use the same we're the same as python
 

9533
02:44:51,060 --> 02:44:53,150
we use the same we're the same as python
right but um we implemented a very

9534
02:44:53,150 --> 02:44:53,160
right but um we implemented a very
 

9535
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:55,130
right but um we implemented a very
different way right and so if you look

9536
02:44:55,130 --> 02:44:55,140
different way right and so if you look
 

9537
02:44:55,140 --> 02:44:57,349
different way right and so if you look
at other languages like we'll pick on C

9538
02:44:57,349 --> 02:44:57,359
at other languages like we'll pick on C
 

9539
02:44:57,359 --> 02:44:59,750
at other languages like we'll pick on C
plus plus our favorite right uh C plus

9540
02:44:59,750 --> 02:44:59,760
plus plus our favorite right uh C plus
 

9541
02:44:59,760 --> 02:45:01,429
plus plus our favorite right uh C plus
plus has this thing called zero cost

9542
02:45:01,429 --> 02:45:01,439
plus has this thing called zero cost
 

9543
02:45:01,439 --> 02:45:02,809
plus has this thing called zero cost
exception handling

9544
02:45:02,809 --> 02:45:02,819
exception handling
 

9545
02:45:02,819 --> 02:45:05,570
exception handling
okay see and this is

9546
02:45:05,570 --> 02:45:05,580
okay see and this is
 

9547
02:45:05,580 --> 02:45:07,250
okay see and this is
in my opinion

9548
02:45:07,250 --> 02:45:07,260
in my opinion
 

9549
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:10,309
in my opinion
something to learn lessons from it's a

9550
02:45:10,309 --> 02:45:10,319
something to learn lessons from it's a
 

9551
02:45:10,319 --> 02:45:13,130
something to learn lessons from it's a
nice polite way of thing and so

9552
02:45:13,130 --> 02:45:13,140
nice polite way of thing and so
 

9553
02:45:13,140 --> 02:45:15,230
nice polite way of thing and so
um and so zero cost exception handling

9554
02:45:15,230 --> 02:45:15,240
um and so zero cost exception handling
 

9555
02:45:15,240 --> 02:45:17,570
um and so zero cost exception handling
the way it works is that it's called

9556
02:45:17,570 --> 02:45:17,580
the way it works is that it's called
 

9557
02:45:17,580 --> 02:45:19,370
the way it works is that it's called
zero cost because

9558
02:45:19,370 --> 02:45:19,380
zero cost because
 

9559
02:45:19,380 --> 02:45:21,410
zero cost because
if you don't throw an exception there's

9560
02:45:21,410 --> 02:45:21,420
if you don't throw an exception there's
 

9561
02:45:21,420 --> 02:45:23,270
if you don't throw an exception there's
supposed to be no overhead for the

9562
02:45:23,270 --> 02:45:23,280
supposed to be no overhead for the
 

9563
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:26,330
supposed to be no overhead for the
non-error code and so it takes the error

9564
02:45:26,330 --> 02:45:26,340
non-error code and so it takes the error
 

9565
02:45:26,340 --> 02:45:30,889
non-error code and so it takes the error
path out of the uh the common path

9566
02:45:30,889 --> 02:45:30,899
path out of the uh the common path
 

9567
02:45:30,899 --> 02:45:32,929
path out of the uh the common path
um it does this by making throwing an

9568
02:45:32,929 --> 02:45:32,939
um it does this by making throwing an
 

9569
02:45:32,939 --> 02:45:35,809
um it does this by making throwing an
error extremely expensive and so if you

9570
02:45:35,809 --> 02:45:35,819
error extremely expensive and so if you
 

9571
02:45:35,819 --> 02:45:37,550
error extremely expensive and so if you
actually throw an error with a C plus

9572
02:45:37,550 --> 02:45:37,560
actually throw an error with a C plus
 

9573
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:39,830
actually throw an error with a C plus
plus compiler using exceptions let's go

9574
02:45:39,830 --> 02:45:39,840
plus compiler using exceptions let's go
 

9575
02:45:39,840 --> 02:45:41,630
plus compiler using exceptions let's go
look up in tables on the side and do all

9576
02:45:41,630 --> 02:45:41,640
look up in tables on the side and do all
 

9577
02:45:41,640 --> 02:45:43,010
look up in tables on the side and do all
the stuff and so throwing an error could

9578
02:45:43,010 --> 02:45:43,020
the stuff and so throwing an error could
 

9579
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:45,410
the stuff and so throwing an error could
be like 10 000 times more expensive than

9580
02:45:45,410 --> 02:45:45,420
be like 10 000 times more expensive than
 

9581
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:48,349
be like 10 000 times more expensive than
returning from a function right also

9582
02:45:48,349 --> 02:45:48,359
returning from a function right also
 

9583
02:45:48,359 --> 02:45:50,030
returning from a function right also
it's called zero cost exceptions but

9584
02:45:50,030 --> 02:45:50,040
it's called zero cost exceptions but
 

9585
02:45:50,040 --> 02:45:52,490
it's called zero cost exceptions but
it's not zero cost by any stretch of the

9586
02:45:52,490 --> 02:45:52,500
it's not zero cost by any stretch of the
 

9587
02:45:52,500 --> 02:45:54,050
it's not zero cost by any stretch of the
imagination because it massively blows

9588
02:45:54,050 --> 02:45:54,060
imagination because it massively blows
 

9589
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:57,290
imagination because it massively blows
out your code your binary it also adds a

9590
02:45:57,290 --> 02:45:57,300
out your code your binary it also adds a
 

9591
02:45:57,300 --> 02:45:59,389
out your code your binary it also adds a
whole bunch of different paths because

9592
02:45:59,389 --> 02:45:59,399
whole bunch of different paths because
 

9593
02:45:59,399 --> 02:46:01,070
whole bunch of different paths because
of destructors and other things like

9594
02:46:01,070 --> 02:46:01,080
of destructors and other things like
 

9595
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:03,170
of destructors and other things like
that that exist in C plus plus and it

9596
02:46:03,170 --> 02:46:03,180
that that exist in C plus plus and it
 

9597
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:04,790
that that exist in C plus plus and it
reduces the number of optimizations it

9598
02:46:04,790 --> 02:46:04,800
reduces the number of optimizations it
 

9599
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:06,710
reduces the number of optimizations it
has like all these effects and so this

9600
02:46:06,710 --> 02:46:06,720
has like all these effects and so this
 

9601
02:46:06,720 --> 02:46:07,969
has like all these effects and so this
thing that was called zero cost

9602
02:46:07,969 --> 02:46:07,979
thing that was called zero cost
 

9603
02:46:07,979 --> 02:46:09,710
thing that was called zero cost
exceptions

9604
02:46:09,710 --> 02:46:09,720
exceptions
 

9605
02:46:09,720 --> 02:46:14,030
exceptions
it really ain't okay now if you fast

9606
02:46:14,030 --> 02:46:14,040
it really ain't okay now if you fast
 

9607
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:16,969
it really ain't okay now if you fast
forward to newer languages and um and

9608
02:46:16,969 --> 02:46:16,979
forward to newer languages and um and
 

9609
02:46:16,979 --> 02:46:19,190
forward to newer languages and um and
this includes Swift and rust and go and

9610
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:19,200
this includes Swift and rust and go and
 

9611
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:21,349
this includes Swift and rust and go and
and now Mojo

9612
02:46:21,349 --> 02:46:21,359
and now Mojo
 

9613
02:46:21,359 --> 02:46:22,250
and now Mojo
um

9614
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:22,260
um
 

9615
02:46:22,260 --> 02:46:24,050
um
uh well in Python's a little bit

9616
02:46:24,050 --> 02:46:24,060
uh well in Python's a little bit
 

9617
02:46:24,060 --> 02:46:25,309
uh well in Python's a little bit
different because it's interpreted and

9618
02:46:25,309 --> 02:46:25,319
different because it's interpreted and
 

9619
02:46:25,319 --> 02:46:26,510
different because it's interpreted and
so like it's got a little bit of a

9620
02:46:26,510 --> 02:46:26,520
so like it's got a little bit of a
 

9621
02:46:26,520 --> 02:46:27,469
so like it's got a little bit of a
different thing going on but if you look

9622
02:46:27,469 --> 02:46:27,479
different thing going on but if you look
 

9623
02:46:27,479 --> 02:46:30,410
different thing going on but if you look
at it if you look at compiled languages

9624
02:46:30,410 --> 02:46:30,420
at it if you look at compiled languages
 

9625
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:33,469
at it if you look at compiled languages
um many neural languages say okay well

9626
02:46:33,469 --> 02:46:33,479
um many neural languages say okay well
 

9627
02:46:33,479 --> 02:46:35,690
um many neural languages say okay well
let's not do that zero cost exception

9628
02:46:35,690 --> 02:46:35,700
let's not do that zero cost exception
 

9629
02:46:35,700 --> 02:46:38,870
let's not do that zero cost exception
handling thing let's actually treat and

9630
02:46:38,870 --> 02:46:38,880
handling thing let's actually treat and
 

9631
02:46:38,880 --> 02:46:42,110
handling thing let's actually treat and
throwing an error the same as returning

9632
02:46:42,110 --> 02:46:42,120
throwing an error the same as returning
 

9633
02:46:42,120 --> 02:46:44,750
throwing an error the same as returning
a variant returning either the normal

9634
02:46:44,750 --> 02:46:44,760
a variant returning either the normal
 

9635
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:47,889
a variant returning either the normal
result or an error now

9636
02:46:47,889 --> 02:46:47,899
result or an error now
 

9637
02:46:47,899 --> 02:46:50,630
result or an error now
programmers generally don't want to deal

9638
02:46:50,630 --> 02:46:50,640
programmers generally don't want to deal
 

9639
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:52,610
programmers generally don't want to deal
with all the typing machinery and like

9640
02:46:52,610 --> 02:46:52,620
with all the typing machinery and like
 

9641
02:46:52,620 --> 02:46:55,550
with all the typing machinery and like
pushing around a variant and so you use

9642
02:46:55,550 --> 02:46:55,560
pushing around a variant and so you use
 

9643
02:46:55,560 --> 02:46:57,530
pushing around a variant and so you use
all the syntax that python gives us for

9644
02:46:57,530 --> 02:46:57,540
all the syntax that python gives us for
 

9645
02:46:57,540 --> 02:46:59,450
all the syntax that python gives us for
example try and catch and it you know

9646
02:46:59,450 --> 02:46:59,460
example try and catch and it you know
 

9647
02:46:59,460 --> 02:47:01,429
example try and catch and it you know
functions that raise and things like

9648
02:47:01,429 --> 02:47:01,439
functions that raise and things like
 

9649
02:47:01,439 --> 02:47:03,950
functions that raise and things like
this you can put erases decorator on

9650
02:47:03,950 --> 02:47:03,960
this you can put erases decorator on
 

9651
02:47:03,960 --> 02:47:06,050
this you can put erases decorator on
your functions stuff like this and if

9652
02:47:06,050 --> 02:47:06,060
your functions stuff like this and if
 

9653
02:47:06,060 --> 02:47:08,450
your functions stuff like this and if
you want to control that and then the

9654
02:47:08,450 --> 02:47:08,460
you want to control that and then the
 

9655
02:47:08,460 --> 02:47:10,250
you want to control that and then the
language can provide syntax for it but

9656
02:47:10,250 --> 02:47:10,260
language can provide syntax for it but
 

9657
02:47:10,260 --> 02:47:11,450
language can provide syntax for it but
under the hood the way the computer

9658
02:47:11,450 --> 02:47:11,460
under the hood the way the computer
 

9659
02:47:11,460 --> 02:47:14,630
under the hood the way the computer
executes it throwing errors basically as

9660
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:14,640
executes it throwing errors basically as
 

9661
02:47:14,640 --> 02:47:16,550
executes it throwing errors basically as
fast as returning something interesting

9662
02:47:16,550 --> 02:47:16,560
fast as returning something interesting
 

9663
02:47:16,560 --> 02:47:18,349
fast as returning something interesting
so it's exactly the same way it's from a

9664
02:47:18,349 --> 02:47:18,359
so it's exactly the same way it's from a
 

9665
02:47:18,359 --> 02:47:19,910
so it's exactly the same way it's from a
compiler perspective and so this is

9666
02:47:19,910 --> 02:47:19,920
compiler perspective and so this is
 

9667
02:47:19,920 --> 02:47:22,550
compiler perspective and so this is
actually I mean it's a fairly nerdy

9668
02:47:22,550 --> 02:47:22,560
actually I mean it's a fairly nerdy
 

9669
02:47:22,560 --> 02:47:24,830
actually I mean it's a fairly nerdy
thing right which is why I love it

9670
02:47:24,830 --> 02:47:24,840
thing right which is why I love it
 

9671
02:47:24,840 --> 02:47:27,650
thing right which is why I love it
um but the uh this has a huge impact on

9672
02:47:27,650 --> 02:47:27,660
um but the uh this has a huge impact on
 

9673
02:47:27,660 --> 02:47:29,510
um but the uh this has a huge impact on
the way you design your apis

9674
02:47:29,510 --> 02:47:29,520
the way you design your apis
 

9675
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:32,030
the way you design your apis
right so in C plus plus

9676
02:47:32,030 --> 02:47:32,040
right so in C plus plus
 

9677
02:47:32,040 --> 02:47:34,389
right so in C plus plus
huge communities turn off exceptions

9678
02:47:34,389 --> 02:47:34,399
huge communities turn off exceptions
 

9679
02:47:34,399 --> 02:47:37,190
huge communities turn off exceptions
because the cost is just so high right

9680
02:47:37,190 --> 02:47:37,200
because the cost is just so high right
 

9681
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:39,889
because the cost is just so high right
and so the zero cost cost is so high

9682
02:47:39,889 --> 02:47:39,899
and so the zero cost cost is so high
 

9683
02:47:39,899 --> 02:47:41,809
and so the zero cost cost is so high
right and so that means you can't

9684
02:47:41,809 --> 02:47:41,819
right and so that means you can't
 

9685
02:47:41,819 --> 02:47:43,910
right and so that means you can't
actually use exceptions in many

9686
02:47:43,910 --> 02:47:43,920
actually use exceptions in many
 

9687
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:45,710
actually use exceptions in many
libraries

9688
02:47:45,710 --> 02:47:45,720
libraries
 

9689
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:48,170
libraries
right and even for the people that do

9690
02:47:48,170 --> 02:47:48,180
right and even for the people that do
 

9691
02:47:48,180 --> 02:47:51,050
right and even for the people that do
use it well okay how and when do you

9692
02:47:51,050 --> 02:47:51,060
use it well okay how and when do you
 

9693
02:47:51,060 --> 02:47:52,969
use it well okay how and when do you
want to pay the cost if I try to open a

9694
02:47:52,969 --> 02:47:52,979
want to pay the cost if I try to open a
 

9695
02:47:52,979 --> 02:47:55,790
want to pay the cost if I try to open a
file should I throw an error well what

9696
02:47:55,790 --> 02:47:55,800
file should I throw an error well what
 

9697
02:47:55,800 --> 02:47:57,590
file should I throw an error well what
if I'm probing around looking for

9698
02:47:57,590 --> 02:47:57,600
if I'm probing around looking for
 

9699
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:59,510
if I'm probing around looking for
something right I'm looking up in many

9700
02:47:59,510 --> 02:47:59,520
something right I'm looking up in many
 

9701
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:00,950
something right I'm looking up in many
different paths well if it's really slow

9702
02:48:00,950 --> 02:48:00,960
different paths well if it's really slow
 

9703
02:48:00,960 --> 02:48:02,750
different paths well if it's really slow
to do that maybe I'll add another

9704
02:48:02,750 --> 02:48:02,760
to do that maybe I'll add another
 

9705
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:05,330
to do that maybe I'll add another
function that doesn't throw an error it

9706
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:05,340
function that doesn't throw an error it
 

9707
02:48:05,340 --> 02:48:07,550
function that doesn't throw an error it
returns an error code instead and now I

9708
02:48:07,550 --> 02:48:07,560
returns an error code instead and now I
 

9709
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:08,750
returns an error code instead and now I
have two different versions the same

9710
02:48:08,750 --> 02:48:08,760
have two different versions the same
 

9711
02:48:08,760 --> 02:48:10,429
have two different versions the same
thing and so it causes you to Fork your

9712
02:48:10,429 --> 02:48:10,439
thing and so it causes you to Fork your
 

9713
02:48:10,439 --> 02:48:13,910
thing and so it causes you to Fork your
apis and so you know one of the things I

9714
02:48:13,910 --> 02:48:13,920
apis and so you know one of the things I
 

9715
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:16,190
apis and so you know one of the things I
learned from Apple and isil love is the

9716
02:48:16,190 --> 02:48:16,200
learned from Apple and isil love is the
 

9717
02:48:16,200 --> 02:48:17,870
learned from Apple and isil love is the
art of API design is actually really

9718
02:48:17,870 --> 02:48:17,880
art of API design is actually really
 

9719
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:19,730
art of API design is actually really
profound I think this is something that

9720
02:48:19,730 --> 02:48:19,740
profound I think this is something that
 

9721
02:48:19,740 --> 02:48:21,170
profound I think this is something that
Python's also done a pretty good job at

9722
02:48:21,170 --> 02:48:21,180
Python's also done a pretty good job at
 

9723
02:48:21,180 --> 02:48:23,330
Python's also done a pretty good job at
in terms of building out this

9724
02:48:23,330 --> 02:48:23,340
in terms of building out this
 

9725
02:48:23,340 --> 02:48:24,830
in terms of building out this
large-scale package ecosystem it's about

9726
02:48:24,830 --> 02:48:24,840
large-scale package ecosystem it's about
 

9727
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:26,330
large-scale package ecosystem it's about
having standards and things like this

9728
02:48:26,330 --> 02:48:26,340
having standards and things like this
 

9729
02:48:26,340 --> 02:48:28,370
having standards and things like this
and so you know we wouldn't want to

9730
02:48:28,370 --> 02:48:28,380
and so you know we wouldn't want to
 

9731
02:48:28,380 --> 02:48:29,870
and so you know we wouldn't want to
enter a mode where

9732
02:48:29,870 --> 02:48:29,880
enter a mode where
 

9733
02:48:29,880 --> 02:48:31,849
enter a mode where
um you know there's this theoretical

9734
02:48:31,849 --> 02:48:31,859
um you know there's this theoretical
 

9735
02:48:31,859 --> 02:48:33,170
um you know there's this theoretical
feature that exists in language but

9736
02:48:33,170 --> 02:48:33,180
feature that exists in language but
 

9737
02:48:33,180 --> 02:48:34,910
feature that exists in language but
people don't use it in practice

9738
02:48:34,910 --> 02:48:34,920
people don't use it in practice
 

9739
02:48:34,920 --> 02:48:36,710
people don't use it in practice
now I'll also say one of the other

9740
02:48:36,710 --> 02:48:36,720
now I'll also say one of the other
 

9741
02:48:36,720 --> 02:48:38,389
now I'll also say one of the other
really cool things about this

9742
02:48:38,389 --> 02:48:38,399
really cool things about this
 

9743
02:48:38,399 --> 02:48:39,710
really cool things about this
implementation approach is that it can

9744
02:48:39,710 --> 02:48:39,720
implementation approach is that it can
 

9745
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:40,969
implementation approach is that it can
run on gpus and it can run on

9746
02:48:40,969 --> 02:48:40,979
run on gpus and it can run on
 

9747
02:48:40,979 --> 02:48:42,770
run on gpus and it can run on
accelerators and things like this and

9748
02:48:42,770 --> 02:48:42,780
accelerators and things like this and
 

9749
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:45,710
accelerators and things like this and
that standard zero cost exception thing

9750
02:48:45,710 --> 02:48:45,720
that standard zero cost exception thing
 

9751
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:47,570
that standard zero cost exception thing
would never work on an accelerator and

9752
02:48:47,570 --> 02:48:47,580
would never work on an accelerator and
 

9753
02:48:47,580 --> 02:48:49,610
would never work on an accelerator and
so this is also part of how Mojo can

9754
02:48:49,610 --> 02:48:49,620
so this is also part of how Mojo can
 

9755
02:48:49,620 --> 02:48:51,110
so this is also part of how Mojo can
scale all the way down to like little

9756
02:48:51,110 --> 02:48:51,120
scale all the way down to like little
 

9757
02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:53,389
scale all the way down to like little
embedded systems and to running on gpus

9758
02:48:53,389 --> 02:48:53,399
embedded systems and to running on gpus
 

9759
02:48:53,399 --> 02:48:55,250
embedded systems and to running on gpus
and things like that can you actually

9760
02:48:55,250 --> 02:48:55,260
and things like that can you actually
 

9761
02:48:55,260 --> 02:48:57,130
and things like that can you actually
say about the

9762
02:48:57,130 --> 02:48:57,140
say about the
 

9763
02:48:57,140 --> 02:49:00,950
say about the
maybe uh is there some high-level way to

9764
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:00,960
maybe uh is there some high-level way to
 

9765
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:02,690
maybe uh is there some high-level way to
describe the challenge of

9766
02:49:02,690 --> 02:49:02,700
describe the challenge of
 

9767
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:05,270
describe the challenge of
exceptions and how they work in code

9768
02:49:05,270 --> 02:49:05,280
exceptions and how they work in code
 

9769
02:49:05,280 --> 02:49:07,610
exceptions and how they work in code
during compilation so it's just this

9770
02:49:07,610 --> 02:49:07,620
during compilation so it's just this
 

9771
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:10,610
during compilation so it's just this
idea of percolating up a thing

9772
02:49:10,610 --> 02:49:10,620
idea of percolating up a thing
 

9773
02:49:10,620 --> 02:49:13,910
idea of percolating up a thing
an error yeah yeah so the way the way to

9774
02:49:13,910 --> 02:49:13,920
an error yeah yeah so the way the way to
 

9775
02:49:13,920 --> 02:49:14,990
an error yeah yeah so the way the way to
think about it is

9776
02:49:14,990 --> 02:49:15,000
think about it is
 

9777
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,130
think about it is
um think about a function that doesn't

9778
02:49:16,130 --> 02:49:16,140
um think about a function that doesn't
 

9779
02:49:16,140 --> 02:49:18,110
um think about a function that doesn't
return anything just as a simple case

9780
02:49:18,110 --> 02:49:18,120
return anything just as a simple case
 

9781
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:19,870
return anything just as a simple case
right and so you have

9782
02:49:19,870 --> 02:49:19,880
right and so you have
 

9783
02:49:19,880 --> 02:49:23,030
right and so you have
function one calls function two calls

9784
02:49:23,030 --> 02:49:23,040
function one calls function two calls
 

9785
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:24,889
function one calls function two calls
function three calls function four

9786
02:49:24,889 --> 02:49:24,899
function three calls function four
 

9787
02:49:24,899 --> 02:49:26,809
function three calls function four
along that call stack that are try

9788
02:49:26,809 --> 02:49:26,819
along that call stack that are try
 

9789
02:49:26,819 --> 02:49:29,090
along that call stack that are try
blocks right and so if you have function

9790
02:49:29,090 --> 02:49:29,100
blocks right and so if you have function
 

9791
02:49:29,100 --> 02:49:30,830
blocks right and so if you have function
one calls function two function two has

9792
02:49:30,830 --> 02:49:30,840
one calls function two function two has
 

9793
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:32,990
one calls function two function two has
a try block and then within it it calls

9794
02:49:32,990 --> 02:49:33,000
a try block and then within it it calls
 

9795
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,270
a try block and then within it it calls
function three right well what happens

9796
02:49:35,270 --> 02:49:35,280
function three right well what happens
 

9797
02:49:35,280 --> 02:49:37,790
function three right well what happens
if function three throws

9798
02:49:37,790 --> 02:49:37,800
if function three throws
 

9799
02:49:37,800 --> 02:49:39,710
if function three throws
well actually start simpler what happens

9800
02:49:39,710 --> 02:49:39,720
well actually start simpler what happens
 

9801
02:49:39,720 --> 02:49:41,750
well actually start simpler what happens
if it returns well if it returns it's

9802
02:49:41,750 --> 02:49:41,760
if it returns well if it returns it's
 

9803
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:43,010
if it returns well if it returns it's
supposed to go back out and continue

9804
02:49:43,010 --> 02:49:43,020
supposed to go back out and continue
 

9805
02:49:43,020 --> 02:49:44,570
supposed to go back out and continue
executing and then fall off the bottom

9806
02:49:44,570 --> 02:49:44,580
executing and then fall off the bottom
 

9807
02:49:44,580 --> 02:49:46,010
executing and then fall off the bottom
of the try block and keep going and

9808
02:49:46,010 --> 02:49:46,020
of the try block and keep going and
 

9809
02:49:46,020 --> 02:49:47,330
of the try block and keep going and
all's good

9810
02:49:47,330 --> 02:49:47,340
all's good
 

9811
02:49:47,340 --> 02:49:49,429
all's good
if the function throws you're supposed

9812
02:49:49,429 --> 02:49:49,439
if the function throws you're supposed
 

9813
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:51,170
if the function throws you're supposed
to exit the current function

9814
02:49:51,170 --> 02:49:51,180
to exit the current function
 

9815
02:49:51,180 --> 02:49:53,210
to exit the current function
and then get into the accept Clause

9816
02:49:53,210 --> 02:49:53,220
and then get into the accept Clause
 

9817
02:49:53,220 --> 02:49:55,370
and then get into the accept Clause
right and then do whatever code's there

9818
02:49:55,370 --> 02:49:55,380
right and then do whatever code's there
 

9819
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:56,990
right and then do whatever code's there
and then keep falling on and going on

9820
02:49:56,990 --> 02:49:57,000
and then keep falling on and going on
 

9821
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,870
and then keep falling on and going on
and so the way that a compiler like Mojo

9822
02:49:59,870 --> 02:49:59,880
and so the way that a compiler like Mojo
 

9823
02:49:59,880 --> 02:50:02,510
and so the way that a compiler like Mojo
works is that the call to that function

9824
02:50:02,510 --> 02:50:02,520
works is that the call to that function
 

9825
02:50:02,520 --> 02:50:05,150
works is that the call to that function
which happens in the accept block calls

9826
02:50:05,150 --> 02:50:05,160
which happens in the accept block calls
 

9827
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:06,469
which happens in the accept block calls
the function and then instead of

9828
02:50:06,469 --> 02:50:06,479
the function and then instead of
 

9829
02:50:06,479 --> 02:50:07,790
the function and then instead of
returning nothing

9830
02:50:07,790 --> 02:50:07,800
returning nothing
 

9831
02:50:07,800 --> 02:50:10,370
returning nothing
it actually returns you know a variant

9832
02:50:10,370 --> 02:50:10,380
it actually returns you know a variant
 

9833
02:50:10,380 --> 02:50:12,950
it actually returns you know a variant
between nothing and an error

9834
02:50:12,950 --> 02:50:12,960
between nothing and an error
 

9835
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:15,290
between nothing and an error
and so if you return normally go off the

9836
02:50:15,290 --> 02:50:15,300
and so if you return normally go off the
 

9837
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:17,270
and so if you return normally go off the
bottom or do a return

9838
02:50:17,270 --> 02:50:17,280
bottom or do a return
 

9839
02:50:17,280 --> 02:50:19,429
bottom or do a return
you refer nothing and if you throw throw

9840
02:50:19,429 --> 02:50:19,439
you refer nothing and if you throw throw
 

9841
02:50:19,439 --> 02:50:21,170
you refer nothing and if you throw throw
an error you

9842
02:50:21,170 --> 02:50:21,180
an error you
 

9843
02:50:21,180 --> 02:50:23,630
an error you
return the variant that is I'm an error

9844
02:50:23,630 --> 02:50:23,640
return the variant that is I'm an error
 

9845
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:25,910
return the variant that is I'm an error
right so when you get to the call you

9846
02:50:25,910 --> 02:50:25,920
right so when you get to the call you
 

9847
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:28,250
right so when you get to the call you
say okay cool I called a function hey I

9848
02:50:28,250 --> 02:50:28,260
say okay cool I called a function hey I
 

9849
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:30,349
say okay cool I called a function hey I
know locally I'm in a try block

9850
02:50:30,349 --> 02:50:30,359
know locally I'm in a try block
 

9851
02:50:30,359 --> 02:50:32,510
know locally I'm in a try block
right and so I I call the function and

9852
02:50:32,510 --> 02:50:32,520
right and so I I call the function and
 

9853
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:34,670
right and so I I call the function and
then I check to see what it returns aha

9854
02:50:34,670 --> 02:50:34,680
then I check to see what it returns aha
 

9855
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:36,230
then I check to see what it returns aha
if it's that error thing jump to the

9856
02:50:36,230 --> 02:50:36,240
if it's that error thing jump to the
 

9857
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:37,190
if it's that error thing jump to the
accept block

9858
02:50:37,190 --> 02:50:37,200
accept block
 

9859
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:39,590
accept block
and that's all done for you behind the

9860
02:50:39,590 --> 02:50:39,600
and that's all done for you behind the
 

9861
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:41,210
and that's all done for you behind the
scenes exactly and so the competitors

9862
02:50:41,210 --> 02:50:41,220
scenes exactly and so the competitors
 

9863
02:50:41,220 --> 02:50:43,250
scenes exactly and so the competitors
all this for you and I mean one of the

9864
02:50:43,250 --> 02:50:43,260
all this for you and I mean one of the
 

9865
02:50:43,260 --> 02:50:44,570
all this for you and I mean one of the
things if you dig into how this stuff

9866
02:50:44,570 --> 02:50:44,580
things if you dig into how this stuff
 

9867
02:50:44,580 --> 02:50:46,250
things if you dig into how this stuff
works in Python it gets a little bit

9868
02:50:46,250 --> 02:50:46,260
works in Python it gets a little bit
 

9869
02:50:46,260 --> 02:50:47,510
works in Python it gets a little bit
more complicated because you have

9870
02:50:47,510 --> 02:50:47,520
more complicated because you have
 

9871
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:50,330
more complicated because you have
finally blocks which now need you need

9872
02:50:50,330 --> 02:50:50,340
finally blocks which now need you need
 

9873
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:52,670
finally blocks which now need you need
to go into do some stuff and then those

9874
02:50:52,670 --> 02:50:52,680
to go into do some stuff and then those
 

9875
02:50:52,680 --> 02:50:54,830
to go into do some stuff and then those
can also throw and return wait what

9876
02:50:54,830 --> 02:50:54,840
can also throw and return wait what
 

9877
02:50:54,840 --> 02:50:57,469
can also throw and return wait what
nothing and like the stuff matters for

9878
02:50:57,469 --> 02:50:57,479
nothing and like the stuff matters for
 

9879
02:50:57,479 --> 02:50:58,730
nothing and like the stuff matters for
compatibility

9880
02:50:58,730 --> 02:50:58,740
compatibility
 

9881
02:50:58,740 --> 02:51:01,250
compatibility
um like there's there's nestum there's

9882
02:51:01,250 --> 02:51:01,260
um like there's there's nestum there's
 

9883
02:51:01,260 --> 02:51:03,230
um like there's there's nestum there's
with Clauses and so with Clauses are

9884
02:51:03,230 --> 02:51:03,240
with Clauses and so with Clauses are
 

9885
02:51:03,240 --> 02:51:04,490
with Clauses and so with Clauses are
kind of like finally blocked with some

9886
02:51:04,490 --> 02:51:04,500
kind of like finally blocked with some
 

9887
02:51:04,500 --> 02:51:06,110
kind of like finally blocked with some
special stuff going on and so there's

9888
02:51:06,110 --> 02:51:06,120
special stuff going on and so there's
 

9889
02:51:06,120 --> 02:51:07,969
special stuff going on and so there's
nothing in general nesting of anything

9890
02:51:07,969 --> 02:51:07,979
nothing in general nesting of anything
 

9891
02:51:07,979 --> 02:51:12,050
nothing in general nesting of anything
nothing of functions should be illegal

9892
02:51:12,050 --> 02:51:12,060
nothing of functions should be illegal
 

9893
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:14,389
nothing of functions should be illegal
it just feels like it adds a level of

9894
02:51:14,389 --> 02:51:14,399
it just feels like it adds a level of
 

9895
02:51:14,399 --> 02:51:17,030
it just feels like it adds a level of
complexity Lex I'm merely an implementer

9896
02:51:17,030 --> 02:51:17,040
complexity Lex I'm merely an implementer
 

9897
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:19,790
complexity Lex I'm merely an implementer
oh this is again yeah one of one of the

9898
02:51:19,790 --> 02:51:19,800
oh this is again yeah one of one of the
 

9899
02:51:19,800 --> 02:51:22,070
oh this is again yeah one of one of the
one of the trade-offs you get when you

9900
02:51:22,070 --> 02:51:22,080
one of the trade-offs you get when you
 

9901
02:51:22,080 --> 02:51:24,349
one of the trade-offs you get when you
decide to build a superset is you get to

9902
02:51:24,349 --> 02:51:24,359
decide to build a superset is you get to
 

9903
02:51:24,359 --> 02:51:26,270
decide to build a superset is you get to
implement a full Fidelity implementation

9904
02:51:26,270 --> 02:51:26,280
implement a full Fidelity implementation
 

9905
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:28,790
implement a full Fidelity implementation
of the thing that you decided is good

9906
02:51:28,790 --> 02:51:28,800
of the thing that you decided is good
 

9907
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:30,770
of the thing that you decided is good
and so

9908
02:51:30,770 --> 02:51:30,780
and so
 

9909
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:33,410
and so
yeah I mean we can we can complain about

9910
02:51:33,410 --> 02:51:33,420
yeah I mean we can we can complain about
 

9911
02:51:33,420 --> 02:51:35,330
yeah I mean we can we can complain about
the reality of the world and Shake our

9912
02:51:35,330 --> 02:51:35,340
the reality of the world and Shake our
 

9913
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:38,090
the reality of the world and Shake our
fist but it always feels like you

9914
02:51:38,090 --> 02:51:38,100
fist but it always feels like you
 

9915
02:51:38,100 --> 02:51:39,889
fist but it always feels like you
shouldn't be allowed to do that like to

9916
02:51:39,889 --> 02:51:39,899
shouldn't be allowed to do that like to
 

9917
02:51:39,899 --> 02:51:42,290
shouldn't be allowed to do that like to
declare functions in certain functions

9918
02:51:42,290 --> 02:51:42,300
declare functions in certain functions
 

9919
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:44,230
declare functions in certain functions
inside functions

9920
02:51:44,230 --> 02:51:44,240
inside functions
 

9921
02:51:44,240 --> 02:51:47,090
inside functions
what happened to lacks the the lisp guy

9922
02:51:47,090 --> 02:51:47,100
what happened to lacks the the lisp guy
 

9923
02:51:47,100 --> 02:51:50,450
what happened to lacks the the lisp guy
no I understand that but lisp is what I

9924
02:51:50,450 --> 02:51:50,460
no I understand that but lisp is what I
 

9925
02:51:50,460 --> 02:51:53,210
no I understand that but lisp is what I
used to do in college so now you've

9926
02:51:53,210 --> 02:51:53,220
used to do in college so now you've
 

9927
02:51:53,220 --> 02:51:54,130
used to do in college so now you've
grown up

9928
02:51:54,130 --> 02:51:54,140
grown up
 

9929
02:51:54,140 --> 02:51:56,389
grown up
you know we've all done things in

9930
02:51:56,389 --> 02:51:56,399
you know we've all done things in
 

9931
02:51:56,399 --> 02:51:59,530
you know we've all done things in
college we're not proud

9932
02:51:59,530 --> 02:51:59,540

 

9933
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:02,030

okay yeah I was gonna say you're afraid

9934
02:52:02,030 --> 02:52:02,040
okay yeah I was gonna say you're afraid
 

9935
02:52:02,040 --> 02:52:04,750
okay yeah I was gonna say you're afraid
of me you're taking the whole internet

9936
02:52:04,750 --> 02:52:04,760
of me you're taking the whole internet
 

9937
02:52:04,760 --> 02:52:07,490
of me you're taking the whole internet
it's uh it worked it worked as a joke in

9938
02:52:07,490 --> 02:52:07,500
it's uh it worked it worked as a joke in
 

9939
02:52:07,500 --> 02:52:09,530
it's uh it worked it worked as a joke in
my head and yeah it was right so so

9940
02:52:09,530 --> 02:52:09,540
my head and yeah it was right so so
 

9941
02:52:09,540 --> 02:52:11,450
my head and yeah it was right so so
message functions are joking aside

9942
02:52:11,450 --> 02:52:11,460
message functions are joking aside
 

9943
02:52:11,460 --> 02:52:13,250
message functions are joking aside
actually really great and for certain

9944
02:52:13,250 --> 02:52:13,260
actually really great and for certain
 

9945
02:52:13,260 --> 02:52:14,929
actually really great and for certain
things right and so these are also

9946
02:52:14,929 --> 02:52:14,939
things right and so these are also
 

9947
02:52:14,939 --> 02:52:16,309
things right and so these are also
called closures

9948
02:52:16,309 --> 02:52:16,319
called closures
 

9949
02:52:16,319 --> 02:52:18,230
called closures
closures are pretty cool and you can

9950
02:52:18,230 --> 02:52:18,240
closures are pretty cool and you can
 

9951
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:19,670
closures are pretty cool and you can
pass callbacks there's a lot of good

9952
02:52:19,670 --> 02:52:19,680
pass callbacks there's a lot of good
 

9953
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:22,070
pass callbacks there's a lot of good
patterns and so uh So speaking of which

9954
02:52:22,070 --> 02:52:22,080
patterns and so uh So speaking of which
 

9955
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:26,150
patterns and so uh So speaking of which
I don't think you have uh nested

9956
02:52:26,150 --> 02:52:26,160
I don't think you have uh nested
 

9957
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:29,210
I don't think you have uh nested
functions implemented yet in Mojo we

9958
02:52:29,210 --> 02:52:29,220
functions implemented yet in Mojo we
 

9959
02:52:29,220 --> 02:52:30,889
functions implemented yet in Mojo we
don't have Lambda syntax but we do have

9960
02:52:30,889 --> 02:52:30,899
don't have Lambda syntax but we do have
 

9961
02:52:30,899 --> 02:52:33,110
don't have Lambda syntax but we do have
the synthetics functions yeah so there's

9962
02:52:33,110 --> 02:52:33,120
the synthetics functions yeah so there's
 

9963
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:34,670
the synthetics functions yeah so there's
a few things on the roadmap they have

9964
02:52:34,670 --> 02:52:34,680
a few things on the roadmap they have
 

9965
02:52:34,680 --> 02:52:36,710
a few things on the roadmap they have
that it would be cool to sort of just

9966
02:52:36,710 --> 02:52:36,720
that it would be cool to sort of just
 

9967
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:38,750
that it would be cool to sort of just
fly through because it's interesting to

9968
02:52:38,750 --> 02:52:38,760
fly through because it's interesting to
 

9969
02:52:38,760 --> 02:52:41,269
fly through because it's interesting to
see you know how many features there are

9970
02:52:41,269 --> 02:52:41,279
see you know how many features there are
 

9971
02:52:41,279 --> 02:52:44,090
see you know how many features there are
in a language small and big yep they

9972
02:52:44,090 --> 02:52:44,100
in a language small and big yep they
 

9973
02:52:44,100 --> 02:52:45,889
in a language small and big yep they
have to implement yeah so first of all

9974
02:52:45,889 --> 02:52:45,899
have to implement yeah so first of all
 

9975
02:52:45,899 --> 02:52:47,870
have to implement yeah so first of all
there's Tuple support and that has to do

9976
02:52:47,870 --> 02:52:47,880
there's Tuple support and that has to do
 

9977
02:52:47,880 --> 02:52:49,910
there's Tuple support and that has to do
with some very specific aspect of it

9978
02:52:49,910 --> 02:52:49,920
with some very specific aspect of it
 

9979
02:52:49,920 --> 02:52:51,950
with some very specific aspect of it
like the parentheses or not parentheses

9980
02:52:51,950 --> 02:52:51,960
like the parentheses or not parentheses
 

9981
02:52:51,960 --> 02:52:53,870
like the parentheses or not parentheses
that yeah this is just a totally a

9982
02:52:53,870 --> 02:52:53,880
that yeah this is just a totally a
 

9983
02:52:53,880 --> 02:52:55,849
that yeah this is just a totally a
syntactic thing a syntactic thing okay

9984
02:52:55,849 --> 02:52:55,859
syntactic thing a syntactic thing okay
 

9985
02:52:55,859 --> 02:52:58,910
syntactic thing a syntactic thing okay
there's but it's cool it's still uh

9986
02:52:58,910 --> 02:52:58,920
there's but it's cool it's still uh
 

9987
02:52:58,920 --> 02:53:01,670
there's but it's cool it's still uh
so keyword arguments and functions yeah

9988
02:53:01,670 --> 02:53:01,680
so keyword arguments and functions yeah
 

9989
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:03,410
so keyword arguments and functions yeah
so this is where in Python you can say

9990
02:53:03,410 --> 02:53:03,420
so this is where in Python you can say
 

9991
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:06,590
so this is where in Python you can say
call a function x equals four yeah and X

9992
02:53:06,590 --> 02:53:06,600
call a function x equals four yeah and X
 

9993
02:53:06,600 --> 02:53:08,330
call a function x equals four yeah and X
is the name of the argument that's a

9994
02:53:08,330 --> 02:53:08,340
is the name of the argument that's a
 

9995
02:53:08,340 --> 02:53:09,670
is the name of the argument that's a
nice sort of documenting

9996
02:53:09,670 --> 02:53:09,680
nice sort of documenting
 

9997
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:11,870
nice sort of documenting
self-documenting feature yeah I mean and

9998
02:53:11,870 --> 02:53:11,880
self-documenting feature yeah I mean and
 

9999
02:53:11,880 --> 02:53:13,250
self-documenting feature yeah I mean and
again this isn't rocket science to

10000
02:53:13,250 --> 02:53:13,260
again this isn't rocket science to
 

10001
02:53:13,260 --> 02:53:14,690
again this isn't rocket science to
implement that's just the laundry it's

10002
02:53:14,690 --> 02:53:14,700
implement that's just the laundry it's
 

10003
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:16,010
implement that's just the laundry it's
just on the list

10004
02:53:16,010 --> 02:53:16,020
just on the list
 

10005
02:53:16,020 --> 02:53:18,410
just on the list
uh the bigger features are things like

10006
02:53:18,410 --> 02:53:18,420
uh the bigger features are things like
 

10007
02:53:18,420 --> 02:53:21,590
uh the bigger features are things like
traits so traits are when you want to

10008
02:53:21,590 --> 02:53:21,600
traits so traits are when you want to
 

10009
02:53:21,600 --> 02:53:23,870
traits so traits are when you want to
Define abstract so when you get into

10010
02:53:23,870 --> 02:53:23,880
Define abstract so when you get into
 

10011
02:53:23,880 --> 02:53:26,630
Define abstract so when you get into
typed languages you need the ability to

10012
02:53:26,630 --> 02:53:26,640
typed languages you need the ability to
 

10013
02:53:26,640 --> 02:53:28,550
typed languages you need the ability to
write generics and so you want to say I

10014
02:53:28,550 --> 02:53:28,560
write generics and so you want to say I
 

10015
02:53:28,560 --> 02:53:29,990
write generics and so you want to say I
want to write this function and now I

10016
02:53:29,990 --> 02:53:30,000
want to write this function and now I
 

10017
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:31,670
want to write this function and now I
want to work on all things that are

10018
02:53:31,670 --> 02:53:31,680
want to work on all things that are
 

10019
02:53:31,680 --> 02:53:33,349
want to work on all things that are
arithmetic like

10020
02:53:33,349 --> 02:53:33,359
arithmetic like
 

10021
02:53:33,359 --> 02:53:35,210
arithmetic like
well what does arithmetic like mean well

10022
02:53:35,210 --> 02:53:35,220
well what does arithmetic like mean well
 

10023
02:53:35,220 --> 02:53:38,330
well what does arithmetic like mean well
arithmetic-like is a categorization of a

10024
02:53:38,330 --> 02:53:38,340
arithmetic-like is a categorization of a
 

10025
02:53:38,340 --> 02:53:41,090
arithmetic-like is a categorization of a
bunch of types and so it's again you can

10026
02:53:41,090 --> 02:53:41,100
bunch of types and so it's again you can
 

10027
02:53:41,100 --> 02:53:42,349
bunch of types and so it's again you can
Define many different ways and I'm not

10028
02:53:42,349 --> 02:53:42,359
Define many different ways and I'm not
 

10029
02:53:42,359 --> 02:53:43,490
Define many different ways and I'm not
going to go into ring Theory or

10030
02:53:43,490 --> 02:53:43,500
going to go into ring Theory or
 

10031
02:53:43,500 --> 02:53:46,309
going to go into ring Theory or
something but the uh you know you can

10032
02:53:46,309 --> 02:53:46,319
something but the uh you know you can
 

10033
02:53:46,319 --> 02:53:47,929
something but the uh you know you can
say it's arithmetic like if you can add

10034
02:53:47,929 --> 02:53:47,939
say it's arithmetic like if you can add
 

10035
02:53:47,939 --> 02:53:49,849
say it's arithmetic like if you can add
subtract multiply divide it for example

10036
02:53:49,849 --> 02:53:49,859
subtract multiply divide it for example
 

10037
02:53:49,859 --> 02:53:51,349
subtract multiply divide it for example
right and so what you're saying is

10038
02:53:51,349 --> 02:53:51,359
right and so what you're saying is
 

10039
02:53:51,359 --> 02:53:53,809
right and so what you're saying is
you're saying there's a set of traits

10040
02:53:53,809 --> 02:53:53,819
you're saying there's a set of traits
 

10041
02:53:53,819 --> 02:53:57,410
you're saying there's a set of traits
that apply to a broad variety of types

10042
02:53:57,410 --> 02:53:57,420
that apply to a broad variety of types
 

10043
02:53:57,420 --> 02:53:59,570
that apply to a broad variety of types
and so they're all these types of

10044
02:53:59,570 --> 02:53:59,580
and so they're all these types of
 

10045
02:53:59,580 --> 02:54:01,370
and so they're all these types of
arithmetic like all these tensors and

10046
02:54:01,370 --> 02:54:01,380
arithmetic like all these tensors and
 

10047
02:54:01,380 --> 02:54:02,990
arithmetic like all these tensors and
floating Point integer and like there's

10048
02:54:02,990 --> 02:54:03,000
floating Point integer and like there's
 

10049
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,510
floating Point integer and like there's
this category of of types and then I can

10050
02:54:05,510 --> 02:54:05,520
this category of of types and then I can
 

10051
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:08,450
this category of of types and then I can
Define on an orthogonal axis algorithms

10052
02:54:08,450 --> 02:54:08,460
Define on an orthogonal axis algorithms
 

10053
02:54:08,460 --> 02:54:10,250
Define on an orthogonal axis algorithms
that then work against types that have

10054
02:54:10,250 --> 02:54:10,260
that then work against types that have
 

10055
02:54:10,260 --> 02:54:11,990
that then work against types that have
those properties

10056
02:54:11,990 --> 02:54:12,000
those properties
 

10057
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,690
those properties
and so this is a again it's a widely

10058
02:54:14,690 --> 02:54:14,700
and so this is a again it's a widely
 

10059
02:54:14,700 --> 02:54:16,610
and so this is a again it's a widely
known thing it's been implemented in

10060
02:54:16,610 --> 02:54:16,620
known thing it's been implemented in
 

10061
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:19,190
known thing it's been implemented in
Swift and rust in many languages so it's

10062
02:54:19,190 --> 02:54:19,200
Swift and rust in many languages so it's
 

10063
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:20,889
Swift and rust in many languages so it's
not a Haskell

10064
02:54:20,889 --> 02:54:20,899
not a Haskell
 

10065
02:54:20,899 --> 02:54:23,570
not a Haskell
which is where everybody learns learns

10066
02:54:23,570 --> 02:54:23,580
which is where everybody learns learns
 

10067
02:54:23,580 --> 02:54:24,889
which is where everybody learns learns
their tricks from

10068
02:54:24,889 --> 02:54:24,899
their tricks from
 

10069
02:54:24,899 --> 02:54:26,990
their tricks from
um but the uh but we need to implement

10070
02:54:26,990 --> 02:54:27,000
um but the uh but we need to implement
 

10071
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,969
um but the uh but we need to implement
that and that will enable a new level of

10072
02:54:28,969 --> 02:54:28,979
that and that will enable a new level of
 

10073
02:54:28,979 --> 02:54:30,290
that and that will enable a new level of
expressivity

10074
02:54:30,290 --> 02:54:30,300
expressivity
 

10075
02:54:30,300 --> 02:54:33,110
expressivity
uh so classes yeah class is a big deal

10076
02:54:33,110 --> 02:54:33,120
uh so classes yeah class is a big deal
 

10077
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:35,450
uh so classes yeah class is a big deal
it's a big deal uh still to be

10078
02:54:35,450 --> 02:54:35,460
it's a big deal uh still to be
 

10079
02:54:35,460 --> 02:54:37,370
it's a big deal uh still to be
implemented

10080
02:54:37,370 --> 02:54:37,380
implemented
 

10081
02:54:37,380 --> 02:54:40,010
implemented
um like you said Lambda syntax

10082
02:54:40,010 --> 02:54:40,020
um like you said Lambda syntax
 

10083
02:54:40,020 --> 02:54:41,809
um like you said Lambda syntax
and there's like detailed stuff like

10084
02:54:41,809 --> 02:54:41,819
and there's like detailed stuff like
 

10085
02:54:41,819 --> 02:54:44,990
and there's like detailed stuff like
coal module import uh

10086
02:54:44,990 --> 02:54:45,000
coal module import uh
 

10087
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,210
coal module import uh
support for top level code and file

10088
02:54:47,210 --> 02:54:47,220
support for top level code and file
 

10089
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:51,650
support for top level code and file
scope so and then Global variables also

10090
02:54:51,650 --> 02:54:51,660
scope so and then Global variables also
 

10091
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:53,510
scope so and then Global variables also
so being able to have variables outside

10092
02:54:53,510 --> 02:54:53,520
so being able to have variables outside
 

10093
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:55,370
so being able to have variables outside
of a top level well and so this comes

10094
02:54:55,370 --> 02:54:55,380
of a top level well and so this comes
 

10095
02:54:55,380 --> 02:54:57,650
of a top level well and so this comes
back to the where Mojo came from and the

10096
02:54:57,650 --> 02:54:57,660
back to the where Mojo came from and the
 

10097
02:54:57,660 --> 02:55:00,950
back to the where Mojo came from and the
fact that it's 0.1 right and so we're

10098
02:55:00,950 --> 02:55:00,960
fact that it's 0.1 right and so we're
 

10099
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:02,809
fact that it's 0.1 right and so we're
building the modular is building an AI

10100
02:55:02,809 --> 02:55:02,819
building the modular is building an AI
 

10101
02:55:02,819 --> 02:55:05,210
building the modular is building an AI
stack right and an air stack has a bunch

10102
02:55:05,210 --> 02:55:05,220
stack right and an air stack has a bunch
 

10103
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:07,010
stack right and an air stack has a bunch
of problems working with hardware and

10104
02:55:07,010 --> 02:55:07,020
of problems working with hardware and
 

10105
02:55:07,020 --> 02:55:08,870
of problems working with hardware and
writing high performance kernels and

10106
02:55:08,870 --> 02:55:08,880
writing high performance kernels and
 

10107
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:10,250
writing high performance kernels and
doing with kernel Fusion thing I was

10108
02:55:10,250 --> 02:55:10,260
doing with kernel Fusion thing I was
 

10109
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:11,750
doing with kernel Fusion thing I was
talking about and getting the most out

10110
02:55:11,750 --> 02:55:11,760
talking about and getting the most out
 

10111
02:55:11,760 --> 02:55:13,370
talking about and getting the most out
of the hardware and so we've really

10112
02:55:13,370 --> 02:55:13,380
of the hardware and so we've really
 

10113
02:55:13,380 --> 02:55:15,590
of the hardware and so we've really
prioritized and built Mojo to solve

10114
02:55:15,590 --> 02:55:15,600
prioritized and built Mojo to solve
 

10115
02:55:15,600 --> 02:55:17,870
prioritized and built Mojo to solve
modulus problem

10116
02:55:17,870 --> 02:55:17,880
modulus problem
 

10117
02:55:17,880 --> 02:55:20,389
modulus problem
right now our North Stars build out and

10118
02:55:20,389 --> 02:55:20,399
right now our North Stars build out and
 

10119
02:55:20,399 --> 02:55:22,010
right now our North Stars build out and
support all the things and so we're

10120
02:55:22,010 --> 02:55:22,020
support all the things and so we're
 

10121
02:55:22,020 --> 02:55:23,570
support all the things and so we're
making incredible progress by the way

10122
02:55:23,570 --> 02:55:23,580
making incredible progress by the way
 

10123
02:55:23,580 --> 02:55:26,269
making incredible progress by the way
Mojo's only like seven months old so

10124
02:55:26,269 --> 02:55:26,279
Mojo's only like seven months old so
 

10125
02:55:26,279 --> 02:55:28,250
Mojo's only like seven months old so
that's another interesting thing I mean

10126
02:55:28,250 --> 02:55:28,260
that's another interesting thing I mean
 

10127
02:55:28,260 --> 02:55:29,330
that's another interesting thing I mean
part of the reason I wanted to mention

10128
02:55:29,330 --> 02:55:29,340
part of the reason I wanted to mention
 

10129
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:31,370
part of the reason I wanted to mention
some of these things is like there's a

10130
02:55:31,370 --> 02:55:31,380
some of these things is like there's a
 

10131
02:55:31,380 --> 02:55:33,590
some of these things is like there's a
lot to to do and it's pretty cool how

10132
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:33,600
lot to to do and it's pretty cool how
 

10133
02:55:33,600 --> 02:55:36,830
lot to to do and it's pretty cool how
you just kind of sometimes you take for

10134
02:55:36,830 --> 02:55:36,840
you just kind of sometimes you take for
 

10135
02:55:36,840 --> 02:55:38,090
you just kind of sometimes you take for
granted how much there is in a

10136
02:55:38,090 --> 02:55:38,100
granted how much there is in a
 

10137
02:55:38,100 --> 02:55:39,230
granted how much there is in a
programming language how many cool

10138
02:55:39,230 --> 02:55:39,240
programming language how many cool
 

10139
02:55:39,240 --> 02:55:40,910
programming language how many cool
features you kind of rely on and this is

10140
02:55:40,910 --> 02:55:40,920
features you kind of rely on and this is
 

10141
02:55:40,920 --> 02:55:43,130
features you kind of rely on and this is
kind of a nice reminder when you lay it

10142
02:55:43,130 --> 02:55:43,140
kind of a nice reminder when you lay it
 

10143
02:55:43,140 --> 02:55:45,650
kind of a nice reminder when you lay it
as a to-do list yeah and so I mean but

10144
02:55:45,650 --> 02:55:45,660
as a to-do list yeah and so I mean but
 

10145
02:55:45,660 --> 02:55:46,969
as a to-do list yeah and so I mean but
also you look into

10146
02:55:46,969 --> 02:55:46,979
also you look into
 

10147
02:55:46,979 --> 02:55:48,950
also you look into
it's it's amazing how much is also there

10148
02:55:48,950 --> 02:55:48,960
it's it's amazing how much is also there
 

10149
02:55:48,960 --> 02:55:51,710
it's it's amazing how much is also there
and you take it for granted that

10150
02:55:51,710 --> 02:55:51,720
and you take it for granted that
 

10151
02:55:51,720 --> 02:55:54,830
and you take it for granted that
um a value if you define it it will get

10152
02:55:54,830 --> 02:55:54,840
um a value if you define it it will get
 

10153
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:56,630
um a value if you define it it will get
destroyed automatically

10154
02:55:56,630 --> 02:55:56,640
destroyed automatically
 

10155
02:55:56,640 --> 02:55:58,309
destroyed automatically
like that little feature itself is

10156
02:55:58,309 --> 02:55:58,319
like that little feature itself is
 

10157
02:55:58,319 --> 02:56:00,290
like that little feature itself is
actually really complicated given the

10158
02:56:00,290 --> 02:56:00,300
actually really complicated given the
 

10159
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:02,269
actually really complicated given the
way the ownership system has to work and

10160
02:56:02,269 --> 02:56:02,279
way the ownership system has to work and
 

10161
02:56:02,279 --> 02:56:04,550
way the ownership system has to work and
the way that works within Mojo is a huge

10162
02:56:04,550 --> 02:56:04,560
the way that works within Mojo is a huge
 

10163
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:06,170
the way that works within Mojo is a huge
step forward from what Russ and Swift

10164
02:56:06,170 --> 02:56:06,180
step forward from what Russ and Swift
 

10165
02:56:06,180 --> 02:56:07,910
step forward from what Russ and Swift
have done can you say that again when a

10166
02:56:07,910 --> 02:56:07,920
have done can you say that again when a
 

10167
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:09,950
have done can you say that again when a
value when you define it gets destroyed

10168
02:56:09,950 --> 02:56:09,960
value when you define it gets destroyed
 

10169
02:56:09,960 --> 02:56:11,990
value when you define it gets destroyed
yeah so like say you have a string right

10170
02:56:11,990 --> 02:56:12,000
yeah so like say you have a string right
 

10171
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:13,309
yeah so like say you have a string right
so you just find a string on the stack

10172
02:56:13,309 --> 02:56:13,319
so you just find a string on the stack
 

10173
02:56:13,319 --> 02:56:15,950
so you just find a string on the stack
okay whatever that means like in in your

10174
02:56:15,950 --> 02:56:15,960
okay whatever that means like in in your
 

10175
02:56:15,960 --> 02:56:17,330
okay whatever that means like in in your
local function

10176
02:56:17,330 --> 02:56:17,340
local function
 

10177
02:56:17,340 --> 02:56:20,330
local function
right and so you say uh like whether it

10178
02:56:20,330 --> 02:56:20,340
right and so you say uh like whether it
 

10179
02:56:20,340 --> 02:56:22,309
right and so you say uh like whether it
being a deaf once they just say x equals

10180
02:56:22,309 --> 02:56:22,319
being a deaf once they just say x equals
 

10181
02:56:22,319 --> 02:56:25,190
being a deaf once they just say x equals
hello world right well if your string

10182
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:25,200
hello world right well if your string
 

10183
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:27,769
hello world right well if your string
type requires you to allocate memory

10184
02:56:27,769 --> 02:56:27,779
type requires you to allocate memory
 

10185
02:56:27,779 --> 02:56:29,269
type requires you to allocate memory
then when it's destroyed you have to

10186
02:56:29,269 --> 02:56:29,279
then when it's destroyed you have to
 

10187
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:32,150
then when it's destroyed you have to
deallocate it so in Python and Mojo you

10188
02:56:32,150 --> 02:56:32,160
deallocate it so in Python and Mojo you
 

10189
02:56:32,160 --> 02:56:34,210
deallocate it so in Python and Mojo you
define that with the Dell method right

10190
02:56:34,210 --> 02:56:34,220
define that with the Dell method right
 

10191
02:56:34,220 --> 02:56:38,530
define that with the Dell method right
where does that get run

10192
02:56:38,530 --> 02:56:38,540

 

10193
02:56:38,540 --> 02:56:42,230

well it gets run sometime between the

10194
02:56:42,230 --> 02:56:42,240
well it gets run sometime between the
 

10195
02:56:42,240 --> 02:56:45,170
well it gets run sometime between the
last use of the value and

10196
02:56:45,170 --> 02:56:45,180
last use of the value and
 

10197
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:48,230
last use of the value and
the end of the program like in this you

10198
02:56:48,230 --> 02:56:48,240
the end of the program like in this you
 

10199
02:56:48,240 --> 02:56:49,790
the end of the program like in this you
know get into a garbage collection you

10200
02:56:49,790 --> 02:56:49,800
know get into a garbage collection you
 

10201
02:56:49,800 --> 02:56:52,190
know get into a garbage collection you
get into like all these long debated you

10202
02:56:52,190 --> 02:56:52,200
get into like all these long debated you
 

10203
02:56:52,200 --> 02:56:55,610
get into like all these long debated you
talk about religions and and trade-offs

10204
02:56:55,610 --> 02:56:55,620
talk about religions and and trade-offs
 

10205
02:56:55,620 --> 02:56:57,050
talk about religions and and trade-offs
and things like this this is a hugely

10206
02:56:57,050 --> 02:56:57,060
and things like this this is a hugely
 

10207
02:56:57,060 --> 02:56:59,150
and things like this this is a hugely
hotly contested world

10208
02:56:59,150 --> 02:56:59,160
hotly contested world
 

10209
02:56:59,160 --> 02:57:01,190
hotly contested world
if you look at C plus plus the way this

10210
02:57:01,190 --> 02:57:01,200
if you look at C plus plus the way this
 

10211
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:02,630
if you look at C plus plus the way this
works is that

10212
02:57:02,630 --> 02:57:02,640
works is that
 

10213
02:57:02,640 --> 02:57:04,910
works is that
if you define a variable or a set of

10214
02:57:04,910 --> 02:57:04,920
if you define a variable or a set of
 

10215
02:57:04,920 --> 02:57:06,950
if you define a variable or a set of
variables within a function they get

10216
02:57:06,950 --> 02:57:06,960
variables within a function they get
 

10217
02:57:06,960 --> 02:57:10,190
variables within a function they get
destroyed in a last in first out order

10218
02:57:10,190 --> 02:57:10,200
destroyed in a last in first out order
 

10219
02:57:10,200 --> 02:57:13,490
destroyed in a last in first out order
so it's like nesting okay

10220
02:57:13,490 --> 02:57:13,500
so it's like nesting okay
 

10221
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:15,110
so it's like nesting okay
um this has a huge problem because if

10222
02:57:15,110 --> 02:57:15,120
um this has a huge problem because if
 

10223
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:17,090
um this has a huge problem because if
you define you have a big scope I need

10224
02:57:17,090 --> 02:57:17,100
you define you have a big scope I need
 

10225
02:57:17,100 --> 02:57:18,230
you define you have a big scope I need
to find a whole bunch of values at the

10226
02:57:18,230 --> 02:57:18,240
to find a whole bunch of values at the
 

10227
02:57:18,240 --> 02:57:20,450
to find a whole bunch of values at the
top and then you use them and then you

10228
02:57:20,450 --> 02:57:20,460
top and then you use them and then you
 

10229
02:57:20,460 --> 02:57:21,710
top and then you use them and then you
do a whole bunch of code that doesn't

10230
02:57:21,710 --> 02:57:21,720
do a whole bunch of code that doesn't
 

10231
02:57:21,720 --> 02:57:23,630
do a whole bunch of code that doesn't
use them they don't get destroyed until

10232
02:57:23,630 --> 02:57:23,640
use them they don't get destroyed until
 

10233
02:57:23,640 --> 02:57:26,450
use them they don't get destroyed until
the very end of that scope right and so

10234
02:57:26,450 --> 02:57:26,460
the very end of that scope right and so
 

10235
02:57:26,460 --> 02:57:28,730
the very end of that scope right and so
this also destroys tail calls it's a

10236
02:57:28,730 --> 02:57:28,740
this also destroys tail calls it's a
 

10237
02:57:28,740 --> 02:57:30,410
this also destroys tail calls it's a
good functional programming right this

10238
02:57:30,410 --> 02:57:30,420
good functional programming right this
 

10239
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:32,570
good functional programming right this
this has a bunch of different impacts on

10240
02:57:32,570 --> 02:57:32,580
this has a bunch of different impacts on
 

10241
02:57:32,580 --> 02:57:34,190
this has a bunch of different impacts on
um you know you talk about reference

10242
02:57:34,190 --> 02:57:34,200
um you know you talk about reference
 

10243
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:35,570
um you know you talk about reference
counting optimizations and things like

10244
02:57:35,570 --> 02:57:35,580
counting optimizations and things like
 

10245
02:57:35,580 --> 02:57:37,309
counting optimizations and things like
this a bunch of very low level things

10246
02:57:37,309 --> 02:57:37,319
this a bunch of very low level things
 

10247
02:57:37,319 --> 02:57:40,190
this a bunch of very low level things
and so what Mojo does it has a different

10248
02:57:40,190 --> 02:57:40,200
and so what Mojo does it has a different
 

10249
02:57:40,200 --> 02:57:42,410
and so what Mojo does it has a different
approach on that from any language I'm

10250
02:57:42,410 --> 02:57:42,420
approach on that from any language I'm
 

10251
02:57:42,420 --> 02:57:44,090
approach on that from any language I'm
familiar with where it destroys them as

10252
02:57:44,090 --> 02:57:44,100
familiar with where it destroys them as
 

10253
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:46,190
familiar with where it destroys them as
soon as possible

10254
02:57:46,190 --> 02:57:46,200
soon as possible
 

10255
02:57:46,200 --> 02:57:48,050
soon as possible
and by doing that you get better memory

10256
02:57:48,050 --> 02:57:48,060
and by doing that you get better memory
 

10257
02:57:48,060 --> 02:57:49,790
and by doing that you get better memory
use you get better predictability you

10258
02:57:49,790 --> 02:57:49,800
use you get better predictability you
 

10259
02:57:49,800 --> 02:57:51,830
use you get better predictability you
get tail calls that work like you get a

10260
02:57:51,830 --> 02:57:51,840
get tail calls that work like you get a
 

10261
02:57:51,840 --> 02:57:53,330
get tail calls that work like you get a
bunch of other things you get better

10262
02:57:53,330 --> 02:57:53,340
bunch of other things you get better
 

10263
02:57:53,340 --> 02:57:54,889
bunch of other things you get better
ownership tracking there's a bunch of

10264
02:57:54,889 --> 02:57:54,899
ownership tracking there's a bunch of
 

10265
02:57:54,899 --> 02:57:57,469
ownership tracking there's a bunch of
these very simple things that are very

10266
02:57:57,469 --> 02:57:57,479
these very simple things that are very
 

10267
02:57:57,479 --> 02:58:00,050
these very simple things that are very
fundamental that are already built in

10268
02:58:00,050 --> 02:58:00,060
fundamental that are already built in
 

10269
02:58:00,060 --> 02:58:02,210
fundamental that are already built in
there in Mojo today that are the things

10270
02:58:02,210 --> 02:58:02,220
there in Mojo today that are the things
 

10271
02:58:02,220 --> 02:58:04,309
there in Mojo today that are the things
that nobody talks about generally but

10272
02:58:04,309 --> 02:58:04,319
that nobody talks about generally but
 

10273
02:58:04,319 --> 02:58:06,050
that nobody talks about generally but
when they don't work right you find out

10274
02:58:06,050 --> 02:58:06,060
when they don't work right you find out
 

10275
02:58:06,060 --> 02:58:08,389
when they don't work right you find out
and you have to complain about is it

10276
02:58:08,389 --> 02:58:08,399
and you have to complain about is it
 

10277
02:58:08,399 --> 02:58:09,910
and you have to complain about is it
trivial to know

10278
02:58:09,910 --> 02:58:09,920
trivial to know
 

10279
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:12,290
trivial to know
uh what's the soonest possible to delete

10280
02:58:12,290 --> 02:58:12,300
uh what's the soonest possible to delete
 

10281
02:58:12,300 --> 02:58:13,610
uh what's the soonest possible to delete
a thing that's not going to be used

10282
02:58:13,610 --> 02:58:13,620
a thing that's not going to be used
 

10283
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:15,590
a thing that's not going to be used
again yeah well I mean it's generally

10284
02:58:15,590 --> 02:58:15,600
again yeah well I mean it's generally
 

10285
02:58:15,600 --> 02:58:17,330
again yeah well I mean it's generally
trivial it's it's after the last use of

10286
02:58:17,330 --> 02:58:17,340
trivial it's it's after the last use of
 

10287
02:58:17,340 --> 02:58:19,730
trivial it's it's after the last use of
it so if you find X as a string and then

10288
02:58:19,730 --> 02:58:19,740
it so if you find X as a string and then
 

10289
02:58:19,740 --> 02:58:21,710
it so if you find X as a string and then
you have some use of X somewhere in your

10290
02:58:21,710 --> 02:58:21,720
you have some use of X somewhere in your
 

10291
02:58:21,720 --> 02:58:23,750
you have some use of X somewhere in your
code within that scope I mean within the

10292
02:58:23,750 --> 02:58:23,760
code within that scope I mean within the
 

10293
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:25,730
code within that scope I mean within the
scope that's accessible it's yeah

10294
02:58:25,730 --> 02:58:25,740
scope that's accessible it's yeah
 

10295
02:58:25,740 --> 02:58:27,110
scope that's accessible it's yeah
exactly so you can only use something

10296
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:27,120
exactly so you can only use something
 

10297
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:29,570
exactly so you can only use something
within its scope and so then it doesn't

10298
02:58:29,570 --> 02:58:29,580
within its scope and so then it doesn't
 

10299
02:58:29,580 --> 02:58:30,830
within its scope and so then it doesn't
wait until the end of the script to

10300
02:58:30,830 --> 02:58:30,840
wait until the end of the script to
 

10301
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:33,710
wait until the end of the script to
delete it it destroys it after the last

10302
02:58:33,710 --> 02:58:33,720
delete it it destroys it after the last
 

10303
02:58:33,720 --> 02:58:36,469
delete it it destroys it after the last
years so there's kind of some very ego

10304
02:58:36,469 --> 02:58:36,479
years so there's kind of some very ego
 

10305
02:58:36,479 --> 02:58:37,910
years so there's kind of some very ego
machine that's just sitting there and

10306
02:58:37,910 --> 02:58:37,920
machine that's just sitting there and
 

10307
02:58:37,920 --> 02:58:39,170
machine that's just sitting there and
deleting yeah and it's all in the

10308
02:58:39,170 --> 02:58:39,180
deleting yeah and it's all in the
 

10309
02:58:39,180 --> 02:58:40,790
deleting yeah and it's all in the
compiler so it's not at runtime which is

10310
02:58:40,790 --> 02:58:40,800
compiler so it's not at runtime which is
 

10311
02:58:40,800 --> 02:58:45,590
compiler so it's not at runtime which is
also cool and so yeah and so what and

10312
02:58:45,590 --> 02:58:45,600
also cool and so yeah and so what and
 

10313
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:46,910
also cool and so yeah and so what and
this is actually non-trivial because you

10314
02:58:46,910 --> 02:58:46,920
this is actually non-trivial because you
 

10315
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:49,250
this is actually non-trivial because you
have control flow right and so it gets

10316
02:58:49,250 --> 02:58:49,260
have control flow right and so it gets
 

10317
02:58:49,260 --> 02:58:50,570
have control flow right and so it gets
complicated pretty quickly and so like

10318
02:58:50,570 --> 02:58:50,580
complicated pretty quickly and so like
 

10319
02:58:50,580 --> 02:58:52,370
complicated pretty quickly and so like
getting straight was not also you have

10320
02:58:52,370 --> 02:58:52,380
getting straight was not also you have
 

10321
02:58:52,380 --> 02:58:53,929
getting straight was not also you have
to insert delete like in a lot of places

10322
02:58:53,929 --> 02:58:53,939
to insert delete like in a lot of places
 

10323
02:58:53,939 --> 02:58:56,450
to insert delete like in a lot of places
potentially yeah exactly so the compiler

10324
02:58:56,450 --> 02:58:56,460
potentially yeah exactly so the compiler
 

10325
02:58:56,460 --> 02:58:57,769
potentially yeah exactly so the compiler
asks a reason about this and this is

10326
02:58:57,769 --> 02:58:57,779
asks a reason about this and this is
 

10327
02:58:57,779 --> 02:58:59,389
asks a reason about this and this is
where again it's experience building

10328
02:58:59,389 --> 02:58:59,399
where again it's experience building
 

10329
02:58:59,399 --> 02:59:01,550
where again it's experience building
languages and not getting this right so

10330
02:59:01,550 --> 02:59:01,560
languages and not getting this right so
 

10331
02:59:01,560 --> 02:59:02,990
languages and not getting this right so
again you get another chance to do it

10332
02:59:02,990 --> 02:59:03,000
again you get another chance to do it
 

10333
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,269
again you get another chance to do it
and you get basic things like this right

10334
02:59:05,269 --> 02:59:05,279
and you get basic things like this right
 

10335
02:59:05,279 --> 02:59:07,309
and you get basic things like this right
but it's it's extremely powerful when

10336
02:59:07,309 --> 02:59:07,319
but it's it's extremely powerful when
 

10337
02:59:07,319 --> 02:59:09,170
but it's it's extremely powerful when
you do that right and so there's a bunch

10338
02:59:09,170 --> 02:59:09,180
you do that right and so there's a bunch
 

10339
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:10,969
you do that right and so there's a bunch
of things like that that kind of combine

10340
02:59:10,969 --> 02:59:10,979
of things like that that kind of combine
 

10341
02:59:10,979 --> 02:59:12,110
of things like that that kind of combine
together

10342
02:59:12,110 --> 02:59:12,120
together
 

10343
02:59:12,120 --> 02:59:14,330
together
and this comes back to the you get a

10344
02:59:14,330 --> 02:59:14,340
and this comes back to the you get a
 

10345
02:59:14,340 --> 02:59:15,950
and this comes back to the you get a
chance to do it the right way do it the

10346
02:59:15,950 --> 02:59:15,960
chance to do it the right way do it the
 

10347
02:59:15,960 --> 02:59:17,389
chance to do it the right way do it the
right way and make sure that every brick

10348
02:59:17,389 --> 02:59:17,399
right way and make sure that every brick
 

10349
02:59:17,399 --> 02:59:19,429
right way and make sure that every brick
you put down is really good so that when

10350
02:59:19,429 --> 02:59:19,439
you put down is really good so that when
 

10351
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:20,990
you put down is really good so that when
you put more bricks on top of it they

10352
02:59:20,990 --> 02:59:21,000
you put more bricks on top of it they
 

10353
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:22,250
you put more bricks on top of it they
stack up to something that's beautiful

10354
02:59:22,250 --> 02:59:22,260
stack up to something that's beautiful
 

10355
02:59:22,260 --> 02:59:24,170
stack up to something that's beautiful
well there's also

10356
02:59:24,170 --> 02:59:24,180
well there's also
 

10357
02:59:24,180 --> 02:59:26,570
well there's also
like how many

10358
02:59:26,570 --> 02:59:26,580
like how many
 

10359
02:59:26,580 --> 02:59:29,389
like how many
design discussions do there have to be

10360
02:59:29,389 --> 02:59:29,399
design discussions do there have to be
 

10361
02:59:29,399 --> 02:59:30,769
design discussions do there have to be
about particular details like

10362
02:59:30,769 --> 02:59:30,779
about particular details like
 

10363
02:59:30,779 --> 02:59:32,389
about particular details like
implementation of particular small

10364
02:59:32,389 --> 02:59:32,399
implementation of particular small
 

10365
02:59:32,399 --> 02:59:35,210
implementation of particular small
features because the features that

10366
02:59:35,210 --> 02:59:35,220
features because the features that
 

10367
02:59:35,220 --> 02:59:38,389
features because the features that
seem small I bet some of them might be

10368
02:59:38,389 --> 02:59:38,399
seem small I bet some of them might be
 

10369
02:59:38,399 --> 02:59:39,410
seem small I bet some of them might be
like

10370
02:59:39,410 --> 02:59:39,420
like
 

10371
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:42,170
like
really uh require really big design

10372
02:59:42,170 --> 02:59:42,180
really uh require really big design
 

10373
02:59:42,180 --> 02:59:44,450
really uh require really big design
decisions yeah well so I mean let me

10374
02:59:44,450 --> 02:59:44,460
decisions yeah well so I mean let me
 

10375
02:59:44,460 --> 02:59:46,190
decisions yeah well so I mean let me
give you another example of this python

10376
02:59:46,190 --> 02:59:46,200
give you another example of this python
 

10377
02:59:46,200 --> 02:59:48,710
give you another example of this python
has a feature called async await so it's

10378
02:59:48,710 --> 02:59:48,720
has a feature called async await so it's
 

10379
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:51,710
has a feature called async await so it's
it's a new feature I mean in in the long

10380
02:59:51,710 --> 02:59:51,720
it's a new feature I mean in in the long
 

10381
02:59:51,720 --> 02:59:54,110
it's a new feature I mean in in the long
arguments on History it's a relatively

10382
02:59:54,110 --> 02:59:54,120
arguments on History it's a relatively
 

10383
02:59:54,120 --> 02:59:57,110
arguments on History it's a relatively
new feature right that allows way more

10384
02:59:57,110 --> 02:59:57,120
new feature right that allows way more
 

10385
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:59,450
new feature right that allows way more
expressive asynchronous programming okay

10386
02:59:59,450 --> 02:59:59,460
expressive asynchronous programming okay
 

10387
02:59:59,460 --> 03:00:02,090
expressive asynchronous programming okay
again this is this is a Python's a

10388
03:00:02,090 --> 03:00:02,100
again this is this is a Python's a
 

10389
03:00:02,100 --> 03:00:03,650
again this is this is a Python's a
beautiful thing and they did things that

10390
03:00:03,650 --> 03:00:03,660
beautiful thing and they did things that
 

10391
03:00:03,660 --> 03:00:05,269
beautiful thing and they did things that
are great for Mojo for completely

10392
03:00:05,269 --> 03:00:05,279
are great for Mojo for completely
 

10393
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:07,010
are great for Mojo for completely
different reasons

10394
03:00:07,010 --> 03:00:07,020
different reasons
 

10395
03:00:07,020 --> 03:00:08,809
different reasons
um the reason that async await got added

10396
03:00:08,809 --> 03:00:08,819
um the reason that async await got added
 

10397
03:00:08,819 --> 03:00:11,030
um the reason that async await got added
to python as far as I know is because

10398
03:00:11,030 --> 03:00:11,040
to python as far as I know is because
 

10399
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:13,250
to python as far as I know is because
python doesn't support threads

10400
03:00:13,250 --> 03:00:13,260
python doesn't support threads
 

10401
03:00:13,260 --> 03:00:16,070
python doesn't support threads
okay and so python doesn't support

10402
03:00:16,070 --> 03:00:16,080
okay and so python doesn't support
 

10403
03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:17,929
okay and so python doesn't support
threads but you want to work with

10404
03:00:17,929 --> 03:00:17,939
threads but you want to work with
 

10405
03:00:17,939 --> 03:00:19,610
threads but you want to work with
networking and other things like that

10406
03:00:19,610 --> 03:00:19,620
networking and other things like that
 

10407
03:00:19,620 --> 03:00:21,469
networking and other things like that
that can block I mean python does

10408
03:00:21,469 --> 03:00:21,479
that can block I mean python does
 

10409
03:00:21,479 --> 03:00:22,790
that can block I mean python does
support threads it's just not its

10410
03:00:22,790 --> 03:00:22,800
support threads it's just not its
 

10411
03:00:22,800 --> 03:00:24,530
support threads it's just not its
strength and so

10412
03:00:24,530 --> 03:00:24,540
strength and so
 

10413
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:25,309
strength and so
um

10414
03:00:25,309 --> 03:00:25,319
um
 

10415
03:00:25,319 --> 03:00:27,230
um
and so they added this feature called

10416
03:00:27,230 --> 03:00:27,240
and so they added this feature called
 

10417
03:00:27,240 --> 03:00:28,790
and so they added this feature called
async await it's also seen in other

10418
03:00:28,790 --> 03:00:28,800
async await it's also seen in other
 

10419
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:31,130
async await it's also seen in other
languages like Swift and JavaScript and

10420
03:00:31,130 --> 03:00:31,140
languages like Swift and JavaScript and
 

10421
03:00:31,140 --> 03:00:33,349
languages like Swift and JavaScript and
many other places as well

10422
03:00:33,349 --> 03:00:33,359
many other places as well
 

10423
03:00:33,359 --> 03:00:35,690
many other places as well
um async wait and Mojo's amazing because

10424
03:00:35,690 --> 03:00:35,700
um async wait and Mojo's amazing because
 

10425
03:00:35,700 --> 03:00:37,190
um async wait and Mojo's amazing because
we have a high performance heterogeneous

10426
03:00:37,190 --> 03:00:37,200
we have a high performance heterogeneous
 

10427
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:39,050
we have a high performance heterogeneous
compute runtime underneath the covers

10428
03:00:39,050 --> 03:00:39,060
compute runtime underneath the covers
 

10429
03:00:39,060 --> 03:00:43,010
compute runtime underneath the covers
that then allows non-blocking IO so you

10430
03:00:43,010 --> 03:00:43,020
that then allows non-blocking IO so you
 

10431
03:00:43,020 --> 03:00:46,130
that then allows non-blocking IO so you
get full use of your accelerator that's

10432
03:00:46,130 --> 03:00:46,140
get full use of your accelerator that's
 

10433
03:00:46,140 --> 03:00:47,870
get full use of your accelerator that's
huge it turns out it's actually really

10434
03:00:47,870 --> 03:00:47,880
huge it turns out it's actually really
 

10435
03:00:47,880 --> 03:00:50,030
huge it turns out it's actually really
an important part of fully utilizing a

10436
03:00:50,030 --> 03:00:50,040
an important part of fully utilizing a
 

10437
03:00:50,040 --> 03:00:51,469
an important part of fully utilizing a
machine you talk about design

10438
03:00:51,469 --> 03:00:51,479
machine you talk about design
 

10439
03:00:51,479 --> 03:00:53,690
machine you talk about design
discussions that took a lot of

10440
03:00:53,690 --> 03:00:53,700
discussions that took a lot of
 

10441
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:55,610
discussions that took a lot of
discussions right and it probably will

10442
03:00:55,610 --> 03:00:55,620
discussions right and it probably will
 

10443
03:00:55,620 --> 03:00:58,130
discussions right and it probably will
require more iteration and so My

10444
03:00:58,130 --> 03:00:58,140
require more iteration and so My
 

10445
03:00:58,140 --> 03:00:59,809
require more iteration and so My
Philosophy with Mojo is that you know we

10446
03:00:59,809 --> 03:00:59,819
Philosophy with Mojo is that you know we
 

10447
03:00:59,819 --> 03:01:01,190
Philosophy with Mojo is that you know we
have a small team of really good people

10448
03:01:01,190 --> 03:01:01,200
have a small team of really good people
 

10449
03:01:01,200 --> 03:01:02,809
have a small team of really good people
that are pushing forward and they're

10450
03:01:02,809 --> 03:01:02,819
that are pushing forward and they're
 

10451
03:01:02,819 --> 03:01:05,750
that are pushing forward and they're
very good at the extremely deep knowing

10452
03:01:05,750 --> 03:01:05,760
very good at the extremely deep knowing
 

10453
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:07,250
very good at the extremely deep knowing
how the compiler and runtime and like

10454
03:01:07,250 --> 03:01:07,260
how the compiler and runtime and like
 

10455
03:01:07,260 --> 03:01:09,050
how the compiler and runtime and like
all the the low-level stuff works

10456
03:01:09,050 --> 03:01:09,060
all the the low-level stuff works
 

10457
03:01:09,060 --> 03:01:10,550
all the the low-level stuff works
together

10458
03:01:10,550 --> 03:01:10,560
together
 

10459
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:11,870
together
um but they're not perfect the same

10460
03:01:11,870 --> 03:01:11,880
um but they're not perfect the same
 

10461
03:01:11,880 --> 03:01:13,490
um but they're not perfect the same
thing as the Swift team right and this

10462
03:01:13,490 --> 03:01:13,500
thing as the Swift team right and this
 

10463
03:01:13,500 --> 03:01:15,469
thing as the Swift team right and this
is where one of the reasons we released

10464
03:01:15,469 --> 03:01:15,479
is where one of the reasons we released
 

10465
03:01:15,479 --> 03:01:17,690
is where one of the reasons we released
Mojo much earlier is so we can get

10466
03:01:17,690 --> 03:01:17,700
Mojo much earlier is so we can get
 

10467
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:19,610
Mojo much earlier is so we can get
feedback and we've already like renamed

10468
03:01:19,610 --> 03:01:19,620
feedback and we've already like renamed
 

10469
03:01:19,620 --> 03:01:22,010
feedback and we've already like renamed
a keyword and did a community feedback

10470
03:01:22,010 --> 03:01:22,020
a keyword and did a community feedback
 

10471
03:01:22,020 --> 03:01:25,070
a keyword and did a community feedback
and which one uh we use an ampersand and

10472
03:01:25,070 --> 03:01:25,080
and which one uh we use an ampersand and
 

10473
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:27,769
and which one uh we use an ampersand and
now it's named in out we're not renaming

10474
03:01:27,769 --> 03:01:27,779
now it's named in out we're not renaming
 

10475
03:01:27,779 --> 03:01:29,210
now it's named in out we're not renaming
existing python keywords because that

10476
03:01:29,210 --> 03:01:29,220
existing python keywords because that
 

10477
03:01:29,220 --> 03:01:30,710
existing python keywords because that
breaks compatibility right we're

10478
03:01:30,710 --> 03:01:30,720
breaks compatibility right we're
 

10479
03:01:30,720 --> 03:01:33,170
breaks compatibility right we're
renaming things we're adding and making

10480
03:01:33,170 --> 03:01:33,180
renaming things we're adding and making
 

10481
03:01:33,180 --> 03:01:35,630
renaming things we're adding and making
sure that they are designed well we get

10482
03:01:35,630 --> 03:01:35,640
sure that they are designed well we get
 

10483
03:01:35,640 --> 03:01:37,429
sure that they are designed well we get
usage experience we iterate and work

10484
03:01:37,429 --> 03:01:37,439
usage experience we iterate and work
 

10485
03:01:37,439 --> 03:01:39,650
usage experience we iterate and work
with the community because again if you

10486
03:01:39,650 --> 03:01:39,660
with the community because again if you
 

10487
03:01:39,660 --> 03:01:40,610
with the community because again if you
scale something really fast and

10488
03:01:40,610 --> 03:01:40,620
scale something really fast and
 

10489
03:01:40,620 --> 03:01:41,690
scale something really fast and
everybody write the older code and they

10490
03:01:41,690 --> 03:01:41,700
everybody write the older code and they
 

10491
03:01:41,700 --> 03:01:43,250
everybody write the older code and they
start using it in production then it's

10492
03:01:43,250 --> 03:01:43,260
start using it in production then it's
 

10493
03:01:43,260 --> 03:01:45,290
start using it in production then it's
impossible to change and so you want to

10494
03:01:45,290 --> 03:01:45,300
impossible to change and so you want to
 

10495
03:01:45,300 --> 03:01:46,969
impossible to change and so you want to
learn from people you want to iterate

10496
03:01:46,969 --> 03:01:46,979
learn from people you want to iterate
 

10497
03:01:46,979 --> 03:01:48,889
learn from people you want to iterate
and work on that early on and this is

10498
03:01:48,889 --> 03:01:48,899
and work on that early on and this is
 

10499
03:01:48,899 --> 03:01:50,570
and work on that early on and this is
where design discussions it's it's

10500
03:01:50,570 --> 03:01:50,580
where design discussions it's it's
 

10501
03:01:50,580 --> 03:01:52,250
where design discussions it's it's
actually quite important could you could

10502
03:01:52,250 --> 03:01:52,260
actually quite important could you could
 

10503
03:01:52,260 --> 03:01:54,590
actually quite important could you could
you incorporate an emoji like into the

10504
03:01:54,590 --> 03:01:54,600
you incorporate an emoji like into the
 

10505
03:01:54,600 --> 03:01:57,490
you incorporate an emoji like into the
language into the main language

10506
03:01:57,490 --> 03:01:57,500
language into the main language
 

10507
03:01:57,500 --> 03:02:00,410
language into the main language
do you have a favorite one well I really

like uh in terms of humor like uh RAW

10510
03:02:03,530 --> 03:02:03,540
like uh in terms of humor like uh RAW
 

10511
03:02:03,540 --> 03:02:05,030

full whatever rolling on the floor

10512
03:02:05,030 --> 03:02:05,040
full whatever rolling on the floor

laughing
 

10515
03:02:06,180 --> 03:02:08,690
laughing
so that could be like a

10516
03:02:08,690 --> 03:02:08,700
so that could be like a
 

10517
03:02:08,700 --> 03:02:10,429
so that could be like a
what would that be the use case for that

10518
03:02:10,429 --> 03:02:10,439
what would that be the use case for that
 

10519
03:02:10,439 --> 03:02:12,230
what would that be the use case for that
I can accept throw an exception of some

liking this
I'm gonna I'm gonna use the viral nature

10534
03:02:26,929 --> 03:02:26,939
I'm gonna I'm gonna use the viral nature
 

10535
03:02:26,939 --> 03:02:28,910
I'm gonna I'm gonna use the viral nature
of the internet to actually get this to

10536
03:02:28,910 --> 03:02:28,920
of the internet to actually get this to
 

10537
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:31,070
of the internet to actually get this to
get this passed uh I mean it's funny you

10538
03:02:31,070 --> 03:02:31,080
get this passed uh I mean it's funny you
 

10539
03:02:31,080 --> 03:02:32,570
get this passed uh I mean it's funny you
come back to the flame Emoji file

10540
03:02:32,570 --> 03:02:32,580
come back to the flame Emoji file
 

10541
03:02:32,580 --> 03:02:35,809
come back to the flame Emoji file
extension right the uh um you know we

10542
03:02:35,809 --> 03:02:35,819
extension right the uh um you know we
 

10543
03:02:35,819 --> 03:02:37,670
extension right the uh um you know we
have the option to use the flame Emoji

10544
03:02:37,670 --> 03:02:37,680
have the option to use the flame Emoji
 

10545
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:40,969
have the option to use the flame Emoji
which just even that concept because for

10546
03:02:40,969 --> 03:02:40,979
which just even that concept because for
 

10547
03:02:40,979 --> 03:02:42,830
which just even that concept because for
example the people at GitHub say no I've

10548
03:02:42,830 --> 03:02:42,840
example the people at GitHub say no I've
 

10549
03:02:42,840 --> 03:02:45,170
example the people at GitHub say no I've
seen everything like

10550
03:02:45,170 --> 03:02:45,180
seen everything like
 

10551
03:02:45,180 --> 03:02:47,870
seen everything like
yeah there's something uh it kind of

10552
03:02:47,870 --> 03:02:47,880
yeah there's something uh it kind of
 

10553
03:02:47,880 --> 03:02:50,690
yeah there's something uh it kind of
it's reinvigorating it's like uh

10554
03:02:50,690 --> 03:02:50,700
it's reinvigorating it's like uh
 

10555
03:02:50,700 --> 03:02:52,610
it's reinvigorating it's like uh
it's like oh that's possible that's

10556
03:02:52,610 --> 03:02:52,620
it's like oh that's possible that's
 

10557
03:02:52,620 --> 03:02:54,769
it's like oh that's possible that's
really cool that for some reason that

10558
03:02:54,769 --> 03:02:54,779
really cool that for some reason that
 

10559
03:02:54,779 --> 03:02:56,090
really cool that for some reason that
makes everything else actually I'm

10560
03:02:56,090 --> 03:02:56,100
makes everything else actually I'm
 

10561
03:02:56,100 --> 03:02:57,590
makes everything else actually I'm
really excited the world is ready for

10562
03:02:57,590 --> 03:02:57,600
really excited the world is ready for
 

10563
03:02:57,600 --> 03:02:59,210
really excited the world is ready for
this stuff right and so you know when we

10564
03:02:59,210 --> 03:02:59,220
this stuff right and so you know when we
 

10565
03:02:59,220 --> 03:03:00,530
this stuff right and so you know when we
have a package manager we'll clearly

10566
03:03:00,530 --> 03:03:00,540
have a package manager we'll clearly
 

10567
03:03:00,540 --> 03:03:02,809
have a package manager we'll clearly
have to innovate by having the compiled

10568
03:03:02,809 --> 03:03:02,819
have to innovate by having the compiled
 

10569
03:03:02,819 --> 03:03:05,210
have to innovate by having the compiled
package thing be the little box with the

10570
03:03:05,210 --> 03:03:05,220
package thing be the little box with the
 

10571
03:03:05,220 --> 03:03:07,670
package thing be the little box with the
bow on it right I mean

10572
03:03:07,670 --> 03:03:07,680
bow on it right I mean
 

10573
03:03:07,680 --> 03:03:09,889
bow on it right I mean
it has to be done it has to be done is

10574
03:03:09,889 --> 03:03:09,899
it has to be done it has to be done is
 

10575
03:03:09,899 --> 03:03:11,510
it has to be done it has to be done is
there some stuff on the road map that

10576
03:03:11,510 --> 03:03:11,520
there some stuff on the road map that
 

10577
03:03:11,520 --> 03:03:14,030
there some stuff on the road map that
you're particularly stressed about or

10578
03:03:14,030 --> 03:03:14,040
you're particularly stressed about or
 

10579
03:03:14,040 --> 03:03:15,410
you're particularly stressed about or
excited about that you're thinking about

10580
03:03:15,410 --> 03:03:15,420
excited about that you're thinking about
 

10581
03:03:15,420 --> 03:03:18,410
excited about that you're thinking about
a lot I mean as a today snapshot which

10582
03:03:18,410 --> 03:03:18,420
a lot I mean as a today snapshot which
 

10583
03:03:18,420 --> 03:03:20,269
a lot I mean as a today snapshot which
will be obviously tomorrow uh the

10584
03:03:20,269 --> 03:03:20,279
will be obviously tomorrow uh the
 

10585
03:03:20,279 --> 03:03:22,250
will be obviously tomorrow uh the
lifetime stuff is really exciting and so

10586
03:03:22,250 --> 03:03:22,260
lifetime stuff is really exciting and so
 

10587
03:03:22,260 --> 03:03:25,550
lifetime stuff is really exciting and so
lifetimes give you safe references to

10588
03:03:25,550 --> 03:03:25,560
lifetimes give you safe references to
 

10589
03:03:25,560 --> 03:03:28,250
lifetimes give you safe references to
memory without dangling pointers and so

10590
03:03:28,250 --> 03:03:28,260
memory without dangling pointers and so
 

10591
03:03:28,260 --> 03:03:29,570
memory without dangling pointers and so
this has been done in languages like

10592
03:03:29,570 --> 03:03:29,580
this has been done in languages like
 

10593
03:03:29,580 --> 03:03:30,710
this has been done in languages like
Russ before and so we have a new

10594
03:03:30,710 --> 03:03:30,720
Russ before and so we have a new
 

10595
03:03:30,720 --> 03:03:32,269
Russ before and so we have a new
approach which is really cool I'm very

10596
03:03:32,269 --> 03:03:32,279
approach which is really cool I'm very
 

10597
03:03:32,279 --> 03:03:34,309
approach which is really cool I'm very
excited about that that'll be out to the

10598
03:03:34,309 --> 03:03:34,319
excited about that that'll be out to the
 

10599
03:03:34,319 --> 03:03:35,690
excited about that that'll be out to the
community very soon

10600
03:03:35,690 --> 03:03:35,700
community very soon
 

10601
03:03:35,700 --> 03:03:38,450
community very soon
um the traits feature is really a big

10602
03:03:38,450 --> 03:03:38,460
um the traits feature is really a big
 

10603
03:03:38,460 --> 03:03:40,730
um the traits feature is really a big
deal and so that's blocking a lot of API

10604
03:03:40,730 --> 03:03:40,740
deal and so that's blocking a lot of API
 

10605
03:03:40,740 --> 03:03:42,530
deal and so that's blocking a lot of API
design and so there's that I think

10606
03:03:42,530 --> 03:03:42,540
design and so there's that I think
 

10607
03:03:42,540 --> 03:03:44,389
design and so there's that I think
that's really exciting

10608
03:03:44,389 --> 03:03:44,399
that's really exciting
 

10609
03:03:44,399 --> 03:03:45,230
that's really exciting
um

10610
03:03:45,230 --> 03:03:45,240
um
 

10611
03:03:45,240 --> 03:03:47,030
um
a lot of it is these kind of table

10612
03:03:47,030 --> 03:03:47,040
a lot of it is these kind of table
 

10613
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:48,650
a lot of it is these kind of table
Stakes features

10614
03:03:48,650 --> 03:03:48,660
Stakes features
 

10615
03:03:48,660 --> 03:03:51,050
Stakes features
um one of the things that is again also

10616
03:03:51,050 --> 03:03:51,060
um one of the things that is again also
 

10617
03:03:51,060 --> 03:03:53,750
um one of the things that is again also
Lessons Learned with Swift uh

10618
03:03:53,750 --> 03:03:53,760
Lessons Learned with Swift uh
 

10619
03:03:53,760 --> 03:03:56,809
Lessons Learned with Swift uh
is that uh programmers in general like

10620
03:03:56,809 --> 03:03:56,819
is that uh programmers in general like
 

10621
03:03:56,819 --> 03:03:58,389
is that uh programmers in general like
to add syntactic sugar

10622
03:03:58,389 --> 03:03:58,399
to add syntactic sugar
 

10623
03:03:58,399 --> 03:04:00,950
to add syntactic sugar
and so it's like oh well this annoying

10624
03:04:00,950 --> 03:04:00,960
and so it's like oh well this annoying
 

10625
03:04:00,960 --> 03:04:03,230
and so it's like oh well this annoying
thing like like in Python you have to

10626
03:04:03,230 --> 03:04:03,240
thing like like in Python you have to
 

10627
03:04:03,240 --> 03:04:04,969
thing like like in Python you have to
spell ad

10628
03:04:04,969 --> 03:04:04,979
spell ad
 

10629
03:04:04,979 --> 03:04:08,269
spell ad
why can't I just use plus def plus come

10630
03:04:08,269 --> 03:04:08,279
why can't I just use plus def plus come
 

10631
03:04:08,279 --> 03:04:09,889
why can't I just use plus def plus come
on why can't I just do that right and so

10632
03:04:09,889 --> 03:04:09,899
on why can't I just do that right and so
 

10633
03:04:09,899 --> 03:04:11,990
on why can't I just do that right and so
try a little bit of syntactic sugar it

10634
03:04:11,990 --> 03:04:12,000
try a little bit of syntactic sugar it
 

10635
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:13,550
try a little bit of syntactic sugar it
makes sense it's beautiful it's obvious

10636
03:04:13,550 --> 03:04:13,560
makes sense it's beautiful it's obvious
 

10637
03:04:13,560 --> 03:04:16,190
makes sense it's beautiful it's obvious
we're trying not to do that

10638
03:04:16,190 --> 03:04:16,200
we're trying not to do that
 

10639
03:04:16,200 --> 03:04:17,809
we're trying not to do that
and so

10640
03:04:17,809 --> 03:04:17,819
and so
 

10641
03:04:17,819 --> 03:04:19,250
and so
um for two different reasons one of

10642
03:04:19,250 --> 03:04:19,260
um for two different reasons one of
 

10643
03:04:19,260 --> 03:04:21,530
um for two different reasons one of
which is that again lesson learn Swift

10644
03:04:21,530 --> 03:04:21,540
which is that again lesson learn Swift
 

10645
03:04:21,540 --> 03:04:24,050
which is that again lesson learn Swift
Swift has a lot of syntactic sugar

10646
03:04:24,050 --> 03:04:24,060
Swift has a lot of syntactic sugar
 

10647
03:04:24,060 --> 03:04:25,190
Swift has a lot of syntactic sugar
um

10648
03:04:25,190 --> 03:04:25,200
um
 

10649
03:04:25,200 --> 03:04:27,590
um
which may maybe a good thing maybe not I

10650
03:04:27,590 --> 03:04:27,600
which may maybe a good thing maybe not I
 

10651
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:30,410
which may maybe a good thing maybe not I
don't know but um but because it's such

10652
03:04:30,410 --> 03:04:30,420
don't know but um but because it's such
 

10653
03:04:30,420 --> 03:04:32,210
don't know but um but because it's such
an easy and addictive thing to do sugar

10654
03:04:32,210 --> 03:04:32,220
an easy and addictive thing to do sugar
 

10655
03:04:32,220 --> 03:04:35,630
an easy and addictive thing to do sugar
like make sure blood get crazy right

10656
03:04:35,630 --> 03:04:35,640
like make sure blood get crazy right
 

10657
03:04:35,640 --> 03:04:37,309
like make sure blood get crazy right
um like the community will really dig

10658
03:04:37,309 --> 03:04:37,319
um like the community will really dig
 

10659
03:04:37,319 --> 03:04:38,690
um like the community will really dig
into that and want to do a lot of that

10660
03:04:38,690 --> 03:04:38,700
into that and want to do a lot of that
 

10661
03:04:38,700 --> 03:04:40,250
into that and want to do a lot of that
and I think it's very distracting from

10662
03:04:40,250 --> 03:04:40,260
and I think it's very distracting from
 

10663
03:04:40,260 --> 03:04:42,710
and I think it's very distracting from
building the core abstractions second is

10664
03:04:42,710 --> 03:04:42,720
building the core abstractions second is
 

10665
03:04:42,720 --> 03:04:43,670
building the core abstractions second is
we want to be a good member of the

10666
03:04:43,670 --> 03:04:43,680
we want to be a good member of the
 

10667
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:46,190
we want to be a good member of the
Python community

10668
03:04:46,190 --> 03:04:46,200
Python community
 

10669
03:04:46,200 --> 03:04:48,530
Python community
right and so we want to work with the

10670
03:04:48,530 --> 03:04:48,540
right and so we want to work with the
 

10671
03:04:48,540 --> 03:04:51,110
right and so we want to work with the
broader python community and yeah we're

10672
03:04:51,110 --> 03:04:51,120
broader python community and yeah we're
 

10673
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:52,849
broader python community and yeah we're
pushing forward a bunch of systems

10674
03:04:52,849 --> 03:04:52,859
pushing forward a bunch of systems
 

10675
03:04:52,859 --> 03:04:54,050
pushing forward a bunch of systems
programming features and we need to

10676
03:04:54,050 --> 03:04:54,060
programming features and we need to
 

10677
03:04:54,060 --> 03:04:55,610
programming features and we need to
build them out to understand them but

10678
03:04:55,610 --> 03:04:55,620
build them out to understand them but
 

10679
03:04:55,620 --> 03:04:57,889
build them out to understand them but
once we get a long ways forward I want

10680
03:04:57,889 --> 03:04:57,899
once we get a long ways forward I want
 

10681
03:04:57,899 --> 03:04:59,030
once we get a long ways forward I want
to make sure that we go back to the

10682
03:04:59,030 --> 03:04:59,040
to make sure that we go back to the
 

10683
03:04:59,040 --> 03:05:00,530
to make sure that we go back to the
python community and say okay let's do

10684
03:05:00,530 --> 03:05:00,540
python community and say okay let's do
 

10685
03:05:00,540 --> 03:05:01,910
python community and say okay let's do
some design reviews let's actually talk

10686
03:05:01,910 --> 03:05:01,920
some design reviews let's actually talk
 

10687
03:05:01,920 --> 03:05:03,530
some design reviews let's actually talk
about this stuff let's figure out how we

10688
03:05:03,530 --> 03:05:03,540
about this stuff let's figure out how we
 

10689
03:05:03,540 --> 03:05:05,210
about this stuff let's figure out how we
want this stuff all to work together and

10690
03:05:05,210 --> 03:05:05,220
want this stuff all to work together and
 

10691
03:05:05,220 --> 03:05:07,429
want this stuff all to work together and
syntactic sugar just makes all that more

10692
03:05:07,429 --> 03:05:07,439
syntactic sugar just makes all that more
 

10693
03:05:07,439 --> 03:05:08,990
syntactic sugar just makes all that more
complicated so

10694
03:05:08,990 --> 03:05:09,000
complicated so
 

10695
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,389
complicated so
and uh yeah list comprehensions that you

10696
03:05:11,389 --> 03:05:11,399
and uh yeah list comprehensions that you
 

10697
03:05:11,399 --> 03:05:14,150
and uh yeah list comprehensions that you
have to be implemented and my favorite I

10698
03:05:14,150 --> 03:05:14,160
have to be implemented and my favorite I
 

10699
03:05:14,160 --> 03:05:19,990
have to be implemented and my favorite I
mean dictionaries

10700
03:05:19,990 --> 03:05:20,000

 

10701
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,190

yeah but nonetheless it's actually still

10702
03:05:22,190 --> 03:05:22,200
yeah but nonetheless it's actually still
 

10703
03:05:22,200 --> 03:05:23,990
yeah but nonetheless it's actually still
quite interesting and useful as you

10704
03:05:23,990 --> 03:05:24,000
quite interesting and useful as you
 

10705
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:27,050
quite interesting and useful as you
mentioned modular is very new

10706
03:05:27,050 --> 03:05:27,060
mentioned modular is very new
 

10707
03:05:27,060 --> 03:05:29,870
mentioned modular is very new
Mojo is very new it's a relatively small

10708
03:05:29,870 --> 03:05:29,880
Mojo is very new it's a relatively small
 

10709
03:05:29,880 --> 03:05:32,690
Mojo is very new it's a relatively small
team yeah it's building up this yeah

10710
03:05:32,690 --> 03:05:32,700
team yeah it's building up this yeah
 

10711
03:05:32,700 --> 03:05:35,269
team yeah it's building up this yeah
we're just gigantic stack it's

10712
03:05:35,269 --> 03:05:35,279
we're just gigantic stack it's
 

10713
03:05:35,279 --> 03:05:37,730
we're just gigantic stack it's
incredible stack that's going to perhaps

10714
03:05:37,730 --> 03:05:37,740
incredible stack that's going to perhaps
 

10715
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:39,830
incredible stack that's going to perhaps
Define the future of

10716
03:05:39,830 --> 03:05:39,840
Define the future of
 

10717
03:05:39,840 --> 03:05:43,849
Define the future of
development of our AI overlords uh we

10718
03:05:43,849 --> 03:05:43,859
development of our AI overlords uh we
 

10719
03:05:43,859 --> 03:05:46,269
development of our AI overlords uh we
just hope it will be useful

10720
03:05:46,269 --> 03:05:46,279
just hope it will be useful
 

10721
03:05:46,279 --> 03:05:50,570
just hope it will be useful
as do all of us uh so what uh what have

10722
03:05:50,570 --> 03:05:50,580
as do all of us uh so what uh what have
 

10723
03:05:50,580 --> 03:05:53,030
as do all of us uh so what uh what have
you learned from this process of

10724
03:05:53,030 --> 03:05:53,040
you learned from this process of
 

10725
03:05:53,040 --> 03:05:55,370
you learned from this process of
building up a team maybe one question is

10726
03:05:55,370 --> 03:05:55,380
building up a team maybe one question is
 

10727
03:05:55,380 --> 03:05:57,190
building up a team maybe one question is
how do you hire

10728
03:05:57,190 --> 03:05:57,200
how do you hire
 

10729
03:05:57,200 --> 03:06:00,710
how do you hire
great programmers great people that

10730
03:06:00,710 --> 03:06:00,720
great programmers great people that
 

10731
03:06:00,720 --> 03:06:02,530
great programmers great people that
operate in this

10732
03:06:02,530 --> 03:06:02,540
operate in this
 

10733
03:06:02,540 --> 03:06:07,510
operate in this
compiler Hardware machine learning

10734
03:06:07,510 --> 03:06:07,520
compiler Hardware machine learning
 

10735
03:06:07,520 --> 03:06:11,210
compiler Hardware machine learning
software interface design space yeah and

10736
03:06:11,210 --> 03:06:11,220
software interface design space yeah and
 

10737
03:06:11,220 --> 03:06:13,370
software interface design space yeah and
maybe are a little bit fluid yeah what

10738
03:06:13,370 --> 03:06:13,380
maybe are a little bit fluid yeah what
 

10739
03:06:13,380 --> 03:06:15,590
maybe are a little bit fluid yeah what
they can do so okay so language design

10740
03:06:15,590 --> 03:06:15,600
they can do so okay so language design
 

10741
03:06:15,600 --> 03:06:17,929
they can do so okay so language design
too so building a company is just as

10742
03:06:17,929 --> 03:06:17,939
too so building a company is just as
 

10743
03:06:17,939 --> 03:06:19,790
too so building a company is just as
interesting in different ways is

10744
03:06:19,790 --> 03:06:19,800
interesting in different ways is
 

10745
03:06:19,800 --> 03:06:22,790
interesting in different ways is
building a language like different skill

10746
03:06:22,790 --> 03:06:22,800
building a language like different skill
 

10747
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:24,410
building a language like different skill
sets different things but super

10748
03:06:24,410 --> 03:06:24,420
sets different things but super
 

10749
03:06:24,420 --> 03:06:25,670
sets different things but super
interesting and I've built a lot of

10750

10753
03:06:27,899 --> 03:06:29,570
teams in a lot of different places
um if you zoom in from the big problem

10754
03:06:29,570 --> 03:06:29,580
um if you zoom in from the big problem
 

10755
03:06:29,580 --> 03:06:31,250
um if you zoom in from the big problem
into recruiting

10756

into recruiting
 

10757
03:06:31,260 --> 03:06:34,309
into recruiting
well so here's our problem okay I'll

10758
03:06:34,309 --> 03:06:34,319
well so here's our problem okay I'll
 

10759
03:06:34,319 --> 03:06:35,870
well so here's our problem okay I'll
I'll just I'll be very straightforward

10760
03:06:35,870 --> 03:06:35,880
I'll just I'll be very straightforward
 

10761
03:06:35,880 --> 03:06:38,090
I'll just I'll be very straightforward
about this we started modular with a lot

10762
03:06:38,090 --> 03:06:38,100
about this we started modular with a lot
 

10763
03:06:38,100 --> 03:06:40,250
about this we started modular with a lot
of conviction about we understand the

10764
03:06:40,250 --> 03:06:40,260
of conviction about we understand the
 

10765
03:06:40,260 --> 03:06:41,690
of conviction about we understand the
problems we understand the customer pain

10766
03:06:41,690 --> 03:06:41,700
problems we understand the customer pain
 

10767
03:06:41,700 --> 03:06:43,969
problems we understand the customer pain
points we need to work backwards from

10768
03:06:43,969 --> 03:06:43,979
points we need to work backwards from
 

10769
03:06:43,979 --> 03:06:46,130
points we need to work backwards from
the suffering in the industry and if we

10770
03:06:46,130 --> 03:06:46,140
the suffering in the industry and if we
 

10771
03:06:46,140 --> 03:06:47,450
the suffering in the industry and if we
solve those problems we think it'll be

10772
03:06:47,450 --> 03:06:47,460
solve those problems we think it'll be
 

10773
03:06:47,460 --> 03:06:49,070
solve those problems we think it'll be
useful for people

10774
03:06:49,070 --> 03:06:49,080
useful for people
 

10775
03:06:49,080 --> 03:06:50,990
useful for people
but the problem is is that the people we

super specialized people that have jobs
at Big Tech big Tech worlds right and

10782
03:06:59,210 --> 03:06:59,220
at Big Tech big Tech worlds right and
 

10783
03:06:59,220 --> 03:07:01,610
at Big Tech big Tech worlds right and
you know we I don't think we have

10784
03:07:01,610 --> 03:07:01,620
you know we I don't think we have
 

10785
03:07:01,620 --> 03:07:03,290
you know we I don't think we have
um product Market fit in the way that a

10786
03:07:03,290 --> 03:07:03,300
um product Market fit in the way that a
 

10787
03:07:03,300 --> 03:07:05,450
um product Market fit in the way that a
normal startup does we don't have

10789
03:07:05,460 --> 03:07:07,969
normal startup does we don't have
product Market fit challenges because

10790
03:07:07,969 --> 03:07:07,979
product Market fit challenges because
 

10791
03:07:07,979 --> 03:07:10,130
product Market fit challenges because
right now everybody's using Ai and so

10792
03:07:10,130 --> 03:07:10,140
right now everybody's using Ai and so
 

10793
03:07:10,140 --> 03:07:11,450
right now everybody's using Ai and so
many of them are suffering and they want

03:08:25,309 --> 03:08:25,319
that have no Direction they're just kind
 

10873
03:08:25,319 --> 03:08:27,650
that have no Direction they're just kind
of floating in different places and they

03:08:28,859 --> 03:08:31,250
want to be amazing they just don't know
how and so a lot of it starts with have

10878
03:08:31,250 --> 03:08:31,260
how and so a lot of it starts with have
 

10879
03:08:31,260 --> 03:08:32,809
how and so a lot of it starts with have
a Clear Vision

10885
03:08:37,020 --> 03:08:39,530
what we're doing and um so I kind of
grew up at Apple in my engineering life

10886
03:08:39,530 --> 03:08:39,540
grew up at Apple in my engineering life
 

10887
03:08:39,540 --> 03:08:41,990
grew up at Apple in my engineering life
right and so a lot of the Apple DNA

10888
03:08:41,990 --> 03:08:42,000
right and so a lot of the Apple DNA
 

10889
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,809
right and so a lot of the Apple DNA
rubbed off on me my co-founder Tim also

10890
03:08:44,809 --> 03:08:44,819
rubbed off on me my co-founder Tim also
 

10891
03:08:44,819 --> 03:08:46,730
rubbed off on me my co-founder Tim also
is like a strong product guy and so what

10892
03:08:46,730 --> 03:08:46,740
is like a strong product guy and so what
 

10893
03:08:46,740 --> 03:08:48,950
is like a strong product guy and so what
we learned is you know I decided Apple

03:08:48,950 --> 03:08:48,960
we learned is you know I decided Apple
 

10895
03:08:48,960 --> 03:08:51,050
we learned is you know I decided Apple
that you don't work from building cool

10896
03:08:51,050 --> 03:08:51,060
that you don't work from building cool
 

10897
03:08:51,060 --> 03:08:53,990
that you don't work from building cool
technology you don't work from like come

10898
03:08:53,990 --> 03:08:54,000
technology you don't work from like come
 

10899
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,370
technology you don't work from like come
up with cool product and think about the

10900
03:08:55,370 --> 03:08:55,380
up with cool product and think about the
 

10901
03:08:55,380 --> 03:08:56,510
up with cool product and think about the
features you'll have in the big check

10902
03:08:56,510 --> 03:08:56,520

their problems well hey they might be
interested in that right and so if you

10918
03:09:12,410 --> 03:09:12,420
interested in that right and so if you
 

10919

interested in that right and so if you
speak to them about their problems if

this that's a big piece uh we're a
 

10989
03:10:21,300 --> 03:10:23,990
this that's a big piece uh we're a
remote first company and so we have to

10990
03:10:23,990 --> 03:10:24,000
remote first company and so we have to
 

10991
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:25,969
remote first company and so we have to
uh

uh so remote first has a very strong set
of pros and cons on the one hand you can

10996
03:10:32,030 --> 03:10:32,040
of pros and cons on the one hand you can
 

10997
03:10:32,040 --> 03:10:34,490
of pros and cons on the one hand you can
hire people from wherever they are and

10998
03:10:34,490 --> 03:10:34,500
hire people from wherever they are and
 

10999

03:10:38,220 --> 03:10:40,610
they live in strange places or unusual
places on the other hand you have time

11004
03:10:40,610 --> 03:10:40,620
places on the other hand you have time
 

11005
03:10:40,620 --> 03:10:41,990
places on the other hand you have time
zones

11006
03:10:41,990 --> 03:10:42,000
zones
 

11007
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:43,550
zones
on the other hand you have like

11008
03:10:43,550 --> 03:10:43,560
on the other hand you have like
 

11009
03:10:43,560 --> 03:10:46,429
on the other hand you have like
everybody on the internet will fight if

11010
03:10:46,429 --> 03:10:46,439
everybody on the internet will fight if
 

11011
03:10:46,439 --> 03:10:48,110
everybody on the internet will fight if
they don't understand each other and so

11012
03:10:48,110 --> 03:10:48,120
they don't understand each other and so
 

11013
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:50,150
they don't understand each other and so
we've had to learn how to like have a

11014
03:10:50,150 --> 03:10:50,160
we've had to learn how to like have a
 

11015
03:10:50,160 --> 03:10:51,530
we've had to learn how to like have a
system where we actually fly people in

11016
03:10:51,530 --> 03:10:51,540
system where we actually fly people in
 

11017
03:10:51,540 --> 03:10:53,030
system where we actually fly people in
and we get the whole company together

11018
03:10:53,030 --> 03:10:53,040
and we get the whole company together
 

11019
03:10:53,040 --> 03:10:54,830
and we get the whole company together
periodically and then we get work groups

11020
03:10:54,830 --> 03:10:54,840
periodically and then we get work groups
 

11021
03:10:54,840 --> 03:10:56,330
periodically and then we get work groups
together and we plan and execute

11022
03:10:56,330 --> 03:10:56,340
together and we plan and execute
 

11023
03:10:56,340 --> 03:10:58,610
together and we plan and execute
together and there's like an intimacy to

11024
03:10:58,610 --> 03:10:58,620
together and there's like an intimacy to
 

11025
03:10:58,620 --> 03:11:01,309
together and there's like an intimacy to
the in-person brainstorming yeah I guess

11026
03:11:01,309 --> 03:11:01,319
the in-person brainstorming yeah I guess
 

11027
03:11:01,319 --> 03:11:03,710
the in-person brainstorming yeah I guess
you lose but maybe you don't maybe if

11028
03:11:03,710 --> 03:11:03,720
you lose but maybe you don't maybe if
 

11029
03:11:03,720 --> 03:11:04,969
you lose but maybe you don't maybe if
you get to know each other well and you

11030
03:11:04,969 --> 03:11:04,979
you get to know each other well and you
 

11031
03:11:04,979 --> 03:11:06,230
you get to know each other well and you
trust each other maybe you can do that

11032
03:11:06,230 --> 03:11:06,240
trust each other maybe you can do that
 

11033
03:11:06,240 --> 03:11:08,450
trust each other maybe you can do that
yeah well so when the pandemic first hit

11034
03:11:08,450 --> 03:11:08,460
yeah well so when the pandemic first hit
 

11035

I mean I'm curious about your experience
too the first thing I missed was having

11038
03:11:11,929 --> 03:11:11,939
too the first thing I missed was having
 

11039
03:11:11,939 --> 03:11:14,510
too the first thing I missed was having
whiteboards yeah right in those design

11040
03:11:14,510 --> 03:11:14,520
whiteboards yeah right in those design
 

11041
03:11:14,520 --> 03:11:17,090
whiteboards yeah right in those design
discussions where like I can high high

11042
03:11:17,090 --> 03:11:17,100
discussions where like I can high high
 

11043
03:11:17,100 --> 03:11:19,550

done work through the problem of the day

11046
03:11:21,170 --> 03:11:21,180
done work through the problem of the day
 

11047
03:11:21,180 --> 03:11:22,790

and solve the problem and move forward

11050
03:11:24,469 --> 03:11:24,479
and solve the problem and move forward
 

11051
03:11:24,479 --> 03:11:25,790

yeah
 

11053
03:11:25,800 --> 03:11:27,950
yeah
um but we figured out ways to work

11054
03:11:27,950 --> 03:11:27,960
um but we figured out ways to work
 

11055
03:11:27,960 --> 03:11:30,830
um but we figured out ways to work
around that now with you know all these

11117
03:12:34,020 --> 03:12:36,230
you're bonding but through that bonding
you get the excitement there's certain

11118
03:12:36,230 --> 03:12:36,240
you get the excitement there's certain
 

11119
03:12:36,240 --> 03:12:38,809
you get the excitement there's certain
ideas are like complete and

11120
03:12:38,809 --> 03:12:38,819
ideas are like complete and
 

11121
03:12:38,819 --> 03:12:40,670
ideas are like complete and
you'll see that in the faces of others

11122
03:12:40,670 --> 03:12:40,680
you'll see that in the faces of others
 

11123
03:12:40,680 --> 03:12:43,429
you'll see that in the faces of others
that you won't see necessarily on zoom

11124
03:12:43,429 --> 03:12:43,439
that you won't see necessarily on zoom
 

11125
03:12:43,439 --> 03:12:47,030
that you won't see necessarily on zoom
in like something it feels like that

11126
03:12:47,030 --> 03:12:47,040
in like something it feels like that
 

11127
03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:49,010
in like something it feels like that
should be possible to do

11128
03:12:49,010 --> 03:12:49,020
should be possible to do
 

11129
03:12:49,020 --> 03:12:51,410
should be possible to do
without being in person well I mean

11130
03:12:51,410 --> 03:12:51,420
without being in person well I mean
 

11131
03:12:51,420 --> 03:12:52,969
without being in person well I mean
being in person is a very different

11132
03:12:52,969 --> 03:12:52,979
being in person is a very different
 

11133
03:12:52,979 --> 03:12:55,309
being in person is a very different
thing yeah I don't it's worth it but you

11134
03:12:55,309 --> 03:12:55,319
thing yeah I don't it's worth it but you
 

11135
03:12:55,319 --> 03:12:57,650
thing yeah I don't it's worth it but you
can't always do it and so again we're

11136
03:12:57,650 --> 03:12:57,660
can't always do it and so again we're
 

11137
03:12:57,660 --> 03:12:59,690
can't always do it and so again we're
still learning and we're also learning

11138
03:12:59,690 --> 03:12:59,700
still learning and we're also learning
 

11139
03:12:59,700 --> 03:13:02,330
still learning and we're also learning
as like Humanity with this new reality

11140
03:13:02,330 --> 03:13:02,340
as like Humanity with this new reality
 

11141
03:13:02,340 --> 03:13:04,969
as like Humanity with this new reality
right but um but what we found is that

11142
03:13:04,969 --> 03:13:04,979
right but um but what we found is that
 

11143
03:13:04,979 --> 03:13:06,830
right but um but what we found is that
getting people together whether it be a

11144
03:13:06,830 --> 03:13:06,840
getting people together whether it be a
 

11145
03:13:06,840 --> 03:13:08,389
getting people together whether it be a
team or the whole company or whatever

11146
03:13:08,389 --> 03:13:08,399
team or the whole company or whatever
 

11147
03:13:08,399 --> 03:13:10,610
team or the whole company or whatever
is it worth the expense because people

11148
03:13:10,610 --> 03:13:10,620
is it worth the expense because people
 

11149
03:13:10,620 --> 03:13:12,530
is it worth the expense because people
work together and are happier

11150
03:13:12,530 --> 03:13:12,540
work together and are happier
 

11151
03:13:12,540 --> 03:13:14,750
work together and are happier
after that like it just it just like

11152
03:13:14,750 --> 03:13:14,760
after that like it just it just like
 

11153
03:13:14,760 --> 03:13:16,670
after that like it just it just like
there's a massive period of time where

11154
03:13:16,670 --> 03:13:16,680
there's a massive period of time where
 

11155
03:13:16,680 --> 03:13:18,050
there's a massive period of time where
you like go out and things start getting

11156
03:13:18,050 --> 03:13:18,060
you like go out and things start getting
 

11157
03:13:18,060 --> 03:13:20,450
you like go out and things start getting
frayed pull people together and then you

11158
03:13:20,450 --> 03:13:20,460
frayed pull people together and then you
 

11159
03:13:20,460 --> 03:13:21,830
frayed pull people together and then you
realize that we're all working together

11160
03:13:21,830 --> 03:13:21,840
realize that we're all working together
 

11161
03:13:21,840 --> 03:13:23,330
realize that we're all working together
we see things the same way we work

11162
03:13:23,330 --> 03:13:23,340
we see things the same way we work
 

11163
03:13:23,340 --> 03:13:24,469
we see things the same way we work
through the disagreement or the

11164
03:13:24,469 --> 03:13:24,479
through the disagreement or the
 

11165
03:13:24,479 --> 03:13:26,150
through the disagreement or the
misunderstanding we're talking across

11166
03:13:26,150 --> 03:13:26,160
misunderstanding we're talking across
 

11167
03:13:26,160 --> 03:13:27,650
misunderstanding we're talking across
each other and then you work much better

11168
03:13:27,650 --> 03:13:27,660
each other and then you work much better
 

11169
03:13:27,660 --> 03:13:29,389
each other and then you work much better
together and so things like that I think

11170
03:13:29,389 --> 03:13:29,399
together and so things like that I think
 

11171
03:13:29,399 --> 03:13:32,150
together and so things like that I think
are really quite important what about uh

11172
03:13:32,150 --> 03:13:32,160
are really quite important what about uh
 

11173
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:34,070
are really quite important what about uh
people that are kind of specialized in

11174
03:13:34,070 --> 03:13:34,080
people that are kind of specialized in
 

11175
03:13:34,080 --> 03:13:35,630
people that are kind of specialized in
very different aspects of the stack

11176
03:13:35,630 --> 03:13:35,640
very different aspects of the stack
 

11177
03:13:35,640 --> 03:13:37,190
very different aspects of the stack
working together what are some

11178
03:13:37,190 --> 03:13:37,200
working together what are some
 

11179
03:13:37,200 --> 03:13:38,750
working together what are some
interesting challenges there yeah well

11180
03:13:38,750 --> 03:13:38,760
interesting challenges there yeah well
 

11181
03:13:38,760 --> 03:13:40,070
interesting challenges there yeah well
so I mean I mean there's lots of

11182
03:13:40,070 --> 03:13:40,080
so I mean I mean there's lots of
 

11183
03:13:40,080 --> 03:13:41,330
so I mean I mean there's lots of
interesting people as you can tell I'm

11184
03:13:41,330 --> 03:13:41,340
interesting people as you can tell I'm
 

11185

interesting people as you can tell I'm
you know hard to deal with too

11186
03:13:43,450 --> 03:13:43,460
you know hard to deal with too
 

11187

but you're one of the most lovable the
 

11189
03:13:46,439 --> 03:13:50,210
but you're one of the most lovable the
uh uh so one of the so there's different

11190

philosophies in building teams uh for me
and so some people say higher 10x

11194
03:13:55,610 --> 03:13:55,620
and so some people say higher 10x
 

11195
03:13:55,620 --> 03:13:56,870
and so some people say higher 10x
programmers and that's the only thing

that whatever that means right
 

11199
03:13:58,920 --> 03:14:00,429
that whatever that means right
um what I believe in is building

11200
03:14:00,429 --> 03:14:00,439
um what I believe in is building
 

11201

and technology and so at modular the the

11292
03:15:40,969 --> 03:15:40,979
and technology and so at modular the the
 

11293
03:15:40,979 --> 03:15:43,190
and technology and so at modular the the
tech we're building is

11294
03:15:43,190 --> 03:15:43,200
tech we're building is
 

11295
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:45,469
tech we're building is
here to solve people's problems like it

11296
03:15:45,469 --> 03:15:45,479
here to solve people's problems like it
 

11297
03:15:45,479 --> 03:15:46,790
here to solve people's problems like it
is directly the thing that we're giving

11298
03:15:46,790 --> 03:15:46,800
is directly the thing that we're giving
 

11299
03:15:46,800 --> 03:15:49,250
is directly the thing that we're giving
to people and so this is a really big

11300
03:15:49,250 --> 03:15:49,260
to people and so this is a really big
 

11301
03:15:49,260 --> 03:15:51,230
to people and so this is a really big
difference and what it means for me as a

Engineers is they're working on the

11306
03:15:54,349 --> 03:15:54,359

11307
03:15:54,359 --> 03:15:56,389
Engineers is they're working on the
thing that matters and that's actually

11308
03:15:56,389 --> 03:15:56,399
thing that matters and that's actually
 

11309
03:15:56,399 --> 03:15:58,790
thing that matters and that's actually
pretty I mean again for for compiler

11310
03:15:58,790 --> 03:15:58,800
pretty I mean again for for compiler
 

11311
03:15:58,800 --> 03:15:59,690
pretty I mean again for for compiler
people and things like that that's

11312
03:15:59,690 --> 03:15:59,700
people and things like that that's
 

11313
03:15:59,700 --> 03:16:02,150
people and things like that that's
that's usually not the case right and so

11314
03:16:02,150 --> 03:16:02,160
that's usually not the case right and so
 

11315
03:16:02,160 --> 03:16:03,950
that's usually not the case right and so
that's that's also pretty exciting and

11316
03:16:03,950 --> 03:16:03,960
that's that's also pretty exciting and
 

11317
03:16:03,960 --> 03:16:07,490
that's that's also pretty exciting and
and quite nice but the um one of the

11318
03:16:07,490 --> 03:16:07,500
and quite nice but the um one of the
 

11319
03:16:07,500 --> 03:16:09,650
and quite nice but the um one of the
ways that this manifests is it makes it

11320
03:16:09,650 --> 03:16:09,660
ways that this manifests is it makes it
 

11321
03:16:09,660 --> 03:16:11,150
ways that this manifests is it makes it
easier to make decisions

11322
03:16:11,150 --> 03:16:11,160
easier to make decisions
 

11323
03:16:11,160 --> 03:16:13,010
easier to make decisions
and so one of the challenges I've had in

11324
03:16:13,010 --> 03:16:13,020
and so one of the challenges I've had in
 

11325
03:16:13,020 --> 03:16:15,010
and so one of the challenges I've had in
other worlds is it's like okay well

11326
03:16:15,010 --> 03:16:15,020
other worlds is it's like okay well
 

11327
03:16:15,020 --> 03:16:17,389
other worlds is it's like okay well

03:16:54,290 --> 03:16:54,300
to my grandchildren and so you know it's
 

11361
03:16:54,300 --> 03:16:55,670
to my grandchildren and so you know it's
it's very liberating to be able to

11362
03:16:55,670 --> 03:16:55,680
it's very liberating to be able to
 

11363
03:16:55,680 --> 03:16:57,110
it's very liberating to be able to
decide I think that life should have a

11364
03:16:57,110 --> 03:16:57,120
decide I think that life should have a
 

11365
03:16:57,120 --> 03:16:58,210
decide I think that life should have a
t-shirt

11366
03:16:58,210 --> 03:16:58,220
t-shirt
 

11367
03:16:58,220 --> 03:17:01,610
t-shirt
right and it becomes very simple

11368
03:17:01,610 --> 03:17:01,620
right and it becomes very simple
 

11369
03:17:01,620 --> 03:17:03,349
right and it becomes very simple
like Lex

11370
03:17:03,349 --> 03:17:03,359
like Lex
 

11371
03:17:03,359 --> 03:17:06,889
like Lex
it's this uh this is awesome

11372
03:17:06,889 --> 03:17:06,899
it's this uh this is awesome
 

11373
03:17:06,899 --> 03:17:09,710
it's this uh this is awesome
um so

11374
03:17:09,710 --> 03:17:09,720
um so
 

11375
03:17:09,720 --> 03:17:13,670
um so
I have to ask you about the

11376
03:17:13,670 --> 03:17:13,680
I have to ask you about the
 

11377
03:17:13,680 --> 03:17:15,590
I have to ask you about the
one of the interesting developments with

11378
03:17:15,590 --> 03:17:15,600
one of the interesting developments with
 

11379
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:17,870
one of the interesting developments with
large language models

11380
03:17:17,870 --> 03:17:17,880
large language models
 

11381
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:21,830
large language models
is that they're able to generate code

11382
03:17:21,830 --> 03:17:21,840
is that they're able to generate code
 

11383
03:17:21,840 --> 03:17:24,889
is that they're able to generate code
uh recently really well

11384
03:17:24,889 --> 03:17:24,899
uh recently really well
 

11385
03:17:24,899 --> 03:17:28,730
uh recently really well
I guess to a degree that maybe a

11386
03:17:28,730 --> 03:17:28,740
I guess to a degree that maybe a
 

11387
03:17:28,740 --> 03:17:30,349
I guess to a degree that maybe a
I don't know if you understand but I

11388
03:17:30,349 --> 03:17:30,359
I don't know if you understand but I
 

11389
03:17:30,359 --> 03:17:32,929
I don't know if you understand but I
have I struggle to understand because it

11390
03:17:32,929 --> 03:17:32,939
have I struggle to understand because it
 

11391
03:17:32,939 --> 03:17:35,809
have I struggle to understand because it
it forces me to ask questions about the

11392
03:17:35,809 --> 03:17:35,819
it forces me to ask questions about the
 

11393
03:17:35,819 --> 03:17:38,330
it forces me to ask questions about the
nature of programming of the nature of

11394
03:17:38,330 --> 03:17:38,340
nature of programming of the nature of
 

11395
03:17:38,340 --> 03:17:39,290
nature of programming of the nature of
thought

11396
03:17:39,290 --> 03:17:39,300
thought
 

11397
03:17:39,300 --> 03:17:42,410
thought
because the uh language models are able

11398
03:17:42,410 --> 03:17:42,420
because the uh language models are able
 

11399
03:17:42,420 --> 03:17:44,030
because the uh language models are able
to predict the kind of code I was about

11400
03:17:44,030 --> 03:17:44,040
to predict the kind of code I was about
 

11401
03:17:44,040 --> 03:17:46,730
to predict the kind of code I was about
to write so well yep that it makes me

11402
03:17:46,730 --> 03:17:46,740
to write so well yep that it makes me
 

11403
03:17:46,740 --> 03:17:48,830
to write so well yep that it makes me
wonder like how unique my brain is and

11404
03:17:48,830 --> 03:17:48,840
wonder like how unique my brain is and
 

11405
03:17:48,840 --> 03:17:50,690
wonder like how unique my brain is and
where the valuable ideas actually come

11406
03:17:50,690 --> 03:17:50,700
where the valuable ideas actually come
 

11407
03:17:50,700 --> 03:17:53,269
where the valuable ideas actually come
from like how much do I contribute in

11408
03:17:53,269 --> 03:17:53,279
from like how much do I contribute in
 

11409
03:17:53,279 --> 03:17:54,730
from like how much do I contribute in
terms of uh

11410
03:17:54,730 --> 03:17:54,740
terms of uh
 

11411
03:17:54,740 --> 03:17:59,090
terms of uh
Ingenuity Innovation to code I write or

11412
03:17:59,090 --> 03:17:59,100
Ingenuity Innovation to code I write or
 

11413
03:17:59,100 --> 03:18:01,030
Ingenuity Innovation to code I write or
design and that kind of stuff

11414
03:18:01,030 --> 03:18:01,040
design and that kind of stuff
 

11415
03:18:01,040 --> 03:18:02,990
design and that kind of stuff
when you stand on the shoulders of

11416
03:18:02,990 --> 03:18:03,000
when you stand on the shoulders of
 

11417
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:04,550
when you stand on the shoulders of
giants are you really doing anything and

11418
03:18:04,550 --> 03:18:04,560
giants are you really doing anything and
 

11419
03:18:04,560 --> 03:18:07,429
giants are you really doing anything and
what L alums are helping you do is they

11420
03:18:07,429 --> 03:18:07,439
what L alums are helping you do is they
 

11421
03:18:07,439 --> 03:18:09,110
what L alums are helping you do is they
help you stand on the shoulders of

11422
03:18:09,110 --> 03:18:09,120
help you stand on the shoulders of
 

11423
03:18:09,120 --> 03:18:11,030
help you stand on the shoulders of
giants new program there's mistakes

11424
03:18:11,030 --> 03:18:11,040
giants new program there's mistakes
 

11425
03:18:11,040 --> 03:18:12,830
giants new program there's mistakes
they're interesting that you learn from

11426
03:18:12,830 --> 03:18:12,840
they're interesting that you learn from
 

11427
03:18:12,840 --> 03:18:15,349
they're interesting that you learn from
but I just it would love to get your

11428
03:18:15,349 --> 03:18:15,359
but I just it would love to get your
 

11429
03:18:15,359 --> 03:18:17,630
but I just it would love to get your
opinion first high level yeah of what

11430
03:18:17,630 --> 03:18:17,640
opinion first high level yeah of what
 

11431
03:18:17,640 --> 03:18:20,389
opinion first high level yeah of what
you think about this impact of large

11432
03:18:20,389 --> 03:18:20,399
you think about this impact of large
 

11433
03:18:20,399 --> 03:18:22,070
you think about this impact of large
language models when they do program

11434
03:18:22,070 --> 03:18:22,080
language models when they do program
 

11435
03:18:22,080 --> 03:18:24,830
language models when they do program
synthesis when they generate code yeah

11436
03:18:24,830 --> 03:18:24,840
synthesis when they generate code yeah
 

11437
03:18:24,840 --> 03:18:26,269
synthesis when they generate code yeah
well so

11438
03:18:26,269 --> 03:18:26,279
well so
 

11439
03:18:26,279 --> 03:18:26,990
well so
um

11440
03:18:26,990 --> 03:18:27,000
um
 

11441
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:30,110
um
I don't know where it all goes yeah

11442
03:18:30,110 --> 03:18:30,120
I don't know where it all goes yeah
 

11443
03:18:30,120 --> 03:18:31,790
I don't know where it all goes yeah
um I'm an optimist and I'm a human

11444
03:18:31,790 --> 03:18:31,800
um I'm an optimist and I'm a human
 

11445
03:18:31,800 --> 03:18:34,610
um I'm an optimist and I'm a human
Optimist right I think that things I've

11446
03:18:34,610 --> 03:18:34,620
Optimist right I think that things I've
 

11447
03:18:34,620 --> 03:18:36,349
Optimist right I think that things I've
seen are that a lot of the llms are

11448
03:18:36,349 --> 03:18:36,359
seen are that a lot of the llms are
 

11449
03:18:36,359 --> 03:18:37,670
seen are that a lot of the llms are
really good at crushing leak code

11450
03:18:37,670 --> 03:18:37,680
really good at crushing leak code
 

11451
03:18:37,680 --> 03:18:40,130
really good at crushing leak code
projects and they can reverse the link

11452
03:18:40,130 --> 03:18:40,140
projects and they can reverse the link
 

11453
03:18:40,140 --> 03:18:42,410
projects and they can reverse the link
list like crazy well it turns out

11454
03:18:42,410 --> 03:18:42,420
list like crazy well it turns out
 

11455
03:18:42,420 --> 03:18:43,849
list like crazy well it turns out
there's a lot of

11456
03:18:43,849 --> 03:18:43,859
there's a lot of
 

11457
03:18:43,859 --> 03:18:45,530
there's a lot of
instances of that on the internet and

11458
03:18:45,530 --> 03:18:45,540
instances of that on the internet and
 

11459
03:18:45,540 --> 03:18:47,450
instances of that on the internet and
it's a pretty stock thing and so if you

11460
03:18:47,450 --> 03:18:47,460
it's a pretty stock thing and so if you
 

11461
03:18:47,460 --> 03:18:48,950
it's a pretty stock thing and so if you
want to see

11462
03:18:48,950 --> 03:18:48,960
want to see
 

11463
03:18:48,960 --> 03:18:51,170
want to see
standard questions answered LMS can

11464
03:18:51,170 --> 03:18:51,180
standard questions answered LMS can
 

11465
03:18:51,180 --> 03:18:52,550
standard questions answered LMS can
memorize all the answers and that can be

11466
03:18:52,550 --> 03:18:52,560
memorize all the answers and that can be
 

11467
03:18:52,560 --> 03:18:54,710
memorize all the answers and that can be
amazing and also they do generalize out

11468
03:18:54,710 --> 03:18:54,720
amazing and also they do generalize out
 

11469
03:18:54,720 --> 03:18:56,630
amazing and also they do generalize out
from that and so there's good work on

11470
03:18:56,630 --> 03:18:56,640
from that and so there's good work on
 

11471
03:18:56,640 --> 03:18:59,750
from that and so there's good work on
that but um but I think that if in my

11472
03:18:59,750 --> 03:18:59,760
that but um but I think that if in my
 

11473
03:18:59,760 --> 03:19:01,670
that but um but I think that if in my
experience building things building

11474
03:19:01,670 --> 03:19:01,680
experience building things building
 

11475
03:19:01,680 --> 03:19:03,650
experience building things building
something like you talk about Mojo where

11476
03:19:03,650 --> 03:19:03,660
something like you talk about Mojo where
 

11477
03:19:03,660 --> 03:19:05,090
something like you talk about Mojo where
you talk about these things where you

11478
03:19:05,090 --> 03:19:05,100
you talk about these things where you
 

11479
03:19:05,100 --> 03:19:07,190
you talk about these things where you
talk about building an applied solution

11480
03:19:07,190 --> 03:19:07,200
talk about building an applied solution
 

11481
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:08,990
talk about building an applied solution
to a problem it's also about working

11482
03:19:08,990 --> 03:19:09,000
to a problem it's also about working
 

11483
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:10,130
to a problem it's also about working
with people

11484
03:19:10,130 --> 03:19:10,140
with people
 

11485
03:19:10,140 --> 03:19:11,450
with people
it's about understanding the problem

11486
03:19:11,450 --> 03:19:11,460
it's about understanding the problem
 

11487
03:19:11,460 --> 03:19:12,710
it's about understanding the problem
what is the product that you want to

11488
03:19:12,710 --> 03:19:12,720
what is the product that you want to
 

11489
03:19:12,720 --> 03:19:14,330
what is the product that you want to
build what are the use case what are the

11490
03:19:14,330 --> 03:19:14,340
build what are the use case what are the
 

11491
03:19:14,340 --> 03:19:16,429
build what are the use case what are the
customers you can't just go survey all

11492
03:19:16,429 --> 03:19:16,439
customers you can't just go survey all
 

11493
03:19:16,439 --> 03:19:17,870
customers you can't just go survey all
the customers because they'll tell you

11494
03:19:17,870 --> 03:19:17,880
the customers because they'll tell you
 

11495
03:19:17,880 --> 03:19:20,510
the customers because they'll tell you
that they want a faster horse maybe they

11496
03:19:20,510 --> 03:19:20,520
that they want a faster horse maybe they
 

11497
03:19:20,520 --> 03:19:22,370
that they want a faster horse maybe they
need a car right and so a lot of it

11498
03:19:22,370 --> 03:19:22,380
need a car right and so a lot of it
 

11499
03:19:22,380 --> 03:19:24,110
need a car right and so a lot of it
comes into

11500
03:19:24,110 --> 03:19:24,120
comes into
 

11501
03:19:24,120 --> 03:19:25,250
comes into
um you know I don't feel like we have to

11502
03:19:25,250 --> 03:19:25,260
um you know I don't feel like we have to
 

11503
03:19:25,260 --> 03:19:27,050
um you know I don't feel like we have to
compete with L alums I think they'll

11504
03:19:27,050 --> 03:19:27,060
compete with L alums I think they'll
 

11505
03:19:27,060 --> 03:19:28,610
compete with L alums I think they'll
help automate a ton of the mechanical

11506
03:19:28,610 --> 03:19:28,620
help automate a ton of the mechanical
 

11507
03:19:28,620 --> 03:19:31,550
help automate a ton of the mechanical
stuff out of the way and just like you

11508
03:19:31,550 --> 03:19:31,560
stuff out of the way and just like you
 

11509
03:19:31,560 --> 03:19:33,170
stuff out of the way and just like you
know I think we all try to scale through

11510
03:19:33,170 --> 03:19:33,180
know I think we all try to scale through
 

11511
03:19:33,180 --> 03:19:34,450
know I think we all try to scale through
delegation and things like this

11512
03:19:34,450 --> 03:19:34,460
delegation and things like this
 

11513
03:19:34,460 --> 03:19:37,190
delegation and things like this
delegating wrote things to an llm I

11514
03:19:37,190 --> 03:19:37,200
delegating wrote things to an llm I
 

11515
03:19:37,200 --> 03:19:39,309
delegating wrote things to an llm I
think is an extremely valuable and

11516
03:19:39,309 --> 03:19:39,319
think is an extremely valuable and
 

11517
03:19:39,319 --> 03:19:41,389
think is an extremely valuable and
approach that will help us all scale and

11518
03:19:41,389 --> 03:19:41,399
approach that will help us all scale and
 

11519
03:19:41,399 --> 03:19:43,370
approach that will help us all scale and
be more productive but I think it's a

11520
03:19:43,370 --> 03:19:43,380
be more productive but I think it's a
 

11521
03:19:43,380 --> 03:19:45,650
be more productive but I think it's a
it's a fascinating companion but I'd say

11522
03:19:45,650 --> 03:19:45,660
it's a fascinating companion but I'd say
 

11523
03:19:45,660 --> 03:19:46,670
it's a fascinating companion but I'd say
I don't think that means that we're

11524
03:19:46,670 --> 03:19:46,680
I don't think that means that we're
 

11525
03:19:46,680 --> 03:19:48,490
I don't think that means that we're
going to be done with coding

11526
03:19:48,490 --> 03:19:48,500
going to be done with coding
 

11527
03:19:48,500 --> 03:19:53,050
going to be done with coding
but there's power in it as a companion

11528
03:19:53,050 --> 03:19:53,060
but there's power in it as a companion
 

11529
03:19:53,060 --> 03:19:55,490
but there's power in it as a companion
from there I could I would love to zoom

11530
03:19:55,490 --> 03:19:55,500
from there I could I would love to zoom
 

11531
03:19:55,500 --> 03:19:57,590
from there I could I would love to zoom
in onto Mojo a little bit do you think

11532
03:19:57,590 --> 03:19:57,600
in onto Mojo a little bit do you think
 

11533
03:19:57,600 --> 03:20:00,050
in onto Mojo a little bit do you think
uh do you think about that do you think

11534
03:20:00,050 --> 03:20:00,060
uh do you think about that do you think
 

11535
03:20:00,060 --> 03:20:03,070
uh do you think about that do you think
about llm's generating Mojo code

11536
03:20:03,070 --> 03:20:03,080
about llm's generating Mojo code
 

11537
03:20:03,080 --> 03:20:06,590
about llm's generating Mojo code
and helping sort of like when you design

11538
03:20:06,590 --> 03:20:06,600
and helping sort of like when you design
 

11539
03:20:06,600 --> 03:20:08,510
and helping sort of like when you design
new programming language it almost seems

11540
03:20:08,510 --> 03:20:08,520
new programming language it almost seems
 

11541
03:20:08,520 --> 03:20:12,110
new programming language it almost seems
like man it would be nice to sort of

11542
03:20:12,110 --> 03:20:12,120
like man it would be nice to sort of
 

11543
03:20:12,120 --> 03:20:13,250
like man it would be nice to sort of
um

11544
03:20:13,250 --> 03:20:13,260
um
 

11545
03:20:13,260 --> 03:20:14,929
um
almost as a way to learn how I'm

11546
03:20:14,929 --> 03:20:14,939
almost as a way to learn how I'm
 

11547
03:20:14,939 --> 03:20:16,490
almost as a way to learn how I'm
supposed to use this thing

11548
03:20:16,490 --> 03:20:16,500
supposed to use this thing
 

11549
03:20:16,500 --> 03:20:19,070
supposed to use this thing
for them to be trained on some of the

11550
03:20:19,070 --> 03:20:19,080
for them to be trained on some of the
 

11551
03:20:19,080 --> 03:20:21,530
for them to be trained on some of the
most good so I do lead an AI company so

11552
03:20:21,530 --> 03:20:21,540
most good so I do lead an AI company so
 

11553
03:20:21,540 --> 03:20:24,650
most good so I do lead an AI company so
maybe there will be a Mojo llm at some

11554
03:20:24,650 --> 03:20:24,660
maybe there will be a Mojo llm at some
 

11555
03:20:24,660 --> 03:20:27,830
maybe there will be a Mojo llm at some
point uh but if your question is like

11556
03:20:27,830 --> 03:20:27,840
point uh but if your question is like
 

11557
03:20:27,840 --> 03:20:29,750
point uh but if your question is like
how do we make a language to be suitable

11558
03:20:29,750 --> 03:20:29,760
how do we make a language to be suitable
 

11559
03:20:29,760 --> 03:20:32,570
how do we make a language to be suitable
for llms yeah I think that the

11560
03:20:32,570 --> 03:20:32,580
for llms yeah I think that the
 

11561
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:33,469
for llms yeah I think that the
um

11562
03:20:33,469 --> 03:20:33,479
um
 

11563
03:20:33,479 --> 03:20:35,269
um
I think the cool thing about LMS is you

11564
03:20:35,269 --> 03:20:35,279
I think the cool thing about LMS is you
 

11565
03:20:35,279 --> 03:20:37,070
I think the cool thing about LMS is you
don't have to

11566
03:20:37,070 --> 03:20:37,080
don't have to
 

11567
03:20:37,080 --> 03:20:39,710
don't have to
and so if you look at what is English or

11568
03:20:39,710 --> 03:20:39,720
and so if you look at what is English or
 

11569
03:20:39,720 --> 03:20:41,090
and so if you look at what is English or
any of these other terrible languages

11570
03:20:41,090 --> 03:20:41,100
any of these other terrible languages
 

11571
03:20:41,100 --> 03:20:42,650
any of these other terrible languages
that we as humans deal with on a

11572
03:20:42,650 --> 03:20:42,660
that we as humans deal with on a
 

11573
03:20:42,660 --> 03:20:44,150
that we as humans deal with on a
continuous basis they're never designed

11574
03:20:44,150 --> 03:20:44,160
continuous basis they're never designed
 

11575
03:20:44,160 --> 03:20:47,030
continuous basis they're never designed
for machines and yet they're the

11576
03:20:47,030 --> 03:20:47,040
for machines and yet they're the
 

11577
03:20:47,040 --> 03:20:48,769
for machines and yet they're the
intermediate representation they're The

11578
03:20:48,769 --> 03:20:48,779
intermediate representation they're The
 

11579
03:20:48,779 --> 03:20:50,750
intermediate representation they're The
Exchange format that we humans use to

11580
03:20:50,750 --> 03:20:50,760
Exchange format that we humans use to
 

11581
03:20:50,760 --> 03:20:52,910
Exchange format that we humans use to
get stuff done right and so these

11582
03:20:52,910 --> 03:20:52,920
get stuff done right and so these
 

11583
03:20:52,920 --> 03:20:54,410
get stuff done right and so these
programming languages they're an

11584
03:20:54,410 --> 03:20:54,420
programming languages they're an
 

11585
03:20:54,420 --> 03:20:56,690
programming languages they're an
intermediate representation between the

11586
03:20:56,690 --> 03:20:56,700
intermediate representation between the
 

11587
03:20:56,700 --> 03:20:58,490
intermediate representation between the
human and the computer or the human and

11588
03:20:58,490 --> 03:20:58,500
human and the computer or the human and
 

11589
03:20:58,500 --> 03:21:01,429
human and the computer or the human and
the compiler roughly right and so I

11590
03:21:01,429 --> 03:21:01,439
the compiler roughly right and so I
 

11591
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:03,110
the compiler roughly right and so I
think the llms will have no problem

11592
03:21:03,110 --> 03:21:03,120
think the llms will have no problem
 

11593
03:21:03,120 --> 03:21:05,809
think the llms will have no problem
learning whatever keyword we pick maybe

11594
03:21:05,809 --> 03:21:05,819
learning whatever keyword we pick maybe
 

11595
03:21:05,819 --> 03:21:08,269
learning whatever keyword we pick maybe
the Phi Emoji is gonna oh maybe that's

11596
03:21:08,269 --> 03:21:08,279
the Phi Emoji is gonna oh maybe that's
 

11597
03:21:08,279 --> 03:21:09,889
the Phi Emoji is gonna oh maybe that's
gonna break it it doesn't tokenize no

11598
03:21:09,889 --> 03:21:09,899
gonna break it it doesn't tokenize no
 

11599
03:21:09,899 --> 03:21:11,990
gonna break it it doesn't tokenize no
the reverse of that it will actually

11600
03:21:11,990 --> 03:21:12,000
the reverse of that it will actually
 

11601
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:14,210
the reverse of that it will actually
enable it because one of the issues I

11602
03:21:14,210 --> 03:21:14,220
enable it because one of the issues I
 

11603
03:21:14,220 --> 03:21:15,650
enable it because one of the issues I
could see with being a super set of

11604
03:21:15,650 --> 03:21:15,660
could see with being a super set of
 

11605
03:21:15,660 --> 03:21:18,050
could see with being a super set of
python is there would be Confusion by

11606
03:21:18,050 --> 03:21:18,060
python is there would be Confusion by
 

11607
03:21:18,060 --> 03:21:19,370
python is there would be Confusion by
the gray area

11608
03:21:19,370 --> 03:21:19,380
the gray area
 

11609
03:21:19,380 --> 03:21:22,610
the gray area
so we'll be mixing stuff

11610
03:21:22,610 --> 03:21:22,620
so we'll be mixing stuff
 

11611
03:21:22,620 --> 03:21:25,010
so we'll be mixing stuff
but well I'm a human Optimist I'm also

11612
03:21:25,010 --> 03:21:25,020
but well I'm a human Optimist I'm also
 

11613
03:21:25,020 --> 03:21:26,570
but well I'm a human Optimist I'm also
an llm optimist I think that will solve

11614
03:21:26,570 --> 03:21:26,580
an llm optimist I think that will solve
 

11615
03:21:26,580 --> 03:21:30,290
an llm optimist I think that will solve
that problem but the uh um but but you

11616
03:21:30,290 --> 03:21:30,300
that problem but the uh um but but you
 

11617
03:21:30,300 --> 03:21:32,410
that problem but the uh um but but you
look at that and you say okay well

11618
03:21:32,410 --> 03:21:32,420
look at that and you say okay well
 

11619
03:21:32,420 --> 03:21:35,150
look at that and you say okay well
reducing the rote thing right turns out

11620
03:21:35,150 --> 03:21:35,160
reducing the rote thing right turns out
 

11621
03:21:35,160 --> 03:21:37,130
reducing the rote thing right turns out
compilers are very particular and they

11622
03:21:37,130 --> 03:21:37,140
compilers are very particular and they
 

11623
03:21:37,140 --> 03:21:38,690
compilers are very particular and they
really want things they really want the

11624
03:21:38,690 --> 03:21:38,700
really want things they really want the
 

11625
03:21:38,700 --> 03:21:40,070
really want things they really want the
indentation to be right they really want

11626
03:21:40,070 --> 03:21:40,080
indentation to be right they really want
 

11627
03:21:40,080 --> 03:21:41,870
indentation to be right they really want
the colon to be there on your else or

11628
03:21:41,870 --> 03:21:41,880
the colon to be there on your else or
 

11629
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:43,610
the colon to be there on your else or
else it'll complain right I mean

11630
03:21:43,610 --> 03:21:43,620
else it'll complain right I mean
 

11631
03:21:43,620 --> 03:21:46,550
else it'll complain right I mean
compilers can do better at this but um

11632
03:21:46,550 --> 03:21:46,560
compilers can do better at this but um
 

11633
03:21:46,560 --> 03:21:48,530
compilers can do better at this but um
lens can totally help solve that problem

11634
03:21:48,530 --> 03:21:48,540
lens can totally help solve that problem
 

11635
03:21:48,540 --> 03:21:50,870
lens can totally help solve that problem
and so I'm very happy about the new uh

11636
03:21:50,870 --> 03:21:50,880
and so I'm very happy about the new uh
 

11637
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:52,730
and so I'm very happy about the new uh
predictive coding and copilot type

11638
03:21:52,730 --> 03:21:52,740
predictive coding and copilot type
 

11639
03:21:52,740 --> 03:21:54,170
predictive coding and copilot type
features and things like this because I

11640
03:21:54,170 --> 03:21:54,180
features and things like this because I
 

11641
03:21:54,180 --> 03:21:55,250
features and things like this because I
think it'll all just make us more

11642
03:21:55,250 --> 03:21:55,260
think it'll all just make us more
 

11643
03:21:55,260 --> 03:21:57,650
think it'll all just make us more
productive it's still messy and fuzzy

11644
03:21:57,650 --> 03:21:57,660
productive it's still messy and fuzzy
 

11645
03:21:57,660 --> 03:22:00,830
productive it's still messy and fuzzy
and uncertain unpredictable so but is

11646
03:22:00,830 --> 03:22:00,840
and uncertain unpredictable so but is
 

11647
03:22:00,840 --> 03:22:02,929
and uncertain unpredictable so but is
there a future you see given how big of

11648
03:22:02,929 --> 03:22:02,939
there a future you see given how big of
 

11649
03:22:02,939 --> 03:22:06,830
there a future you see given how big of
a leap gpt4 was where you start to see

11650
03:22:06,830 --> 03:22:06,840
a leap gpt4 was where you start to see
 

11651
03:22:06,840 --> 03:22:10,990
a leap gpt4 was where you start to see
something like llms inside a compiler

11652
03:22:10,990 --> 03:22:11,000
something like llms inside a compiler
 

11653
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:13,370
something like llms inside a compiler
uh I mean you could do that yeah

11654
03:22:13,370 --> 03:22:13,380
uh I mean you could do that yeah
 

11655
03:22:13,380 --> 03:22:14,690
uh I mean you could do that yeah
absolutely I mean I think that would be

11656
03:22:14,690 --> 03:22:14,700
absolutely I mean I think that would be
 

11657
03:22:14,700 --> 03:22:17,210
absolutely I mean I think that would be
interesting there's otherwise well well

11658
03:22:17,210 --> 03:22:17,220
interesting there's otherwise well well
 

11659
03:22:17,220 --> 03:22:19,730
interesting there's otherwise well well
I mean it would be very expensive so

11660
03:22:19,730 --> 03:22:19,740
I mean it would be very expensive so
 

11661
03:22:19,740 --> 03:22:21,590
I mean it would be very expensive so
compilers run fast and they're very

11662
03:22:21,590 --> 03:22:21,600
compilers run fast and they're very
 

11663
03:22:21,600 --> 03:22:23,269
compilers run fast and they're very
efficient and LMS are currently very

11664
03:22:23,269 --> 03:22:23,279
efficient and LMS are currently very
 

11665
03:22:23,279 --> 03:22:25,370
efficient and LMS are currently very
expensive there's on device llms and

11666
03:22:25,370 --> 03:22:25,380
expensive there's on device llms and
 

11667
03:22:25,380 --> 03:22:26,750
expensive there's on device llms and
there's other things going on and so

11668
03:22:26,750 --> 03:22:26,760
there's other things going on and so
 

11669
03:22:26,760 --> 03:22:29,090
there's other things going on and so
maybe there's an answer there

11670
03:22:29,090 --> 03:22:29,100
maybe there's an answer there
 

11671
03:22:29,100 --> 03:22:30,530
maybe there's an answer there
um I think that one of the things that I

11672
03:22:30,530 --> 03:22:30,540
um I think that one of the things that I
 

11673
03:22:30,540 --> 03:22:33,290
um I think that one of the things that I
haven't seen enough of is that

11674
03:22:33,290 --> 03:22:33,300
haven't seen enough of is that
 

11675
03:22:33,300 --> 03:22:35,510
haven't seen enough of is that
so llms to me are amazing when you tap

11676
03:22:35,510 --> 03:22:35,520
so llms to me are amazing when you tap
 

11677
03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:38,510
so llms to me are amazing when you tap
into the creative potential of the

11678
03:22:38,510 --> 03:22:38,520
into the creative potential of the
 

11679
03:22:38,520 --> 03:22:40,969
into the creative potential of the
hallucinations right and so if you're

11680
03:22:40,969 --> 03:22:40,979
hallucinations right and so if you're
 

11681
03:22:40,979 --> 03:22:43,490
hallucinations right and so if you're
building doing creative brainstorming or

11682
03:22:43,490 --> 03:22:43,500
building doing creative brainstorming or
 

11683
03:22:43,500 --> 03:22:44,769
building doing creative brainstorming or
creative writing or things like that the

11684
03:22:44,769 --> 03:22:44,779
creative writing or things like that the
 

11685
03:22:44,779 --> 03:22:47,690
creative writing or things like that the
hallucinations work in your favor

11686
03:22:47,690 --> 03:22:47,700
hallucinations work in your favor
 

11687
03:22:47,700 --> 03:22:48,349
hallucinations work in your favor
um

11688
03:22:48,349 --> 03:22:48,359
um
 

11689
03:22:48,359 --> 03:22:49,849
um
if your writing code that has to be

11690
03:22:49,849 --> 03:22:49,859
if your writing code that has to be
 

11691
03:22:49,859 --> 03:22:50,750
if your writing code that has to be
correct because you're going to ship it

11692
03:22:50,750 --> 03:22:50,760
correct because you're going to ship it
 

11693
03:22:50,760 --> 03:22:52,130
correct because you're going to ship it
in production then maybe that's not

11694
03:22:52,130 --> 03:22:52,140
in production then maybe that's not
 

11695
03:22:52,140 --> 03:22:53,750
in production then maybe that's not
actually a feature

11696
03:22:53,750 --> 03:22:53,760
actually a feature
 

11697
03:22:53,760 --> 03:22:56,210
actually a feature
and so I think that there there has been

11698
03:22:56,210 --> 03:22:56,220
and so I think that there there has been
 

11699
03:22:56,220 --> 03:22:57,650
and so I think that there there has been
research and there has been work on

11700
03:22:57,650 --> 03:22:57,660
research and there has been work on
 

11701
03:22:57,660 --> 03:23:01,190
research and there has been work on
building algebraic reasoning systems and

11702
03:23:01,190 --> 03:23:01,200
building algebraic reasoning systems and
 

11703
03:23:01,200 --> 03:23:03,290
building algebraic reasoning systems and
kind of like figuring out more things

11704
03:23:03,290 --> 03:23:03,300
kind of like figuring out more things
 

11705
03:23:03,300 --> 03:23:05,690
kind of like figuring out more things
that feel like proofs and so I think

11706
03:23:05,690 --> 03:23:05,700
that feel like proofs and so I think
 

11707
03:23:05,700 --> 03:23:07,190
that feel like proofs and so I think
that there could be interesting work in

11708
03:23:07,190 --> 03:23:07,200
that there could be interesting work in
 

11709
03:23:07,200 --> 03:23:09,710
that there could be interesting work in
terms of building more reliable scale

11710
03:23:09,710 --> 03:23:09,720
terms of building more reliable scale
 

11711
03:23:09,720 --> 03:23:10,969
terms of building more reliable scale
systems and that could be interesting

11712
03:23:10,969 --> 03:23:10,979
systems and that could be interesting
 

11713
03:23:10,979 --> 03:23:13,490
systems and that could be interesting
but if you chase that rabbit hole down

11714
03:23:13,490 --> 03:23:13,500
but if you chase that rabbit hole down
 

11715
03:23:13,500 --> 03:23:14,990
but if you chase that rabbit hole down
the question then becomes how do you

11716
03:23:14,990 --> 03:23:15,000
the question then becomes how do you
 

11717
03:23:15,000 --> 03:23:17,030
the question then becomes how do you
express your intent of the machine and

11718
03:23:17,030 --> 03:23:17,040
express your intent of the machine and
 

11719
03:23:17,040 --> 03:23:18,830
express your intent of the machine and
so maybe you want LM to provide the spec

11720
03:23:18,830 --> 03:23:18,840
so maybe you want LM to provide the spec
 

11721
03:23:18,840 --> 03:23:21,170
so maybe you want LM to provide the spec
but you have a different kind of net

11722
03:23:21,170 --> 03:23:21,180
but you have a different kind of net
 

11723
03:23:21,180 --> 03:23:23,450
but you have a different kind of net
that then actually implements the code

11724
03:23:23,450 --> 03:23:23,460
that then actually implements the code
 

11725
03:23:23,460 --> 03:23:26,809
that then actually implements the code
right so it's a used documentation and

11726
03:23:26,809 --> 03:23:26,819
right so it's a used documentation and
 

11727
03:23:26,819 --> 03:23:29,750
right so it's a used documentation and
and inspiration versus the actual

11728
03:23:29,750 --> 03:23:29,760
and inspiration versus the actual
 

11729
03:23:29,760 --> 03:23:33,170
and inspiration versus the actual
implementation yeah potentially

11730
03:23:33,170 --> 03:23:33,180
implementation yeah potentially
 

11731
03:23:33,180 --> 03:23:35,809
implementation yeah potentially
since uh if successful modular will be

11732
03:23:35,809 --> 03:23:35,819
since uh if successful modular will be
 

11733
03:23:35,819 --> 03:23:39,110
since uh if successful modular will be
the thing that runs I say so jokingly

11734
03:23:39,110 --> 03:23:39,120
the thing that runs I say so jokingly
 

11735
03:23:39,120 --> 03:23:42,769
the thing that runs I say so jokingly
our AI overlords but AI systems that are

11736
03:23:42,769 --> 03:23:42,779
our AI overlords but AI systems that are
 

11737
03:23:42,779 --> 03:23:44,269
our AI overlords but AI systems that are
used across

11738
03:23:44,269 --> 03:23:44,279
used across
 

11739
03:23:44,279 --> 03:23:46,610
used across
uh I know it's a cliche term but uh

11740
03:23:46,610 --> 03:23:46,620
uh I know it's a cliche term but uh
 

11741
03:23:46,620 --> 03:23:49,130
uh I know it's a cliche term but uh
internet of things so of course so so

11742
03:23:49,130 --> 03:23:49,140
internet of things so of course so so
 

11743
03:23:49,140 --> 03:23:51,170
internet of things so of course so so
I'll joke and say like AGI should be

11744
03:23:51,170 --> 03:23:51,180
I'll joke and say like AGI should be
 

11745
03:23:51,180 --> 03:23:55,130
I'll joke and say like AGI should be
written in Mojo yeah AGI you're joking

11746
03:23:55,130 --> 03:23:55,140
written in Mojo yeah AGI you're joking
 

11747
03:23:55,140 --> 03:23:56,870
written in Mojo yeah AGI you're joking
but it's also possible that it's not a

11748
03:23:56,870 --> 03:23:56,880
but it's also possible that it's not a
 

11749
03:23:56,880 --> 03:24:00,469
but it's also possible that it's not a
joke uh that a lot of the ideas behind

11750
03:24:00,469 --> 03:24:00,479
joke uh that a lot of the ideas behind
 

11751
03:24:00,479 --> 03:24:03,290
joke uh that a lot of the ideas behind
Mojo is uh seems like the the natural

11752
03:24:03,290 --> 03:24:03,300
Mojo is uh seems like the the natural
 

11753
03:24:03,300 --> 03:24:06,290
Mojo is uh seems like the the natural
set of ideas that would enable at scale

11754
03:24:06,290 --> 03:24:06,300
set of ideas that would enable at scale
 

11755
03:24:06,300 --> 03:24:10,790
set of ideas that would enable at scale
training and inference of AI systems

11756
03:24:10,790 --> 03:24:10,800
training and inference of AI systems
 

11757
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:12,410
training and inference of AI systems
um so just I have to ask you about the

11758
03:24:12,410 --> 03:24:12,420
um so just I have to ask you about the
 

11759
03:24:12,420 --> 03:24:13,969
um so just I have to ask you about the
big philosophical question about human

11760
03:24:13,969 --> 03:24:13,979
big philosophical question about human
 

11761
03:24:13,979 --> 03:24:16,929
big philosophical question about human
civilization so folks like uh uh

11762
03:24:16,929 --> 03:24:16,939
civilization so folks like uh uh
 

11763
03:24:16,939 --> 03:24:18,590
civilization so folks like uh uh
eliezeriatkowski are really concerned

11764
03:24:18,590 --> 03:24:18,600
eliezeriatkowski are really concerned
 

11765
03:24:18,600 --> 03:24:21,229
eliezeriatkowski are really concerned
about the threat of AI do you think

11766
03:24:21,229 --> 03:24:21,239
about the threat of AI do you think
 

11767
03:24:21,239 --> 03:24:22,370
about the threat of AI do you think
about

11768
03:24:22,370 --> 03:24:22,380
about
 

11769
03:24:22,380 --> 03:24:25,070
about
the the good

11770
03:24:25,070 --> 03:24:25,080
the the good
 

11771
03:24:25,080 --> 03:24:28,070
the the good
and the bad that can happen at scale

11772
03:24:28,070 --> 03:24:28,080
and the bad that can happen at scale
 

11773
03:24:28,080 --> 03:24:30,290
and the bad that can happen at scale
deployment of AI systems well so I've

11774
03:24:30,290 --> 03:24:30,300
deployment of AI systems well so I've
 

11775
03:24:30,300 --> 03:24:31,670
deployment of AI systems well so I've
I've thought a lot about it and there's

11776
03:24:31,670 --> 03:24:31,680
I've thought a lot about it and there's
 

11777
03:24:31,680 --> 03:24:33,830
I've thought a lot about it and there's
a lot of different parts to this problem

11778
03:24:33,830 --> 03:24:33,840
a lot of different parts to this problem
 

11779
03:24:33,840 --> 03:24:36,410
a lot of different parts to this problem
everything from job displacement to

11780
03:24:36,410 --> 03:24:36,420
everything from job displacement to
 

11781
03:24:36,420 --> 03:24:39,170
everything from job displacement to
Skynet things like this and so you can

11782
03:24:39,170 --> 03:24:39,180
Skynet things like this and so you can
 

11783
03:24:39,180 --> 03:24:41,750
Skynet things like this and so you can
zoom into sub parts of this problem

11784
03:24:41,750 --> 03:24:41,760
zoom into sub parts of this problem
 

11785
03:24:41,760 --> 03:24:43,370
zoom into sub parts of this problem
um

11786
03:24:43,370 --> 03:24:43,380
um
 

11787
03:24:43,380 --> 03:24:46,790
um
I'm not super optimistic about AGI being

11788
03:24:46,790 --> 03:24:46,800
I'm not super optimistic about AGI being
 

11789
03:24:46,800 --> 03:24:48,349
I'm not super optimistic about AGI being
solved next year

11790
03:24:48,349 --> 03:24:48,359
solved next year
 

11791
03:24:48,359 --> 03:24:49,550
solved next year
I don't think that's going to happen

11792
03:24:49,550 --> 03:24:49,560
I don't think that's going to happen
 

11793
03:24:49,560 --> 03:24:51,729
I don't think that's going to happen
personally so you have a kind of

11794
03:24:51,729 --> 03:24:51,739
personally so you have a kind of
 

11795
03:24:51,739 --> 03:24:54,710
personally so you have a kind of
zen-like calm about because there's a

11796
03:24:54,710 --> 03:24:54,720
zen-like calm about because there's a
 

11797
03:24:54,720 --> 03:24:57,070
zen-like calm about because there's a
nervousness because the leap of gbt4

11798
03:24:57,070 --> 03:24:57,080
nervousness because the leap of gbt4
 

11799
03:24:57,080 --> 03:25:01,190
nervousness because the leap of gbt4
seems so big sure that's like we're

11800
03:25:01,190 --> 03:25:01,200
seems so big sure that's like we're
 

11801
03:25:01,200 --> 03:25:03,110
seems so big sure that's like we're
almost we're there's some kind of

11802
03:25:03,110 --> 03:25:03,120
almost we're there's some kind of
 

11803
03:25:03,120 --> 03:25:04,849
almost we're there's some kind of
transition here period you're thinking

11804
03:25:04,849 --> 03:25:04,859
transition here period you're thinking
 

11805
03:25:04,859 --> 03:25:07,190
transition here period you're thinking
well so so I mean there's a couple of

11806
03:25:07,190 --> 03:25:07,200
well so so I mean there's a couple of
 

11807
03:25:07,200 --> 03:25:09,050
well so so I mean there's a couple of
things going on there one is

11808
03:25:09,050 --> 03:25:09,060
things going on there one is
 

11809
03:25:09,060 --> 03:25:11,210
things going on there one is
um I'm sure GPT five and seven and 19

11810
03:25:11,210 --> 03:25:11,220
um I'm sure GPT five and seven and 19
 

11811
03:25:11,220 --> 03:25:13,550
um I'm sure GPT five and seven and 19
will be also huge leaps

11812
03:25:13,550 --> 03:25:13,560
will be also huge leaps
 

11813
03:25:13,560 --> 03:25:14,510
will be also huge leaps
um they're also getting much more

11814
03:25:14,510 --> 03:25:14,520
um they're also getting much more
 

11815
03:25:14,520 --> 03:25:17,090
um they're also getting much more
expensive to run and so there may be a

11816
03:25:17,090 --> 03:25:17,100
expensive to run and so there may be a
 

11817
03:25:17,100 --> 03:25:18,349
expensive to run and so there may be a
limiting function in terms of just

11818
03:25:18,349 --> 03:25:18,359
limiting function in terms of just
 

11819
03:25:18,359 --> 03:25:20,809
limiting function in terms of just
expense on the one hand and train like

11820
03:25:20,809 --> 03:25:20,819
expense on the one hand and train like
 

11821
03:25:20,819 --> 03:25:22,670
expense on the one hand and train like
that that could be a limiter that slows

11822
03:25:22,670 --> 03:25:22,680
that that could be a limiter that slows
 

11823
03:25:22,680 --> 03:25:24,229
that that could be a limiter that slows
things down but I think the bigger

11824
03:25:24,229 --> 03:25:24,239
things down but I think the bigger
 

11825
03:25:24,239 --> 03:25:27,650
things down but I think the bigger
limiter is outside of like Skynet takes

11826
03:25:27,650 --> 03:25:27,660
limiter is outside of like Skynet takes
 

11827
03:25:27,660 --> 03:25:29,690
limiter is outside of like Skynet takes
over and I don't spend any time thinking

11828
03:25:29,690 --> 03:25:29,700
over and I don't spend any time thinking
 

11829
03:25:29,700 --> 03:25:30,950
over and I don't spend any time thinking
about that because if Skynet takes over

11830
03:25:30,950 --> 03:25:30,960
about that because if Skynet takes over
 

11831
03:25:30,960 --> 03:25:32,450
about that because if Skynet takes over
and kills us all then I'll be dead so I

11832
03:25:32,450 --> 03:25:32,460
and kills us all then I'll be dead so I
 

11833
03:25:32,460 --> 03:25:35,030
and kills us all then I'll be dead so I
don't worry about that so you know I

11834
03:25:35,030 --> 03:25:35,040
don't worry about that so you know I
 

11835
03:25:35,040 --> 03:25:37,070
don't worry about that so you know I
mean that's just okay I have other

11836
03:25:37,070 --> 03:25:37,080
mean that's just okay I have other
 

11837
03:25:37,080 --> 03:25:38,330
mean that's just okay I have other
things worry about I'll just focus on

11838
03:25:38,330 --> 03:25:38,340
things worry about I'll just focus on
 

11839
03:25:38,340 --> 03:25:40,010
things worry about I'll just focus on
yeah I'll focus and not worry about that

11840
03:25:40,010 --> 03:25:40,020
yeah I'll focus and not worry about that
 

11841
03:25:40,020 --> 03:25:41,030
yeah I'll focus and not worry about that
one

11842
03:25:41,030 --> 03:25:41,040
one
 

11843
03:25:41,040 --> 03:25:43,250
one
um but I think that the the other thing

11844
03:25:43,250 --> 03:25:43,260
um but I think that the the other thing
 

11845
03:25:43,260 --> 03:25:44,630
um but I think that the the other thing
I'd say is that

11846
03:25:44,630 --> 03:25:44,640
I'd say is that
 

11847
03:25:44,640 --> 03:25:47,450
I'd say is that
AI moves quickly but humans move slowly

11848
03:25:47,450 --> 03:25:47,460
AI moves quickly but humans move slowly
 

11849
03:25:47,460 --> 03:25:49,670
AI moves quickly but humans move slowly
and we adapt slowly and so what I expect

11850
03:25:49,670 --> 03:25:49,680
and we adapt slowly and so what I expect
 

11851
03:25:49,680 --> 03:25:51,710
and we adapt slowly and so what I expect
to happen is just like any technology

11852
03:25:51,710 --> 03:25:51,720
to happen is just like any technology
 

11853
03:25:51,720 --> 03:25:55,610
to happen is just like any technology
diffusion like the promise and then the

11854
03:25:55,610 --> 03:25:55,620
diffusion like the promise and then the
 

11855
03:25:55,620 --> 03:25:58,969
diffusion like the promise and then the
application takes time to roll out and

11856
03:25:58,969 --> 03:25:58,979
application takes time to roll out and
 

11857
03:25:58,979 --> 03:26:01,070
application takes time to roll out and
so I think that I'm not even too worried

11858
03:26:01,070 --> 03:26:01,080
so I think that I'm not even too worried
 

11859
03:26:01,080 --> 03:26:03,410
so I think that I'm not even too worried
about autonomous cars defining away all

11860
03:26:03,410 --> 03:26:03,420
about autonomous cars defining away all
 

11861
03:26:03,420 --> 03:26:05,870
about autonomous cars defining away all
the taxi drivers remember autonomy is

11862
03:26:05,870 --> 03:26:05,880
the taxi drivers remember autonomy is
 

11863
03:26:05,880 --> 03:26:07,849
the taxi drivers remember autonomy is
supposed to be solved by 2020. yeah boy

11864
03:26:07,849 --> 03:26:07,859
supposed to be solved by 2020. yeah boy
 

11865
03:26:07,859 --> 03:26:11,690
supposed to be solved by 2020. yeah boy
do I so and um and so like I think that

11866
03:26:11,690 --> 03:26:11,700
do I so and um and so like I think that
 

11867
03:26:11,700 --> 03:26:13,670
do I so and um and so like I think that
on the one hand we can see amazing

11868
03:26:13,670 --> 03:26:13,680
on the one hand we can see amazing
 

11869
03:26:13,680 --> 03:26:15,290
on the one hand we can see amazing
progress but on the other hand we can

11870
03:26:15,290 --> 03:26:15,300
progress but on the other hand we can
 

11871
03:26:15,300 --> 03:26:18,170
progress but on the other hand we can
see that uh you know the the reality is

11872
03:26:18,170 --> 03:26:18,180
see that uh you know the the reality is
 

11873
03:26:18,180 --> 03:26:19,670
see that uh you know the the reality is
a little bit more complicated and it may

11874
03:26:19,670 --> 03:26:19,680
a little bit more complicated and it may
 

11875
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:21,590
a little bit more complicated and it may
take longer to roll out than than you

11876
03:26:21,590 --> 03:26:21,600
take longer to roll out than than you
 

11877
03:26:21,600 --> 03:26:22,910
take longer to roll out than than you
might expect well that's in the physical

11878
03:26:22,910 --> 03:26:22,920
might expect well that's in the physical
 

11879
03:26:22,920 --> 03:26:25,070
might expect well that's in the physical
space I I do think in the digital space

11880
03:26:25,070 --> 03:26:25,080
space I I do think in the digital space
 

11881
03:26:25,080 --> 03:26:27,769
space I I do think in the digital space
is a the stuff that's built on top of

11882
03:26:27,769 --> 03:26:27,779
is a the stuff that's built on top of
 

11883
03:26:27,779 --> 03:26:30,710
is a the stuff that's built on top of
llms that runs

11884
03:26:30,710 --> 03:26:30,720
llms that runs
 

11885
03:26:30,720 --> 03:26:32,330
llms that runs
you know the millions of apps that could

11886
03:26:32,330 --> 03:26:32,340
you know the millions of apps that could
 

11887
03:26:32,340 --> 03:26:34,010
you know the millions of apps that could
be built on top of them

11888
03:26:34,010 --> 03:26:34,020
be built on top of them
 

11889
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:35,690
be built on top of them
and they could be run on millions of

11890
03:26:35,690 --> 03:26:35,700
and they could be run on millions of
 

11891
03:26:35,700 --> 03:26:39,110
and they could be run on millions of
devices millions of types of devices

11892
03:26:39,110 --> 03:26:39,120
devices millions of types of devices
 

11893
03:26:39,120 --> 03:26:41,269
devices millions of types of devices
I I just think

11894
03:26:41,269 --> 03:26:41,279
I I just think
 

11895
03:26:41,279 --> 03:26:44,210
I I just think
that the rapid effect it has in human

11896
03:26:44,210 --> 03:26:44,220
that the rapid effect it has in human
 

11897
03:26:44,220 --> 03:26:47,030
that the rapid effect it has in human
civilization could be truly

11898
03:26:47,030 --> 03:26:47,040
civilization could be truly
 

11899
03:26:47,040 --> 03:26:49,130
civilization could be truly
transformative to it yeah you don't even

11900
03:26:49,130 --> 03:26:49,140
transformative to it yeah you don't even
 

11901
03:26:49,140 --> 03:26:51,410
transformative to it yeah you don't even
know well so that predict well and there

11902
03:26:51,410 --> 03:26:51,420
know well so that predict well and there
 

11903
03:26:51,420 --> 03:26:52,550
know well so that predict well and there
I think it depends on are you an

11904
03:26:52,550 --> 03:26:52,560
I think it depends on are you an
 

11905
03:26:52,560 --> 03:26:54,290
I think it depends on are you an
optimist or a pessimist yeah or a

11906
03:26:54,290 --> 03:26:54,300
optimist or a pessimist yeah or a
 

11907
03:26:54,300 --> 03:26:55,490
optimist or a pessimist yeah or a
masochist

11908
03:26:55,490 --> 03:26:55,500
masochist
 

11909
03:26:55,500 --> 03:26:59,210
masochist
um just to clarify uh optimist about

11910
03:26:59,210 --> 03:26:59,220
um just to clarify uh optimist about
 

11911
03:26:59,220 --> 03:27:01,969
um just to clarify uh optimist about
human civilization me too and so I look

11912
03:27:01,969 --> 03:27:01,979
human civilization me too and so I look
 

11913
03:27:01,979 --> 03:27:04,130
human civilization me too and so I look
at that as saying okay cool well yeah I

11914
03:27:04,130 --> 03:27:04,140
at that as saying okay cool well yeah I
 

11915
03:27:04,140 --> 03:27:06,290
at that as saying okay cool well yeah I
do right and so some people say oh my

11916
03:27:06,290 --> 03:27:06,300
do right and so some people say oh my
 

11917
03:27:06,300 --> 03:27:07,610
do right and so some people say oh my
God it's going to destroy us all how do

11918
03:27:07,610 --> 03:27:07,620
God it's going to destroy us all how do
 

11919
03:27:07,620 --> 03:27:09,769
God it's going to destroy us all how do
we prevent that I I kind of look at it

11920
03:27:09,769 --> 03:27:09,779
we prevent that I I kind of look at it
 

11921
03:27:09,779 --> 03:27:12,590
we prevent that I I kind of look at it
from a is it going to unlock us all

11922
03:27:12,590 --> 03:27:12,600
from a is it going to unlock us all
 

11923
03:27:12,600 --> 03:27:14,210
from a is it going to unlock us all
right you talk about coding it's going

11924
03:27:14,210 --> 03:27:14,220
right you talk about coding it's going
 

11925
03:27:14,220 --> 03:27:15,110
right you talk about coding it's going
to make so I don't have to do all the

11926
03:27:15,110 --> 03:27:15,120
to make so I don't have to do all the
 

11927
03:27:15,120 --> 03:27:16,550
to make so I don't have to do all the
repetitive stuff

11928
03:27:16,550 --> 03:27:16,560
repetitive stuff
 

11929
03:27:16,560 --> 03:27:18,349
repetitive stuff
well suddenly that's a very optimistic

11930
03:27:18,349 --> 03:27:18,359
well suddenly that's a very optimistic
 

11931
03:27:18,359 --> 03:27:20,570
well suddenly that's a very optimistic
way to look at it and you look at what a

11932
03:27:20,570 --> 03:27:20,580
way to look at it and you look at what a
 

11933
03:27:20,580 --> 03:27:22,610
way to look at it and you look at what a
lot of a lot of these technologies have

11934
03:27:22,610 --> 03:27:22,620
lot of a lot of these technologies have
 

11935
03:27:22,620 --> 03:27:24,650
lot of a lot of these technologies have
done to improve our lives and I want

11936
03:27:24,650 --> 03:27:24,660
done to improve our lives and I want
 

11937
03:27:24,660 --> 03:27:27,110
done to improve our lives and I want
that to go faster

11938
03:27:27,110 --> 03:27:27,120
that to go faster
 

11939
03:27:27,120 --> 03:27:28,309
that to go faster
what do you think the future of

11940
03:27:28,309 --> 03:27:28,319
what do you think the future of
 

11941
03:27:28,319 --> 03:27:30,229
what do you think the future of
programming looks like in the next 10 20

11942
03:27:30,229 --> 03:27:30,239
programming looks like in the next 10 20
 

11943
03:27:30,239 --> 03:27:32,090
programming looks like in the next 10 20
30 50 years

11944
03:27:32,090 --> 03:27:32,100
30 50 years
 

11945
03:27:32,100 --> 03:27:36,349
30 50 years
there are the limbs and uh with with

11946
03:27:36,349 --> 03:27:36,359
there are the limbs and uh with with
 

11947
03:27:36,359 --> 03:27:39,050
there are the limbs and uh with with
Mojo with modular like your vision for

11948
03:27:39,050 --> 03:27:39,060
Mojo with modular like your vision for
 

11949
03:27:39,060 --> 03:27:42,050
Mojo with modular like your vision for
devices the hardware to compilers to

11950
03:27:42,050 --> 03:27:42,060
devices the hardware to compilers to
 

11951
03:27:42,060 --> 03:27:44,269
devices the hardware to compilers to
this to the different stacks of software

11952
03:27:44,269 --> 03:27:44,279
this to the different stacks of software
 

11953
03:27:44,279 --> 03:27:45,950
this to the different stacks of software
yeah well so what I want I mean coming

11954
03:27:45,950 --> 03:27:45,960
yeah well so what I want I mean coming
 

11955
03:27:45,960 --> 03:27:47,690
yeah well so what I want I mean coming
coming back to my arch nemesis right

11956
03:27:47,690 --> 03:27:47,700
coming back to my arch nemesis right
 

11957
03:27:47,700 --> 03:27:50,870
coming back to my arch nemesis right
it's complexity right so again me being

11958
03:27:50,870 --> 03:27:50,880
it's complexity right so again me being
 

11959
03:27:50,880 --> 03:27:53,809
it's complexity right so again me being
The Optimist if we drive down complexity

11960
03:27:53,809 --> 03:27:53,819
The Optimist if we drive down complexity
 

11961
03:27:53,819 --> 03:27:55,729
The Optimist if we drive down complexity
we can make these tools these

11962
03:27:55,729 --> 03:27:55,739
we can make these tools these
 

11963
03:27:55,739 --> 03:27:57,889
we can make these tools these
Technologies these cool Hardware widgets

11964
03:27:57,889 --> 03:27:57,899
Technologies these cool Hardware widgets
 

11965
03:27:57,899 --> 03:28:00,110
Technologies these cool Hardware widgets
accessible to way more people right and

11966
03:28:00,110 --> 03:28:00,120
accessible to way more people right and
 

11967
03:28:00,120 --> 03:28:01,250
accessible to way more people right and
so what I'd love to see is more

11968
03:28:01,250 --> 03:28:01,260
so what I'd love to see is more
 

11969
03:28:01,260 --> 03:28:04,010
so what I'd love to see is more
personalized experiences more uh things

11970
03:28:04,010 --> 03:28:04,020
personalized experiences more uh things
 

11971
03:28:04,020 --> 03:28:05,870
personalized experiences more uh things
the research getting into production

11972
03:28:05,870 --> 03:28:05,880
the research getting into production
 

11973
03:28:05,880 --> 03:28:08,570
the research getting into production
instead of being lost at nerups right

11974
03:28:08,570 --> 03:28:08,580
instead of being lost at nerups right
 

11975
03:28:08,580 --> 03:28:11,630
instead of being lost at nerups right
and so and like the the the these things

11976
03:28:11,630 --> 03:28:11,640
and so and like the the the these things
 

11977
03:28:11,640 --> 03:28:14,030
and so and like the the the these things
that impact people's lives by entering

11978
03:28:14,030 --> 03:28:14,040
that impact people's lives by entering
 

11979
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:15,110
that impact people's lives by entering
products

11980
03:28:15,110 --> 03:28:15,120
products
 

11981
03:28:15,120 --> 03:28:16,849
products
and so one of the things that I'm a

11982
03:28:16,849 --> 03:28:16,859
and so one of the things that I'm a
 

11983
03:28:16,859 --> 03:28:19,309
and so one of the things that I'm a
little bit concerned about is right now

11984
03:28:19,309 --> 03:28:19,319
little bit concerned about is right now
 

11985
03:28:19,319 --> 03:28:21,650
little bit concerned about is right now
um the big companies are investing huge

11986
03:28:21,650 --> 03:28:21,660
um the big companies are investing huge
 

11987
03:28:21,660 --> 03:28:23,269
um the big companies are investing huge
amounts of money and are driving the top

11988
03:28:23,269 --> 03:28:23,279
amounts of money and are driving the top
 

11989
03:28:23,279 --> 03:28:25,510
amounts of money and are driving the top
line of AI capability for really quickly

11990
03:28:25,510 --> 03:28:25,520
line of AI capability for really quickly
 

11991
03:28:25,520 --> 03:28:28,010
line of AI capability for really quickly
but if it means that you have to have

11992
03:28:28,010 --> 03:28:28,020
but if it means that you have to have
 

11993
03:28:28,020 --> 03:28:29,809
but if it means that you have to have
100 million dollars to train a model or

11994
03:28:29,809 --> 03:28:29,819
100 million dollars to train a model or
 

11995
03:28:29,819 --> 03:28:32,510
100 million dollars to train a model or
more 100 billion dollars right well

11996
03:28:32,510 --> 03:28:32,520
more 100 billion dollars right well
 

11997
03:28:32,520 --> 03:28:34,969
more 100 billion dollars right well
that's gonna make it very concentrated

11998
03:28:34,969 --> 03:28:34,979
that's gonna make it very concentrated
 

11999
03:28:34,979 --> 03:28:37,309
that's gonna make it very concentrated
with very few people in the world that

12000
03:28:37,309 --> 03:28:37,319
with very few people in the world that
 

12001
03:28:37,319 --> 03:28:39,110
with very few people in the world that
can actually do this stuff I would much

12002
03:28:39,110 --> 03:28:39,120
can actually do this stuff I would much
 

12003
03:28:39,120 --> 03:28:40,309
can actually do this stuff I would much
rather see

12004
03:28:40,309 --> 03:28:40,319
rather see
 

12005
03:28:40,319 --> 03:28:42,950
rather see
lots of people across the industry

12006
03:28:42,950 --> 03:28:42,960
lots of people across the industry
 

12007
03:28:42,960 --> 03:28:44,990
lots of people across the industry
be able to participate and use this

12008
03:28:44,990 --> 03:28:45,000
be able to participate and use this
 

12009
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:46,729
be able to participate and use this
right and you look at this you know I

12010
03:28:46,729 --> 03:28:46,739
right and you look at this you know I
 

12011
03:28:46,739 --> 03:28:48,110
right and you look at this you know I
mean a lot of great research has been

12012
03:28:48,110 --> 03:28:48,120
mean a lot of great research has been
 

12013
03:28:48,120 --> 03:28:50,590
mean a lot of great research has been
done in the health world and looking at

12014
03:28:50,590 --> 03:28:50,600
done in the health world and looking at
 

12015
03:28:50,600 --> 03:28:53,450
done in the health world and looking at
like detecting mythologies and doing

12016
03:28:53,450 --> 03:28:53,460
like detecting mythologies and doing
 

12017
03:28:53,460 --> 03:28:55,550
like detecting mythologies and doing
Radiology with AI and like doing all

12018
03:28:55,550 --> 03:28:55,560
Radiology with AI and like doing all
 

12019
03:28:55,560 --> 03:28:58,070
Radiology with AI and like doing all
these things well the problem today is

12020
03:28:58,070 --> 03:28:58,080
these things well the problem today is
 

12021
03:28:58,080 --> 03:28:59,690
these things well the problem today is
that to deploy and build these systems

12022
03:28:59,690 --> 03:28:59,700
that to deploy and build these systems
 

12023
03:28:59,700 --> 03:29:01,670
that to deploy and build these systems
you have to be an expert in radiology

12024
03:29:01,670 --> 03:29:01,680
you have to be an expert in radiology
 

12025
03:29:01,680 --> 03:29:03,830
you have to be an expert in radiology
and an expert in AI

12026
03:29:03,830 --> 03:29:03,840
and an expert in AI
 

12027
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:06,710
and an expert in AI
and if we can break down the barriers so

12028
03:29:06,710 --> 03:29:06,720
and if we can break down the barriers so
 

12029
03:29:06,720 --> 03:29:08,809
and if we can break down the barriers so
that more people can use AI techniques

12030
03:29:08,809 --> 03:29:08,819
that more people can use AI techniques
 

12031
03:29:08,819 --> 03:29:11,269
that more people can use AI techniques
it's more like programming python

12032
03:29:11,269 --> 03:29:11,279
it's more like programming python
 

12033
03:29:11,279 --> 03:29:14,150
it's more like programming python
which roughly everybody can do if they

12034
03:29:14,150 --> 03:29:14,160
which roughly everybody can do if they
 

12035
03:29:14,160 --> 03:29:15,889
which roughly everybody can do if they
want to right then I think that we'll

12036
03:29:15,889 --> 03:29:15,899
want to right then I think that we'll
 

12037
03:29:15,899 --> 03:29:17,750
want to right then I think that we'll
get a lot more practical application of

12038
03:29:17,750 --> 03:29:17,760
get a lot more practical application of
 

12039
03:29:17,760 --> 03:29:20,750
get a lot more practical application of
these techniques and a lot more nicheer

12040
03:29:20,750 --> 03:29:20,760
these techniques and a lot more nicheer
 

12041
03:29:20,760 --> 03:29:22,969
these techniques and a lot more nicheer
cool but narrower demands I think that's

12042
03:29:22,969 --> 03:29:22,979
cool but narrower demands I think that's
 

12043
03:29:22,979 --> 03:29:24,530
cool but narrower demands I think that's
that's going to be really cool do you

12044
03:29:24,530 --> 03:29:24,540
that's going to be really cool do you
 

12045
03:29:24,540 --> 03:29:25,670
that's going to be really cool do you
think we'll have more or less

12046
03:29:25,670 --> 03:29:25,680
think we'll have more or less
 

12047
03:29:25,680 --> 03:29:29,510
think we'll have more or less
programmers in the world than no well so

12048
03:29:29,510 --> 03:29:29,520
programmers in the world than no well so
 

12049
03:29:29,520 --> 03:29:30,530
programmers in the world than no well so
um I think we'll have more more

12050
03:29:30,530 --> 03:29:30,540
um I think we'll have more more
 

12051
03:29:30,540 --> 03:29:32,450
um I think we'll have more more
programmers but they may not consider

12052
03:29:32,450 --> 03:29:32,460
programmers but they may not consider
 

12053
03:29:32,460 --> 03:29:34,370
programmers but they may not consider
themselves to be programmers that'd be a

12054
03:29:34,370 --> 03:29:34,380
themselves to be programmers that'd be a
 

12055
03:29:34,380 --> 03:29:35,630
themselves to be programmers that'd be a
different name for you right I mean do

12056
03:29:35,630 --> 03:29:35,640
different name for you right I mean do
 

12057
03:29:35,640 --> 03:29:37,429
different name for you right I mean do
you consider somebody that uses uh you

12058
03:29:37,429 --> 03:29:37,439
you consider somebody that uses uh you
 

12059
03:29:37,439 --> 03:29:38,750
you consider somebody that uses uh you
know I think that arguably the most

12060
03:29:38,750 --> 03:29:38,760
know I think that arguably the most
 

12061
03:29:38,760 --> 03:29:42,590
know I think that arguably the most
popular programming language is Excel

12062
03:29:42,590 --> 03:29:42,600
popular programming language is Excel
 

12063
03:29:42,600 --> 03:29:44,030
popular programming language is Excel
yeah

12064
03:29:44,030 --> 03:29:44,040
yeah
 

12065
03:29:44,040 --> 03:29:46,309
yeah
right yeah and so do they consider

12066
03:29:46,309 --> 03:29:46,319
right yeah and so do they consider
 

12067
03:29:46,319 --> 03:29:48,469
right yeah and so do they consider
themselves to be programmers maybe not I

12068
03:29:48,469 --> 03:29:48,479
themselves to be programmers maybe not I
 

12069
03:29:48,479 --> 03:29:50,630
themselves to be programmers maybe not I
mean some of them make crazy macros and

12070
03:29:50,630 --> 03:29:50,640
mean some of them make crazy macros and
 

12071
03:29:50,640 --> 03:29:54,170
mean some of them make crazy macros and
stuff like that but but but what what

12072
03:29:54,170 --> 03:29:54,180
stuff like that but but but what what
 

12073
03:29:54,180 --> 03:29:57,349
stuff like that but but but what what
the you mentioned Steve Jobs it's the uh

12074
03:29:57,349 --> 03:29:57,359
the you mentioned Steve Jobs it's the uh
 

12075
03:29:57,359 --> 03:30:00,050
the you mentioned Steve Jobs it's the uh
bicycle for the mind it allows you to go

12076
03:30:00,050 --> 03:30:00,060
bicycle for the mind it allows you to go
 

12077
03:30:00,060 --> 03:30:02,510
bicycle for the mind it allows you to go
faster right and so I think that as we

12078
03:30:02,510 --> 03:30:02,520
faster right and so I think that as we
 

12079
03:30:02,520 --> 03:30:04,490
faster right and so I think that as we
look forward right what is AI I look at

12080
03:30:04,490 --> 03:30:04,500
look forward right what is AI I look at
 

12081
03:30:04,500 --> 03:30:06,469
look forward right what is AI I look at
it as hopefully a new programming

12082
03:30:06,469 --> 03:30:06,479
it as hopefully a new programming
 

12083
03:30:06,479 --> 03:30:08,090
it as hopefully a new programming
Paradigm it's like object-oriented

12084
03:30:08,090 --> 03:30:08,100
Paradigm it's like object-oriented
 

12085
03:30:08,100 --> 03:30:10,190
Paradigm it's like object-oriented
programming right if you want to write a

12086
03:30:10,190 --> 03:30:10,200
programming right if you want to write a
 

12087
03:30:10,200 --> 03:30:12,469
programming right if you want to write a
cat detector you don't use for Loops it

12088
03:30:12,469 --> 03:30:12,479
cat detector you don't use for Loops it
 

12089
03:30:12,479 --> 03:30:13,849
cat detector you don't use for Loops it
turns out that's not the right tool for

12090
03:30:13,849 --> 03:30:13,859
turns out that's not the right tool for
 

12091
03:30:13,859 --> 03:30:15,950
turns out that's not the right tool for
the job right and so right now

12092
03:30:15,950 --> 03:30:15,960
the job right and so right now
 

12093
03:30:15,960 --> 03:30:17,750
the job right and so right now
unfortunately because I mean it's not

12094
03:30:17,750 --> 03:30:17,760
unfortunately because I mean it's not
 

12095
03:30:17,760 --> 03:30:19,130
unfortunately because I mean it's not
unfortunate but it's just kind of where

12096
03:30:19,130 --> 03:30:19,140
unfortunate but it's just kind of where
 

12097
03:30:19,140 --> 03:30:21,469
unfortunate but it's just kind of where
things are AI is this weird different

12098
03:30:21,469 --> 03:30:21,479
things are AI is this weird different
 

12099
03:30:21,479 --> 03:30:23,650
things are AI is this weird different
thing that's not integrated into

12100
03:30:23,650 --> 03:30:23,660
thing that's not integrated into
 

12101
03:30:23,660 --> 03:30:25,610
thing that's not integrated into
programming languages and normal tool

12102
03:30:25,610 --> 03:30:25,620
programming languages and normal tool
 

12103
03:30:25,620 --> 03:30:27,110
programming languages and normal tool
chains and all the Technologies really

12104
03:30:27,110 --> 03:30:27,120
chains and all the Technologies really
 

12105
03:30:27,120 --> 03:30:29,450
chains and all the Technologies really
weird and doesn't work right and you

12106
03:30:29,450 --> 03:30:29,460
weird and doesn't work right and you
 

12107
03:30:29,460 --> 03:30:31,429
weird and doesn't work right and you
have to babysit it and every time you

12108
03:30:31,429 --> 03:30:31,439
have to babysit it and every time you
 

12109
03:30:31,439 --> 03:30:33,469
have to babysit it and every time you
switch Hardware it's different shouldn't

12110
03:30:33,469 --> 03:30:33,479
switch Hardware it's different shouldn't
 

12111
03:30:33,479 --> 03:30:35,389
switch Hardware it's different shouldn't
be that way when you change that when

12112
03:30:35,389 --> 03:30:35,399
be that way when you change that when
 

12113
03:30:35,399 --> 03:30:37,309
be that way when you change that when
you fix that suddenly again the tools

12114
03:30:37,309 --> 03:30:37,319
you fix that suddenly again the tools
 

12115
03:30:37,319 --> 03:30:38,990
you fix that suddenly again the tools
Technologies can be way easier to use

12116
03:30:38,990 --> 03:30:39,000
Technologies can be way easier to use
 

12117
03:30:39,000 --> 03:30:40,790
Technologies can be way easier to use
you can start using them for many more

12118
03:30:40,790 --> 03:30:40,800
you can start using them for many more
 

12119
03:30:40,800 --> 03:30:42,229
you can start using them for many more
things and so that that's that's what I

12120
03:30:42,229 --> 03:30:42,239
things and so that that's that's what I
 

12121
03:30:42,239 --> 03:30:43,670
things and so that that's that's what I
would be excited about

12122
03:30:43,670 --> 03:30:43,680
would be excited about
 

12123
03:30:43,680 --> 03:30:45,229
would be excited about
what kind of advice could you give to

12124

advice
 

12193
03:31:49,979 --> 03:31:52,190
advice
um all speakers you know a compiler nerd

12194
03:31:52,190 --> 03:31:52,200
um all speakers you know a compiler nerd
 

12195
03:31:52,200 --> 03:31:54,769
um all speakers you know a compiler nerd
if everybody's going

12196
03:31:54,769 --> 03:31:54,779
if everybody's going
 

12197
03:31:54,779 --> 03:31:57,050
if everybody's going
left sometimes it's pretty cool to go

12198
03:31:57,050 --> 03:31:57,060
left sometimes it's pretty cool to go
 

12199
03:31:57,060 --> 03:31:58,969
left sometimes it's pretty cool to go
right yeah and so just because

12200
03:31:58,969 --> 03:31:58,979
right yeah and so just because
 

12201
03:31:58,979 --> 03:32:00,530
right yeah and so just because
everybody's doing a thing it doesn't

12202
03:32:00,530 --> 03:32:00,540
everybody's doing a thing it doesn't
 

12203
03:32:00,540 --> 03:32:03,229
everybody's doing a thing it doesn't
mean you have to do the same thing and

12204
03:32:03,229 --> 03:32:03,239
mean you have to do the same thing and
 

12205
03:32:03,239 --> 03:32:05,269
mean you have to do the same thing and
follow the herd in fact I think that

12206
03:32:05,269 --> 03:32:05,279
follow the herd in fact I think that
 

12207
03:32:05,279 --> 03:32:08,269
follow the herd in fact I think that
sometimes the most exciting path through

12208
03:32:08,269 --> 03:32:08,279
sometimes the most exciting path through
 

12209
03:32:08,279 --> 03:32:10,910
sometimes the most exciting path through
life lead to being curious about things

12210
03:32:10,910 --> 03:32:10,920
life lead to being curious about things
 

12211
03:32:10,920 --> 03:32:12,950
life lead to being curious about things
that nobody else actually focuses on

12212
03:32:12,950 --> 03:32:12,960
that nobody else actually focuses on
 

12213
03:32:12,960 --> 03:32:15,769
that nobody else actually focuses on
right and turns out that understanding

12214
03:32:15,769 --> 03:32:15,779
right and turns out that understanding
 

12215
03:32:15,779 --> 03:32:18,110
right and turns out that understanding
deeply parts of the problem that people

12216
03:32:18,110 --> 03:32:18,120
deeply parts of the problem that people
 

12217
03:32:18,120 --> 03:32:20,269
deeply parts of the problem that people
want to take for granted makes you

12218
03:32:20,269 --> 03:32:20,279
want to take for granted makes you
 

12219
03:32:20,279 --> 03:32:22,190
want to take for granted makes you
extremely valuable and specialized in

12220
03:32:22,190 --> 03:32:22,200
extremely valuable and specialized in
 

12221
03:32:22,200 --> 03:32:26,030
extremely valuable and specialized in
ways that the herd is not and so again I

12222
03:32:26,030 --> 03:32:26,040
ways that the herd is not and so again I
 

12223
03:32:26,040 --> 03:32:26,990
ways that the herd is not and so again I
mean there's lots of rooms for

12224
03:32:26,990 --> 03:32:27,000
mean there's lots of rooms for
 

12225
03:32:27,000 --> 03:32:29,090
mean there's lots of rooms for
specialization lots of rooms for uh

12226
03:32:29,090 --> 03:32:29,100
specialization lots of rooms for uh
 

12227
03:32:29,100 --> 03:32:30,530
specialization lots of rooms for uh
generalists there's lots of room for

12228
03:32:30,530 --> 03:32:30,540
generalists there's lots of room for
 

12229
03:32:30,540 --> 03:32:31,910
generalists there's lots of room for
different kinds and parts of the problem

12230
03:32:31,910 --> 03:32:31,920
different kinds and parts of the problem
 

12231
03:32:31,920 --> 03:32:34,729
different kinds and parts of the problem
but but I think that it's you know just

12232
03:32:34,729 --> 03:32:34,739
but but I think that it's you know just
 

12233
03:32:34,739 --> 03:32:36,110
but but I think that it's you know just
because everything everybody's doing one

12234
03:32:36,110 --> 03:32:36,120
because everything everybody's doing one
 

12235
03:32:36,120 --> 03:32:36,950
because everything everybody's doing one
thing doesn't mean you should

12236
03:32:36,950 --> 03:32:36,960
thing doesn't mean you should
 

12237
03:32:36,960 --> 03:32:39,349
thing doesn't mean you should
necessarily do it and now the herd is

12238
03:32:39,349 --> 03:32:39,359
necessarily do it and now the herd is
 

12239
03:32:39,359 --> 03:32:42,050
necessarily do it and now the herd is
