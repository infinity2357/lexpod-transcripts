the fourth state of matter so if you
 

365
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,150
the fourth state of matter so if you
think about

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
think about
 

367
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,749

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,390
of those states of matter and it's
actually the state of matter which one

um liquids are hotter water
 

381
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,629
um liquids are hotter water

uh well that's true of most substances

386
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
uh well that's true of most substances
 

387
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,070
uh well that's true of most substances
and um plasma is a is a state of matter

388
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
and um plasma is a is a state of matter
 

389

and um plasma is a is a state of matter
in which the electrons are

390
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
in which the electrons are
 

391
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,790
in which the electrons are
unbound from the nuclei so they become

392
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:02,800
unbound from the nuclei so they become
 

393
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,430
unbound from the nuclei so they become
separated from the nuclei and can move

394
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
separated from the nuclei and can move
 

395
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,150

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
separately
 

397
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,510
separately
so we have positively charged nuclei

398
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
so we have positively charged nuclei
 

399
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,830
so we have positively charged nuclei
and we have negatively charged electrons

400
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
and we have negatively charged electrons
 

401
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,589
and we have negatively charged electrons
then the net is

stars and the sun are plasmas
 

433
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,350
stars and the sun are plasmas
because they're very hot and it's only

fission and fusion
 

451
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,589
fission and fusion
as you mentioned fusion is the kind of

452
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
as you mentioned fusion is the kind of
 

453
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,430
as you mentioned fusion is the kind of
reaction happening in the sun so what's

454
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
reaction happening in the sun so what's
 

455
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,510
reaction happening in the sun so what's
vision and what's fusion

456
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
vision and what's fusion
 

457
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,790
vision and what's fusion
well fission is taking heavy elements

458
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
well fission is taking heavy elements
 

459
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,230
well fission is taking heavy elements
like uranium and breaking them up

460
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
like uranium and breaking them up
 

461
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,390
like uranium and breaking them up
and it turns out that that process of

462
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
and it turns out that that process of
 

463
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,230
and it turns out that that process of
breaking up heavy elements releases

464
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
breaking up heavy elements releases
 

465
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,790
breaking up heavy elements releases

what does it mean to be a heavy helmet
 

469
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,710
what does it mean to be a heavy helmet
it means that there are many

um uranium there are 92
 

481
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,589
um uranium there are 92
protons in each nucleus and even more

so but it's hard to do it requires

578
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
so but it's hard to do it requires
 

579
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,990
so but it's hard to do it requires
very high energy of impact

580

very high energy of impact
 

581
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,430
very high energy of impact
and actually it's very easy to

582
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
and actually it's very easy to
 

583
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,590
and actually it's very easy to
understand why and that is that

584
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
understand why and that is that
 

585
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,310
understand why and that is that
those two nuclei if they're both let's

586
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
those two nuclei if they're both let's
 

587
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,790
those two nuclei if they're both let's
say

588
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
say
 

589
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,550
say
hydrogen nuclei one is let's say

590
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
hydrogen nuclei one is let's say
 

591
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,150
hydrogen nuclei one is let's say
deuterium and the other is let's say

592
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
deuterium and the other is let's say
 

593
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,110
deuterium and the other is let's say
tritium

tritium
 

595
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,670
tritium
they're both electrically charged and so

596
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680
they're both electrically charged and so
 

597
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,269
they're both electrically charged and so
the and they're positively charged so

598
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
the and they're positively charged so
 

599
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,230
the and they're positively charged so
they they

600
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
they they
 

601
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,630
they they
like charges repel everyone knows that

602
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
like charges repel everyone knows that
 

603
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,430
like charges repel everyone knows that
right

604
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
right
 

605
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,829
right
so basically to get them close enough

606
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
so basically to get them close enough
 

607
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,670
so basically to get them close enough
together to react

608
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
together to react
 

609
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,910
together to react
you have to overcome the repulsion the

610
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
you have to overcome the repulsion the
 

611
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,509
you have to overcome the repulsion the
electric repulsion

612
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
electric repulsion
 

613
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,590
electric repulsion
of the two um nuclei from one another

614
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
of the two um nuclei from one another
 

615
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,430
of the two um nuclei from one another
and you have to get them extremely close

616
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
and you have to get them extremely close
 

617
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,750
and you have to get them extremely close
to one another in order for the nuclear

618
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
to one another in order for the nuclear
 

619
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,509
to one another in order for the nuclear
forces to overtake

620
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
forces to overtake
 

621
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,750
forces to overtake
the electrical forces and and actually

622
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
the electrical forces and and actually
 

623
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,590
the electrical forces and and actually
form a new nucleus

624
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
form a new nucleus
 

625
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,550
form a new nucleus
and so one requires very high energies

626
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
and so one requires very high energies
 

627
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:28,870
and so one requires very high energies
of

628
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
of
 

629
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,790
of
impact in order for reactions to take

630
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
impact in order for reactions to take
 

631
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,949
impact in order for reactions to take
place and those high energies of impact

632
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
place and those high energies of impact
 

633
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,230
place and those high energies of impact
correspond to very high temperatures

634
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
correspond to very high temperatures
 

635
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,550
correspond to very high temperatures
of random motion so that's why you can

636
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
of random motion so that's why you can
 

637
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,069
of random motion so that's why you can
do something like that

638
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
do something like that
 

639
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,310
do something like that
in the sun so we can build the sun

640
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
in the sun so we can build the sun
 

641
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,509
in the sun so we can build the sun
that's one way to do it

642
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:43,519
that's one way to do it
 

643
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,990
that's one way to do it
but uh on earth how do you create a

644
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,000
but uh on earth how do you create a
 

645
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,640
but uh on earth how do you create a
fusion

646
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:46,650
fusion
 

647
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,990

00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:51,279
reaction yeah well nature engineering
 

651
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,629
reaction yeah well nature engineering
nature's fusion uh reactors are indeed

652
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
nature's fusion uh reactors are indeed
 

653
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,150
nature's fusion uh reactors are indeed
the stars

654
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
the stars
 

655
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,949
the stars
and uh they are very hot in the set in

656
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
and uh they are very hot in the set in
 

657
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,069
and uh they are very hot in the set in
the center

658
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
the center
 

659
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,790
the center
and re and they reach the point where

660
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:02,800
and re and they reach the point where
 

661
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,430
and re and they reach the point where
they

662
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
they
 

663
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,710
they
release more energy from those reactions

664
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
release more energy from those reactions
 

665
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,949
release more energy from those reactions
than they lose by radiation and

666
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
than they lose by radiation and
 

667
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,069
than they lose by radiation and
transport to the surface

668
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
transport to the surface
 

669
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,949
transport to the surface
and so forth and that's a state of

00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:12,959
and so forth and that's a state of
 

671
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,470
and so forth and that's a state of
ignition

672
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
ignition
 

673
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,430
ignition
and and that's what we have to achieve

674
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,440
and and that's what we have to achieve
 

675
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:17,910
and and that's what we have to achieve
to

676
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
to
 

677
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,150
to
to give net energy it's like lighting a

678
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
to give net energy it's like lighting a
 

679
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,030
to give net energy it's like lighting a
fire

680
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
fire
 

681
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,870
fire
if you if you have a if you have a

682
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
if you if you have a if you have a
 

683
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,710
if you if you have a if you have a
bundle of sticks and you hold a match up

684
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
bundle of sticks and you hold a match up
 

685
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,829
bundle of sticks and you hold a match up
to it

686
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:25,839
to it
 

687
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,629
to it
and you see smoke coming from the sticks

688
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
and you see smoke coming from the sticks
 

689
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,790
and you see smoke coming from the sticks
but you take the match away and the

690
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
but you take the match away and the
 

691
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,670
but you take the match away and the
and the and the sticks just fizzle out

692
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
and the and the sticks just fizzle out
 

693
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,470
and the and the sticks just fizzle out
that's not

694
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480
that's not
 

695
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,750
that's not
the reason they did it fizzled out is

696
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:35,760
the reason they did it fizzled out is
 

697
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,509
the reason they did it fizzled out is
that yes they were burning

698
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
that yes they were burning
 

699
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,870
that yes they were burning
there was smoke coming from them but

700
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
there was smoke coming from them but
 

701
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,030
there was smoke coming from them but
they were not ignited

702
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
they were not ignited
 

703
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,949
they were not ignited
but if you are able to take the match

704
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
but if you are able to take the match
 

705
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,190
but if you are able to take the match
away and they keep burning and they are

706
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
away and they keep burning and they are
 

707
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,710
away and they keep burning and they are
generating enough heat

708
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
generating enough heat
 

709
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,629
generating enough heat
to keep themselves hot and hence keep

710
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
to keep themselves hot and hence keep
 

711
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,389
to keep themselves hot and hence keep
the reactions going

712
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
the reactions going
 

713
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,190
the reactions going
that's chemical ignition well what we

714
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
that's chemical ignition well what we
 

715
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,310
that's chemical ignition well what we
need to do

716
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,320
need to do
 

717
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,430
need to do
what the stars do in order to generate

718
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
what the stars do in order to generate
 

719
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,790
what the stars do in order to generate
nuclear fusion energy is

720
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
nuclear fusion energy is
 

721
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,150
nuclear fusion energy is
they are ignited they are generated

722
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
they are ignited they are generated
 

723
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,910
they are ignited they are generated
enough energy to keep themselves hot

724
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
enough energy to keep themselves hot
 

725
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,829
enough energy to keep themselves hot
and that's what we've got to do on earth

726
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
and that's what we've got to do on earth
 

727
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,949
and that's what we've got to do on earth
if we're going to make

728
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
if we're going to make
 

729
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,230
if we're going to make
fusion work on earth but it's much

730
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
fusion work on earth but it's much
 

731
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,910
fusion work on earth but it's much
harder to do

732
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
harder to do
 

733
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,030
harder to do
on earth than it is you know in a star

734
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
on earth than it is you know in a star
 

735
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,470
on earth than it is you know in a star
because you know we need temperatures

736
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
because you know we need temperatures
 

737
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,750
because you know we need temperatures
of order tens of millions of

738
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
of order tens of millions of
 

739
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,230
of order tens of millions of
degrees celsius in order for the

740
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
degrees celsius in order for the
 

741
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,430
degrees celsius in order for the
reactions to go

742
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
reactions to go
 

743
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,910
reactions to go
fast enough to generate enough

744
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:31,920
fast enough to generate enough
 

745
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,190
fast enough to generate enough
electricity to keep it

746
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
electricity to keep it
 

747
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,350
electricity to keep it
or enough energy to keep it going and

748
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
or enough energy to keep it going and
 

749
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,310
or enough energy to keep it going and
and so um if you've got something that's

750
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
and so um if you've got something that's
 

751
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,230
and so um if you've got something that's
tens of millions of degrees

752
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
tens of millions of degrees
 

753
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,790
tens of millions of degrees
celsius and you want to keep it all

754
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:44,800
celsius and you want to keep it all
 

755
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,470
celsius and you want to keep it all
together and keep the heat in long

756
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
together and keep the heat in long
 

757
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,110
together and keep the heat in long
enough

758
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
enough
 

759
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,189
enough
to have enough reactions taking place

760
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,199
to have enough reactions taking place
 

761
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,870
to have enough reactions taking place
you can't just put it in a bottle

762
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
you can't just put it in a bottle
 

763
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,509
you can't just put it in a bottle
you know plastic or glass it would be

00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:53,519
you know plastic or glass it would be
 

765
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,550
you know plastic or glass it would be
gone you know it's

gone you know it's
 

767
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,990
gone you know it's
in milliseconds um so

768
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,000
in milliseconds um so
 

769
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,750
in milliseconds um so
um you have to have some non-material

770
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
um you have to have some non-material
 

771
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,910
um you have to have some non-material
mechanism of confining the plasma

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
mechanism of confining the plasma
 

773
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,470
mechanism of confining the plasma
in the case of stars that non-material

774
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480

star together it's what
 

781
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,470

gravity is extremely weak i mean i don't
 

791
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,189
gravity is extremely weak i mean i don't
mean to say we don't fall yes we fall

792
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:27,199
mean to say we don't fall yes we fall
 

793
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,590

other force that you can think about
 

803
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,430
other force that you can think about
on earth and so we need a stronger force

804
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
on earth and so we need a stronger force
 

805
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,389
on earth and so we need a stronger force
to keep the plasma together to confine

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,000
and powering our society with it
 

837
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,230
and powering our society with it
a dumb question so on top of the

838
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
a dumb question so on top of the
 

839
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,350
a dumb question so on top of the
magnetic fields

840
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
magnetic fields
 

841
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,269
magnetic fields
do you also need the plastic water

842
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
do you also need the plastic water
 

843
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,590
do you also need the plastic water
bottle walls or is it purely magnetic

844
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:29,600
bottle walls or is it purely magnetic
 

845
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,310
bottle walls or is it purely magnetic
fields

846
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
fields
 

847
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,350
fields
well actually what we do need walls

848
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
well actually what we do need walls
 

849
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,069
well actually what we do need walls
um those walls must be kept away from

850
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
um those walls must be kept away from
 

851
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,350
um those walls must be kept away from
the plasma because otherwise they'd be

852
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
the plasma because otherwise they'd be
 

853
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,269
the plasma because otherwise they'd be
melted or the plasma must be kept away

854
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
melted or the plasma must be kept away
 

855
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,790
melted or the plasma must be kept away
from them inside

856
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
from them inside
 

857
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,670
from them inside
inside of them but the main purpose of

858
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
inside of them but the main purpose of
 

859
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,710
inside of them but the main purpose of
the walls

860
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
the walls
 

861
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,350
the walls
is not to keep the plasma in it's to

862
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
is not to keep the plasma in it's to
 

863
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,069
is not to keep the plasma in it's to
keep the atmosphere out

864
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
keep the atmosphere out
 

865
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,749
keep the atmosphere out
so if we want to do it on earth where

866
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
so if we want to do it on earth where
 

867
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,910
so if we want to do it on earth where
there's air

868
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:53,920
there's air
 

869
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,910
there's air
we want the plasma to consist of

870
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
we want the plasma to consist of
 

871
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,910
we want the plasma to consist of
hydrogen isotopes or other things the

872
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
hydrogen isotopes or other things the
 

873
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,590
hydrogen isotopes or other things the
things we're trying to react

874
00:15:59,590 --> 00:15:59,600
things we're trying to react
 

875
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,110
things we're trying to react
and by the way the density

876
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
and by the way the density
 

877
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,870
and by the way the density
of those plasmas at least in magnetic

878
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
of those plasmas at least in magnetic
 

879
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,150
of those plasmas at least in magnetic
confinement fusion

880
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
confinement fusion
 

881
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,870
confinement fusion
is very low it's maybe a million times

882
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
is very low it's maybe a million times
 

883
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,829
is very low it's maybe a million times
less

884
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:09,839
less
 

885
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,590
less
than the density of air in this room

886
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
than the density of air in this room
 

887
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,069
than the density of air in this room
so in order for a fusion reactor like

888
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
so in order for a fusion reactor like
 

889
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,350
so in order for a fusion reactor like
that to work

890
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
that to work
 

891
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,430
that to work
you have to keep all of the air out and

892
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
you have to keep all of the air out and
 

893
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,509
you have to keep all of the air out and
just keep the plasma in so yes there are

894
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
just keep the plasma in so yes there are
 

895
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,470
just keep the plasma in so yes there are
other things

896
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,480
other things
 

897
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,910
other things
but those are things that are relatively

898
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
but those are things that are relatively
 

899
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,150
but those are things that are relatively
easy i mean making a vacuum

900
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
easy i mean making a vacuum
 

901
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,310
easy i mean making a vacuum
these days is technologically quite

902
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
these days is technologically quite
 

903
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,910
these days is technologically quite
quite straightforward we know how to do

904
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
quite straightforward we know how to do
 

905
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,230
quite straightforward we know how to do
that

906
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
that
 

907
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,870
that
okay what we don't quite know how to do

908
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
okay what we don't quite know how to do
 

909
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,670
okay what we don't quite know how to do
is to make

910
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
is to make
 

911
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,189
is to make
a confinement uh device that

912
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
a confinement uh device that
 

913
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,829
a confinement uh device that
isolates the plasma well enough so that

914
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
isolates the plasma well enough so that
 

915
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,389
isolates the plasma well enough so that
it

916
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
it
 

917
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,310
it
so that it's able to keep itself burning

918
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
so that it's able to keep itself burning
 

919
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,670
so that it's able to keep itself burning
with its own reaction

920
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
with its own reaction
 

921
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,829
with its own reaction
so maybe can you talk about what a

922
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
so maybe can you talk about what a
 

923
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,269
so maybe can you talk about what a
takamaka is

924
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
takamaka is
 

925
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,550
takamaka is
the russian acronym from which the word

926
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
the russian acronym from which the word
 

927
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,550
the russian acronym from which the word
tokamak is built just means toroidal

928
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
tokamak is built just means toroidal
 

929
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,910
tokamak is built just means toroidal
magnetic chamber

930
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
magnetic chamber
 

931
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,430
magnetic chamber
so it's a toroidal chamber taurus is

932
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
so it's a toroidal chamber taurus is
 

933
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,829
so it's a toroidal chamber taurus is
is a geometric shape which is like a

934
00:16:59,829 --> 00:16:59,839
is a geometric shape which is like a
 

935
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,670
is a geometric shape which is like a
doughnut with a hole down the middle

936
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
doughnut with a hole down the middle
 

937
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,230
doughnut with a hole down the middle
okay and so it's the so it's the meat of

938
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
okay and so it's the so it's the meat of
 

939
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,949
okay and so it's the so it's the meat of
the doughnut

940
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
the doughnut
 

941
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,630
the doughnut
okay that's the taurus um and it's

942
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
okay that's the taurus um and it's
 

943
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,789
okay that's the taurus um and it's
and it's got a magnetic field so that's

944
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
and it's got a magnetic field so that's
 

945
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,069
and it's got a magnetic field so that's
really all takamak

946
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
really all takamak
 

947
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,990
really all takamak
uh means but the particular

948
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
uh means but the particular
 

949
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,909
uh means but the particular
configuration

950
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
configuration
 

951
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,309
configuration
um that we're the that is very

952
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
um that we're the that is very
 

953
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,270
um that we're the that is very
widespread and there's the sort of

954
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
widespread and there's the sort of
 

955
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,189
widespread and there's the sort of
best prospect in the least in the near

956
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:23,199
best prospect in the least in the near
 

957
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,990
best prospect in the least in the near
term for making fusion energy work

958
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
term for making fusion energy work
 

959
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,870
term for making fusion energy work
is one in which there's a very strong

960
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
is one in which there's a very strong
 

961
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,310
is one in which there's a very strong
magnetic field

962
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
magnetic field
 

963
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,350
magnetic field
the the long way around the

964
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
the the long way around the
 

965
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,990
the the long way around the
doughnut around the torus um so you've

966
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
doughnut around the torus um so you've
 

967
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,830
doughnut around the torus um so you've
got to imagine that there's this

968
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
got to imagine that there's this
 

969
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,990
got to imagine that there's this
doughnut shape with an embedded magnetic

970
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:40,000
doughnut shape with an embedded magnetic
 

971
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,909
doughnut shape with an embedded magnetic
field just going round and round

972
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
field just going round and round
 

973
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,870
field just going round and round
the long way the the big advantage of

974
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
the long way the the big advantage of
 

975
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,270
the long way the the big advantage of
that

976
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
that
 

977
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,830
that
is that plasma particles

978
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
is that plasma particles
 

979
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,710
is that plasma particles
are when they're in a in the presence of

980
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
are when they're in a in the presence of
 

981
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,549
are when they're in a in the presence of
a magnetic field

982
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
a magnetic field
 

983
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,630
a magnetic field
feel strong forces from the magnetic

984
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
feel strong forces from the magnetic
 

985
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,390
feel strong forces from the magnetic
field and those forces

986
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:58,400
field and those forces
 

987
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,510
field and those forces
make the particles gyrate around the

988
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:01,520
make the particles gyrate around the
 

989
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,230
make the particles gyrate around the
direction

990
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
direction
 

991
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,430
direction
of the magnetic field line so basically

992
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:05,440
of the magnetic field line so basically
 

993
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,430
of the magnetic field line so basically
the particles follow helical orbits like

994
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:09,440
the particles follow helical orbits like
 

995
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,750
the particles follow helical orbits like
like a following like a spring that's

996
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
like a following like a spring that's
 

997
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,750
like a following like a spring that's
directed along the magnetic field

998
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:13,760
directed along the magnetic field
 

999
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,669
directed along the magnetic field
well if you make the magnetic field go

1000
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:15,679
well if you make the magnetic field go
 

1001
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,830
well if you make the magnetic field go
in inside this toroidal chamber and just

1002
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
in inside this toroidal chamber and just
 

1003
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,230
in inside this toroidal chamber and just
simply go round and round the chamber

1004
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,240
simply go round and round the chamber
 

1005
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,549
simply go round and round the chamber
then because of this helical orbit

1006
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
then because of this helical orbit
 

1007
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,470
then because of this helical orbit
the particles can't move fast across the

1008
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
the particles can't move fast across the
 

1009
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,510
the particles can't move fast across the
magnetic field

1010
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
magnetic field
 

1011
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,909
magnetic field
but they can move very quickly along the

1012
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
but they can move very quickly along the
 

1013
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,590
but they can move very quickly along the
magnetic field

1014
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
magnetic field
 

1015
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,270
magnetic field
and if you have a magnetic field that

1016
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
and if you have a magnetic field that
 

1017
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,110
and if you have a magnetic field that
doesn't leave the chamber

1018
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
doesn't leave the chamber
 

1019
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,590
doesn't leave the chamber
it doesn't matter if they move along the

1020
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
it doesn't matter if they move along the
 

1021
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,870
it doesn't matter if they move along the
magnetic field it does

1022
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
magnetic field it does
 

1023
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,230
magnetic field it does
it means it doesn't mean they're going

1024
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
it means it doesn't mean they're going
 

1025
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,990
it means it doesn't mean they're going
to exit the chamber

1026
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
to exit the chamber
 

1027
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,669
to exit the chamber
but if you just had a straight magnetic

1028
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
but if you just had a straight magnetic
 

1029
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,990
but if you just had a straight magnetic
field as you you know for example

1030
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
field as you you know for example
 

1031
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,950
field as you you know for example
coming from um you know a bar a

1032
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:50,960
coming from um you know a bar a
 

1033
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,230
coming from um you know a bar a
helmholtz coil or

1034
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
helmholtz coil or
 

1035
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,870
helmholtz coil or
or a bar magnet then you'd have to have

1036
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
or a bar magnet then you'd have to have
 

1037
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,789
or a bar magnet then you'd have to have
ends it would come would come to the end

1038
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:56,799
ends it would come would come to the end
 

1039
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,870
ends it would come would come to the end
ends of the chamber somewhere in the and

1040
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
ends of the chamber somewhere in the and
 

1041
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,710
ends of the chamber somewhere in the and
the particles would hit the ends and

1042
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
the particles would hit the ends and
 

1043
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,870
the particles would hit the ends and
and they would lose their energy so

1044
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
and they would lose their energy so
 

1045
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,470
and they would lose their energy so
that's why it's toroidal

1046
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
that's why it's toroidal
 

1047
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,470
that's why it's toroidal
and that's why we have a strong magnetic

1048
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:06,480
and that's why we have a strong magnetic
 

1049
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,830
and that's why we have a strong magnetic
field it's

1050
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:07,840
field it's
 

1051
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,029
field it's
providing a confinement against motion

1052
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
providing a confinement against motion
 

1053
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,789
providing a confinement against motion
in the in the direction that would lead

1054
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
in the in the direction that would lead
 

1055
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,789
in the in the direction that would lead
the particles to leave the chamber

1056
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
the particles to leave the chamber
 

1057
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,029
the particles to leave the chamber
it turns out that then here we're

1058
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
it turns out that then here we're
 

1059
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,230
it turns out that then here we're
getting a little bit technical but it

1060
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
getting a little bit technical but it
 

1061
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,029
getting a little bit technical but it
turns out that

1062
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
turns out that
 

1063
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,190
turns out that
a toroidal field alone is not enough and

1064
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
a toroidal field alone is not enough and
 

1065
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,630
a toroidal field alone is not enough and
so you need more

1066
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
so you need more
 

1067
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,750
so you need more
fields to produce true true confinement

1068
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760
fields to produce true true confinement
 

1069
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,150
fields to produce true true confinement
of

1070
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,160
of
 

1071
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,310
of
plasma and we get those by passing a

1072
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:30,320
plasma and we get those by passing a
 

1073
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,510
plasma and we get those by passing a
current as well

1074
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
current as well
 

1075
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,510
current as well
through the plasma itself i can make

1076
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
through the plasma itself i can make
 

1077
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,630
through the plasma itself i can make
sure it stays on track

1078
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
sure it stays on track
 

1079
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,549
sure it stays on track
well that what that does is makes the

1080
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559
well that what that does is makes the
 

1081
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,830
well that what that does is makes the
field lines themselves

1082
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
field lines themselves
 

1083
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,950
field lines themselves
into much bigger helices and

1084
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
into much bigger helices and
 

1085
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,789
into much bigger helices and
that for reasons that are too

1086
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
that for reasons that are too
 

1087
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,470
that for reasons that are too
complicated to explain

1088
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
complicated to explain
 

1089
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,669
complicated to explain
that clinches the confinement of the

1090
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
that clinches the confinement of the
 

1091
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,630
that clinches the confinement of the
particles

1092
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:48,640
particles
 

1093
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,310
particles
at least in terms of their single

1094
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
at least in terms of their single
 

1095
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,310
at least in terms of their single
particle orbits so they don't leave the

1096
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,320
particle orbits so they don't leave the
 

1097
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,110
particle orbits so they don't leave the
chamber

1098
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
chamber
 

1099
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,870
chamber
and so when the particles are flying

1100
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:54,880
and so when the particles are flying
 

1101
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,710
and so when the particles are flying
along this uh

1102
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
along this uh
 

1103
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,190
along this uh
this this doughnut the inside of the

1104
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
this this doughnut the inside of the
 

1105
00:19:59,200 --> 00:19:59,909
this this doughnut the inside of the
donut

1106
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
donut
 

1107
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,230
donut
uh are they what's where's the

1108
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,240
uh are they what's where's the
 

1109
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,909
uh are they what's where's the
generation of the energy coming from are

1110
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:03,919
generation of the energy coming from are
 

1111
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,110
generation of the energy coming from are
they smashing

1112
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
they smashing
 

1113
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,470
they smashing
into each other yeah eventually i mean

1114
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
into each other yeah eventually i mean
 

1115
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,750
into each other yeah eventually i mean
in a fusion reactor

1116
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:09,760
in a fusion reactor
 

1117
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,510
in a fusion reactor
there will be deuterons and triti and

1118
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:11,520
there will be deuterons and triti and
 

1119
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,110
there will be deuterons and triti and
tritons and they will be

1120
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
tritons and they will be
 

1121
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,350
tritons and they will be
smashing in they will be very hot

1122
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
smashing in they will be very hot
 

1123
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,110
smashing in they will be very hot
they'll be 100 million degrees

1124
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,120
they'll be 100 million degrees
 

1125
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,070
they'll be 100 million degrees
celsius or something so they're moving

1126
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,080
celsius or something so they're moving
 

1127
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,669

1131
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,549

in random directions and they will

1132
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
in random directions and they will
 

1133
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,830
in random directions and they will
collide with one another

1134
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:25,840
collide with one another
 

1135
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,549
collide with one another
and have fusion reactions when those

1136
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
and have fusion reactions when those
 

1137
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,549
and have fusion reactions when those
fusion reactions take place

1138
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
fusion reactions take place

particles
 

1145
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,789
particles
one of the particles that's released is

1146
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:36,799
one of the particles that's released is
 

1147
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,789
one of the particles that's released is
an alpha particle which is also charged

1148
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
an alpha particle which is also charged
 

1149
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,470
an alpha particle which is also charged
and it's also confined

1150
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
and it's also confined
 

1151
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,029
and it's also confined
and that alpha particle stays in the in

1152
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
and that alpha particle stays in the in
 

1153
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,110
and that alpha particle stays in the in
the in the doughnut and heats the other

1154
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
the in the doughnut and heats the other
 

1155
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,870
the in the doughnut and heats the other
particles that are in that doughnut

1156

particles that are in that doughnut
 

1157
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,950
particles that are in that doughnut
so it transfers its energy to those and

1158
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:48,960
so it transfers its energy to those and
 

1159
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,230
so it transfers its energy to those and
they it keeps them hot

1160
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
they it keeps them hot
 

1161
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,149
they it keeps them hot
there's there's some leaking of heat all

1162
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
there's there's some leaking of heat all
 

1163

some transport and so forth there's also
 

1167
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,549
some transport and so forth there's also
a neutron released from that reaction

1168

the fusion energy
 

1173
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,990
the fusion energy
and that will have to be captured in a

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,200
yep
 

1201
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,149
yep
well um there have been experiments that

1202
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
well um there have been experiments that
 

1203
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,190
well um there have been experiments that
have generated

1204
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,200
have generated
 

1205
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,710
have generated
net nuclear energies or nuclear powers

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,430
in the vicinity of
um you know a few tens of megawatts

1210
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440
um you know a few tens of megawatts
 

1211
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,870
um you know a few tens of megawatts
for a few seconds so that's

1212
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
for a few seconds so that's
 

1213
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,190
for a few seconds so that's
you know 10 megajoules that's not much

1214
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
you know 10 megajoules that's not much
 

1215
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,310
you know 10 megajoules that's not much
energy

1216
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,320
energy
 

1217
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,390
energy
it's a few doughnuts worth of energy

1218
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
it's a few doughnuts worth of energy
 

1219
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,110
it's a few doughnuts worth of energy
okay yeah literal donut

1220
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
okay yeah literal donut
 

1221
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,390
okay yeah literal donut
that's right um

1222
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
that's right um
 

1223
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,310
that's right um
but um but we have studied how well

1224
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
but um but we have studied how well
 

1225
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,190
but um but we have studied how well
tokamax can confine plasmas and so we

1226
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
tokamax can confine plasmas and so we
 

1227
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,590
tokamax can confine plasmas and so we
now

1228
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
now
 

1229
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,789
now
understand in in rather great detail

1230
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
understand in in rather great detail
 

1231
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,909
understand in in rather great detail
um the way they work and we're able to

1232
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
um the way they work and we're able to
 

1233
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,270
um the way they work and we're able to
predict what is

1234
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
predict what is
 

1235
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,470
predict what is
going to be required in order to build a

that that becomes essentially ignited

1240
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
that that becomes essentially ignited
 

1241
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,710
that that becomes essentially ignited
or very so close to ignited that it

1242
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
or very so close to ignited that it
 

1243
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,190
or very so close to ignited that it
doesn't matter

1244
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
doesn't matter
 

1245
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,950
doesn't matter
and and at the moment at least if you

1246
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:32,960
and and at the moment at least if you
 

1247
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,549
and and at the moment at least if you
use the modest magnetic field

1248
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
use the modest magnetic field
 

1249
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,350
use the modest magnetic field
values still very strong but but limited

1250
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
values still very strong but but limited
 

1251
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,510
values still very strong but but limited
limited magnetic field values

1252
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
limited magnetic field values
 

1253
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,710
limited magnetic field values
you have to build a very big device and

1254
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
you have to build a very big device and
 

1255
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,230
you have to build a very big device and

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,070
and the career career of many people
like me in the field

1326
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
like me in the field
 

1327
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,750
like me in the field
um i have to admit though

1328
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
um i have to admit though
 

1329
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,149
um i have to admit though
that one of the problems with eta is

1330
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
that one of the problems with eta is
 

1331
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,710
that one of the problems with eta is
that it's an extremely big and expensive

1332
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:16,720
that it's an extremely big and expensive
 

1333
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,350
that it's an extremely big and expensive
and

1334
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
and
 

1335
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,029
and
long time to build experiment and so it

1336
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:21,039
long time to build experiment and so it
 

1337
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,350
long time to build experiment and so it
won't even come into operation

1338
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
won't even come into operation
 

1339
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,070
won't even come into operation
until about 2025 even though it's been

1340
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
until about 2025 even though it's been
 

1341
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,070
until about 2025 even though it's been
being built for

1342
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,080
being built for
 

1343
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,390
being built for
10 years and it's been it was designed

1344
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400
10 years and it's been it was designed
 

1345
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,149
10 years and it's been it was designed
for 30 years before that

1346
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:32,159
for 30 years before that
 

1347
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,830
for 30 years before that
right and so that's actually one of the

1348
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:35,840
right and so that's actually one of the
 

1349
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,070
right and so that's actually one of the
big disappointments of my career

1350
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
big disappointments of my career
 

1351
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,630
big disappointments of my career
in a certain sense which is that we

1352
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
in a certain sense which is that we
 

1353
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,669
in a certain sense which is that we
won't get to

1354
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:41,679
won't get to
 

1355
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,110
won't get to
a burning fusion reaction until well

1356
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,120
a burning fusion reaction until well
 

1357
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,990
a burning fusion reaction until well
past the first

1358
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
past the first
 

1359
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,390
past the first
operation of eater and whether i'm alive

1360
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
operation of eater and whether i'm alive
 

1361
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,149
operation of eater and whether i'm alive
or not i don't know

1362
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:50,159
or not i don't know
 

1363
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,990
or not i don't know
but i certainly will be well and truly

1364
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
but i certainly will be well and truly
 

1365
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,230
but i certainly will be well and truly
retired by the time that happens

1366
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
retired by the time that happens
 

1367
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,029
retired by the time that happens
and so when i realized maybe some years

1368
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
and so when i realized maybe some years
 

1369
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,350
and so when i realized maybe some years
ago that that was going to be the case

1370
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
ago that that was going to be the case
 

1371
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,590
ago that that was going to be the case
it was a discouragement to me let's put

1372
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
it was a discouragement to me let's put
 

1373
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,269
it was a discouragement to me let's put
it like that

1374
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
it like that
 

1375
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,710
it like that
but if we can try to look maybe

1376
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:06,720
but if we can try to look maybe
 

1377
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,950
but if we can try to look maybe
in a ridiculous kind of way look into uh

1378
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
in a ridiculous kind of way look into uh
 

1379
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,350
in a ridiculous kind of way look into uh
100 years from now 200 years 500 years

1380
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
100 years from now 200 years 500 years
 

1381
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,310
100 years from now 200 years 500 years
from now

1382
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
from now
 

1383
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,549
from now
and we you know there's folks like elon

1384
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:14,559
and we you know there's folks like elon
 

1385
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,269
and we you know there's folks like elon
musk uh trying to uh travel outside the

1386
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:17,279
musk uh trying to uh travel outside the
 

1387
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,549
musk uh trying to uh travel outside the
solar system

1388
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
solar system
 

1389
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,390
solar system
i mean the amount of energy we need for

1390
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:20,400
i mean the amount of energy we need for
 

1391
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,750
i mean the amount of energy we need for
some of the exciting things we want to

1392
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
some of the exciting things we want to
 

1393
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,310
some of the exciting things we want to
do

1394
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
do
 

1395
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,870
do
in this world if we look again 100 years

1396
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
in this world if we look again 100 years
 

1397
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,669
in this world if we look again 100 years
from now

1398
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
from now
 

1399
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,110
from now
uh seems to be a very large amount

1400
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
uh seems to be a very large amount
 

1401
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,950
uh seems to be a very large amount
so do you think fusion energy will

1402
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960
so do you think fusion energy will
 

1403
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,549
so do you think fusion energy will
eventually

1404
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
eventually
 

1405
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,830
eventually
uh sometime into your retirement uh

1406
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
uh sometime into your retirement uh
 

1407
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,110
uh sometime into your retirement uh
will be basically uh behind

1408
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
will be basically uh behind
 

1409
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,510
will be basically uh behind
most of the things we do look i

1410
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
most of the things we do look i
 

1411
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,310
most of the things we do look i
absolutely

1412
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,320
absolutely
 

1413
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,750
absolutely
think that fusion research is

1414
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:45,760
think that fusion research is
 

1415
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,909
think that fusion research is
completely justified in fact we should

1416
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:47,919
completely justified in fact we should
 

1417
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,830
completely justified in fact we should
be spending more time and effort on it

1418
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:49,840
be spending more time and effort on it
 

1419
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,669
be spending more time and effort on it
than we currently do

1420
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:51,679
than we currently do
 

1421
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,029
than we currently do
but it isn't going to be a magic bullet

1422
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:55,039
but it isn't going to be a magic bullet
 

1423
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,269
but it isn't going to be a magic bullet
that somehow

1424
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
that somehow
 

1425
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,750
that somehow
solves all the problems of energy by the

1426
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
solves all the problems of energy by the
 

1427
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,510
solves all the problems of energy by the
way that's a generic statement you can

1428
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:01,520
way that's a generic statement you can
 

1429
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,149
way that's a generic statement you can
make about

1430
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:02,159
make about
 

1431
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,470
make about
any energy source in my view i think

1432
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
any energy source in my view i think
 

1433
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,310
any energy source in my view i think
it's a grave mistake to think that

1434
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
it's a grave mistake to think that
 

1435
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,430
it's a grave mistake to think that
science

1436
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
science
 

1437
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,669
science
of any sort is suddenly going to find a

1438
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
of any sort is suddenly going to find a
 

1439
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,750
of any sort is suddenly going to find a
magic bullet for meeting all the energy

1440
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
magic bullet for meeting all the energy
 

1441
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,510
magic bullet for meeting all the energy
needs of society or any of the other

1442
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
needs of society or any of the other
 

1443
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,590
needs of society or any of the other
needs of society by the way

1444
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:15,600
needs of society by the way
 

1445
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,990
needs of society by the way
but and we can talk about that hopefully

1446
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
but and we can talk about that hopefully
 

1447
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,909
but and we can talk about that hopefully
later

1448
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
later
 

1449
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,390
later
but but but but fusion is very

1450
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:22,400
but but but but fusion is very
 

1451
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,230
but but but but fusion is very
worthwhile and we should be doing it

1452
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
worthwhile and we should be doing it
 

1453
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,510
worthwhile and we should be doing it
um and and so my disappointment

1454
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:27,520
um and and so my disappointment
 

1455
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,390
um and and so my disappointment
that i just expressed was in a certain

1456
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,400
that i just expressed was in a certain
 

1457
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,870
that i just expressed was in a certain
sense of personal disappointment

1458
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
sense of personal disappointment
 

1459
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,510
sense of personal disappointment
i do think that fusion energy is a

1460
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,520
i do think that fusion energy is a
 

1461
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,830
i do think that fusion energy is a
terrific challenge it's very difficult

1462
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,840
terrific challenge it's very difficult
 

1463
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,630
terrific challenge it's very difficult
to bring

1464
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
to bring
 

1465
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,630
to bring
the energy source of the sun and stars

1466
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:40,640
the energy source of the sun and stars
 

1467
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,230
the energy source of the sun and stars
down to earth

1468
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,240
down to earth
 

1469
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,430
down to earth
this does contrast in a certain sense

1470
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:45,440
this does contrast in a certain sense
 

1471
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,870
this does contrast in a certain sense
with fission energy by contrast fission

1472
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:48,880
with fission energy by contrast fission

efficient to build a fission reactor
 

1477
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,390
efficient to build a fission reactor
proved to be amazingly easy

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,830
proved to be amazingly easy
you know we did it um within a few years

1480
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:57,840
you know we did it um within a few years
 

1481
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,950
you know we did it um within a few years
of discovering nuclear fission people

1482
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:00,960
of discovering nuclear fission people
 

1483
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,750
of discovering nuclear fission people
had

1484
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
had
 

1485
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,230
had
figured out how to build a reactor and

1486
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,240
figured out how to build a reactor and
 

1487
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,110
figured out how to build a reactor and
did so

1488
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
did so
 

1489
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,510
did so
um you know during the second world war

1490
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,520
um you know during the second world war
 

1491
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,470
um you know during the second world war
which is by the way

1492
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
which is by the way
 

1493
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,710
which is by the way
fission is how the current nuclear power

1494
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
fission is how the current nuclear power
 

1495
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,669
fission is how the current nuclear power
plants work yeah

1496
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
plants work yeah
 

1497
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,590
plants work yeah
and so we have uh nuclear energy today

1498
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
and so we have uh nuclear energy today
 

1499
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,870
and so we have uh nuclear energy today
because fission uh reactors are

1500
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:18,880
because fission uh reactors are
 

1501
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,710
because fission uh reactors are
relatively easy to build you've got to

1502
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
relatively easy to build you've got to
 

1503
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,630
relatively easy to build you've got to
have what's hard is getting

1504
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:22,640
have what's hard is getting
 

1505
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,710
have what's hard is getting
the materials okay and that's just as

1506
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
the materials okay and that's just as
 

1507
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,549
the materials okay and that's just as
well because if everyone could get those

1508
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:26,559
well because if everyone could get those
 

1509
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,750
well because if everyone could get those
materials you know there would be

1510
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:27,760
materials you know there would be
 

1511
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,389
materials you know there would be
weapons proliferation and so forth

1512
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
weapons proliferation and so forth
 

1513
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,549
weapons proliferation and so forth
but it wasn't um all that long um

1514
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
but it wasn't um all that long um
 

1515
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,870
but it wasn't um all that long um
after even the discovery of nuclear

1516
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:36,880
after even the discovery of nuclear
 

1517
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,669
after even the discovery of nuclear
fission

1518
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:37,679
fission
 

1519
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,350
fission
that fission reactors were built and

1520
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
that fission reactors were built and
 

1521
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,110
that fission reactors were built and
fission reactors of course operated

1522
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,120
fission reactors of course operated
 

1523
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,029
fission reactors of course operated
before we had weapons

1524
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,039
before we had weapons
 

1525
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,549
before we had weapons
um so um

1526
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
um so um
 

1527
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,830
um so um
i think nuclear power is

1528
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
i think nuclear power is
 

1529
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,950
i think nuclear power is
obviously important to

1530
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:52,960
obviously important to
 

1531
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,990
obviously important to
meet the energy challenges of our

1532
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000
meet the energy challenges of our
 

1533
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,430
meet the energy challenges of our
age it is completely intrinsically

1534
00:27:59,430 --> 00:27:59,440
age it is completely intrinsically
 

1535
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,870
age it is completely intrinsically
completely

1536
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:00,880
completely
 

1537
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,909
completely
uh co2 emissions free

1538
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:03,919
uh co2 emissions free
 

1539
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,950
uh co2 emissions free
and in fact the wastes that come from

1540
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:06,960
and in fact the wastes that come from
 

1541
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,710
and in fact the wastes that come from
nuclear power whether it's fission or

1542
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
nuclear power whether it's fission or
 

1543
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,310
nuclear power whether it's fission or
fusion for that matter

1544
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,320
fusion for that matter
 

1545
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,149
fusion for that matter
are so moderate in quantity

1546
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:14,159
are so moderate in quantity
 

1547
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,630
are so moderate in quantity
that that we shouldn't really be worried

1548
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,640
that that we shouldn't really be worried
 

1549
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,750
that that we shouldn't really be worried
about them

1550
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:17,760
about them
 

1551
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,750
about them
um i mean yes fission products are

1552
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:19,760
um i mean yes fission products are
 

1553
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,110
um i mean yes fission products are
highly radioactive and

1554
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,120
highly radioactive and
 

1555
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,110
highly radioactive and
and we need to keep them away from

1556
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
and we need to keep them away from
 

1557
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,789
and we need to keep them away from
people but there's so little of them

1558
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:24,799
people but there's so little of them
 

1559
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,470
people but there's so little of them
it's that keeping them away from people

1560
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
it's that keeping them away from people
 

1561
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,470
it's that keeping them away from people
is not particularly difficult

1562
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,480
is not particularly difficult
 

1563
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,590
is not particularly difficult
and so while people complain a lot about

1564
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
and so while people complain a lot about
 

1565
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:31,909
and so while people complain a lot about
the

1566
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:31,919
the
 

1567
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,110
the
the drawbacks of fish and energy um

1568
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
the drawbacks of fish and energy um
 

1569
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,190
the drawbacks of fish and energy um
i think most of those complaints are

1570
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
i think most of those complaints are
 

1571
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,630
i think most of those complaints are
ill-informed

1572
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
ill-informed
 

1573
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,789
ill-informed
um we can talk about you know the the

1574
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:40,799
um we can talk about you know the the
 

1575
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,789
um we can talk about you know the the
challenges and the disasters if you like

1576
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
challenges and the disasters if you like
 

1577
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,430
challenges and the disasters if you like
of

1578
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
of
 

1579
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,549
of
uh off of fission reactors but i think

1580
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
uh off of fission reactors but i think
 

1581
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,510
uh off of fission reactors but i think
fission in the near term offers a

1582
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:49,520
fission in the near term offers a
 

1583
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,510
fission in the near term offers a
terrific opportunity

1584
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520
terrific opportunity
 

1585
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,789
terrific opportunity
for environmentally friendly energy

1586
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:54,799
for environmentally friendly energy
 

1587
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,710
for environmentally friendly energy
which in which in the world as a whole

1588
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:56,720
which in which in the world as a whole
 

1589
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,070
which in which in the world as a whole
is rapidly being

1590
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
is rapidly being
 

1591
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,070
is rapidly being
taken advantage of you know china and

1592
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
taken advantage of you know china and
 

1593
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,350
taken advantage of you know china and
india and places like that

1594
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,360
india and places like that
 

1595
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,669
india and places like that
are rapidly building fission plants

1596
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
are rapidly building fission plants
 

1597
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,269
are rapidly building fission plants
we're not rapidly building fission

1598
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
we're not rapidly building fission
 

1599
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:05,830
we're not rapidly building fission
plants

1600
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
plants
 

1601
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,669
plants
in the u.s although we are actually

1602
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:07,679
in the u.s although we are actually
 

1603
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,350
in the u.s although we are actually
building two at the moment

1604
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,360
building two at the moment
 

1605
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,950
building two at the moment
um two new ones um but we do still

1606
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,960
um two new ones um but we do still
 

1607
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,669
um two new ones um but we do still
get 20 of our electricity from fish and

1608
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
get 20 of our electricity from fish and
 

1609
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,070
get 20 of our electricity from fish and
energy and we could get a lot more

1610
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
energy and we could get a lot more
 

1611
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,070
energy and we could get a lot more
so it's clean energy so it's clean

1612
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
so it's clean energy so it's clean
 

1613
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,269
so it's clean energy so it's clean
energy now

1614
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
energy now
 

1615
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,830
energy now
now again the concern is there's a very

1616
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:23,840
now again the concern is there's a very
 

1617
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,470
now again the concern is there's a very
popular

1618
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:24,480
popular
 

1619
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,149
popular
hbo show and just came out on chernobyl

1620
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:28,159
hbo show and just came out on chernobyl
 

1621
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,750
hbo show and just came out on chernobyl
uh there's the three mile island there's

1622
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:29,760
uh there's the three mile island there's
 

1623
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,269
uh there's the three mile island there's
fukushima that's the most recent

1624
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
fukushima that's the most recent
 

1625
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,230
fukushima that's the most recent
disaster

1626
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,240
disaster
 

1627
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,190
disaster
so there's a kind of a concern of um

1628
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
so there's a kind of a concern of um
 

1629
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,430
so there's a kind of a concern of um
yeah i mean nuclear disasters

1630
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440
yeah i mean nuclear disasters
 

1631
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,990
yeah i mean nuclear disasters
is that what do you make of that kind of

1632
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
is that what do you make of that kind of
 

1633
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,830
is that what do you make of that kind of
uh concern especially if we look into

1634
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:41,840
uh concern especially if we look into
 

1635
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,830
uh concern especially if we look into
the future of fission energy based uh

1636
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
the future of fission energy based uh
 

1637
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,630
the future of fission energy based uh
reactors

1638
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,640
reactors
 

1639
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,230
reactors
well first of all let me say one or two

1640
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,240
well first of all let me say one or two
 

1641
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,070
well first of all let me say one or two
words about the contrast between fission

1642
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,080
words about the contrast between fission
 

1643
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,590
words about the contrast between fission
and fusion and then we'll come on to the

1644
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:49,600
and fusion and then we'll come on to the
 

1645
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,310
and fusion and then we'll come on to the
question of the

1646
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,320
question of the
 

1647
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,669
question of the
disasters and so forth fission does have

1648
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
disasters and so forth fission does have
 

1649
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,269
disasters and so forth fission does have
some drawbacks and they're

1650
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
some drawbacks and they're
 

1651
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,389
some drawbacks and they're
and they're largely to do with four

1652
00:29:58,389 --> 00:29:58,399
and they're largely to do with four
 

1653
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,909
and they're largely to do with four
four main areas one is do we have enough

1654
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
four main areas one is do we have enough
 

1655
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,350
four main areas one is do we have enough
uranium or other

1656
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:03,360
uranium or other
 

1657
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,750
uranium or other
fissile fuels to to supply our energy

1658
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:05,760
fissile fuels to to supply our energy
 

1659
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,789
fissile fuels to to supply our energy
needs

1660
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:06,799
needs
 

1661
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,789
needs
for a long time the answer to that is

1662
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799
for a long time the answer to that is
 

1663
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,870
for a long time the answer to that is
that we know we have

1664
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:10,880
that we know we have
 

1665
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,149
that we know we have
um enough uranium to support fission

1666
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:14,159
um enough uranium to support fission
 

1667
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:14,710
um enough uranium to support fission
energy

1668
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,720
energy
 

1669
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,710
energy
worldwide for thousands of years

1670
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
worldwide for thousands of years
 

1671
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,950
worldwide for thousands of years
but maybe not for millions of years okay

1672
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
but maybe not for millions of years okay
 

1673
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,149
but maybe not for millions of years okay
so that's resources um secondly

1674
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:26,159
so that's resources um secondly
 

1675
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,710
so that's resources um secondly
there there are issues to do with wastes

1676
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
there there are issues to do with wastes
 

1677
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,669
there there are issues to do with wastes
fission wastes

1678
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:29,679
fission wastes
 

1679
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,549
fission wastes
are highly radioactive and some of them

1680
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:32,559
are highly radioactive and some of them
 

1681
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,750
are highly radioactive and some of them
are volatile

1682
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:33,760
are volatile
 

1683
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,350
are volatile
and so for example um in

1684
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,360
and so for example um in
 

1685
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,710
and so for example um in
fukushima the the problem was

1686
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:40,720
fukushima the the problem was
 

1687
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,190
fukushima the the problem was
that some fraction of the fish and waste

1688
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,200
that some fraction of the fish and waste
 

1689
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,630
that some fraction of the fish and waste
were volatilized

1690
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
were volatilized
 

1691
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,230
were volatilized
and went out as a cloud and and polluted

1692
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
and went out as a cloud and and polluted
 

1693
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,669
and went out as a cloud and and polluted
air areas with um cesium

1694
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:51,679
air areas with um cesium
 

1695
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,870
air areas with um cesium
137 strontium 90 and things like that

1696
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
137 strontium 90 and things like that
 

1697
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,669
137 strontium 90 and things like that
so that's a challenge of fission um

1698
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
so that's a challenge of fission um
 

1699
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,190
so that's a challenge of fission um
there's a problem of

1700
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,200
there's a problem of
 

1701
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,509
there's a problem of
safety uh beyond that and that is

1702
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:03,519
safety uh beyond that and that is
 

1703
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,110
safety uh beyond that and that is
that um in fission it's hard to turn the

1704
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,120
that um in fission it's hard to turn the
 

1705
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,230
that um in fission it's hard to turn the
reactor off

1706
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
reactor off
 

1707
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,070
reactor off
when you turn when you stop the nuclear

1708
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
when you turn when you stop the nuclear
 

1709
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,509
when you turn when you stop the nuclear
reactions

1710
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:11,519
reactions
 

1711
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,909
reactions
there is still a lot of heat being

1712
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
there is still a lot of heat being
 

1713
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,310
there is still a lot of heat being
liberated from the fission products

1714
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
liberated from the fission products
 

1715
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,230
liberated from the fission products
and that is actually what the problem

1716
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
and that is actually what the problem
 

1717
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,389
and that is actually what the problem
was at fukushima

1718
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
was at fukushima
 

1719
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,750
was at fukushima
the fukushima reactors were shut down

1720
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
the fukushima reactors were shut down
 

1721
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,149
the fukushima reactors were shut down
the moment that the earthquake took

1722
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
the moment that the earthquake took
 

1723
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,590
the moment that the earthquake took
place

1724
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:27,600
place
 

1725
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,230
place
and they were shut down safely what then

1726
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240
and they were shut down safely what then
 

1727
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,710
and they were shut down safely what then
happened

1728
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
happened
 

1729
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,350
happened
after that fukushima was you know there

1730
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,360
after that fukushima was you know there
 

1731
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,190
after that fukushima was you know there
were there was this enormous

1732
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,200
were there was this enormous
 

1733
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,029
were there was this enormous
tidal wave um many tens of meters high

1734
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
tidal wave um many tens of meters high
 

1735
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,149
tidal wave um many tens of meters high
that came through

1736
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
that came through
 

1737
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,990
that came through
and destroyed the electricity

1738
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,000
and destroyed the electricity
 

1739
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,430
and destroyed the electricity
grid feed to the fukushima reactors and

1740
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,440
grid feed to the fukushima reactors and
 

1741
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:47,830
grid feed to the fukushima reactors and
their

1742
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
their
 

1743
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,190
their
cooling was then turned off and it was

1744
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
cooling was then turned off and it was
 

1745
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,470
cooling was then turned off and it was
the after heat

1746
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:52,480
the after heat
 

1747
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,389
the after heat
of the turned off reactors that

1748
00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:54,399
of the turned off reactors that
 

1749
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,389
of the turned off reactors that
eventually caused the problems that

1750
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
eventually caused the problems that
 

1751
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,590
eventually caused the problems that
led to release and so that so that is

1752
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
led to release and so that so that is
 

1753
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,909
led to release and so that so that is
that's a safety concern and then and

1754
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
that's a safety concern and then and
 

1755
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:02,710
that's a safety concern and then and
then

1756
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,720
then
 

1757
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,870
then
finally there's a problem of

1758
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:04,880
finally there's a problem of
 

1759
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,230
finally there's a problem of
proliferation

1760
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:06,240
proliferation
 

1761
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,710
proliferation
and that is that fission reactors need

1762
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:08,720
and that is that fission reactors need
 

1763
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,909
and that is that fission reactors need
fissile fuel

1764
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:09,919
fissile fuel
 

1765
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,789
fissile fuel
and the technologies for producing the

1766
00:32:12,789 --> 00:32:12,799
and the technologies for producing the
 

1767
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:13,350
and the technologies for producing the
under

1768
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,360
under
 

1769
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,470
under
enriching and so forth the fuels can be

1770
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:16,480
enriching and so forth the fuels can be
 

1771
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,509
enriching and so forth the fuels can be
used can be

1772
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
used can be
 

1773
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,190
used can be
can be um by by bad actors

1774
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:21,200
can be um by by bad actors
 

1775
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,070
can be um by by bad actors
to generate um the materials needed for

1776
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
to generate um the materials needed for
 

1777
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,590
to generate um the materials needed for
a nuclear weapon and that's

1778
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,600
a nuclear weapon and that's
 

1779
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,750
a nuclear weapon and that's
a very very serious concern so those are

1780
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:27,760
a very very serious concern so those are
 

1781
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,269
a very very serious concern so those are
the four problems

1782
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:29,279
the four problems
 

1783
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,710
the four problems
fusion has major advantages in respect

1784
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,720
fusion has major advantages in respect
 

1785
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,029
fusion has major advantages in respect
of

1786
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:33,039
of
 

1787
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,149
of
all of those problems it has more uh

1788
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:36,159
all of those problems it has more uh
 

1789
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,830
all of those problems it has more uh
longer term um fuel resources

1790
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:39,840
longer term um fuel resources
 

1791
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,029
longer term um fuel resources
it has far more benign waste

00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:03,679
when it's turned off in fact the hard
 

1815
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,269
when it's turned off in fact the hard
part of fusion is turning it on not

1816
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
part of fusion is turning it on not
 

1817
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,190
part of fusion is turning it on not
turning it off

1818
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
turning it off
 

1819
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,830
turning it off
and and finally you don't need the same

1820
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:09,840
and and finally you don't need the same
 

1821
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,470
and and finally you don't need the same
uh

1822
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
uh
 

1823
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,950
uh
fission technology to do to make uh

1824
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:12,960
fission technology to do to make uh
 

1825
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,549
fission technology to do to make uh
fusion work and so it

1826
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:14,559
fusion work and so it
 

1827
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,789
fusion work and so it
there it's got terrific advantages from

1828
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:16,799
there it's got terrific advantages from
 

1829
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,389
there it's got terrific advantages from
the point of view of proliferation

1830
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:18,399
the point of view of proliferation

1833
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,950

so those are the those are four main

1834
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:22,960
so those are the those are four main
 

1835
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,590

problems of fission energy
 

1843
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,190

i don't mean to say that fission energy
 

1845
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,830
i don't mean to say that fission energy
is overwhelmingly problematic

1846
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
is overwhelmingly problematic
 

1847
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,950
is overwhelmingly problematic
but clearly there have been catastrophes

1848
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,960
but clearly there have been catastrophes
 

1849
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,669

nuclear energy efficient based energy

1910

nuclear energy efficient based energy
 

1911
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,510
nuclear energy efficient based energy
goes into that category

1912
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,520
goes into that category
 

1913
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,950
goes into that category
it's one of the safest one of the

1914
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:48,960
it's one of the safest one of the
 

1915

it's one of the safest one of the
cleanest forms of energy

cleanest forms of energy
 

1917
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,669
cleanest forms of energy
and yet the pr uh

1918
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:53,679
and yet the pr uh
 

1919
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,909
and yet the pr uh
whoever does the pr for nuclear energy

1920
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:55,919
whoever does the pr for nuclear energy
 

1921
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:56,950
whoever does the pr for nuclear energy
is not uh

1922
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:56,960

has a hard job ahead of them at the

1924

has a hard job ahead of them at the
 

1925
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,550
has a hard job ahead of them at the
moment well i think part of that is

1926
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560
moment well i think part of that is
 

1927
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,630
moment well i think part of that is
their association with nuclear weapons

1928
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
their association with nuclear weapons
 

1929
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,829
their association with nuclear weapons
right because when you say the word

1930
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:03,839
right because when you say the word
 

1931
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,910
right because when you say the word
nuclear people don't instantly think

1932
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:05,920
nuclear people don't instantly think
 

1933
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,270
nuclear people don't instantly think
about nuclear energy they think about

1934
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,280
about nuclear energy they think about
 

1935
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,870
about nuclear energy they think about
nuclear weapons

1936
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
nuclear weapons
 

1937
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,910
nuclear weapons
and and so there is you know perhaps

1938
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:11,920
and and so there is you know perhaps
 

1939
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,550
and and so there is you know perhaps
um a natural tendency to do that but yes

1940
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:14,560
um a natural tendency to do that but yes
 

1941
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,990
um a natural tendency to do that but yes
i agree with you people are very

1942
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,000
i agree with you people are very
 

1943
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,349
i agree with you people are very
poor at estimating risks and they react

1944
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:19,359
poor at estimating risks and they react
 

1945
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,270
poor at estimating risks and they react
emotionally not rationally in most of

1946
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,280
emotionally not rationally in most of
 

1947
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,630
emotionally not rationally in most of
these situations

1948
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
these situations
 

1949
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,270
these situations
can we talk about nuclear weapons just

1950
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,280
can we talk about nuclear weapons just
 

1951
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,750
can we talk about nuclear weapons just
for a little bit

1952
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:27,760
for a little bit
 

1953
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,990
for a little bit
so fission is the kind of reaction

1954
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
so fission is the kind of reaction
 

1955
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,829
so fission is the kind of reaction
that's central to the nuclear weapons we

1956
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:31,839
that's central to the nuclear weapons we
 

1957
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:32,870
that's central to the nuclear weapons we
have today

1958
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:32,880
have today
 

1959
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,430
have today
that's what sets them off that's what

1960
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:35,440
that's what sets them off that's what
 

1961
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,470
that's what sets them off that's what
sets them off

1962
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480
sets them off
 

1963
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,150
sets them off
so if we look at the hydrogen bomb maybe

1964
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,160
so if we look at the hydrogen bomb maybe
 

1965
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,910
so if we look at the hydrogen bomb maybe
you can say how these different

1966
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
you can say how these different
 

1967
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,230
you can say how these different
weapons work so the earliest nuclear

1968
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
weapons work so the earliest nuclear
 

1969
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,190
weapons work so the earliest nuclear
weapons the

1970
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:43,200
weapons the
 

1971
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,109
weapons the
the nuclear bombs that were dropped on

1972
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:45,119
the nuclear bombs that were dropped on
 

1973
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,109
the nuclear bombs that were dropped on
japan etc etc

1974
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
japan etc etc
 

1975
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,030
japan etc etc
were pure fission weapons they used

1976
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,040
were pure fission weapons they used
 

1977
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,710
were pure fission weapons they used

00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:57,990
and their energy is essentially entirely
derived

1982
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,000
derived
 

1983
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,990
derived
from fission reactions but

1984
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
from fission reactions but
 

1985
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,349
from fission reactions but
it was early realized that more energy

1986
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
it was early realized that more energy
 

1987
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,790
it was early realized that more energy
was available

1988
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:06,800
was available
 

1989
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,390
was available
if one could somehow combine a fission

1990
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:10,400
if one could somehow combine a fission
 

1991
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,190
if one could somehow combine a fission
bomb

1992
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:11,200
bomb
 

1993
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,630
bomb
with um fusion reactions

1994
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:16,640
with um fusion reactions
 

1995
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,670
with um fusion reactions
um because the fusion reactions

1996
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680
um because the fusion reactions
 

1997
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,910
um because the fusion reactions
give more energy per unit mass than

1998
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
give more energy per unit mass than
 

1999
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,430
give more energy per unit mass than
than fission reactions and these were

2000
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440
than fission reactions and these were
 

2001
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,230
than fission reactions and these were
this was called

2002
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,240
this was called
 

2003
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,150
this was called
the super you might have heard of the

2004
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,160
the super you might have heard of the
 

2005
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,230
the super you might have heard of the
expression the super or more simply

2006
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
expression the super or more simply
 

2007
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,270
expression the super or more simply
hydrogen bombs okay um

2008
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
hydrogen bombs okay um
 

2009
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,910
hydrogen bombs okay um
bombs which use isotopes of hydrogen and

2010
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
bombs which use isotopes of hydrogen and
 

2011
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,589
bombs which use isotopes of hydrogen and
the fusion reactions associated with

2012
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:39,599
the fusion reactions associated with
 

2013
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,069
the fusion reactions associated with
them

2014
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:40,079
them
 

2015
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,829
them
like you said it's hard to turn on it's

2016
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:41,839
like you said it's hard to turn on it's
 

2017
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:43,349
like you said it's hard to turn on it's
hard to turn on because you need very

2018
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:43,359
hard to turn on because you need very
 

2019
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,710
hard to turn on because you need very
high temperatures

2020
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:44,720
high temperatures
 

2021
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,150
high temperatures
and you need confinement of that

2022
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,160
and you need confinement of that
 

2023
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,750
and you need confinement of that
long enough for the reactions to take

2024
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:49,760
long enough for the reactions to take
 

2025
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,910
long enough for the reactions to take
place and so a bomb

2026
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:51,920
place and so a bomb
 

2027
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,950
place and so a bomb
actually a thermonuclear bomb

2028
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:54,960
actually a thermonuclear bomb
 

2029
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,230
actually a thermonuclear bomb
or a hydrogen bomb

2030
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240

 

2031
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,430

has essentially

2032
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:01,440

 

2033
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,950

a chemical implosion

2034
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:04,960
a chemical implosion
 

2035
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,190
a chemical implosion
which then sets off a fission

2036
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,200
which then sets off a fission
 

2037
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,550
which then sets off a fission
explosion which then sets off

2038
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
explosion which then sets off
 

2039
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,990
explosion which then sets off
and compresses hydrogen isotopes

2040
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
and compresses hydrogen isotopes
 

2041
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,069
and compresses hydrogen isotopes
and other things which i don't know

2042
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:18,079
and other things which i don't know
 

2043
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,750
and other things which i don't know
because i don't i've never had a

2044
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:19,760
because i don't i've never had a
 

2045
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,470
because i don't i've never had a
security clearance okay so i so i can't

2046
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,480
security clearance okay so i so i can't
 

2047
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,510
security clearance okay so i so i can't
betray any

2048
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
betray any
 

2049
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,150
betray any
secrets about weapons because i've never

2050
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,160
secrets about weapons because i've never
 

2051
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,910
secrets about weapons because i've never
been a party to them but

2052
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:27,920
been a party to them but
 

2053
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,310
been a party to them but
because i know a lot about this problem

2054
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:30,320
because i know a lot about this problem
 

2055
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,030
because i know a lot about this problem
i

2056
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,040
i
 

2057
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,630
i
can guess okay um and sets off

2058
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:34,640
can guess okay um and sets off
 

2059
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,550
can guess okay um and sets off
fusion reactions in the middle okay so

2060
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:36,560
fusion reactions in the middle okay so
 

2061
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,670
fusion reactions in the middle okay so
that's basically

2062
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
that's basically
 

2063
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,829
that's basically
it's that sequence of things which

2064
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:39,839
it's that sequence of things which
 

2065
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,109
it's that sequence of things which
produce these enormous

2066
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:41,119
produce these enormous
 

2067
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,390
produce these enormous
you know multi-megaton uh bombs that

2068
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
you know multi-megaton uh bombs that
 

2069
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,430
you know multi-megaton uh bombs that
have very large yields um

2070
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,440
have very large yields um
 

2071
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,870
have very large yields um
and so fusion alone can't get can't get

2072
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:50,880
and so fusion alone can't get can't get
 

2073
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,069
and so fusion alone can't get can't get
you there

2074
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:52,079
you there
 

2075
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,510
you there
it is actually possible to set off or to

2076
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
it is actually possible to set off or to
 

2077
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,430
it is actually possible to set off or to
try to set off

2078
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
try to set off
 

2079
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,710
try to set off
little fusion bombs alone without the

2080
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:00,720
little fusion bombs alone without the
 

2081
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,349
little fusion bombs alone without the
surrounding fission explosion

2082
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:05,359
surrounding fission explosion
 

2083
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,710
surrounding fission explosion
and that is what is called laser fusion

2084
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:08,720
and that is what is called laser fusion
 

2085
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,990
and that is what is called laser fusion
so another approach to fusion which

2086
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,000
so another approach to fusion which
 

2087
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,950
so another approach to fusion which
actually is

2088
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:12,960
actually is
 

2089
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,230
actually is
mostly researched in the

2090
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,240
mostly researched in the
 

2091
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,950
mostly researched in the
weapons complex the national labs and so

2092
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
weapons complex the national labs and so
 

2093
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,230
weapons complex the national labs and so
forth

2094
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,240
forth
 

2095
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,150
forth
because it's more associated with the

2096
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:22,160
because it's more associated with the
 

2097
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,710
because it's more associated with the
technology of of weapons

2098
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:24,720
technology of of weapons
 

2099
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,069
technology of of weapons
is inertial fusion so if if you decide

2100
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
is inertial fusion so if if you decide
 

2101
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:28,710
is inertial fusion so if if you decide
instead of

2102
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:28,720
instead of
 

2103
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,030
instead of
trying to make your plasma just sit

2104
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,040
trying to make your plasma just sit
 

2105
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,790
trying to make your plasma just sit
there in this taurus in the in the

2106
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:32,800
there in this taurus in the in the
 

2107
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,670
there in this taurus in the in the
tokamak and

2108
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:33,680
tokamak and
 

2109
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,910
tokamak and
be controlled steady state with a

2110
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:35,920
be controlled steady state with a
 

2111
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,430
be controlled steady state with a
magnetic field if you if you're willing

2112
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:37,440
magnetic field if you if you're willing
 

2113
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,349
magnetic field if you if you're willing
to accept that

2114
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
to accept that
 

2115
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,910
to accept that
i'll just set off an explosion okay and

2116
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:41,920
i'll just set off an explosion okay and
 

2117
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,829
i'll just set off an explosion okay and
then i'll gather the energy from that

2118
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:43,839
then i'll gather the energy from that
 

2119
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,990
then i'll gather the energy from that
somehow i don't quite know how but let's

2120
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,000
somehow i don't quite know how but let's
 

2121
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,550
somehow i don't quite know how but let's
not ask that question too much

2122
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:48,560
not ask that question too much
 

2123
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,670
not ask that question too much
um then it is possible

2124
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:51,680
um then it is possible
 

2125
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,750
um then it is possible
to imagine generating fusion alone

2126
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:55,760
to imagine generating fusion alone
 

2127
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,790
to imagine generating fusion alone
explosions and and the way you do it is

2128
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:58,800
explosions and and the way you do it is
 

2129
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,230
explosions and and the way you do it is
you take

2130
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,240
you take
 

2131
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,030
you take
some small amount of deuterium tritium

2132
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,040
some small amount of deuterium tritium
 

2133
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,750
some small amount of deuterium tritium
fuel

2134
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:03,760
fuel
 

2135
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,470
fuel
you bombard it with energy from all

2136
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
you bombard it with energy from all
 

2137
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,750
you bombard it with energy from all
sides

2138
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:07,760
sides
 

2139
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,670
sides
and this is what the lasers are used for

2140
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:09,680
and this is what the lasers are used for
 

2141
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,990
and this is what the lasers are used for
extremely powerful at lasers

2142
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,000

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,990
and we'll talk about the sort of the
biggest picture view of it all

2306
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,000
biggest picture view of it all
 

2307
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,950
biggest picture view of it all
uh but let me just ask in terms of your

2308
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,960
uh but let me just ask in terms of your
 

2309
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,990
uh but let me just ask in terms of your
worries

2310
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,000
worries
 

2311
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,790
worries
of if we look 100 years from now we're

2312
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
of if we look 100 years from now we're
 

2313
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,069
of if we look 100 years from now we're
in the middle of

2314
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:18,079
in the middle of
 

2315
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,870
in the middle of
what is now a natural pandemic that from

2316
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
what is now a natural pandemic that from
 

2317
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,030
what is now a natural pandemic that from
the looks of it

2318
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
the looks of it
 

2319
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,230
the looks of it
it fortunately is not as bad as it could

2320
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:26,240
it fortunately is not as bad as it could
 

2321
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,230
it fortunately is not as bad as it could
have possibly been if you look at the

2322
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,240
have possibly been if you look at the
 

2323
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,750
have possibly been if you look at the
spanish flu if you look at the history

2324
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760
spanish flu if you look at the history
 

2325
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,790
spanish flu if you look at the history
of pandemics

2326
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:30,800
of pandemics
 

2327
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,990
of pandemics
if you look at all the possible

2328
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
if you look at all the possible
 

2329
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,390
if you look at all the possible
pandemics that could have been that that

2330
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,400
pandemics that could have been that that
 

2331
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,990
pandemics that could have been that that
folks like bill gates are exceptionally

2332
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
folks like bill gates are exceptionally
 

2333
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,910
folks like bill gates are exceptionally
terrified about we've

2334
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:37,920
terrified about we've
 

2335
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,109
terrified about we've
uh i know many people are suffering

2336
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
uh i know many people are suffering
 

2337
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,109
uh i know many people are suffering
uh but it's it's it's better than it

2338
00:42:43,109 --> 00:42:43,119
uh but it's it's it's better than it
 

2339
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,870
uh but it's it's it's better than it
could have been uh so

2340
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
could have been uh so
 

2341
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,390
could have been uh so
and now we're talking about nuclear

2342
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:46,400
and now we're talking about nuclear
 

2343
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,790
and now we're talking about nuclear
weapons in terms of existential threats

2344
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
weapons in terms of existential threats
 

2345
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,069
weapons in terms of existential threats
to us

2346
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:50,079
to us
 

2347
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,750
to us
as sinful humans uh what worries you the

2348
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:53,760
as sinful humans uh what worries you the
 

2349
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,190
as sinful humans uh what worries you the
most

2350
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,200
most
 

2351
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,470
most
is it nuclear weapons is is it

2352
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:58,480
is it nuclear weapons is is it
 

2353
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,710
is it nuclear weapons is is it

is there do you think in those

2364
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:11,839
is there do you think in those
 

2365
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,829
is there do you think in those
existential terms uh

2366
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:13,839
existential terms uh
 

2367
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,550
existential terms uh
and and do any aspect do any of those

2368
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,560
and and do any aspect do any of those
 

2369
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,630
and and do any aspect do any of those
things worry you

2370
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:18,640
things worry you
 

2371
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,750
things worry you
i am certainly not confident that

2372
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:21,760
i am certainly not confident that
 

2373
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,150
i am certainly not confident that
my children and grandchildren will

2374
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:24,160
my children and grandchildren will
 

2375
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,270
my children and grandchildren will
experience the benefits of civilization

2376
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:27,280
experience the benefits of civilization
 

2377
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,309
experience the benefits of civilization
that i have enjoyed i think it's

2378
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
that i have enjoyed i think it's
 

2379
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,550
that i have enjoyed i think it's
possible for our civilizations to break

2380
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,560
possible for our civilizations to break
 

2381
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:32,990
possible for our civilizations to break
down

2382
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:33,000
down
 

2383
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,710
down
catastrophically i also

2384
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
catastrophically i also
 

2385
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,710
catastrophically i also
think that it's possible for our

2386
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:38,720
think that it's possible for our
 

2387
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,510
think that it's possible for our
civilizations to break down

2388
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
civilizations to break down
 

2389
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,109
civilizations to break down
progressively and i think they will

2390
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
progressively and i think they will
 

2391
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,790
progressively and i think they will
if we continue to have the explosion of

2392
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:48,800
if we continue to have the explosion of
 

2393
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,309
if we continue to have the explosion of
population on the planet that we

2394
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
population on the planet that we
 

2395
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,670
population on the planet that we
currently have

2396
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,680
currently have
 

2397
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,510
currently have
i mean it's quite it's quite

2398
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:55,520
i mean it's quite it's quite
 

2399
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,910
i mean it's quite it's quite
wrong to think of our problems as mostly

2400
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920
wrong to think of our problems as mostly
 

2401
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,870
wrong to think of our problems as mostly
being co2

2402
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:58,880
being co2
 

2403
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,430
being co2
if we can just solve co2 then we can go

2404
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:01,440
if we can just solve co2 then we can go
 

2405
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:01,910
if we can just solve co2 then we can go
on

2406
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
on
 

2407
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,309
on
having this you know continually

2408
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:04,319
having this you know continually
 

2409
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,750
having this you know continually
expanding economy

2410
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
expanding economy
 

2411
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,349
expanding economy
everywhere in the world of course you

2412
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:07,359
everywhere in the world of course you
 

2413
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,030
everywhere in the world of course you
can't do that okay

2414
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:09,040
can't do that okay
 

2415
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,750
can't do that okay
i mean there is a finite you know

2416
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760
i mean there is a finite you know
 

2417
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,069
i mean there is a finite you know
bearing capacity of our planet

2418
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:14,079
bearing capacity of our planet
 

2419
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,670
bearing capacity of our planet
on the resources of our planet on the

2420
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:15,680
on the resources of our planet on the
 

2421
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,190
on the resources of our planet on the

resources of our planet
 

2423
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,990
resources of our planet
and and we can't continue to do that so

2424
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,000
and and we can't continue to do that so
 

2425
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,510
and and we can't continue to do that so
i think there are lots of technical

2426
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:21,520
i think there are lots of technical
 

2427
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,230
i think there are lots of technical
reasons

2428
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
reasons
 

2429
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,910
reasons
why um a continually expanding

2430
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
why um a continually expanding
 

2431
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,910
why um a continually expanding
economy and and uh and civilization

2432
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:29,920
economy and and uh and civilization
 

2433
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,190
economy and and uh and civilization
is impossible and therefore um

2434
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,200
is impossible and therefore um
 

2435
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,190
is impossible and therefore um
actually i'm as much nervous about the

2436
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
actually i'm as much nervous about the
 

2437
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,230
actually i'm as much nervous about the
fact that our

2438
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:36,240
fact that our
 

2439
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,470
fact that our
population is eight billion or something

2440
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:38,480
population is eight billion or something
 

2441
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,589
population is eight billion or something
uh right now

2442
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
uh right now
 

2443
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,510
uh right now
worldwide as i am about um the fact that

2444
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:43,520
worldwide as i am about um the fact that
 

2445
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,589
worldwide as i am about um the fact that
you know a few million people would be

2446
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:45,599
you know a few million people would be
 

2447
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,630
you know a few million people would be
would be killed by

2448
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:46,640
would be killed by
 

2449
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,150
would be killed by
covet 19. i mean i don't want to be

2450
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:50,160
covet 19. i mean i don't want to be
 

2451
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,910
covet 19. i mean i don't want to be
callous about this but from the big

2452
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:51,920
callous about this but from the big
 

2453
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,069
callous about this but from the big
picture it seems like

2454
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:54,079
picture it seems like
 

2455
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,030
picture it seems like
that's much more of a problem

2456
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:56,040
that's much more of a problem
 

2457
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,510
that's much more of a problem
overpopulation

2458
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:57,520
overpopulation
 

2459
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,950
overpopulation
people not dying is ultimately more of a

2460
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
people not dying is ultimately more of a
 

2461
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,750
people not dying is ultimately more of a

2462
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:01,760
problem
 

2463
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,270
problem
uh than people dying um so you know that

2464
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
uh than people dying um so you know that
 

2465
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,829
uh than people dying um so you know that
probably sounds incredibly callousy or

2466
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:07,839
probably sounds incredibly callousy or
 

2467
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,150
probably sounds incredibly callousy or
to listeners but i think it's simply you

2468
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:10,160
to listeners but i think it's simply you
 

2469
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,270
to listeners but i think it's simply you
know a sober assessment of the situation

2470
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280
know a sober assessment of the situation
 

2471
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,390
know a sober assessment of the situation
is there is there ways from

2472
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:16,400
is there is there ways from
 

2473
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,470
is there is there ways from
the way those eight billion or seven

2474
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:18,480
the way those eight billion or seven
 

2475
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,230
the way those eight billion or seven
billion or whatever the number is

2476
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:20,240
billion or whatever the number is
 

2477
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,430
billion or whatever the number is
live that could make it sustainable

2478
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:23,440
live that could make it sustainable
 

2479
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,190
live that could make it sustainable
uh you know because you've kind of

2480
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:25,200
uh you know because you've kind of
 

2481
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,430
uh you know because you've kind of
implied there's a kind of uh

2482
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:27,440
implied there's a kind of uh
 

2483
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,030
implied there's a kind of uh
we have especially in the west this kind

2484
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,040
we have especially in the west this kind
 

2485
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,790
we have especially in the west this kind
of capitalist view of uh

2486
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:30,800
of capitalist view of uh
 

2487
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,190
of capitalist view of uh
really consuming a lot of resources is

2488
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200
really consuming a lot of resources is
 

2489
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,230
really consuming a lot of resources is
there a way to

2490
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:34,240
there a way to
 

2491
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,430
there a way to
like if you could change uh one thing or

2492
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:37,440
like if you could change uh one thing or
 

2493
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,870
like if you could change uh one thing or
a few things what would you

2494
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:38,880
a few things what would you
 

2495
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,630
a few things what would you
change to make this life make it look

2496
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:42,640
change to make this life make it look
 

2497
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,069
change to make this life make it look
more likely that your grandchildren have

2498
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:46,079
more likely that your grandchildren have
 

2499
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,109
more likely that your grandchildren have
a better life than you well okay so

2500
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:49,119
a better life than you well okay so
 

2501
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,870
a better life than you well okay so
let's talk a bit about energy because

2502
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
let's talk a bit about energy because
 

2503
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,470
let's talk a bit about energy because
that's something i know a lot a lot

2504
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:52,480
that's something i know a lot a lot
 

2505
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,230
that's something i know a lot a lot
about having thought about it most of my

2506
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,240
about having thought about it most of my
 

2507
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,510
about having thought about it most of my
career

2508
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520
career
 

2509
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,790
career
in order to reach a steady-state co2

2510
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:58,800
in order to reach a steady-state co2
 

2511

level
 

2513
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,750
level
okay that's acceptable in terms of

2514
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:01,760
okay that's acceptable in terms of
 

2515
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,750
okay that's acceptable in terms of
global climate change and so on and so

2516
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
global climate change and so on and so
 

2517
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,430
global climate change and so on and so
forth

2518
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:05,440
forth
 

2519
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,790
forth
we need to reduce our

2520
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:08,800
we need to reduce our
 

2521
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,190
we need to reduce our
carbon emissions by at least a factor of

2522
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:11,200
carbon emissions by at least a factor of
 

2523
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,829
carbon emissions by at least a factor of
10 worldwide

2524
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:12,839
10 worldwide
 

2525
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:15,670
10 worldwide
okay what's more

2526
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:15,680
okay what's more
 

2527
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,790
okay what's more
you know um the average

2528
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:18,800
you know um the average
 

2529
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,790
you know um the average
energy consumption and hence co2

2530
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:20,800
energy consumption and hence co2
 

2531
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,349
energy consumption and hence co2
emission of people in the world

2532
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:23,359
emission of people in the world
 

2533
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,870
emission of people in the world
is less than a tenth of what we

2534
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:26,880
is less than a tenth of what we
 

2535
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,069
is less than a tenth of what we
per capita of than what we have

2536
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:30,079
per capita of than what we have
 

2537
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,230
per capita of than what we have
in the west in america and europe and so

2538
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
in the west in america and europe and so
 

2539
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,109
in the west in america and europe and so
forth

2540
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
forth
 

2541
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,430
forth
so if you have in mind some utopia in

2542
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:35,440
so if you have in mind some utopia in
 

2543
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,950
so if you have in mind some utopia in
the future where we can where we've

2544
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:36,960
the future where we can where we've
 

2545
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,870
the future where we can where we've
reached a sustainable

2546
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:38,880
reached a sustainable
 

2547
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,150
reached a sustainable
use of energy and we've also reached

2548
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
use of energy and we've also reached
 

2549
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,270
use of energy and we've also reached
a situation in which there's far

2550
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,280
a situation in which there's far
 

2551
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,309
a situation in which there's far
less inequity in the world in the sense

2552
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:48,319
less inequity in the world in the sense
 

2553
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,750
less inequity in the world in the sense
that people have

2554
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
that people have
 

2555
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,990
that people have
share the energy resources more

2556
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,000
share the energy resources more
 

2557
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,510
share the energy resources more
uniformly

2558
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:53,520
uniformly
 

2559
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,990
uniformly
then what what that is equivalent to

2560
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
then what what that is equivalent to
 

2561
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,589
then what what that is equivalent to
would be to reduce

2562
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:57,599
would be to reduce
 

2563
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,190
would be to reduce
the co2 emissions in

2564
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
the co2 emissions in
 

2565
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,990
the co2 emissions in
western economies not by a factor of 10

2566
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
western economies not by a factor of 10
 

2567
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,349
western economies not by a factor of 10
but by a factor of 100 in other words

2568
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:05,359
but by a factor of 100 in other words
 

2569
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,349
but by a factor of 100 in other words
has to go down to one percent of what it

2570
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:07,359
has to go down to one percent of what it
 

2571
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:07,990
has to go down to one percent of what it
is now

2572
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
is now
 

2573
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,710
is now
okay yeah so you know when people talk

2574
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
okay yeah so you know when people talk
 

2575
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,670
okay yeah so you know when people talk
about

2576
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:11,680
about
 

2577
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,069
about
uh you know let's use natural gas

2578
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
uh you know let's use natural gas
 

2579
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,430
uh you know let's use natural gas
because you know maybe it

2580
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:15,440
because you know maybe it
 

2581
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,550
because you know maybe it
only uses 60 of the energy of coal

2582
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,560
only uses 60 of the energy of coal
 

2583
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,630
only uses 60 of the energy of coal
it's complete nonsense we that's not not

2584
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,640
it's complete nonsense we that's not not
 

2585
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,790
it's complete nonsense we that's not not
even scratching the surface of what we

2586
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:22,800
even scratching the surface of what we
 

2587
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,470
even scratching the surface of what we
would need to do so you know is that

2588
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:26,480
would need to do so you know is that
 

2589
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,910
would need to do so you know is that
going to be feasible

2590
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:27,920
going to be feasible
 

2591
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,349
going to be feasible
i i i very much doubt it

2592
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:31,359
i i i very much doubt it
 

2593
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,510
i i i very much doubt it
and therefore i actually doubt that we

2594
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:33,520
and therefore i actually doubt that we
 

2595
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,710
and therefore i actually doubt that we
can reach

2596
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:34,720
can reach
 

2597
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,190
can reach
um a level of energy

2598
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:39,200
um a level of energy
 

2599
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,870
um a level of energy
of fossil energy use that is one percent

2600
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:42,880
of fossil energy use that is one percent
 

2601
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,589
of fossil energy use that is one percent
of the current use in the west without

2602
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:45,599
of the current use in the west without
 

2603
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,710
of the current use in the west without
totally dramatic changes either in

2604
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:48,720
totally dramatic changes either in
 

2605
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,349
totally dramatic changes either in
you know our society our use of of

2606
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:51,359
you know our society our use of of
 

2607
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,190
you know our society our use of of
energy and so forth which actually

2608
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:53,200
energy and so forth which actually
 

2609
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,870
energy and so forth which actually
of course is much of that energy is used

2610
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:54,880
of course is much of that energy is used
 

2611
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:57,190
of course is much of that energy is used
for producing food and so on and so

2612
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
for producing food and so on and so
 

2613
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,150
for producing food and so on and so
forth so it's actually

2614
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,160
forth so it's actually
 

2615
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,630
forth so it's actually
not so obvious that we can we can get we

2616
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:00,640
not so obvious that we can we can get we
 

2617
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,309
not so obvious that we can we can get we
can cut down our energy usage by that

2618
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:02,319
can cut down our energy usage by that
 

2619
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:02,870
can cut down our energy usage by that
factor

2620
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:02,880
factor
 

2621
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,150
factor
or we've got to reduce the human

2622
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:06,160
or we've got to reduce the human
 

2623
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,670
or we've got to reduce the human
population population

2624
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
population population
 

2625
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,190
population population
so you run up against that number that's

2626
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:09,200
so you run up against that number that's
 

2627
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,390
so you run up against that number that's
increasing still

2628
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:12,400

 

2629
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,510

and you don't think that could be it's

2630
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:13,520
and you don't think that could be it's
 

2631
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,750
and you don't think that could be it's
depressing no it's not uh

2632
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:15,760
depressing no it's not uh
 

2633
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,750
depressing no it's not uh
it's not it's not it's not depressing

2634
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,760
it's not it's not it's not depressing
 

2635
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,829
it's not it's not it's not depressing
it's um

2636
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:19,839
it's um
 

2637
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:24,309
it's um
it's difficult like many truths are uh

2638
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:24,319
it's difficult like many truths are uh
 

2639
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,510
it's difficult like many truths are uh
do you do you have a hope uh that there

2640
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:27,520
do you do you have a hope uh that there
 

2641
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,069
do you do you have a hope uh that there
could be a technological solution

2642
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:30,079
could be a technological solution
 

2643
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,870
could be a technological solution
in short no there is no technological

2644
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:32,880
in short no there is no technological
 

2645
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,230
in short no there is no technological
solution

2646
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,240
solution
 

2647
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,109
solution
to for example for population control i

2648
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:37,119
to for example for population control i
 

2649
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,790
to for example for population control i
mean we have the technology

2650
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
mean we have the technology
 

2651
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,870
mean we have the technology
just you know to prevent ourselves

2652
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:40,880
just you know to prevent ourselves
 

2653
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,710
just you know to prevent ourselves

they think that there's some kind of
 

2671
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,150
they think that there's some kind of
technological magic bullet for this but

i just mentioned
 

2679
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,750
i just mentioned
not because it's obvious there isn't but

uh and and in in any case um
 

2685
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,870
uh and and in in any case um
that it's true of energy it's true of

most of the big challenges in our
 

2693
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:22,950

are not scientific or technological

2696
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:26,160
are not scientific or technological
 

2697
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,109
are not scientific or technological
challenges

2698
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:27,119
challenges
 

2699
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,470
challenges
they're human sociological challenges

2700
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:30,480
they're human sociological challenges
 

2701
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,270
they're human sociological challenges
and that's why i think it's a terrible

2702
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:33,280
and that's why i think it's a terrible
 

2703
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,309
and that's why i think it's a terrible
mistake

2704
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:34,319
mistake
 

2705
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,870
mistake
um even for folks like me who work at

2706
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:36,880
um even for folks like me who work at
 

2707
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,349
um even for folks like me who work at
you know

2708
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:37,359
you know
 

2709
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:39,349
you know
well the high temple of science and

2710
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
well the high temple of science and
 

2711
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,549
well the high temple of science and
technology

2712
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:40,559
technology
 

2713
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,430
technology
in in america and maybe in the galaxy

2714
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:43,440
in in america and maybe in the galaxy
 

2715
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,710
in in america and maybe in the galaxy
yeah i mean

2716
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:44,720
yeah i mean
 

2717
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,510
yeah i mean
you know it's it's it's mit it's mit

2718
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520
you know it's it's it's mit it's mit

best university in the world

2720
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:49,839
best university in the world
 

2721
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,790
best university in the world
it's it's a terrible mistake if we give

2722
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:52,800
it's it's a terrible mistake if we give
 

2723
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,750
it's it's a terrible mistake if we give
the impression

2724
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:53,760
the impression
 

2725
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,910
the impression
that technology is going to solve it all

2726
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:55,920
that technology is going to solve it all
 

2727
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,270
that technology is going to solve it all
technology will make

2728
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
technology will make
 

2729
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,030
technology will make
tremendous contributions and i think

2730
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
tremendous contributions and i think
 

2731
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,510
tremendous contributions and i think
it's it's worth working on it

2732
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:01,520
it's it's worth working on it
 

2733
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,309
it's it's worth working on it
but it's a disaster if you think it's

2734
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:04,319
but it's a disaster if you think it's
 

2735
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,710
but it's a disaster if you think it's
going to solve all of our problems and

2736
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:06,720
going to solve all of our problems and
 

2737
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,870
going to solve all of our problems and
and actually um you know i've written a

2738
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
and actually um you know i've written a
 

2739
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,910
and actually um you know i've written a
whole book about

2740
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:09,920
whole book about
 

2741
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,030
whole book about
the question of of scientism and the and

2742
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:13,040
the question of of scientism and the and
 

2743
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,670
the question of of scientism and the and
the over

2744
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:13,680
the over
 

2745
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,630
the over
emphasis on science both as a way of of

2746
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:16,640
emphasis on science both as a way of of
 

2747
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,750
emphasis on science both as a way of of
solving problems

2748
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:17,760
solving problems
 

2749
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,589
solving problems
through technology but also as a way of

2750
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
through technology but also as a way of
 

2751
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,349
through technology but also as a way of
gaining knowledge i think it's not

2752
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:21,359
gaining knowledge i think it's not
 

2753
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,349
gaining knowledge i think it's not
all of the knowledge there is either

2754
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:23,359
all of the knowledge there is either
 

2755
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,710
all of the knowledge there is either
yeah i think that book

2756
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
yeah i think that book
 

2757
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,150
yeah i think that book
and uh your journey there is fascinating

university like cambridge you know
 

2889
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,630
university like cambridge you know
you're surrounded by

or mathematical demonstration
 

2937
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,870
or mathematical demonstration
but it's actually extremely good it's

not you know simply an entity within
 

3187
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,470
not you know simply an entity within
it on the other hand you know our finite

3188
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:24,480
it on the other hand you know our finite
 

3189
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,230
it on the other hand you know our finite
minds

3190
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:26,240
minds
 

3191
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,150
minds
have a pretty hard time encompassing

3192
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:28,160
have a pretty hard time encompassing
 

3193
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,589
have a pretty hard time encompassing
that so

3194
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:29,599
that so
 

3195
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,230
that so
so one has to therefore work in terms of

3196
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:32,240
so one has to therefore work in terms of
 

3197
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,230
so one has to therefore work in terms of
metaphors and images and

3198
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
metaphors and images and
 

3199
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,270
metaphors and images and
and so forth and um

00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
and so forth and um
 

3201
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,630
and so forth and um
i think we would know very little about

central to christian belief and teaching
 

3273
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,190
central to christian belief and teaching
so in that in that sense through jesus

3274
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:03,200
so in that in that sense through jesus
 

3275
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,910
so in that in that sense through jesus
there was um that's kind of a historical

3276
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:05,920
there was um that's kind of a historical
 

3277
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,390
there was um that's kind of a historical
moment

3278
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:06,400
moment
 

3279
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,470
moment
that's profound that's really powerful

3280
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:08,480
that's profound that's really powerful
 

3281
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,589
that's profound that's really powerful
but do you also

3282
01:00:09,589 --> 01:00:09,599
but do you also
 

3283
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,430
but do you also
think that god makes himself seen in

3284
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
think that god makes himself seen in
 

3285
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,870
think that god makes himself seen in
less obvious ways

3286
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:14,880
less obvious ways
 

3287
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,230
less obvious ways
in our world today absolutely

3288
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:18,240
in our world today absolutely
 

3289
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,549
in our world today absolutely
absolutely i mean it's it's certainly

3290
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:20,559
absolutely i mean it's it's certainly
 

3291
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,150
absolutely i mean it's it's certainly
been

3292
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:22,160
been
 

3293
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,910
been
the outlook of um

3294
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:25,920
the outlook of um
 

3295
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,270
the outlook of um
jews and christians throughout history

3296
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
jews and christians throughout history
 

3297
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,069
jews and christians throughout history
that god is seen in the creation that we

3298
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:32,079
that god is seen in the creation that we
 

3299
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,470
that god is seen in the creation that we
when we look at the creation

3300
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:34,480
when we look at the creation
 

3301
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,230
when we look at the creation
we see to some extent the wonder the

3302
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:38,240
we see to some extent the wonder the
 

3303
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,150
we see to some extent the wonder the
majesty the might of the person or

3304
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,160
majesty the might of the person or
 

3305
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,230
majesty the might of the person or
the entity but the person who created it

3306
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:46,240
the entity but the person who created it
 

3307
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,349
the entity but the person who created it
and and that's a way in which scientists

3308
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:49,359
and and that's a way in which scientists
 

3309
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:51,030
and and that's a way in which scientists
particularly

3310
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:51,040
particularly
 

3311
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,390
particularly
uh have over over the ages and

3312
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
uh have over over the ages and
 

3313
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,349
uh have over over the ages and
certainly over most of the last five

3314
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
certainly over most of the last five
 

3315
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,470
certainly over most of the last five
centuries since the

3316
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,480
centuries since the
 

3317
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,390
centuries since the
scientific revolution scientists have

3318
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:02,400
scientific revolution scientists have
 

3319
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,950
scientific revolution scientists have
seen in a certain sense the hand of god

3320
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:04,960
seen in a certain sense the hand of god
 

3321
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,789
seen in a certain sense the hand of god
in creation i mean

3322
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:06,799
in creation i mean
 

3323
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,789
in creation i mean
this leads us perhaps to a different

3324
01:01:08,789 --> 01:01:08,799
this leads us perhaps to a different
 

3325
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,069
this leads us perhaps to a different
discussion but i mean

3326
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:10,079
discussion but i mean
 

3327
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,710
discussion but i mean
it's it's remarkable to me how

3328
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,720
it's it's remarkable to me how
 

3329
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,230
it's it's remarkable to me how
influential

3330
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:14,240
influential
 

3331
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,549
influential
um christianity and religion in

3332
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:16,559
um christianity and religion in
 

3333
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,470
um christianity and religion in
generally has been

3334
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:18,480
generally has been
 

3335
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,109
generally has been
in science yeah most of the scientists

3336
01:01:21,109 --> 01:01:21,119
in science yeah most of the scientists
 

3337
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:22,390
in science yeah most of the scientists
through history as if

3338
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:22,400
through history as if
 

3339
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,710
through history as if
you described i mean god has been a very

3340
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:24,720
you described i mean god has been a very
 

3341
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,470
you described i mean god has been a very
big part of their life

3342
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:26,480
big part of their life
 

3343
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,510
big part of their life
and they were certainly up until the

3344
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:29,520
and they were certainly up until the
 

3345
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,190
and they were certainly up until the
beginning of the 20th century that was

3346
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
beginning of the 20th century that was
 

3347
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,549
beginning of the 20th century that was
the case

3348
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:32,559
the case
 

3349
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:34,470
the case
so maybe this is a good time to can you

3350
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:34,480
so maybe this is a good time to can you
 

3351
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,470
so maybe this is a good time to can you
tell me what scientism is

3352
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:36,480
tell me what scientism is
 

3353
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,390
tell me what scientism is
yeah i mean the short answer is that's

3354
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:38,400
yeah i mean the short answer is that's
 

3355
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,990
yeah i mean the short answer is that's
by scientism

3356
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
by scientism
 

3357
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,589
by scientism
we me we mean the belief that science is

3358
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:43,599
we me we mean the belief that science is
 

3359
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,150
we me we mean the belief that science is
all the real knowledge there is

3360
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,160
all the real knowledge there is
 

3361
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,309
all the real knowledge there is
um and that's a shorthand there are lots

3362
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:48,319
um and that's a shorthand there are lots
 

3363
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,309
um and that's a shorthand there are lots
of different facets of it and what which

3364
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:50,319
of different facets of it and what which
 

3365
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:52,309
of different facets of it and what which
one can explore and the book in which i

3366
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
one can explore and the book in which i
 

3367
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,430
one can explore and the book in which i
explored it

3368
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
explored it
 

3369
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,190
explored it
most most thoroughly was actually

3370
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:57,200
most most thoroughly was actually
 

3371
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,870
most most thoroughly was actually
an earlier book called monopolizing

3372
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:58,880
an earlier book called monopolizing
 

3373
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,470
an earlier book called monopolizing
knowledge and and the

3374
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:00,480
knowledge and and the
 

3375
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,029
knowledge and and the
the purpose of that title is to is to

3376
01:02:03,029 --> 01:02:03,039
the purpose of that title is to is to
 

3377
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:03,829
the purpose of that title is to is to
draw

3378
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:03,839
draw
 

3379
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:05,910
draw
attention to the fact that in our

3380
01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:05,920
attention to the fact that in our
 

3381
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,990
attention to the fact that in our
society as a whole

3382
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,000
society as a whole
 

3383
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,270
society as a whole
in particular in the west today we

3384
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,280
in particular in the west today we
 

3385
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,309
in particular in the west today we
we have grown so reliant on

3386
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:14,319
we have grown so reliant on
 

3387
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:17,430
we have grown so reliant on
science that we that we

3388
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:17,440
science that we that we
 

3389
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,230
science that we that we
tend to put aside other ways of getting

3390
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:20,240
tend to put aside other ways of getting
 

3391
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,670
tend to put aside other ways of getting
to know things

3392
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:21,680
to know things
 

3393
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,349
to know things
and so of course at mit we are focused

3394
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:25,359
and so of course at mit we are focused
 

3395
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,750
and so of course at mit we are focused
on science and we do

3396
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:27,760
on science and we do
 

3397
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,950
on science and we do
focus on it very much but the truth is

3398
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:30,960
focus on it very much but the truth is
 

3399
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:33,349
focus on it very much but the truth is
that there are many ways of getting to

3400
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:33,359
that there are many ways of getting to
 

3401
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,230
that there are many ways of getting to
know things

3402
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:34,240
know things
 

3403
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,510
know things
in our world know things reliably in our

3404
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:37,520
in our world know things reliably in our
 

3405
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,230
in our world know things reliably in our
world

3406
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:38,240
world
 

3407
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,750
world
and a lot of them are not science so

3408
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:41,760
and a lot of them are not science so
 

3409
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,990
and a lot of them are not science so
scientism in my view is a terrible

3410
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:44,000
scientism in my view is a terrible
 

3411
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,750
scientism in my view is a terrible
intellectual error it's to be

3412
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:45,760
intellectual error it's to be
 

3413
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,589
intellectual error it's to be
it's the belief that somehow the methods

3414
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:47,599
it's the belief that somehow the methods
 

3415
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,510
it's the belief that somehow the methods
of science as we've developed them with

3416
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
of science as we've developed them with
 

3417
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,069
of science as we've developed them with
ex

you know experiments and and in the end

01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:52,160
you know experiments and and in the end

particularly upon reproducibility in the

01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:17,829
all the knowledge we
we have and there's many other forms of

to to try to help people to think about
 

3449
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,710
to to try to help people to think about
this is to say well look let's think

3450
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,720
this is to say well look let's think
 

3451
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,230
this is to say well look let's think
about human history i mean to what

3452
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,240
about human history i mean to what
 

3453
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,270
about human history i mean to what
extent can

3454
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
extent can
 

3455
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,349
extent can
human history be discovered

3456
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:31,359
human history be discovered
 

3457
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,950
human history be discovered
scientifically the answer is essentially

3458
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:32,960
scientifically the answer is essentially
 

3459
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,829
scientifically the answer is essentially
it can't

3460
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
it can't
 

3461
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,069
it can't
because and the reason is because human

3462
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
because and the reason is because human
 

3463
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,549
because and the reason is because human
history is not reproducible you can't do

3464
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:38,559
history is not reproducible you can't do
 

3465
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,950
history is not reproducible you can't do
reproducible experiments or observations

3466
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:40,960
reproducible experiments or observations
 

3467
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:41,510
reproducible experiments or observations
and

3468
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:41,520
and
 

3469
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,829
and
and go back and you know try it over

3470
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:43,839
and go back and you know try it over
 

3471
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:44,870
and go back and you know try it over
again it's

3472
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:44,880
again it's
 

3473
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,349
again it's
it's a one-off thing you know the

3474
01:03:47,349 --> 01:03:47,359
it's a one-off thing you know the
 

3475
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,670
it's a one-off thing you know the
history is full of unique events

3476
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:49,680
history is full of unique events
 

3477
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:52,630
history is full of unique events
and and so you you know you you you

3478
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:52,640
and and so you you know you you you
 

3479
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,230
and and so you you know you you you
can't hope to do history

3480
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,240
can't hope to do history
 

3481
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,029
can't hope to do history
using the methods of science yeah i mean

3482
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
using the methods of science yeah i mean
 

3483
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,950
using the methods of science yeah i mean
in in some sense

3484
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:58,960
in in some sense
 

3485
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,190
in in some sense
history is a story of miracles i mean

3486
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:01,200
history is a story of miracles i mean
 

3487
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,230
history is a story of miracles i mean
they don't have to have

3488
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,240
they don't have to have
 

3489
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,029
they don't have to have
to do with god it's just uniqueness is

3490
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:05,039
to do with god it's just uniqueness is
 

3491
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,309
to do with god it's just uniqueness is
anyway unique events

3492
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:06,319
anyway unique events
 

3493
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,029
anyway unique events
these unique events and uh that science

3494
01:04:09,029 --> 01:04:09,039
these unique events and uh that science
 

3495
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,230
these unique events and uh that science
doesn't like that because it's

3496
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:10,240
doesn't like that because it's
 

3497
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,309
doesn't like that because it's
uh unique events but they're very

3498

is science doesn't lead you necessarily

3598
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:04,559
is science doesn't lead you necessarily
 

3599
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,910
is science doesn't lead you necessarily
to believe in a creator god or into

3600
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:07,920
to believe in a creator god or into
 

3601
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,950
to believe in a creator god or into
in any particular in um

3602
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:10,960
in any particular in um
 

3603
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,349
in any particular in um
religion i accept that that's not a

3604
01:06:13,349 --> 01:06:13,359
religion i accept that that's not a
 

3605
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,390
religion i accept that that's not a
problem to me

3606
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:14,400
problem to me
 

3607
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,069
problem to me
because i don't think that science is

3608
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
because i don't think that science is
 

3609
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,270
because i don't think that science is
all the knowledge there is and i think

3610
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:17,280
all the knowledge there is and i think
 

3611
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,390
all the knowledge there is and i think
there are other important ways of

3612
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
there are other important ways of
 

3613
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,270
there are other important ways of
getting to know

3614
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:19,280
getting to know
 

3615
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,589
getting to know
things and one of them is historical for

3616
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:21,599
things and one of them is historical for
 

3617
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,109
things and one of them is historical for
example and i mentioned earlier that i

3618
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119
example and i mentioned earlier that i
 

3619
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,029
example and i mentioned earlier that i
think i became persuaded and i were

3620
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:25,039
think i became persuaded and i were
 

3621
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:27,270
think i became persuaded and i were
and i still am persuaded that the

3622
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:27,280
and i still am persuaded that the
 

3623
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,510
and i still am persuaded that the
historical evidence for the resurrection

3624
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:29,520
historical evidence for the resurrection
 

3625
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,150
historical evidence for the resurrection
is very

3626
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:30,160
is very
 

3627
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,750
is very
is very persuasive again it's not proof

3628
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:33,760
is very persuasive again it's not proof
 

3629
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,990
is very persuasive again it's not proof
or anything like that but it's but it's

3630
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:36,000
or anything like that but it's but it's
 

3631
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,390
or anything like that but it's but it's
pretty good evidence okay

3632
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
pretty good evidence okay
 

3633
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,870
pretty good evidence okay
yeah i've um i talked to richard dawkins

3634

carroll so
 

3641
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,589
carroll so
i i i understand this world it makes it

3642
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:49,599
i i i understand this world it makes it
 

3643
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,029
i i i understand this world it makes it
makes me very curious

3644
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:51,039
makes me very curious
 

3645
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,950
makes me very curious
but maybe uh let me ask sort of another

3646
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:52,960
but maybe uh let me ask sort of another
 

3647
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,390
but maybe uh let me ask sort of another
way

3648
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:54,400
way
 

3649
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,349
way
my own kind of uh world view maybe you

3650
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:57,359
my own kind of uh world view maybe you
 

3651
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,190
my own kind of uh world view maybe you
can help

3652
01:06:59,190 --> 01:06:59,200
can help
 

3653
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,549
can help
as by way of therapy i understand

3654
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:02,559
as by way of therapy i understand
 

3655
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,430
as by way of therapy i understand
um you know because you kind of said

3656
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,440
um you know because you kind of said
 

3657
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,349
um you know because you kind of said
that there's other ways of knowing

3658
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:07,359
that there's other ways of knowing
 

3659
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,309
that there's other ways of knowing
what about if we cut if if i kind of sit

3660
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:10,319
what about if we cut if if i kind of sit
 

3661
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,510
what about if we cut if if i kind of sit
here

3662
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
here
 

3663
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,470
here
and am cognizant of the fact that i

3664
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:14,480
and am cognizant of the fact that i
 

3665
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,630
and am cognizant of the fact that i
almost don't know anything

3666
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,640
almost don't know anything
 

3667
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,109
almost don't know anything
so sort of i'm sit here almost paralyzed

3668
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:19,119
so sort of i'm sit here almost paralyzed
 

3669
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,190
so sort of i'm sit here almost paralyzed
by the the mystery of it all

3670
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:21,200
by the the mystery of it all
 

3671
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,349
by the the mystery of it all
and it's not even when you say there's

3672
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:23,359
and it's not even when you say there's
 

3673
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,029
and it's not even when you say there's
other ways of knowing

3674
01:07:25,029 --> 01:07:25,039
other ways of knowing
 

3675
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,870
other ways of knowing
it it feels almost too confident to me

3676
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:28,880
it it feels almost too confident to me
 

3677
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,270
it it feels almost too confident to me
because uh yeah when i when i listen to

3678
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:31,280
because uh yeah when i when i listen to
 

3679
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,069
because uh yeah when i when i listen to
beautiful

3680
01:07:32,069 --> 01:07:32,079
beautiful
 

3681
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,710
beautiful
music or see art there's something there

3682
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
music or see art there's something there
 

3683
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,349
music or see art there's something there
that's

3684
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:35,359
that's
 

3685
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:39,190
that's
and that's uh that's beyond the reach of

3686
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,200
and that's uh that's beyond the reach of
 

3687
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,870
and that's uh that's beyond the reach of
scientism i would say so

3688
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
scientism i would say so
 

3689
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,069
scientism i would say so
beyond the reach of uh the the tools of

3690
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:44,079
beyond the reach of uh the the tools of
 

3691
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:45,349
beyond the reach of uh the the tools of
science

3692
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
science
 

3693
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:48,470
science
but i don't even feel like that could be

3694
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
but i don't even feel like that could be
 

3695
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,990
but i don't even feel like that could be
an as an actual tool of knowing

3696
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,000
an as an actual tool of knowing
 

3697
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,390
an as an actual tool of knowing
it um yeah i just don't even know where

3698
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:54,400
it um yeah i just don't even know where
 

3699
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,109
it um yeah i just don't even know where
to begin

3700
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:55,119
to begin
 

3701
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,109
to begin
because it just feels like we know so

3702
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:57,119
because it just feels like we know so
 

3703
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,829
because it just feels like we know so
little like uh if we look even a hundred

3704
01:07:59,829 --> 01:07:59,839
little like uh if we look even a hundred
 

3705
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:00,710
little like uh if we look even a hundred
years from now

3706
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
years from now
 

3707
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,230
years from now
when people look back to this time

3708
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:02,240
when people look back to this time
 

3709
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,309
when people look back to this time
humans look back to this time

3710
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,319
humans look back to this time
 

3711
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,990
humans look back to this time
they'll probably laugh at how little we

3712
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,000
they'll probably laugh at how little we
 

3713
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,910
they'll probably laugh at how little we
knew even a hundred years from now and

3714
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:07,920
knew even a hundred years from now and
 

3715
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,910
knew even a hundred years from now and
if we look at a thousand years from now

3716
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:09,920
if we look at a thousand years from now
 

3717
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,349
if we look at a thousand years from now
hopefully we're still alive or some

3718
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:11,359
hopefully we're still alive or some
 

3719
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:12,549
hopefully we're still alive or some
version of our

3720
01:08:12,549 --> 01:08:12,559
version of our
 

3721
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,870
version of our
ai versions of ourselves

3722
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880

 

3723
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,870

you know they they'll certainly laugh at

3724
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
you know they they'll certainly laugh at
 

3725
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,030
you know they they'll certainly laugh at
the absurdity of our beliefs

3726
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:21,040
the absurdity of our beliefs
 

3727
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,390
the absurdity of our beliefs
so what do you uh

3728
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:24,400
so what do you uh
 

3729
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,709
so what do you uh
so you don't seem to be as paralyzed by

3730
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:26,719
so you don't seem to be as paralyzed by
 

3731
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,070
so you don't seem to be as paralyzed by
how little we know

3732
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:28,080
how little we know
 

3733
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,630
how little we know
you confidently push on forward but what

3734
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:30,640
you confidently push on forward but what
 

3735
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,070
you confidently push on forward but what
do you make of that sense of

3736
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:32,080
do you make of that sense of
 

3737
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,829
do you make of that sense of
uh of just not knowing of the mystery

3738
01:08:35,829 --> 01:08:35,839
uh of just not knowing of the mystery
 

3739
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,950
uh of just not knowing of the mystery
we need to be modest

3740
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:38,960
we need to be modest
 

3741
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,990
we need to be modest
or or humble if even

3742
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
or or humble if even
 

3743
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,870
or or humble if even
about what we know i accept that and i i

3744
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
about what we know i accept that and i i
 

3745
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,390
about what we know i accept that and i i
certainly think that's true not

3746
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:46,400
certainly think that's true not
 

3747
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,030
certainly think that's true not
not simply because in the future we'll

3748
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:49,040
not simply because in the future we'll
 

3749
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,910
not simply because in the future we'll
know more science and

3750
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:51,920
know more science and
 

3751
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,910
know more science and
there will be more powerful ways of

3752
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:53,920
there will be more powerful ways of
 

3753
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,510
there will be more powerful ways of
finding out about things

3754
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:55,520
finding out about things
 

3755
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,590
finding out about things
but simply because you know sometimes

3756
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:57,600
but simply because you know sometimes
 

3757

okay but i don't think that necessarily
 

3791
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,829
okay but i don't think that necessarily
uh uh that leads one

3792

and um and this and faith does have
 

3841
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,990
and um and this and faith does have
a strand which is to do with you know

3842
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:40,000
a strand which is to do with you know
 

3843
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,669
a strand which is to do with you know
basically believing

3844

in uh in concepts or um
propositions but actually the word faith

3848
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:48,480
propositions but actually the word faith
 

3849
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,310
propositions but actually the word faith
is much broader than that

3850
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:50,320
is much broader than that
 

3851
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,350
is much broader than that
faith also means um

3852
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:53,360
faith also means um
 

3853
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,470
faith also means um
you know trusting in something

3854
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:56,480
you know trusting in something
 

3855
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,510
you know trusting in something
trusting in a person or trusting in a

thing

3858
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:00,000
thing
 

3859
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,870
thing
uh the reliability of some technology

3860
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:02,880
uh the reliability of some technology
 

3861
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,990
uh the reliability of some technology
for example

3862
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:04,000
for example
 

3863
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,630
for example
um that's equally part of the meaning of

3864
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:06,640
um that's equally part of the meaning of
 

3865
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,669
um that's equally part of the meaning of
the word faith

3866
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:07,679
the word faith
 

3867
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:09,910
the word faith
and and there's a third strand to the to

3868
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:09,920
and and there's a third strand to the to
 

3869
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,669
and and there's a third strand to the to
the meaning of the word as well

3870
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:11,679
the meaning of the word as well
 

3871
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,950
the meaning of the word as well
and that is loyalty so

3872
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:14,960
and that is loyalty so
 

3873
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,070
and that is loyalty so
you know i have faith in my wife and and

3874
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:18,080
you know i have faith in my wife and and
 

3875
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,110
you know i have faith in my wife and and
i try to act

3876
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
i try to act
 

3877
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,910
i try to act
in faith towards her and that's a kind

3878
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:21,920
in faith towards her and that's a kind
 

3879
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:23,270
in faith towards her and that's a kind
of loyalty

3880
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:23,280
of loyalty
 

3881
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,350
of loyalty
and so those three strands are the are

3882
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
and so those three strands are the are
 

3883
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,630
and so those three strands are the are
the most important

3884
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:26,640
the most important
 

3885
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,550
the most important
strands of the meaning of faith yes

believing or or or making decisions
in situations when they don't

3932
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
in situations when they don't
 

3933
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,390
in situations when they don't
have all the proof or evidence or

3934
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:24,400
have all the proof or evidence or
 

3935
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,030
have all the proof or evidence or
knowledge

3936
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:25,040
knowledge
 

3937
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,070
knowledge
that enables you to make a completely

3938
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:28,080
that enables you to make a completely
 

3939
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,750

um rational or well-informed or prudent
 

3941
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,550
um rational or well-informed or prudent
decision we

3942
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,560
decision we
 

3943
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,390
decision we
you know we do this all the time you

3944
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:34,400
you know we do this all the time you
 

3945
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,790
you know we do this all the time you
know my drive down here i nearly took a

3946
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:36,800
know my drive down here i nearly took a
 

3947
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,070
know my drive down here i nearly took a
wrong turning and i

3948
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:38,080
wrong turning and i
 

3949
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,910
wrong turning and i
thought which which way do i go do i

3950
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:39,920
thought which which way do i go do i
 

3951
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,270
thought which which way do i go do i
keep going straight on

3952
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:41,280
keep going straight on
 

3953
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,350
keep going straight on
and so my uh voice came out and i think

3954
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:45,360
and so my uh voice came out and i think
 

3955
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:50,070
and so my uh voice came out and i think
go straight okay

3956
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:50,080
go straight okay
 

3957
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,790
go straight okay
so so you have to make decisions and

3958
01:12:52,790 --> 01:12:52,800
so so you have to make decisions and
 

3959
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,669
so so you have to make decisions and
sometimes

3960
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:53,679
sometimes
 

3961
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,350
sometimes
you know you don't have a navigation

3962
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
you know you don't have a navigation
 

3963
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,030
you know you don't have a navigation
system telling you what to do you just

3964
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:57,040
system telling you what to do you just
 

3965
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,709
system telling you what to do you just
have to make that decision with no

3966
01:12:58,709 --> 01:12:58,719
have to make that decision with no
 

3967
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:00,790
have to make that decision with no
with insufficient evidence and you're

3968
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:00,800
with insufficient evidence and you're
 

3969
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,070
with insufficient evidence and you're
doing it all the time

3970
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:02,080
doing it all the time
 

3971
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,990
doing it all the time
as a human and that's part of being

3972
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:04,000
as a human and that's part of being
 

3973
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,350
as a human and that's part of being
sentient um

3974
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:05,360
sentient um
 

3975
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,630
sentient um
and so that kind of um

3976
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,640
and so that kind of um
 

3977
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,110
and so that kind of um
action and belief on the basis of

3978
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:11,120
action and belief on the basis of
 

3979
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,390
action and belief on the basis of
incomplete evidence

3980
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:12,400
incomplete evidence
 

3981
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,750
incomplete evidence
is not something that i feel

3982
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:13,760
is not something that i feel
 

3983
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,830
is not something that i feel
uncomfortable doing or i

3984
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:15,840
uncomfortable doing or i
 

3985
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,310
uncomfortable doing or i
feel that i feel on that somehow my

3986
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:18,320
feel that i feel on that somehow my
 

3987
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,149
feel that i feel on that somehow my
christian commitments have forced me to

3988
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:20,159
christian commitments have forced me to
 

3989
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:20,790
christian commitments have forced me to
do when i

3990
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:20,800
do when i
 

3991
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,990
do when i
wouldn't have had to have done it

3992
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,000
wouldn't have had to have done it
 

3993
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,270
wouldn't have had to have done it
otherwise i would have had to do it

3994
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:23,280
otherwise i would have had to do it
 

3995
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,470
otherwise i would have had to do it
anyway

3996
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:24,480
anyway
 

3997
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,630
anyway
um and and so you know there's a sense

3998
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:26,640
um and and so you know there's a sense
 

3999
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,750
um and and so you know there's a sense
in which um

4000
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:27,760
in which um
 

4001
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,270
in which um
i think it's important to see the

4002
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:29,280
i think it's important to see the
 

4003
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,110
i think it's important to see the
breadth of meaning of faith

4004
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:31,120
breadth of meaning of faith
 

4005
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,669
breadth of meaning of faith
and and and to recognize then certainly

4006
01:13:33,669 --> 01:13:33,679
and and and to recognize then certainly
 

4007
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,430
and and and to recognize then certainly
in the case of christianity

4008
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:35,440
in the case of christianity
 

4009
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,070
in the case of christianity
um it's trust and loyalty that the the

4010
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:38,080
um it's trust and loyalty that the the
 

4011
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,189
um it's trust and loyalty that the the
key themes

4012
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:39,199
key themes
 

4013
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,709
key themes
that we're called to and i mean another

4014
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
that we're called to and i mean another
 

4015
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,189
that we're called to and i mean another
interesting extension of that that you

4016
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:45,199
interesting extension of that that you
 

4017
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:46,149
interesting extension of that that you
speak to

4018
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:46,159
speak to
 

4019
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:49,590
speak to
it's kind of loyalty is referring to uh

4020
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
it's kind of loyalty is referring to uh
 

4021
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,189
it's kind of loyalty is referring to uh
a connection with something outside of

4022
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:51,199
a connection with something outside of
 

4023
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,790
a connection with something outside of
yourself yeah

4024
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:52,800
yourself yeah
 

4025
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,350
yourself yeah
um so i think you've spoken about like

4026
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:55,360
um so i think you've spoken about like
 

4027
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,350
um so i think you've spoken about like
existentialism or even just atheism in

4028
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:57,360
existentialism or even just atheism in
 

4029
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,870
existentialism or even just atheism in
general as um

4030
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:58,880
general as um
 

4031
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,830
general as um
as leading naturally to an individualism

4032
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:01,840
as leading naturally to an individualism
 

4033
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,070
as leading naturally to an individualism
as a focus on the on the self

4034
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
as a focus on the on the self
 

4035
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,350
as a focus on the on the self
and uh ideas that maybe the

4036
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
and uh ideas that maybe the
 

4037
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,430
and uh ideas that maybe the
christian faith can instill in you is um

4038
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:11,440
christian faith can instill in you is um
 

4039
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,110
christian faith can instill in you is um
allowing you to sort of look outside of

4040
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,120
allowing you to sort of look outside of
 

4041
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,630
allowing you to sort of look outside of
yourself so connection

4042
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:14,640
yourself so connection
 

4043
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,030
yourself so connection
i mean loyalty fundamentally is about

4044
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:17,040
i mean loyalty fundamentally is about
 

4045
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,950
i mean loyalty fundamentally is about
other beings

4046
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:18,960
other beings
 

4047
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,950
other beings
and yeah other beings and i mean i think

4048
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:22,960
and yeah other beings and i mean i think
 

4049
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,110
and yeah other beings and i mean i think
i don't know what it is in me but i'm

4050
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,120
i don't know what it is in me but i'm
 

4051
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,350
i don't know what it is in me but i'm
very much drawn to that idea

4052
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360
very much drawn to that idea
 

4053
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,830
very much drawn to that idea
and i think humans in general are drawn

4054
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:29,840
and i think humans in general are drawn
 

4055
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,110
and i think humans in general are drawn
to that idea

4056
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:31,120
to that idea
 

4057
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,709
to that idea
you can you can make all kinds of

4058
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:32,719
you can you can make all kinds of
 

4059
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,149
you can you can make all kinds of
evolutionary arguments all that kind of

4060
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:34,159
evolutionary arguments all that kind of
 

4061
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:35,590
evolutionary arguments all that kind of
stuff but uh

4062
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
stuff but uh
 

4063
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,910
stuff but uh
people always kind of tease me uh

4064
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:37,920
people always kind of tease me uh
 

4065
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,790
people always kind of tease me uh
because i talk about love a lot

4066
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:40,800
because i talk about love a lot
 

4067
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,950
because i talk about love a lot
and i mean there's a lot of uh

4068
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:42,960
and i mean there's a lot of uh
 

4069
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,790
and i mean there's a lot of uh
non-scientific things about love right

4070
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:44,800
non-scientific things about love right
 

4071
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,270
non-scientific things about love right
like what

4072
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:45,280
like what
 

4073
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,870
like what
what the heck is that thing why why do

4074
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:46,880
what the heck is that thing why why do
 

4075
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,550
what the heck is that thing why why do
we even need that thing

4076
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:48,560
we even need that thing
 

4077
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,630
we even need that thing
it uh it seems to be an annoying burden

4078
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:50,640
it uh it seems to be an annoying burden
 

4079
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,030
it uh it seems to be an annoying burden
that uh that we we get so much uh

4080
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,040

some rough times together and that seems

4108
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:19,760
some rough times together and that seems
 

4109
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,950
some rough times together and that seems
to make life

4110
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:20,960
to make life
 

4111
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,950
to make life
deeply meaningful what is that

4112
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:24,960
deeply meaningful what is that
 

4113
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,390
deeply meaningful what is that
so yeah um i that's

4114
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:28,400
so yeah um i that's
 

4115
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,630
so yeah um i that's
that resonates with me and i obviously i

4116
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:30,640
that resonates with me and i obviously i
 

4117
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,790
that resonates with me and i obviously i
would i would affirm it um

4118
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
would i would affirm it um
 

4119
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,550
would i would affirm it um
i i think just to just to correct

4120
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:36,560
i i think just to just to correct
 

4121
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,550
i i think just to just to correct
the implication that you made i i don't

4122
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:38,560
the implication that you made i i don't
 

4123
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,950
the implication that you made i i don't
think it's necessarily

4124
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:40,960
think it's necessarily
 

4125
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,229
think it's necessarily
the co the consequence of atheism uh

4126
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
the co the consequence of atheism uh
 

4127
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,669
the co the consequence of atheism uh
that we

4128
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
that we
 

4129
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,910
that we
that we lose track of those kinds of

4130
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:47,920
that we lose track of those kinds of
 

4131
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,030
that we lose track of those kinds of
things i

4132
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:49,040
things i
 

4133
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,550
things i
i mean i think that atheists can be

4134
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:50,560
i mean i think that atheists can be
 

4135
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,229
i mean i think that atheists can be
loyal okay if you like

4136
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:52,239
loyal okay if you like
 

4137
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:55,270
loyal okay if you like
um the question more often

4138
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:55,280
um the question more often
 

4139
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,350
um the question more often
comes up in the context of you know

4140
01:15:57,350 --> 01:15:57,360
comes up in the context of you know
 

4141
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,669
comes up in the context of you know
where does morality come from

4142
01:15:59,669 --> 01:15:59,679
where does morality come from
 

4143
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:03,750
where does morality come from
and loyalty i think and duty are related

4144
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:03,760
and loyalty i think and duty are related
 

4145
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,430
and loyalty i think and duty are related
to one another you know if we have

4146
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:05,440
to one another you know if we have
 

4147
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,189
to one another you know if we have
loyalty to someone then we have a duty

4148
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
loyalty to someone then we have a duty
 

4149
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:08,070
loyalty to someone then we have a duty
to them

4150
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:08,080
to them
 

4151
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,189
to them
okay as well and i think that in so far

4152
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:11,199
okay as well and i think that in so far
 

4153
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,510
okay as well and i think that in so far
as we see ourselves as having some kinds

4154
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
as we see ourselves as having some kinds
 

4155
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,669
as we see ourselves as having some kinds
any kinds of duties or moral compulsions

4156
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:17,679
any kinds of duties or moral compulsions
 

4157
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,590
any kinds of duties or moral compulsions
with respect to our relationships to

4158
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:19,600
with respect to our relationships to
 

4159
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,350
with respect to our relationships to
other people

4160
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:21,360
other people
 

4161
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,510
other people
it's i think it's a question that always

4162
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:23,520
it's i think it's a question that always
 

4163
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,870
it's i think it's a question that always
arises well where does these where do

4164
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:24,880
arises well where does these where do
 

4165
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,470
arises well where does these where do
these come from

4166
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:26,480
these come from
 

4167
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,470
these come from
and there there are various approaches

4168
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,480
and there there are various approaches
 

4169
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:29,590
and there there are various approaches
that people have

4170
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:29,600
that people have
 

4171
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,189
that people have
towards deciding what makes

4172
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
towards deciding what makes
 

4173
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:37,030
towards deciding what makes
ethics or morality moral okay

4174
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:37,040
ethics or morality moral okay
 

4175
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,830
ethics or morality moral okay
but i do think it's the case that um

4176
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:41,840
but i do think it's the case that um
 

4177
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,750
but i do think it's the case that um
it's very hard to ground morality

4178
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
it's very hard to ground morality
 

4179
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,149
it's very hard to ground morality
um in in any kind of absolute way or

4180
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:50,159
um in in any kind of absolute way or
 

4181
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:53,270
um in in any kind of absolute way or
a persuasive way um

4182
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:53,280
a persuasive way um
 

4183
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,310
a persuasive way um
in mere human relationships

4184
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,320
in mere human relationships
 

4185
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,229
in mere human relationships
and so it's certainly the case that in

4186
01:16:58,229 --> 01:16:58,239
and so it's certainly the case that in
 

4187
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,430
and so it's certainly the case that in
christianity

4188
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
christianity
 

4189
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,630
christianity
um there is a sense in which

4190
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:02,640
um there is a sense in which
 

4191
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,630
um there is a sense in which
um morality and

4192
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
um morality and
 

4193
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,430
um morality and
you know the morality of morals comes

4194
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:09,440
you know the morality of morals comes
 

4195
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:09,990
you know the morality of morals comes
from

4196
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,000
from
 

4197
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,669
from
a transcendent place from a transcendent

4198
01:17:13,669 --> 01:17:13,679
a transcendent place from a transcendent
 

4199
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:15,110
a transcendent place from a transcendent
deity

4200
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,120
deity
 

4201
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:19,510
deity
and that we um that we

4202
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:19,520

 

4203
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,550

ground our the compelling

4204
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:22,560
ground our the compelling
 

4205
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,310
ground our the compelling
force of of morals on god

4206
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,320
force of of morals on god
 

4207
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,550
force of of morals on god
more than we do on individuals because

4208
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:28,560
more than we do on individuals because
 

4209
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,590
more than we do on individuals because
after all you know

4210
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:29,600
after all you know
 

4211
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,030
after all you know
if it if you if you've got nothing but

if it if you if you've got nothing but
 

4213
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,870
if it if you if you've got nothing but
you know other people why should you

4214
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:36,880
you know other people why should you
 

4215
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,270
you know other people why should you
you know treat your neighbor well why

4216
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:39,280
you know treat your neighbor well why
 

4217
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,310
you know treat your neighbor well why
shouldn't you

4218
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
shouldn't you
 

4219
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,390
shouldn't you
defraud your neighbor if it's good for

4220
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:42,400
defraud your neighbor if it's good for
 

4221
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,350
defraud your neighbor if it's good for
you

4222
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,360
you
 

4223
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,110
you
well you know you can construct all

4224
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
well you know you can construct all
 

4225
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,709
well you know you can construct all
kinds of arguments and some of them are

4226
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:46,719
kinds of arguments and some of them are
 

4227
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:47,750
kinds of arguments and some of them are
you know obviously

4228
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:47,760
you know obviously
 

4229
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,669
you know obviously
arguments that are commonplace in

4230
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:49,679
arguments that are commonplace in
 

4231
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,350
arguments that are commonplace in
religion too you should do as you would

4232
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:51,360
religion too you should do as you would
 

4233
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,430
religion too you should do as you would
be done by and all this kind of thing

4234
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:53,440
be done by and all this kind of thing
 

4235
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,910
be done by and all this kind of thing
right but none of that seems any any

4236
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
right but none of that seems any any
 

4237
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,390
right but none of that seems any any
more than mere pragmatism to most people

4238
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:58,400
more than mere pragmatism to most people
 

4239
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,630
more than mere pragmatism to most people
okay and so that's what that's one of

4240
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:00,640
okay and so that's what that's one of
 

4241
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,990
okay and so that's what that's one of
the things if

4242
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:02,000
the things if
 

4243
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,310
the things if

okay then what does ground it and he had

4256
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:18,080
okay then what does ground it and he had

no good answer for it
 

4259
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,510
no good answer for it
in fact he claimed there was no answer

4260
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:21,520
in fact he claimed there was no answer
 

4261
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,510
in fact he claimed there was no answer
but then he couldn't live with that

4262
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:23,520
but then he couldn't live with that
 

4263
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,709
but then he couldn't live with that
and so he invented the idea of the

4264
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:26,719
and so he invented the idea of the
 

4265
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:27,830
and so he invented the idea of the
ubermensch

4266
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:27,840
ubermensch
 

4267
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,790

okay
and this was uh a different way of

and so forth um that you know we've
 

4285
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,990
and so forth um that you know we've
in the west thankfully shied away from

4286
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:52,000
in the west thankfully shied away from
 

4287
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,950
in the west thankfully shied away from
uh in

4288
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:52,960
uh in
 

4289
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,750
uh in
in the past uh uh half or three quarters

4290
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:55,760
in the past uh uh half or three quarters
 

4291
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,189
in the past uh uh half or three quarters
of a century

4292
01:18:57,189 --> 01:18:57,199
of a century
 

4293
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:01,189
of a century
but um you know i think it is the case

4294
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:01,199
but um you know i think it is the case
 

4295
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:04,550
but um you know i think it is the case
that uh christianity gives me

4296
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:04,560
that uh christianity gives me
 

4297
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,669
that uh christianity gives me
a basis for my

4298
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
a basis for my
 

4299
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,430
a basis for my
moral beliefs that is more than mere

4300
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:11,440
moral beliefs that is more than mere
 

4301

pragmatism yeah but there is uh
so stepping outside of all of that there

4304
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:16,880
so stepping outside of all of that there
 

4305
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,390
so stepping outside of all of that there
does seem to be

4306
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
does seem to be
 

4307
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,189
does seem to be
a powerful stabilizing like we humans

4308
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:21,199
a powerful stabilizing like we humans
 

4309

01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:25,600
together like in a distributed way uh
 

4313
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,870
together like in a distributed way uh
outside of

absolutely crucial part of it you know
 

4731
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,790
absolutely crucial part of it you know
the fact that our world

4732
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:12,800
the fact that our world
 

4733
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,229
the fact that our world
behaves reproducibly in the main

4734
01:27:16,229 --> 01:27:16,239
behaves reproducibly in the main
 

4735
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:18,790
behaves reproducibly in the main
is absolutely essential for the

4736
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:18,800
is absolutely essential for the
 

4737
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,229
is absolutely essential for the
integrity

4738
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:20,239
integrity
 

4739
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,629
integrity
of our lives without it we wouldn't

4740
01:27:22,629 --> 01:27:22,639
of our lives without it we wouldn't
 

4741
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:23,590
of our lives without it we wouldn't
exist

4742
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:23,600
exist
 

4743
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,669
exist
okay and so there is a sense in which

4744
01:27:25,669 --> 01:27:25,679
okay and so there is a sense in which
 

4745
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,310
okay and so there is a sense in which
the integrity of creation

4746
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:28,320
the integrity of creation
 

4747
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,189
the integrity of creation
um calls for there being consistent

4748
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
um calls for there being consistent
 

4749
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,070
um calls for there being consistent
behavior which

4750
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:32,080
behavior which
 

4751
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,229
behavior which
you know these days we think of as being

4752
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:34,239
you know these days we think of as being
 

4753
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,590
you know these days we think of as being
the laws of nature

4754
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:35,600
the laws of nature
 

4755
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:39,030
the laws of nature
okay and so the consistent behavior of

4756
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:39,040
okay and so the consistent behavior of
 

4757
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:39,750
okay and so the consistent behavior of
nature

4758
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:39,760
nature
 

4759
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,149
nature
is very very important it's what enables

4760
01:27:42,149 --> 01:27:42,159
is very very important it's what enables
 

4761
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:43,990
is very very important it's what enables
us to be what we are

and that integrity is the best thing
 

4777
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,229
and that integrity is the best thing
it's the way we have our existence the

4778
01:28:10,229 --> 01:28:10,239
it's the way we have our existence the
 

4779
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,790

and you know if you want something
different you've got to show

4784
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:17,199
different you've got to show
 

4785
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:20,070
different you've got to show
that there is a way in which you could

4786
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:20,080
that there is a way in which you could
 

4787
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,310
that there is a way in which you could
invent a world that is better

4788
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:22,320
invent a world that is better
 

4789
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,149
invent a world that is better
that it has the integrity that we need

4790
01:28:24,149 --> 01:28:24,159
that it has the integrity that we need
 

4791
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:25,750
that it has the integrity that we need
to exist okay

4792
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:25,760
to exist okay
 

4793
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,470
to exist okay
and and and to be able to think and and

4794
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:28,480
and and and to be able to think and and
 

4795
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:28,870
and and and to be able to think and and
and

4796
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:28,880

love and and be um but
but you were gonna do it better you know

4800
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:34,320
but you were gonna do it better you know
 

4801
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,550
but you were gonna do it better you know
and the atheists think that maybe they

4802
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:36,560
and the atheists think that maybe they
 

4803
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,550
and the atheists think that maybe they
have got a better idea but if they

4804
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:38,560
have got a better idea but if they
 

4805
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,990
have got a better idea but if they
thought about it a bit more carefully

4806
01:28:39,990 --> 01:28:40,000
thought about it a bit more carefully
 

4807
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,030
thought about it a bit more carefully
they'd realize

4808
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,040
they'd realize
 

4809
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,270
they'd realize
no one has put forward a better idea

4810
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:43,280
no one has put forward a better idea
 

4811
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,430
no one has put forward a better idea
okay so the so another way

4812
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:45,440
okay so the so another way
 

4813
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,950
okay so the so another way
to say that uh i mean is that

4814
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:48,960
to say that uh i mean is that
 

4815
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:52,550
to say that uh i mean is that
suffering is an integral part of this

4816
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:52,560
suffering is an integral part of this
 

4817
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,070
suffering is an integral part of this
of um of a consistent

4818
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,080
of um of a consistent
 

4819
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:00,070
of um of a consistent
existence so so sort of uh

4820
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:00,080
existence so so sort of uh
 

4821
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:03,110
existence so so sort of uh
in the philosophical in a philosophical

in the philosophical in a philosophical
 

4823
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,229
in the philosophical in a philosophical
sense

4824
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
sense
 

4825
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,950
sense
uh the full richness and the beauty of

4826
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:06,960
uh the full richness and the beauty of
 

4827
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,070
uh the full richness and the beauty of
our experience

4828
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:08,080
our experience
 

4829
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,070
our experience
would not be as beautiful would not be

4830
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:10,080
would not be as beautiful would not be
 

4831
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,830
would not be as beautiful would not be
as rich

4832
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:11,840
as rich
 

4833
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,310
as rich
if there was no suffering in the world

4834
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:14,320
if there was no suffering in the world
 

4835
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,750
if there was no suffering in the world
is that is that possible

4836
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:15,760
is that is that possible
 

4837
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,110
is that is that possible
well i think you said two different

4838
01:29:17,110 --> 01:29:17,120
well i think you said two different
 

4839
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,629
well i think you said two different
things that aren't exactly at least that

4840
01:29:18,629 --> 01:29:18,639
things that aren't exactly at least that
 

4841
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:20,310
things that aren't exactly at least that
aren't exactly the same

4842
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:20,320
aren't exactly the same
 

4843
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,470
aren't exactly the same
one is that suffering is an integral

4844
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:22,480
one is that suffering is an integral
 

4845
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,669
one is that suffering is an integral
part of

4846
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:23,679
part of
 

4847
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,709
part of
our experience you know that

4848
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:26,719
our experience you know that
 

4849
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,870
our experience you know that
might be considered a challenge to

4850
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:28,880
might be considered a challenge to

01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,070
i don't think that that's consistent
with science as we know it

4894
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,080
with science as we know it
 

4895
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:15,350
with science as we know it
and i and i think that um death

4896
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:15,360
and i and i think that um death
 

4897
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,990
and i and i think that um death
for example has been part of the

4898
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:18,000
for example has been part of the
 

4899
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,189
for example has been part of the
biological

4900
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:19,199
biological
 

4901
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:22,390
biological
world and and the universe as a whole

4902
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:22,400
world and and the universe as a whole
 

4903
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,910
world and and the universe as a whole
um from from billions of years ago so

4904
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:25,920
um from from billions of years ago so
 

4905
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,310
um from from billions of years ago so
so just to be clear about that um you

4906
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:28,320
so just to be clear about that um you
 

4907
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,030
so just to be clear about that um you
know

4908
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:29,040
know
 

4909
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,470
know
i i on the other hand i do so

4910
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:32,480
i i on the other hand i do so
 

4911
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,870
i i on the other hand i do so
if that's the case then certainly in

4912
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:34,880
if that's the case then certainly in
 

4913
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,350
if that's the case then certainly in
that sense at the very least

4914
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:37,360
that sense at the very least
 

4915
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,390
that sense at the very least
um suffering or at least death okay

4916
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:40,400
um suffering or at least death okay
 

4917
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:44,070
um suffering or at least death okay
is part of the biological

4918
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:44,080
is part of the biological
 

4919
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:46,950
is part of the biological
existence and that probably seems so

4920
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:46,960
existence and that probably seems so
 

4921
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,070
existence and that probably seems so
completely obvious

4922
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:48,080
completely obvious
 

4923
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,709
completely obvious
to somebody who you know is okay with

4924
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:50,719
to somebody who you know is okay with
 

4925
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:51,590
to somebody who you know is okay with
science

4926
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:51,600
science
 

4927
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,270
science
whether they you know whether they're a

4928
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:53,280
whether they you know whether they're a
 

4929
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,870

so and i apologize if i'm interrupting

4932
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,040
so and i apologize if i'm interrupting
 

4933
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,430
so and i apologize if i'm interrupting
but it's the obvious reality of

4934
01:30:59,430 --> 01:30:59,440
but it's the obvious reality of
 

4935
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:01,830
but it's the obvious reality of

kind of see as the goal
 

4945
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,030
kind of see as the goal
of many of our pursuits as to extend

you know a dream for many people is to
 

4951
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,550
you know a dream for many people is to
live forever

4952
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:16,560
live forever
 

4953
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,709
live forever
uh but in the in this in the

4954
01:31:18,709 --> 01:31:18,719
uh but in the in this in the
 

4955
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:19,830
uh but in the in this in the
technological world

4956
01:31:19,830 --> 01:31:19,840
technological world
 

4957
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:20,950
technological world
in the engineering world in the

4958
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:20,960
in the engineering world in the
 

4959
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,550
in the engineering world in the
scientific world i mean that's that's

4960
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:22,560
scientific world i mean that's that's
 

4961
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:23,669
scientific world i mean that's that's
the big dream

4962
01:31:23,669 --> 01:31:23,679
the big dream
 

4963
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:27,110
the big dream
to me it feels like

4964
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:27,120
to me it feels like
 

4965
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:30,070
to me it feels like
that's not a dream it's i certainly

4966
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:30,080
that's not a dream it's i certainly
 

4967
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,590
that's not a dream it's i certainly
would like to live forever

4968
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:31,600
would like to live forever
 

4969
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,750
would like to live forever
uh like that that's the initial feeling

4970
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:33,760
uh like that that's the initial feeling
 

4971
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,350
uh like that that's the initial feeling
the instinctual feeling

4972
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:35,360
the instinctual feeling
 

4973
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,990
the instinctual feeling
because you know life is so amazing but

4974
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:38,000
because you know life is so amazing but
 

4975
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:38,790
because you know life is so amazing but
then

4976
01:31:38,790 --> 01:31:38,800
then
 

4977
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,550
then
if you actually kind of like you've

4978
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,560
if you actually kind of like you've
 

4979
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,149
if you actually kind of like you've
presented it if you actually

4980
01:31:42,149 --> 01:31:42,159
presented it if you actually
 

4981
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,950
presented it if you actually
uh lived that kind of life you would

4982
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:44,960
uh lived that kind of life you would
 

4983
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,030
uh lived that kind of life you would
realize that that's actually a step

4984
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:47,040
realize that that's actually a step
 

4985
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,030
realize that that's actually a step
backwards that's a step down from the

4986
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,040
backwards that's a step down from the
 

4987
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,310
backwards that's a step down from the
experience of this life

4988
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:50,320
experience of this life
 

4989
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,110
experience of this life
in my sense that death is an essential

4990
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:53,120
in my sense that death is an essential
 

4991
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,629
in my sense that death is an essential
part of life

4992
01:31:54,629 --> 01:31:54,639
part of life
 

4993
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,470
part of life
about the essential part of this

4994
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:56,480
about the essential part of this
 

4995
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:59,110
about the essential part of this
experience death of all things so the

4996
01:31:59,110 --> 01:31:59,120
experience death of all things so the
 

4997
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:03,350
experience death of all things so the
thing the fact that things end somehow

4998
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:03,360
thing the fact that things end somehow
 

4999
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,910
thing the fact that things end somehow
and the scarcity of things somehow

5000
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:05,920
and the scarcity of things somehow

create

5002
01:32:06,950 --> 01:32:06,960
create
 

5003
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,430
create
the beauty of this experience that we

5004
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:09,440
the beauty of this experience that we
 

5005
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,870
the beauty of this experience that we
have

5006
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:10,880
have
 

5007
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,950
have
yeah transhumanism doesn't look very

5008
01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:12,960
yeah transhumanism doesn't look very
 

5009
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,709
yeah transhumanism doesn't look very
attractive to me either

5010
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:14,719
attractive to me either
 

5011
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:17,510
attractive to me either
but it also doesn't look very feasible

5012
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:17,520
but it also doesn't look very feasible
 

5013
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:19,430
but it also doesn't look very feasible
um

5014
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:19,440
um
 

5015
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,430
um
but that's a whole big topic that i'm

5016
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:21,440
but that's a whole big topic that i'm
 

5017
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,669
but that's a whole big topic that i'm
not exactly an expert

5018
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:23,679
not exactly an expert
 

5019
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:26,550
not exactly an expert
but i'll say but i but you know i've i'm

5020
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:26,560
but i'll say but i but you know i've i'm
 

5021
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,990
but i'll say but i but you know i've i'm
of a certain age where

5022
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:28,000
of a certain age where
 

5023
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,470
of a certain age where
my mortality is more pressing or more

5024
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,480
my mortality is more pressing or more
 

5025
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,189
my mortality is more pressing or more
obvious to me than it once was okay

5026
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:33,199
obvious to me than it once was okay
 

5027
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:36,470
obvious to me than it once was okay
um and um and i don't

5028
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:36,480
um and um and i don't
 

5029
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:40,070
um and um and i don't
dread that i don't see that

5030
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:40,080
dread that i don't see that
 

5031
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,430
dread that i don't see that
as in a certain sense even

5032
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:43,440
as in a certain sense even
 

5033
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,669
as in a certain sense even
the enemy okay you're not afraid of

5034
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:45,679
the enemy okay you're not afraid of
 

5035
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:46,950
the enemy okay you're not afraid of
death well

5036
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:46,960
death well
 

5037
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,350
death well
i'm afraid of lots of things in a in a

5038
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:49,360
i'm afraid of lots of things in a in a
 

5039
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,189
i'm afraid of lots of things in a in a
in a conceptual way but it doesn't keep

5040
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:51,199
in a conceptual way but it doesn't keep
 

5041
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:51,590
in a conceptual way but it doesn't keep
me

5042
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:51,600
me
 

5043
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,110
me
awake at night okay um

5044
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:55,120
awake at night okay um
 

5045
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,750
awake at night okay um
i i'm i think like most people i'm more

5046
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:57,760
i i'm i think like most people i'm more
 

5047
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,629
i i'm i think like most people i'm more
afraid of pain than i am of death

5048
01:33:00,629 --> 01:33:00,639
afraid of pain than i am of death
 

5049
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,390
afraid of pain than i am of death
so i i don't want to put myself forward

5050
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:02,400
so i i don't want to put myself forward
 

5051
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,149
so i i don't want to put myself forward
to some kind of hero that doesn't

5052
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:04,159
to some kind of hero that doesn't
 

5053

outlook

5060

outlook
 

5061
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,790
outlook
um that there is life beyond the grave

5062
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:16,800
um that there is life beyond the grave
 

5063
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,470
um that there is life beyond the grave
um but i don't think that that it's life

5064
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:20,480
um but i don't think that that it's life
 

5065
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,030
um but i don't think that that it's life
in

5066
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:21,040
in
 

5067
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:25,030
in
this universe or in this um

5068
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,040
this universe or in this um
 

5069
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:27,110
this universe or in this um
certainly not in this body and maybe not

5070
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:27,120
certainly not in this body and maybe not
 

5071
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,870
certainly not in this body and maybe not
in a certain sense in this mind i mean

5072
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:28,880
in a certain sense in this mind i mean
 

5073
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:29,990
in a certain sense in this mind i mean
you know christian

5074
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:30,000
you know christian
 

5075
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,070
you know christian
christian belief in the afterlife is is

5076
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:32,080
christian belief in the afterlife is is
 

5077
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:34,310
christian belief in the afterlife is is
that we will be resurrected we will

5078
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:34,320
that we will be resurrected we will
 

5079
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,910
that we will be resurrected we will
in a certain sense be with god i don't

5080
01:33:35,910 --> 01:33:35,920
in a certain sense be with god i don't
 

5081
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,270
in a certain sense be with god i don't
know what that means and i don't think

5082
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:37,280
know what that means and i don't think
 

5083
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:37,910
know what that means and i don't think
anybody else

5084
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:37,920
anybody else
 

5085
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,830
anybody else
really quite knows what that means but

5086
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:39,840
really quite knows what that means but
 

5087
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,030
really quite knows what that means but
there are lots of ways that

5088
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:41,040
there are lots of ways that
 

5089
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:44,709
there are lots of ways that
over history people artists and and

5090
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:44,719
over history people artists and and
 

5091
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,310
over history people artists and and
and writers and so forth have pictured

5092
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:46,320
and writers and so forth have pictured
 

5093
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,709
and writers and so forth have pictured
it um and these are all perhaps some of

5094
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:48,719
it um and these are all perhaps some of
 

5095
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,070
it um and these are all perhaps some of
them helpful ways of thinking

5096
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:50,080
them helpful ways of thinking
 

5097
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,510
them helpful ways of thinking
about it do you think it's possible to

5098
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:51,520
about it do you think it's possible to
 

5099
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,550
about it do you think it's possible to
know what happens after we die

5100
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:54,560
know what happens after we die
 

5101
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,030
know what happens after we die
um i i don't think we find out by

5102
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:57,040
um i i don't think we find out by
 

5103
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,590
um i i don't think we find out by
near-death experiences or those kinds of

5104
01:33:59,590 --> 01:33:59,600
near-death experiences or those kinds of
 

5105
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:00,550
near-death experiences or those kinds of
things but

5106
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:00,560
things but
 

5107
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,629
things but
but i but i think that you know that

5108
01:34:04,629 --> 01:34:04,639
but i but i think that you know that
 

5109
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,110
but i but i think that you know that
we have sufficient i feel i have

5110
01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:07,120
we have sufficient i feel i have
 

5111
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:08,470
we have sufficient i feel i have
sufficient

5112
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:08,480
sufficient
 

5113
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,189
sufficient
information if you like um in terms of

5114
01:34:11,189 --> 01:34:11,199
information if you like um in terms of
 

5115
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:12,629
information if you like um in terms of
god's revelation to be

5116
01:34:12,629 --> 01:34:12,639
god's revelation to be
 

5117
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:15,669
god's revelation to be
confident that that i will

5118
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:15,679
confident that that i will
 

5119
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:18,550
confident that that i will
go somewhere else okay but it won't be

5120
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:18,560
go somewhere else okay but it won't be
 

5121
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,030
go somewhere else okay but it won't be
here

5122
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:19,040
here
 

5123
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,510
here
and i to me the

5124
01:34:23,510 --> 01:34:23,520
and i to me the
 

5125
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,830
and i to me the
aspirations of transhumanism are

5126
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:27,840
aspirations of transhumanism are
 

5127
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,870
aspirations of transhumanism are
horrific i mean i think it would be a

5128
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:30,880
horrific i mean i think it would be a
 

5129
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,310
horrific i mean i think it would be a
nightmare not a dream

5130
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:32,320
nightmare not a dream
 

5131
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,870
nightmare not a dream
a nightmare you know to be somehow

5132
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:34,880
a nightmare you know to be somehow
 

5133
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,470
a nightmare you know to be somehow
downloaded into

5134
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:36,480
downloaded into
 

5135
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,950
downloaded into
a computer and live one's life like that

5136
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:40,960
a computer and live one's life like that
 

5137
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,910
a computer and live one's life like that
because it it completely discounts the

01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,310
in
integrity of our bodies as well as our

01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:47,440
minds i mean
 

5145
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:51,109
minds i mean
we aren't just disembodied minds

5146
01:34:51,109 --> 01:34:51,119
we aren't just disembodied minds
 

5147
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:54,229
we aren't just disembodied minds
it would not be me that was in the

5148
01:34:54,229 --> 01:34:54,239
it would not be me that was in the
 

5149
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,430
it would not be me that was in the

computer
 

5151
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,990
computer
it would be something else if if that

5152
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,000
it would be something else if if that
 

5153
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,070
it would be something else if if that
kind of download were possible of course

5154
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080
kind of download were possible of course
 

5155
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,750
kind of download were possible of course
it isn't possible and it's

5156
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:01,760
it isn't possible and it's
 

5157
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,669
it isn't possible and it's
very long way from being possible but

5158
01:35:03,669 --> 01:35:03,679
very long way from being possible but
 

5159
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:05,510
very long way from being possible but
you know amazing things happen so we

5160
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
you know amazing things happen so we
 

5161
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,310
you know amazing things happen so we
shouldn't

5162
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:06,320
shouldn't
 

5163
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,629
shouldn't
be too cert so this is this is a place

5164
01:35:08,629 --> 01:35:08,639
be too cert so this is this is a place
 

5165
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:10,310
be too cert so this is this is a place
that uh again maybe

5166
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:10,320
that uh again maybe
 

5167
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,510
that uh again maybe
taking a slight step outside uh we're

5168
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:13,520
taking a slight step outside uh we're
 

5169
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,070
taking a slight step outside uh we're
philosophizing a little bit uh let me

5170
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:16,080
philosophizing a little bit uh let me
 

5171
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:17,350
philosophizing a little bit uh let me
ask you about

5172
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
ask you about
 

5173
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,310
ask you about
uh human level or superhuman level

5174
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:20,320
uh human level or superhuman level
 

5175
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,189
uh human level or superhuman level
intelligence

5176
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:21,199
intelligence
 

5177
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,189
intelligence
uh the uh artificial intelligence

5178
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:23,199
uh the uh artificial intelligence
 

5179
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,669
uh the uh artificial intelligence
systems

5180
01:35:25,669 --> 01:35:25,679

 

5181
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,790

do you what do you make from um

5182
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:28,800
do you what do you make from um
 

5183
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,109
do you what do you make from um
from almost a religious or a perspective

5184
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:31,119
from almost a religious or a perspective
 

5185
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:32,070
from almost a religious or a perspective
that we've been

5186
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,080
that we've been
 

5187
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,950
that we've been
talking about of the special aspect of

5188
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:34,960
talking about of the special aspect of
 

5189
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,470
talking about of the special aspect of
human nature

5190
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:36,480
human nature
 

5191
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,910
human nature
of us creating intelligence systems that

5192
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:39,920
of us creating intelligence systems that
 

5193
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,669
of us creating intelligence systems that
exhibit some elements

5194
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:41,679
exhibit some elements
 

5195
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:44,470
exhibit some elements
of that human nature is that something

5196
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:44,480
of that human nature is that something
 

5197
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,830
of that human nature is that something
again like we were talking about with

5198
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:45,840
again like we were talking about with
 

5199
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,109
again like we were talking about with
transhumanism

5200
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:47,119
transhumanism
 

5201
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:49,270
transhumanism
uh there's a feasibility question of how

5202
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:49,280
uh there's a feasibility question of how
 

5203
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,870
uh there's a feasibility question of how
hard is it to actually build machines or

5204
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:50,880
hard is it to actually build machines or
 

5205
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,149
hard is it to actually build machines or
human level intelligence

5206
01:35:52,149 --> 01:35:52,159
human level intelligence
 

5207
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,390
human level intelligence
or have something like consciousness or

5208
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:54,400
or have something like consciousness or
 

5209
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,790
or have something like consciousness or
have all those kinds of human qualities

5210
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:56,800
have all those kinds of human qualities
 

5211
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,470
have all those kinds of human qualities
and then there's the do we want to

5212
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:00,480
and then there's the do we want to
 

5213
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,950
and then there's the do we want to
do that kind of thing so on both of

5214
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:02,960
do that kind of thing so on both of
 

5215
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,350
do that kind of thing so on both of
those directions what do you think

5216
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:05,360
those directions what do you think
 

5217
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,990
those directions what do you think
well okay so you know since your podcast

5218
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:08,000
well okay so you know since your podcast
 

5219
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,590
well okay so you know since your podcast
is called ai i don't want to

5220
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:09,600
is called ai i don't want to
 

5221
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,510
is called ai i don't want to
offend too many of your listeners out

5222
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:11,520
offend too many of your listeners out
 

5223
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,790
offend too many of your listeners out
there that's but i

5224
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:12,800
there that's but i
 

5225
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,430
there that's but i
but i i think one should be a little bit

5226
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:15,440
but i i think one should be a little bit
 

5227
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,510
but i i think one should be a little bit
more modest about one's claims for

5228
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:17,520
more modest about one's claims for
 

5229
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,830
more modest about one's claims for
ai than have typically been the case

5230
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:19,840
ai than have typically been the case
 

5231
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,430
ai than have typically been the case
yeah i think that actually a lot of

5232
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:21,440
yeah i think that actually a lot of
 

5233
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,550
yeah i think that actually a lot of
people in ai

5234
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:22,560
people in ai
 

5235
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,709
people in ai
are somewhat chastened and so there

5236
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:24,719
are somewhat chastened and so there
 

5237
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:26,790
are somewhat chastened and so there
there are more modest claims than

5238
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:26,800
there are more modest claims than
 

5239
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,030
there are more modest claims than
are common with the transhumanists and

5240
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
are common with the transhumanists and
 

5241
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,109
are common with the transhumanists and
yes and and so forth

5242
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:31,119
yes and and so forth
 

5243
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,709
yes and and so forth
um and you know i used to play

5244
01:36:34,709 --> 01:36:34,719
um and you know i used to play
 

5245
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:37,030
um and you know i used to play
chess when i was a kid i was pretty good

5246
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,040
chess when i was a kid i was pretty good
 

5247
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:38,070
chess when i was a kid i was pretty good
at it okay

5248
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:38,080
at it okay
 

5249
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,470
at it okay
um he won competitions and so so on and

5250
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:40,480
um he won competitions and so so on and
 

5251
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,510
um he won competitions and so so on and
so forth

5252
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:41,520
so forth
 

5253
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,990
so forth
and i when i'm talking about when i was

5254
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:44,000
and i when i'm talking about when i was
 

5255
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,149
and i when i'm talking about when i was
in high school i thought it was

5256
01:36:46,149 --> 01:36:46,159
in high school i thought it was
 

5257
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,070
in high school i thought it was
pretty unlikely that a computer would be

5258
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:48,080
pretty unlikely that a computer would be
 

5259
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,910
pretty unlikely that a computer would be
able to become

5260
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:49,920
able to become
 

5261
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,149
able to become
good at chess but i was dead wrong okay

5262
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:52,159
good at chess but i was dead wrong okay
 

5263
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:53,189
good at chess but i was dead wrong okay
and so you know

5264
01:36:53,189 --> 01:36:53,199
and so you know
 

5265
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,030
and so you know
um how did that make you feel by the way

5266
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:55,040
um how did that make you feel by the way
 

5267
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,350
um how did that make you feel by the way
when um do you blew big kids

5268
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:57,360
when um do you blew big kids
 

5269
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,390
when um do you blew big kids
i stopped playing chess seriously

5270
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:00,400
i stopped playing chess seriously
 

5271
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,790
i stopped playing chess seriously
when i had when i encountered computers

5272
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:02,800
when i had when i encountered computers
 

5273
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:03,669
when i had when i encountered computers
that could beat me

5274
01:37:03,669 --> 01:37:03,679
that could beat me
 

5275
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:07,030
that could beat me
okay i still play with my grandchildren

5276
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:07,040
okay i still play with my grandchildren
 

5277
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:07,910
okay i still play with my grandchildren
a little bit but

5278
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:07,920
a little bit but
 

5279
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,030
a little bit but
but um but yeah it it seemed like in a

5280
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:11,040
but um but yeah it it seemed like in a
 

5281
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,709
but um but yeah it it seemed like in a
certain sense it became a solved

5282
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
certain sense it became a solved
 

5283
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:15,350
certain sense it became a solved
problem uh when a.i was able to do it

5284
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:15,360
problem uh when a.i was able to do it
 

5285
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,030
problem uh when a.i was able to do it
better than i could

5286
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:17,040
better than i could
 

5287
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:18,870
better than i could
so i think that there are ways in which

5288
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:18,880
so i think that there are ways in which
 

5289
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,790
so i think that there are ways in which
today we've seen

5290
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:20,800
today we've seen
 

5291
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,270
today we've seen
um computers do things which

5292
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:23,280
um computers do things which
 

5293
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:26,149
um computers do things which
historically were regarded as being

5294
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:26,159
historically were regarded as being
 

5295
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:28,070
historically were regarded as being
very characteristic of human

5296
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:28,080
very characteristic of human
 

5297
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,430
very characteristic of human
intelligence

5298
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:29,440
intelligence
 

5299
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,390
intelligence
and in that sense there there is some

5300
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,400
and in that sense there there is some
 

5301
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,149
and in that sense there there is some
success to ai

5302
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:34,159
success to ai
 

5303
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:37,030
success to ai
i also think that um you know there are

5304
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
i also think that um you know there are
 

5305
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,870
i also think that um you know there are
certain things which one might think of

5306
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880
certain things which one might think of
 

5307
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,310
certain things which one might think of
as being ai

5308
01:37:40,310 --> 01:37:40,320
as being ai
 

5309
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,629
as being ai
which are you know completely widespread

5310
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
which are you know completely widespread
 

5311
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,149
which are you know completely widespread
in our society i'm thinking about the

5312
01:37:44,149 --> 01:37:44,159
in our society i'm thinking about the
 

5313
01:37:44,159 --> 01:37:44,709
in our society i'm thinking about the
internet

5314
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:44,719
internet
 

5315
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,070
internet
search engines uh um and so

5316
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,080
search engines uh um and so
 

5317
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:51,030
search engines uh um and so
forth which are enormously influential

5318
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:51,040
forth which are enormously influential
 

5319
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:51,430
forth which are enormously influential
and

5320
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:51,440
and
 

5321
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,629
and
obviously do things more powerfully than

5322
01:37:54,629 --> 01:37:54,639
obviously do things more powerfully than
 

5323
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,350
obviously do things more powerfully than
any individual human or even any

5324
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
any individual human or even any
 

5325
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,109
any individual human or even any
combination of humans could do much

5326
01:37:59,109 --> 01:37:59,119
combination of humans could do much
 

5327
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:00,470
combination of humans could do much
faster and

5328
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:00,480
faster and
 

5329
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,590
faster and
and and uh accessing

5330
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:03,600
and and uh accessing
 

5331
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,669
and and uh accessing
databases and so on and so forth all of

5332
01:38:05,669 --> 01:38:05,679
databases and so on and so forth all of
 

5333
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:07,030
databases and so on and so forth all of
this is uh

5334
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:07,040
this is uh
 

5335
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:11,189
this is uh
outstripped our human intelligence

5336
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:11,199
outstripped our human intelligence
 

5337
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:14,070
outstripped our human intelligence
um i'm not sure the extent though to

5338
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:14,080
um i'm not sure the extent though to
 

5339
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,270
um i'm not sure the extent though to
which that is really

5340
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:15,280
which that is really
 

5341
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:18,310
which that is really
intelligence uh in the way that was

5342
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:18,320
intelligence uh in the way that was
 

5343
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,070
intelligence uh in the way that was
traditionally meant but it's certainly

5344
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:20,080
traditionally meant but it's certainly
 

5345
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,830
traditionally meant but it's certainly
amazingly

5346
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:21,840
amazingly
 

5347
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,189
amazingly
um facile and it

5348
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:25,199
um facile and it
 

5349
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,709
um facile and it
it multiplies our ability to access

5350
01:38:28,709 --> 01:38:28,719
it multiplies our ability to access
 

5351
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:31,669
it multiplies our ability to access
human knowledge and and data and so

5352
01:38:31,669 --> 01:38:31,679
human knowledge and and data and so
 

5353
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:32,390
human knowledge and and data and so
forth so

5354
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,400
forth so
 

5355
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,310
forth so
is that something is that enter the

5356
01:38:34,310 --> 01:38:34,320
is that something is that enter the
 

5357
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,669
is that something is that enter the
realm of something we should be

5358
01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:35,679
realm of something we should be
 

5359
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,270
realm of something we should be
concerned about

5360
01:38:37,270 --> 01:38:37,280
concerned about
 

5361
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,910
concerned about
so in the realm of religion you talk

5362
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:39,920
so in the realm of religion you talk
 

5363
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,910
so in the realm of religion you talk
about what is good what is evil what is

5364
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:41,920
about what is good what is evil what is
 

5365
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:42,950
about what is good what is evil what is
right what is wrong

5366
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:42,960
right what is wrong
 

5367
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,669
right what is wrong
you have a set of morals set of beliefs

5368
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:45,679
you have a set of morals set of beliefs
 

5369
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,590
you have a set of morals set of beliefs
and when you have an entity come into

5370
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:47,600
and when you have an entity come into
 

5371
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:48,229
and when you have an entity come into
the picture

5372
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:48,239
the picture
 

5373
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:51,510
the picture
that that has quite a bit of power

5374
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:51,520
that that has quite a bit of power
 

5375
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,669
that that has quite a bit of power
if we potentially look into the future

5376
01:38:53,669 --> 01:38:53,679
if we potentially look into the future
 

5377
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,030
if we potentially look into the future
and intelligence and capability

5378
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,040
and intelligence and capability
 

5379
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,430
and intelligence and capability
um do you think there's something that

5380
01:38:59,430 --> 01:38:59,440
um do you think there's something that
 

5381
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:00,709
um do you think there's something that
religion can say

5382
01:39:00,709 --> 01:39:00,719
religion can say
 

5383
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:05,350
religion can say
about artificial intelligence or is that

5384
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:05,360
about artificial intelligence or is that
 

5385
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,030
about artificial intelligence or is that
something you we shouldn't worry about

5386
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:07,040
something you we shouldn't worry about
 

5387
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,709
something you we shouldn't worry about
until it arrives you think

5388
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:08,719
until it arrives you think
 

5389
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,950
until it arrives you think
just like with the chess program um you

5390
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:10,960
just like with the chess program um you
 

5391
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,790
just like with the chess program um you
know religious writers have thought

5392
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:12,800
know religious writers have thought
 

5393
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:15,350
know religious writers have thought
about this for centuries

5394
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:15,360
about this for centuries
 

5395
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,830
about this for centuries
uh you know there's been a long debate

5396
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:17,840
uh you know there's been a long debate
 

5397
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:18,470
uh you know there's been a long debate
about

5398
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:18,480
about
 

5399
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,629
about
what is what it was historically called

5400
01:39:20,629 --> 01:39:20,639
what is what it was historically called
 

5401
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,030
what is what it was historically called
the plurality of worlds

5402
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:23,040
the plurality of worlds
 

5403
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,270
the plurality of worlds
and it was actually more about whether

5404
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:25,280
and it was actually more about whether
 

5405
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,390
and it was actually more about whether
there are

5406
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:26,400
there are
 

5407
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,669
there are
places where other intelligent creatures

5408
01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:29,679
places where other intelligent creatures
 

5409
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,950
places where other intelligent creatures
live than it was about us creating them

5410
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:32,960
live than it was about us creating them
 

5411
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:35,270
live than it was about us creating them
but but i think it's largely the same

5412
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:35,280
but but i think it's largely the same
 

5413
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,350
but but i think it's largely the same
question it's almost like aliens

5414
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
question it's almost like aliens
 

5415
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,189
question it's almost like aliens
yeah other intelligence so if there is

5416
01:39:39,189 --> 01:39:39,199
yeah other intelligence so if there is
 

5417
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:41,270
yeah other intelligence so if there is
other intelligent life in the universe

5418
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:41,280
other intelligent life in the universe
 

5419
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:43,910
other intelligent life in the universe
what is its relationship to god okay

5420
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:43,920
what is its relationship to god okay
 

5421
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:44,470
what is its relationship to god okay
that is

5422
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:44,480
that is
 

5423
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,470
that is
in a certain sense the puzzle that

5424
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:46,480
in a certain sense the puzzle that
 

5425
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,550
in a certain sense the puzzle that
religious thinkers and writers have

5426
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:48,560
religious thinkers and writers have
 

5427
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:49,830
religious thinkers and writers have
thought about for a long time and

5428
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:49,840
thought about for a long time and
 

5429
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:50,149
thought about for a long time and
there's

5430
01:39:50,149 --> 01:39:50,159
there's
 

5431
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,629
there's
a whole range of of different opinions

5432
01:39:52,629 --> 01:39:52,639
a whole range of of different opinions
 

5433
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:53,270
a whole range of of different opinions
about that

5434
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:53,280
about that
 

5435
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,669
about that
i mean personally you know i think it's

5436
01:39:55,669 --> 01:39:55,679
i mean personally you know i think it's
 

5437
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:57,189
i mean personally you know i think it's
it's an interesting question but it's

5438
01:39:57,189 --> 01:39:57,199
it's an interesting question but it's
 

5439
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,709
it's an interesting question but it's
not a very pressing question at the

5440
01:39:58,709 --> 01:39:58,719
not a very pressing question at the
 

5441
01:39:58,719 --> 01:39:59,510
not a very pressing question at the
moment

5442
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,520
moment
 

5443
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,310
moment
um yeah and i think the same way about

5444
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:02,320
um yeah and i think the same way about
 

5445
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:02,790
um yeah and i think the same way about
the

5446
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:02,800
the
 

5447
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,950
the
the question of what happens if we're

5448
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:04,960
the question of what happens if we're
 

5449
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,109
the question of what happens if we're
able to build a sentient robot for

5450
01:40:07,109 --> 01:40:07,119
able to build a sentient robot for
 

5451
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:08,470
able to build a sentient robot for
example

5452
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:08,480
example
 

5453
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:09,990
example
i think it's an interesting question and

5454
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,000
i think it's an interesting question and
 

5455
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,430
i think it's an interesting question and
we'll have to think about it when that

5456
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:11,440
we'll have to think about it when that
 

5457
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,709
we'll have to think about it when that
happens

5458
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
happens
 

5459
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,229
happens
but i think we're still quite a ways

5460
01:40:14,229 --> 01:40:14,239
but i think we're still quite a ways
 

5461
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:15,830
but i think we're still quite a ways
away from that and so i

5462
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:15,840
away from that and so i
 

5463
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,629
away from that and so i
i don't have a good answer um but i

5464
01:40:18,629 --> 01:40:18,639
i don't have a good answer um but i
 

5465
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,229
i don't have a good answer um but i
think there's a literature that you one

5466
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:20,239
think there's a literature that you one
 

5467
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:21,109
think there's a literature that you one
could tap

5468
01:40:21,109 --> 01:40:21,119
could tap
 

5469
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:23,590
could tap
um to think about okay if you want to

5470
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:23,600
um to think about okay if you want to
 

5471
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,310
um to think about okay if you want to
start early on the question yeah

5472
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:26,320
start early on the question yeah
 

5473
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,149
start early on the question yeah
well let me ask you another impossible

5474
01:40:28,149 --> 01:40:28,159
well let me ask you another impossible
 

5475
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:29,750
well let me ask you another impossible
question you know from a religious or

5476
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:29,760
question you know from a religious or
 

5477
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,189
question you know from a religious or
from a personal perspective

5478
01:40:31,189 --> 01:40:31,199
from a personal perspective
 

5479
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,750
from a personal perspective
what do you think is consciousness this

5480
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:33,760
what do you think is consciousness this
 

5481
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,189
what do you think is consciousness this
this uh

5482
01:40:35,189 --> 01:40:35,199
this uh
 

5483
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:37,350
this uh
subjective experience that we seem to be

5484
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:37,360
subjective experience that we seem to be
 

5485
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,470
subjective experience that we seem to be
having

5486
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:38,480
having
 

5487
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:42,470
having
does uh this does uh

5488
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:42,480
does uh this does uh
 

5489
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,070
does uh this does uh
the christian religion have something to

5490
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:44,080
the christian religion have something to
 

5491
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,550
the christian religion have something to
say about consciousness does your own

5492
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:46,560
say about consciousness does your own
 

5493
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,149
say about consciousness does your own
when you look in the mirror do you have

5494
01:40:48,149 --> 01:40:48,159
when you look in the mirror do you have
 

5495
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:51,189
when you look in the mirror do you have
a sense of what is consciousness

5496
01:40:51,189 --> 01:40:51,199
a sense of what is consciousness
 

5497
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:53,430
a sense of what is consciousness
um i think the bible doesn't have much

5498
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:53,440
um i think the bible doesn't have much
 

5499
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,109
um i think the bible doesn't have much
in the way of answers about that

5500
01:40:55,109 --> 01:40:55,119
in the way of answers about that
 

5501
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:56,629
in the way of answers about that
directly in the sense that you're

5502
01:40:56,629 --> 01:40:56,639
directly in the sense that you're
 

5503
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,629
directly in the sense that you're
perhaps asking it which is more like

5504
01:40:58,629 --> 01:40:58,639
perhaps asking it which is more like
 

5505
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:00,790
perhaps asking it which is more like
i think you're asking for some kind of

5506
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:00,800
i think you're asking for some kind of
 

5507
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,430
i think you're asking for some kind of
uh quasi scientific or maybe indeed

5508
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:03,440
uh quasi scientific or maybe indeed
 

5509
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,149
uh quasi scientific or maybe indeed
scientific

5510
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:04,159
scientific
 

5511
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,310
scientific
uh uh description that's not really

5512
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:06,320
uh uh description that's not really
 

5513
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:07,189
uh uh description that's not really
looking for one yes

5514
01:41:07,189 --> 01:41:07,199
looking for one yes
 

5515
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:10,390
looking for one yes
um i i think that i think that there

5516
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,400
um i i think that i think that there
 

5517
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,310
um i i think that i think that there
it's an interesting question i think

5518
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:12,320
it's an interesting question i think
 

5519
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,030
it's an interesting question i think
it's actually um

5520
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,040
it's actually um
 

5521
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,910
it's actually um
a it's a jump too far i think we have we

5522
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:17,920
a it's a jump too far i think we have we
 

5523
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:19,109
a it's a jump too far i think we have we
don't even know the answer to the

5524
01:41:19,109 --> 01:41:19,119
don't even know the answer to the
 

5525
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:20,470
don't even know the answer to the
question what is the mind

5526
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:20,480
question what is the mind
 

5527
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:22,470
question what is the mind
let alone consciousness so if you

5528
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:22,480
let alone consciousness so if you
 

5529
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:24,310
let alone consciousness so if you
distinguish between those two things

5530
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:24,320
distinguish between those two things
 

5531
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,750
distinguish between those two things
i think the question that's being

5532
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:25,760
i think the question that's being
 

5533
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,390
i think the question that's being
addressed more directly

5534
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:28,400
addressed more directly
 

5535
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:31,430
addressed more directly
scientifically as well as in other ways

5536
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,440
scientifically as well as in other ways
 

5537
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,229
scientifically as well as in other ways
it is what is the mind and that is

5538
01:41:34,229 --> 01:41:34,239
it is what is the mind and that is
 

5539
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:35,910
it is what is the mind and that is
certainly a very

5540
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:35,920
certainly a very
 

5541
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,390
certainly a very
topical question even in places like mit

5542
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:38,400
topical question even in places like mit
 

5543
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,030
topical question even in places like mit
which is not

5544
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:39,040
which is not
 

5545
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:41,189
which is not
historically involved with philosophical

5546
01:41:41,189 --> 01:41:41,199
historically involved with philosophical
 

5547
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:42,550
historically involved with philosophical
questions you know that people

5548
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:42,560
questions you know that people
 

5549
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,070
questions you know that people
doing neuroscience and so forth i think

5550
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,080
doing neuroscience and so forth i think
 

5551
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:48,310
doing neuroscience and so forth i think
it's a very important question and i

5552
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:48,320
it's a very important question and i
 

5553
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,950
it's a very important question and i
think that we're going to find

5554
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:50,960
think that we're going to find
 

5555
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,550
think that we're going to find
that um we are not computers

5556
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:54,560
that um we are not computers
 

5557
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,830
that um we are not computers
in other words i think the the

5558
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:57,840
in other words i think the the
 

5559
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,430
in other words i think the the
commonplace theory of

5560
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:01,440
commonplace theory of
 

5561
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:05,270
commonplace theory of
what mind is is is generally speaking

5562
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:05,280
what mind is is is generally speaking
 

5563
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:08,550
what mind is is is generally speaking
by analogy that we are basically wet

5564
01:42:08,550 --> 01:42:08,560
by analogy that we are basically wet
 

5565
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:12,830
by analogy that we are basically wet
wet wear okay um that we that we're some

5566
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:12,840
wet wear okay um that we that we're some
 

5567
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,790
wet wear okay um that we that we're some
computer-like entity

5568
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:16,800
computer-like entity
 

5569
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,990
computer-like entity
and that that the analogy to digital

5570
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:20,000
and that that the analogy to digital
 

5571
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:20,790
and that that the analogy to digital
computers

computers
 

5573
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:23,189
computers
is is is a pretty decent one i mean that

5574
01:42:23,189 --> 01:42:23,199
is is is a pretty decent one i mean that
 

5575
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:25,189
is is is a pretty decent one i mean that
that's of course a viewpoint

5576
01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:25,199
that's of course a viewpoint
 

5577
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:28,229
that's of course a viewpoint
which um you know which drives

5578
01:42:28,229 --> 01:42:28,239
which um you know which drives

which um you know which drives
the aspirations of the transhumanists i

5580
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:30,400
the aspirations of the transhumanists i
 

5581
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,390
the aspirations of the transhumanists i
mean they they so much believe that our

5582
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:32,400
mean they they so much believe that our
 

5583
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:33,590
mean they they so much believe that our
minds are nothing

5584
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:33,600
minds are nothing
 

5585
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,750
minds are nothing
other than you know a certain sense some

5586
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:35,760
other than you know a certain sense some

other than you know a certain sense some
kind of implementation of software

01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:38,080
kind of implementation of software
 

5589
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,310
kind of implementation of software

01:42:40,310 --> 01:42:40,320
in biology that they say to themselves
 

5591
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,510
in biology that they say to themselves
well of course we're going to be able to

5592
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:41,520
well of course we're going to be able to
 

5593
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:42,070
well of course we're going to be able to
download

5594
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:42,080
download
 

5595
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,990
download
it into a into a digital computer i

5596
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:46,000
it into a into a digital computer i
 

5597
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,229
it into a into a digital computer i
don't think that's true

5598
01:42:48,229 --> 01:42:48,239
don't think that's true
 

5599
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:51,750
don't think that's true
i think it's most likely that

5600
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:51,760
i think it's most likely that
 

5601
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:54,149
i think it's most likely that
quantum mechanics is very important in

5602
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:54,159
quantum mechanics is very important in
 

5603
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:55,990
quantum mechanics is very important in
the brain

5604
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:56,000
the brain
 

5605
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,189
the brain
uh it seems most unlikely that it's not

5606
01:42:59,189 --> 01:42:59,199
uh it seems most unlikely that it's not
 

5607
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:01,990
uh it seems most unlikely that it's not
to me i know that that's contrary to the

5608
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,000
to me i know that that's contrary to the
 

5609
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,910
to me i know that that's contrary to the
opinions of many people but

5610
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:03,920
opinions of many people but
 

5611
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,750
opinions of many people but
but that's my view and it's also a view

5612
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:05,760
but that's my view and it's also a view
 

5613
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,709
but that's my view and it's also a view
for example of people like roger penrose

5614
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
for example of people like roger penrose
 

5615
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:09,990
for example of people like roger penrose
and people like that who've written

5616
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:10,000
and people like that who've written
 

5617
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,030
and people like that who've written
about it rather extensively

5618
01:43:13,030 --> 01:43:13,040
about it rather extensively
 

5619
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:16,149
about it rather extensively
and if that's the case then really

5620
01:43:16,149 --> 01:43:16,159
and if that's the case then really
 

5621
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:19,830
and if that's the case then really
my mind is not reproduce

5622
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:19,840
my mind is not reproduce
 

5623
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,109
my mind is not reproduce
reducible to some kind of software which

5624
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:23,119
reducible to some kind of software which
 

5625
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:25,109
reducible to some kind of software which
can be considered to be portable

5626
01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:25,119
can be considered to be portable
 

5627
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:28,870
can be considered to be portable
it is so connected to the hardware

5628
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:28,880
it is so connected to the hardware
 

5629
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:32,310
it is so connected to the hardware
of my body that the two are inseparable

5630
01:43:32,310 --> 01:43:32,320
of my body that the two are inseparable
 

5631
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,109
of my body that the two are inseparable
okay and so if that is in fact what we

5632
01:43:35,109 --> 01:43:35,119
okay and so if that is in fact what we
 

5633
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:36,070
okay and so if that is in fact what we
find

5634
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:36,080
find
 

5635
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,109
find
um as i suspect will be the case then

5636
01:43:39,109 --> 01:43:39,119
um as i suspect will be the case then
 

5637
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:41,030
um as i suspect will be the case then
the aspirations of the transhumanists

5638
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:41,040
the aspirations of the transhumanists
 

5639
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:41,750
the aspirations of the transhumanists
will be

5640
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:41,760
will be
 

5641
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,870
will be
very long in coming if at all

5642
01:43:44,870 --> 01:43:44,880
very long in coming if at all
 

5643
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,669
very long in coming if at all
um so i think that actually physics and

5644
01:43:47,669 --> 01:43:47,679
um so i think that actually physics and
 

5645
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,030
um so i think that actually physics and
chemistry

5646
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:49,040
chemistry
 

5647
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,310
chemistry
um you know are in a certain are in a

5648
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:52,320
um you know are in a certain are in a
 

5649
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:52,870
um you know are in a certain are in a
sense

5650
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:52,880
sense
 

5651
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,149
sense
um uh involved with the brain and within

5652
01:43:56,149 --> 01:43:56,159
um uh involved with the brain and within
 

5653
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:57,350
um uh involved with the brain and within
the mind but not

5654
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:57,360
the mind but not
 

5655
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,910
the mind but not
in a very simple way like you know like

5656
01:43:59,910 --> 01:43:59,920
in a very simple way like you know like
 

5657
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:00,390
in a very simple way like you know like
the

5658
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:00,400
the
 

5659
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,990
the
computer analogy um in in a much more

5660
01:44:03,990 --> 01:44:04,000
computer analogy um in in a much more
 

5661
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,550
computer analogy um in in a much more
complicated way

5662
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:06,560
complicated way
 

5663
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,750
complicated way
and i also think that um

5664
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:09,760
and i also think that um
 

5665
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:13,109
and i also think that um
it's philosophically

5666
01:44:13,109 --> 01:44:13,119
it's philosophically
 

5667
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:17,430
it's philosophically
ignorant to speak as if

5668
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:17,440
ignorant to speak as if
 

5669
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:21,430
ignorant to speak as if
um when and if the actions of the brain

5670
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,440
um when and if the actions of the brain
 

5671
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:21,830
um when and if the actions of the brain
are

5672
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:21,840
are
 

5673
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,910
are
are understood at the physical and

5674
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:23,920
are understood at the physical and
 

5675
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,590
are understood at the physical and
chemical level

5676
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:25,600
chemical level
 

5677
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,030
chemical level
that will me that the mind will vanish

5678
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:29,040
that will me that the mind will vanish
 

5679
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,350
that will me that the mind will vanish
as a concept you know that we'll just

5680
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:31,360
as a concept you know that we'll just
 

5681
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:32,629
as a concept you know that we'll just
say we're nothing but

5682
01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:32,639
say we're nothing but
 

5683
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:35,830
say we're nothing but
brains okay of course it won't

5684
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:35,840
brains okay of course it won't
 

5685
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,149
brains okay of course it won't
i mean it may well be that our mind is

5686
01:44:38,149 --> 01:44:38,159
i mean it may well be that our mind is
 

5687
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,270
i mean it may well be that our mind is
an emergent

5688
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:39,280
an emergent
 

5689
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,830
an emergent
phenomenon that comes out of the physics

5690
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:41,840
phenomenon that comes out of the physics
 

5691
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,350
phenomenon that comes out of the physics
and chemistry and biology

5692
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:43,360
and chemistry and biology
 

5693
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,550
and chemistry and biology
okay but it's also something that we

5694
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:46,560
okay but it's also something that we
 

5695
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,430
okay but it's also something that we
have to

5696
01:44:47,430 --> 01:44:47,440
have to
 

5697
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:50,709
have to
encounter and take seriously and so

5698
01:44:50,709 --> 01:44:50,719
encounter and take seriously and so
 

5699
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:53,350
encounter and take seriously and so
um you know it's it's not the case that

5700
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:53,360
um you know it's it's not the case that
 

5701
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,790
um you know it's it's not the case that
it that the mind is

5702
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:54,800
it that the mind is
 

5703
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,390
it that the mind is
reducible to nothing but

5704
01:44:58,390 --> 01:44:58,400
reducible to nothing but
 

5705
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,790
reducible to nothing but
physics and chemistry even if it's

5706
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:00,800
physics and chemistry even if it's
 

5707
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,149
physics and chemistry even if it's
embedded in

5708
01:45:02,149 --> 01:45:02,159
embedded in
 

5709
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:04,629
embedded in
you know continuously into physics and

5710
01:45:04,629 --> 01:45:04,639
you know continuously into physics and
 

5711
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:07,270
you know continuously into physics and
chemistry as i rather suspect it is

5712
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:07,280
chemistry as i rather suspect it is
 

5713
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:11,590
chemistry as i rather suspect it is
um so i that that's my own view i mean

5714
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:11,600
um so i that that's my own view i mean
 

5715
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:13,990
um so i that that's my own view i mean
another way of putting it is that the

5716
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:14,000
another way of putting it is that the
 

5717
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,430
another way of putting it is that the
mind or the soul

5718
01:45:15,430 --> 01:45:15,440
mind or the soul
 

5719
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,790
mind or the soul
is not something added into humans

5720
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:18,800
is not something added into humans
 

5721
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,470
is not something added into humans
as might have been the viewpoint um

5722
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:22,480
as might have been the viewpoint um
 

5723
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,390
as might have been the viewpoint um
historically i do think there is you

5724
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:24,400
historically i do think there is you
 

5725
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,149
historically i do think there is you
know there is something added to humans

5726
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:26,159
know there is something added to humans
 

5727
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:27,189
know there is something added to humans
but it's not

5728
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:27,199
but it's not
 

5729
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:29,189
but it's not
it's not the mind it's the spirit and

5730
01:45:29,189 --> 01:45:29,199
it's not the mind it's the spirit and
 

5731
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:30,629
it's not the mind it's the spirit and
that takes us beyond the physical

5732
01:45:30,629 --> 01:45:30,639
that takes us beyond the physical
 

5733
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:32,870
that takes us beyond the physical
context beyond this universe

5734
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:32,880
context beyond this universe
 

5735
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,030
context beyond this universe
but i but i don't think that that

5736
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:35,040
but i but i don't think that that
 

5737
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,870

is that thing which is necessarily added

in explicit so i mean

5744
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:42,480
in explicit so i mean
 

5745
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,870
in explicit so i mean
i'm not a substance duelist in that

5746
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:44,880
i'm not a substance duelist in that
 

5747
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:46,470
i'm not a substance duelist in that
sense okay if you want to put it

5748
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:46,480
sense okay if you want to put it
 

5749
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,830

philosophically

5750
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:47,840
philosophically
 

5751
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,590
philosophically
i mean um but you see you your senses um

5752
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:51,600
i mean um but you see you your senses um
 

5753
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,510
i mean um but you see you your senses um
so the mind and the intelligence and

5754
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:53,520
so the mind and the intelligence and
 

5755
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,030
so the mind and the intelligence and
consciousness can be these emergent

5756
01:45:55,030 --> 01:45:55,040
consciousness can be these emergent
 

5757
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,390
consciousness can be these emergent
things

5758
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:56,400
things
 

5759
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,550
things
do you have do you have a hope a sense

5760
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:58,560
do you have do you have a hope a sense
 

5761
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,229
do you have do you have a hope a sense
that science could

5762
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:00,239
that science could
 

5763
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:03,109
that science could
help us get pretty far down the road of

5764
01:46:03,109 --> 01:46:03,119
help us get pretty far down the road of
 

5765
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,590
help us get pretty far down the road of
understanding we will get much further

5766
01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:05,600
understanding we will get much further
 

5767
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:10,470
understanding we will get much further
than we have and we it'll be interesting

5768
01:46:10,470 --> 01:46:10,480
than we have and we it'll be interesting
 

5769
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:13,910
than we have and we it'll be interesting
um i mean right now our our methods of

5770
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:13,920
um i mean right now our our methods of
 

5771
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:15,910
um i mean right now our our methods of
diagnosing the human brain

5772
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:15,920
diagnosing the human brain
 

5773
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:18,229
diagnosing the human brain
are extremely primitive i mean the

5774
01:46:18,229 --> 01:46:18,239
are extremely primitive i mean the
 

5775
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:20,310
are extremely primitive i mean the
resolution that we have

5776
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:20,320
resolution that we have
 

5777
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:23,910
resolution that we have
you know that comes out of uh out of nmr

5778
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:23,920
you know that comes out of uh out of nmr
 

5779
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,550
you know that comes out of uh out of nmr
and and brain scans and so forth is

5780
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:26,560
and and brain scans and so forth is
 

5781
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,709
and and brain scans and so forth is
miserable compared with what we need

5782
01:46:28,709 --> 01:46:28,719
miserable compared with what we need
 

5783
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:30,950
miserable compared with what we need
in order to understand the brain at the

5784
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:30,960
in order to understand the brain at the
 

5785
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,709
in order to understand the brain at the
cellular level let alone at the

5786
01:46:32,709 --> 01:46:32,719
cellular level let alone at the
 

5787
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:35,990
cellular level let alone at the
at the atomic level um but uh

5788
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,000
at the atomic level um but uh
 

5789
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,750
at the atomic level um but uh
you know we're making progress it's

5790
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:37,760
you know we're making progress it's
 

5791
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:39,510
you know we're making progress it's
relatively slow progress but it's

5792
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:39,520
relatively slow progress but it's
 

5793
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:39,990
relatively slow progress but it's
progress

5794
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:40,000
progress
 

5795
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,030
progress
and people are working on it and we're

5796
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,040
and people are working on it and we're
 

5797
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:43,270
and people are working on it and we're
going to get better at it and we'll find

5798
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:43,280
going to get better at it and we'll find
 

5799
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,510
going to get better at it and we'll find
out very interesting things as we do

5800
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:45,520
out very interesting things as we do
 

5801
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,669
out very interesting things as we do
um the time resolution is also

5802
01:46:47,669 --> 01:46:47,679
um the time resolution is also
 

5803
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:49,189
um the time resolution is also
completely hopeless compared

5804
01:46:49,189 --> 01:46:49,199
completely hopeless compared
 

5805
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:50,790
completely hopeless compared
compare with what we need to understand

5806
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:50,800
compare with what we need to understand
 

5807
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,470
compare with what we need to understand
the thought you know

5808
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:52,480
the thought you know
 

5809
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,270
the thought you know
so um so there's a long way to go and we

5810
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:55,280
so um so there's a long way to go and we
 

5811
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,030
so um so there's a long way to go and we
will get better at it

5812
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:57,040
will get better at it
 

5813
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,750
will get better at it
um but i'm but i'm not at all worried as

5814
01:46:59,750 --> 01:46:59,760
um but i'm but i'm not at all worried as
 

5815
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,390
um but i'm but i'm not at all worried as
some people

5816
01:47:00,390 --> 01:47:00,400
some people
 

5817
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,550
some people
are and some people speak as if there's

5818
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:02,560
are and some people speak as if there's
 

5819
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:03,669
are and some people speak as if there's
a good thing

5820
01:47:03,669 --> 01:47:03,679
a good thing
 

5821
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:06,870
a good thing
that somehow the concepts of

01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:06,880
that somehow the concepts of
 

5823
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,470
that somehow the concepts of
humanity and the mind and religion

5824

humanity and the mind and religion
 

5825
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:13,590
humanity and the mind and religion

well i i find kind of compelling that

01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:31,199
well i i find kind of compelling that
 

5847
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:33,270
well i i find kind of compelling that

we're a part of
 

5861
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:54,470
we're a part of
i certainly think that god takes delight

5862
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:54,480
i certainly think that god takes delight
 

5863
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,149
i certainly think that god takes delight
in his creation

5864
01:47:56,149 --> 01:47:56,159
in his creation
 

5865
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:58,950
in his creation
and that it was created for that delight

5866
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:58,960
and that it was created for that delight
 

5867
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,790
and that it was created for that delight
as much as it was

5868
01:48:00,790 --> 01:48:00,800
as much as it was
 

5869
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,990
as much as it was
um for any other reason and that

5870
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:04,000
um for any other reason and that
 

5871
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,310
um for any other reason and that
you know that therefore are there's

5872
01:48:06,310 --> 01:48:06,320
you know that therefore are there's
 

5873
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,270
you know that therefore are there's
reason to be

5874
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:07,280
reason to be
 

5875
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:10,390
reason to be
hopeful and and awestruck by the

5876
01:48:10,390 --> 01:48:10,400
hopeful and and awestruck by the
 

5877
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:11,590
hopeful and and awestruck by the
creation whether it's

5878
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:11,600
creation whether it's
 

5879
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,550
creation whether it's
on the very small or on the very large

5880
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:14,560
on the very small or on the very large
 

5881
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:15,830
on the very small or on the very large
i'm not sure if you're familiar there's

5882
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:15,840
i'm not sure if you're familiar there's
 

5883
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,030
i'm not sure if you're familiar there's
something called the simulation

5884
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:17,040
something called the simulation
 

5885
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,870
something called the simulation
hypothesis

5886
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:18,880
hypothesis
 

5887
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,830
hypothesis
that's been fun to talk about with the

5888
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:21,840
that's been fun to talk about with the
 

5889
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,390
that's been fun to talk about with the
computer scientists and so on which is a

5890
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:24,400
computer scientists and so on which is a
 

5891
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,590
computer scientists and so on which is a
kind of thought experiment that proposes

5892
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:27,600
kind of thought experiment that proposes
 

5893
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,790
kind of thought experiment that proposes
that you know the entirety of the world

5894
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:30,800
that you know the entirety of the world
 

5895
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,790
that you know the entirety of the world
around us is a kind of a computer

5896
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:32,800
around us is a kind of a computer
 

5897
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:33,430
around us is a kind of a computer
program

5898
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:33,440
program
 

5899
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:35,109
program
that's a simulation and then we're

5900
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:35,119
that's a simulation and then we're
 

5901
01:48:35,119 --> 01:48:36,470
that's a simulation and then we're
living inside it

5902
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:36,480
living inside it
 

5903
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,189
living inside it
i think there's um i think from a

5904
01:48:39,189 --> 01:48:39,199
i think there's um i think from a
 

5905
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:40,709
i think there's um i think from a
certain perspective that could be

5906
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:40,719
certain perspective that could be
 

5907
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:41,830
certain perspective that could be
consistent

5908
01:48:41,830 --> 01:48:41,840
consistent
 

5909
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,950
consistent
with a religious view of the world

5910
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:44,960
with a religious view of the world
 

5911
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,149
with a religious view of the world
i mean you could just use different

5912
01:48:46,149 --> 01:48:46,159
i mean you could just use different
 

5913
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:49,030
i mean you could just use different
terms uh basically

5914
01:48:49,030 --> 01:48:49,040
terms uh basically
 

5915
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,109
terms uh basically
uh what are your but it's a it's a it

5916
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:51,119
uh what are your but it's a it's a it
 

5917
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:52,790
uh what are your but it's a it's a it
feels like a more

5918
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:52,800
feels like a more
 

5919
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:56,790
feels like a more
um modern updated version of that

5920
01:48:56,790 --> 01:48:56,800
um modern updated version of that
 

5921
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:00,790
um modern updated version of that
but what is what's your sense of this uh

5922
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:00,800
but what is what's your sense of this uh
 

5923
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,550
but what is what's your sense of this uh
or the simulation hypothesis do you find

5924
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:02,560
or the simulation hypothesis do you find
 

5925
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,470
or the simulation hypothesis do you find
it interesting useful to think about it

5926
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:04,480
it interesting useful to think about it
 

5927
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:05,910
it interesting useful to think about it
do you find it ridiculous

5928
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:05,920
do you find it ridiculous
 

5929
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,750
do you find it ridiculous
did you find it fun what what are your

5930
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:07,760
did you find it fun what what are your
 

5931
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,510
did you find it fun what what are your
thoughts uh

5932
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:09,520
thoughts uh
 

5933
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,189
thoughts uh
it's fun and it's been of course the

5934
01:49:11,189 --> 01:49:11,199
it's fun and it's been of course the
 

5935
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:14,709
it's fun and it's been of course the
subject of various movies yeah um

5936
01:49:14,709 --> 01:49:14,719
subject of various movies yeah um
 

5937
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:16,629
subject of various movies yeah um
that that some of which are very well

5938
01:49:16,629 --> 01:49:16,639
that that some of which are very well
 

5939
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:17,910
that that some of which are very well
known um

5940
01:49:17,910 --> 01:49:17,920
known um
 

5941
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:23,589
known um
you know i don't think it makes sense to

5942
01:49:23,589 --> 01:49:23,599
you know i don't think it makes sense to
 

5943
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:26,310
you know i don't think it makes sense to
think of it as a simulation hypothesis

5944
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:26,320
think of it as a simulation hypothesis
 

5945
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,270
think of it as a simulation hypothesis
in the sense that

5946
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:27,280
in the sense that
 

5947
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:30,550
in the sense that
we're really lying in uh

5948
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:30,560
we're really lying in uh
 

5949
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,310
we're really lying in uh
banks um of of uh

5950
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:34,320
banks um of of uh
 

5951
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,109
banks um of of uh
on banks of beds having our energy

5952
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:37,119
on banks of beds having our energy
 

5953
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:38,709
on banks of beds having our energy
drained away from us

5954
01:49:38,709 --> 01:49:38,719
drained away from us
 

5955
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:41,350
drained away from us
um and and the simulation is going on in

5956
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:41,360
um and and the simulation is going on in
 

5957
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:42,070
um and and the simulation is going on in
our individual

5958
01:49:42,070 --> 01:49:42,080
our individual
 

5959
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:44,550
our individual
brains that that makes no sense to me at

5960
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:44,560
brains that that makes no sense to me at
 

5961
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,149
brains that that makes no sense to me at
all i don't think that's what's

5962
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:46,159
all i don't think that's what's
 

5963
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:48,390
all i don't think that's what's
meant by the simulation hypothesis as as

5964
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:48,400
meant by the simulation hypothesis as as
 

5965
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:49,830
meant by the simulation hypothesis as as
you're using it now

5966
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:49,840
you're using it now
 

5967
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,030
you're using it now
but i think that there is a um

5968
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:53,040
but i think that there is a um
 

5969
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:56,470
but i think that there is a um
there is very little distinction between

5970
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:56,480
there is very little distinction between
 

5971
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:57,030
there is very little distinction between
saying

5972
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:57,040
saying
 

5973
01:49:57,040 --> 01:50:00,390
saying
that a an intelligent creator

5974
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:00,400
that a an intelligent creator
 

5975
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:04,070
that a an intelligent creator
has set up the universe according to

5976
01:50:04,070 --> 01:50:04,080
has set up the universe according to
 

5977
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,510
has set up the universe according to
his will and his plan

5978
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:07,520
his will and his plan
 

5979
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:11,350
his will and his plan
and set it in motion and is

5980
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:11,360
and set it in motion and is
 

5981
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,149
and set it in motion and is
allowing it to run out maybe as

5982
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:14,159
allowing it to run out maybe as
 

5983
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:15,189
allowing it to run out maybe as
christians say

5984
01:50:15,189 --> 01:50:15,199
christians say
 

5985
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:18,550
christians say
he's sustaining it actually

5986
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:18,560
he's sustaining it actually
 

5987
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,189
he's sustaining it actually
um by his word of power it says in the

5988
01:50:21,189 --> 01:50:21,199
um by his word of power it says in the
 

5989
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:21,589
um by his word of power it says in the
book

5990
01:50:21,589 --> 01:50:21,599
book
 

5991
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:24,629
book
of the letter to hebrews okay

5992
01:50:24,629 --> 01:50:24,639
of the letter to hebrews okay
 

5993
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:29,350
of the letter to hebrews okay
in in in this amazingly consistent

5994
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:29,360
in in in this amazingly consistent
 

5995
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:32,950
in in in this amazingly consistent
and um integrated way

5996
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:32,960
and um integrated way
 

5997
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,550
and um integrated way
um i don't think there's very much

5998
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:34,560
um i don't think there's very much
 

5999
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:35,910
um i don't think there's very much
difference between saying that and

6000
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:35,920
difference between saying that and
 

6001
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,990
difference between saying that and
saying that it's assimilation okay

6002
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:38,000
saying that it's assimilation okay
 

6003
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,990
saying that it's assimilation okay
i mean i think it's almost the same

6004
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:40,000
i mean i think it's almost the same
 

6005
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,270
i mean i think it's almost the same
thing okay

6006
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:41,280
thing okay
 

6007
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,830
thing okay
but i but i think from but i think it's

6008
01:50:43,830 --> 01:50:43,840
but i but i think from but i think it's
 

6009
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:47,430
but i but i think from but i think it's
important to recognize that

6010
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:47,440

 

6011
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,990

the simulation in that concept the

6012
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:50,000
the simulation in that concept the
 

6013
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,589
the simulation in that concept the
simulation and the creation or the or

6014
01:50:51,589 --> 01:50:51,599
simulation and the creation or the or
 

6015
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:53,109
simulation and the creation or the or
the universe are the same thing

6016
01:50:53,109 --> 01:50:53,119
the universe are the same thing
 

6017
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:56,790
the universe are the same thing
okay in other words it's a simulation

6018
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:56,800
okay in other words it's a simulation
 

6019
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,390
okay in other words it's a simulation
you know that is billions of light years

6020
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:00,400
you know that is billions of light years
 

6021
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:01,030
you know that is billions of light years
across

6022
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:01,040
across
 

6023
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:04,310
across
okay yeah um i mean there's a sense in

6024
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:04,320
okay yeah um i mean there's a sense in
 

6025
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:05,669
okay yeah um i mean there's a sense in
which it helps

6026
01:51:05,669 --> 01:51:05,679
which it helps
 

6027
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:07,990
which it helps
one understand especially if you're not

6028
01:51:07,990 --> 01:51:08,000
one understand especially if you're not
 

6029
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:08,950
one understand especially if you're not
religious

6030
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:08,960
religious
 

6031
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:10,550
religious
that there is something outside of the

6032
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:10,560
that there is something outside of the
 

6033
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,030
that there is something outside of the
world that we live in

6034
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:13,040
world that we live in
 

6035
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,470
world that we live in
that there's something bigger than the

6036
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:14,480
that there's something bigger than the
 

6037
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,310
that there's something bigger than the
world we live in um

6038
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:16,320
world we live in um
 

6039
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,589
world we live in um
and that i mean it's just another

6040
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:17,599
and that i mean it's just another
 

6041
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:19,510
and that i mean it's just another
perspective on uh

6042
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:19,520
perspective on uh
 

6043
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,270
perspective on uh
that humbles humbles you um so

6044
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:23,280
that humbles humbles you um so
 

6045
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,629
that humbles humbles you um so
in that sense it's a powerful thought

6046
01:51:24,629 --> 01:51:24,639
in that sense it's a powerful thought
 

6047
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:26,870
in that sense it's a powerful thought
experiment one shortcoming of that

6048
01:51:26,870 --> 01:51:26,880
experiment one shortcoming of that
 

6049
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:29,030
experiment one shortcoming of that
is is the following is of the of the

6050
01:51:29,030 --> 01:51:29,040
is is the following is of the of the
 

6051
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,109
is is the following is of the of the
analogy here's this

6052
01:51:31,109 --> 01:51:31,119
analogy here's this
 

6053
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:32,790
analogy here's this
that we think of a simulation as

6054
01:51:32,790 --> 01:51:32,800
that we think of a simulation as
 

6055
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:34,470
that we think of a simulation as
something take taking place

6056
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:34,480
something take taking place
 

6057
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,350
something take taking place
in the universe you know when we it's

6058
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:37,360
in the universe you know when we it's
 

6059
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:40,870
in the universe you know when we it's
it's taking place in my computer okay

6060
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:40,880
it's taking place in my computer okay
 

6061
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,950
it's taking place in my computer okay
i don't think that's the right analogy

6062
01:51:42,950 --> 01:51:42,960
i don't think that's the right analogy
 

6063
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,709
i don't think that's the right analogy
for

6064
01:51:44,709 --> 01:51:44,719
for
 

6065
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:48,390
for
um a christian view of creation okay

6066
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:48,400
um a christian view of creation okay
 

6067
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,870
um a christian view of creation okay
i don't think it's taking place in some

6068
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:50,880
i don't think it's taking place in some
 

6069
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,470
i don't think it's taking place in some
other

6070
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:52,480
other
 

6071
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,910
other
universe that god has made okay i think

6072
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:55,920
universe that god has made okay i think
 

6073
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,910
universe that god has made okay i think
maybe it's taking place in the mind of

6074
01:51:57,910 --> 01:51:57,920
maybe it's taking place in the mind of
 

6075
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,189
maybe it's taking place in the mind of
god

6076
01:51:59,189 --> 01:51:59,199
god
 

6077
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:02,070
god
christians might hypothesize also but i

6078
01:52:02,070 --> 01:52:02,080
christians might hypothesize also but i
 

6079
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,589
christians might hypothesize also but i
but i think that that

6080
01:52:03,589 --> 01:52:03,599
but i think that that
 

6081
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:05,669
but i think that that
that it's important to recognize that

6082
01:52:05,669 --> 01:52:05,679
that it's important to recognize that
 

6083
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:07,109
that it's important to recognize that
christian theology at a

6084
01:52:07,109 --> 01:52:07,119
christian theology at a
 

6085
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:10,310
christian theology at a
at any rate is that god is not one of

6086
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:10,320
at any rate is that god is not one of
 

6087
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,709
at any rate is that god is not one of
the entities in the universe and

6088
01:52:12,709 --> 01:52:12,719
the entities in the universe and
 

6089
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:15,189
the entities in the universe and
and presumably therefore is very

6090
01:52:15,189 --> 01:52:15,199
and presumably therefore is very
 

6091
01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:16,950
and presumably therefore is very
different from a simulation that we

6092
01:52:16,950 --> 01:52:16,960
different from a simulation that we
 

6093
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:19,669
different from a simulation that we
might run on a computer

6094
01:52:19,669 --> 01:52:19,679
might run on a computer
 

6095
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:22,709
might run on a computer
let me ask you adam and eve even adam

6096
01:52:22,709 --> 01:52:22,719
let me ask you adam and eve even adam
 

6097

ate of the fruit

6098
01:52:23,669 --> 01:52:23,679

01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:25,109
ate of the fruit
of the tree of knowledge of good and

6100
01:52:25,109 --> 01:52:25,119
of the tree of knowledge of good and
 

6101
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:27,589
of the tree of knowledge of good and
evil does this is this story meaningful

6102
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:27,599
evil does this is this story meaningful
 

6103
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:30,070
evil does this is this story meaningful
to you what does the story mean to you

6104
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,080
to you what does the story mean to you
 

6105
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:33,270
to you what does the story mean to you
yeah it is meaningful to me um i i take

6106
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:33,280
yeah it is meaningful to me um i i take
 

6107
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:33,669
yeah it is meaningful to me um i i take
the

6108
01:52:33,669 --> 01:52:33,679
the
 

6109
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:35,350
the
you know the writings of the bible very

6110
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:35,360
you know the writings of the bible very
 

6111
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:37,109
you know the writings of the bible very
seriously and i think that

6112
01:52:37,109 --> 01:52:37,119
seriously and i think that
 

6113
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:39,350
seriously and i think that
most christians regard them as having

6114
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:39,360
most christians regard them as having
 

6115
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,270
most christians regard them as having
some kind of authoritative

6116
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:41,280
some kind of authoritative
 

6117
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:45,270
some kind of authoritative
um role in their in their in their faith

6118
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:45,280
um role in their in their in their faith
 

6119
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:48,550
um role in their in their in their faith
um what do i get from it i mean i think

6120
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:48,560
um what do i get from it i mean i think
 

6121
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,310
um what do i get from it i mean i think
the most important thing that christians

6122
01:52:50,310 --> 01:52:50,320
the most important thing that christians
 

6123
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,629
the most important thing that christians
get from the story of adam and eve and

6124
01:52:52,629 --> 01:52:52,639
get from the story of adam and eve and
 

6125
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,709
get from the story of adam and eve and
eating the apple and so forth is that

6126
01:52:54,709 --> 01:52:54,719
eating the apple and so forth is that
 

6127
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:55,990
eating the apple and so forth is that
the relationship

6128
01:52:55,990 --> 01:52:56,000
the relationship
 

6129
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,430
the relationship
between humans and god is broken

6130
01:52:59,430 --> 01:52:59,440
between humans and god is broken
 

6131
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:03,109
between humans and god is broken
has been broken by man's disobedience

6132
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:03,119
has been broken by man's disobedience
 

6133
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:05,189
has been broken by man's disobedience
that's what the the story of adam and

6134
01:53:05,189 --> 01:53:05,199
that's what the the story of adam and
 

6135
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:07,669
that's what the the story of adam and
eve and the apple is all about

6136
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:07,679
eve and the apple is all about
 

6137
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:11,589
eve and the apple is all about
and um that that broken relationship

6138
01:53:11,589 --> 01:53:11,599
and um that that broken relationship
 

6139
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:15,430
and um that that broken relationship
is for christians what jesus came

6140
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:15,440
is for christians what jesus came
 

6141
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,470
is for christians what jesus came
to redeem came to

6142
01:53:18,470 --> 01:53:18,480
to redeem came to
 

6143
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:21,750
to redeem came to
overcome that brokenness and

6144
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:21,760
overcome that brokenness and
 

6145
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:28,790
overcome that brokenness and
restore that relationship with god

6146
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:28,800

 

6147
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,109

to some extent at any rate on earth and

6148
01:53:31,109 --> 01:53:31,119
to some extent at any rate on earth and
 

6149
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:32,870
to some extent at any rate on earth and
and ultimately

6150
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:32,880
and ultimately
 

6151
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,910
and ultimately
um you know in in the in eternity to

6152
01:53:35,910 --> 01:53:35,920
um you know in in the in eternity to
 

6153
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,109
um you know in in the in eternity to
restore it fully

6154
01:53:37,109 --> 01:53:37,119
restore it fully
 

6155
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:40,390
restore it fully
so that's really what christians mean

6156
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:40,400
so that's really what christians mean
 

6157
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:43,030
so that's really what christians mean
and gain from the story of adam and eve

6158
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,040
and gain from the story of adam and eve
 

6159
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,310
and gain from the story of adam and eve
of course lots of people

6160
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:44,320
of course lots of people
 

6161
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,709
of course lots of people
ask the questions about how so how

6162
01:53:46,709 --> 01:53:46,719
ask the questions about how so how
 

6163
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,790
ask the questions about how so how
literally should we take

6164
01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:48,800
literally should we take
 

6165
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,870
literally should we take
these stories of particularly the first

6166
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:50,880
these stories of particularly the first
 

6167
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,270
these stories of particularly the first
few few chapters of genesis which is an

6168
01:53:53,270 --> 01:53:53,280
few few chapters of genesis which is an
 

6169
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,870
few few chapters of genesis which is an
important question but

6170
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:54,880
important question but
 

6171
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:58,229
important question but
but i mean but we tend to um get bogged

6172
01:53:58,229 --> 01:53:58,239
but i mean but we tend to um get bogged
 

6173
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:00,070
but i mean but we tend to um get bogged
down with it a bit too much

6174
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:00,080
down with it a bit too much
 

6175
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,709
down with it a bit too much
i think we should take away the message

6176
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:02,719
i think we should take away the message
 

6177
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:03,830
i think we should take away the message
um

6178
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:03,840
um
 

6179
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:06,870
um
and i think the the the uh

6180
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:06,880
and i think the the the uh
 

6181
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:08,629
and i think the the the uh
what the what actually we would have

before i became a christian i read a
philosophy book whose

6304
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:42,000
philosophy book whose
 

6305
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,149
philosophy book whose
approximate title was um what you know

6306
01:56:44,149 --> 01:56:44,159
approximate title was um what you know
 

6307
01:56:44,159 --> 01:56:45,430

what is the meaning of life

what is the meaning of life
 

6309
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:48,149
what is the meaning of life
and you know that book basically said

and i think that's probably the the
 

6317
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,310
and i think that's probably the the
predominant secular view

6318
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:56,320
predominant secular view
 

6319
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,870
predominant secular view
is these days that there is no real

6320
01:56:58,870 --> 01:56:58,880
is these days that there is no real
 

6321
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,550
is these days that there is no real
meaning but you can make up a meaning

6322
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:00,560
meaning but you can make up a meaning
 

6323
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:00,870
meaning but you can make up a meaning
and

and
that will give you meaning into your
