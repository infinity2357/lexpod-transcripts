340
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
stars
 

341
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,749
stars
one of my first memory is of the moon i

342
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
one of my first memory is of the moon i
 

343
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,189
one of my first memory is of the moon i
remember watching the moon

344
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199

and the moon was just following me just
 

355
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,790
and the moon was just following me just
had no idea why that was

356
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
had no idea why that was
 

357

yeah so like looking up at the sky and
 

359
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,550
yeah so like looking up at the sky and
there's this glowing thing

there's this glowing thing
 

361
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,230
there's this glowing thing
how do you make sense of the moon that

362
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
how do you make sense of the moon that
 

363
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,230
how do you make sense of the moon that
at that age at age at like age five

364
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
at that age at age at like age five
 

365
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,830
at that age at age at like age five
there's just no way you can

366

these uh
 

377
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,550
these uh
uh almost uh out there ideas of of that

378
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
uh almost uh out there ideas of of that
 

379
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,670
uh almost uh out there ideas of of that
our earth is flat

380
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
our earth is flat
 

381
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,870
our earth is flat
uh floating about on the internet and it

382
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
uh floating about on the internet and it
 

383
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,950
uh floating about on the internet and it
made me think you know when did i first

384
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
made me think you know when did i first
 

385
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,150
made me think you know when did i first
realize that

386
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
realize that
 

387
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,909
realize that
the earth is um like this ball

388
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
the earth is um like this ball
 

389
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,749
the earth is um like this ball
that's uh flying through empty space

390
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
that's uh flying through empty space
 

391
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,230
that's uh flying through empty space
i mean it's terrifying it's uh

392
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
i mean it's terrifying it's uh
 

393

it's uh it's hard because we live in our
 

399
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,309
it's uh it's hard because we live in our
frame of reference here on this planet

400
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
frame of reference here on this planet
 

401
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,070
frame of reference here on this planet
yeah it's nearly impossible none of us

402
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
yeah it's nearly impossible none of us
 

403
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,909

i mean do you remember when you realized
understood like the physics

410
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
understood like the physics
 

411
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,270
understood like the physics
like the layout of the solar system this

412
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
like the layout of the solar system this
 

413
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,550

is it was it like
 

415
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,230
is it was it like
did you first have to take physics to

416
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
did you first have to take physics to
 

417
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,830

496
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
i just couldn't believe that honestly
 

497
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,710
i just couldn't believe that honestly
like my first thought was this is so

498
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
like my first thought was this is so
 

499
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,390
like my first thought was this is so
incredible mind-blowing

500
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:04,400
incredible mind-blowing
 

501
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,670
incredible mind-blowing
like why wouldn't anyone have told me

502
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
like why wouldn't anyone have told me
 

503
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,710
like why wouldn't anyone have told me
this existed can anyone else see this

know if
 

513
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,510
know if
maybe you can tell me if it's the same

514
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
maybe you can tell me if it's the same
 

515
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,270
maybe you can tell me if it's the same
uh i've had that with robots

516
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
uh i've had that with robots
 

517
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,350
uh i've had that with robots
uh there's a few robots i've met where i

518
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
uh there's a few robots i've met where i
 

519
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,950
uh there's a few robots i've met where i
just fell in love with this like

520
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
just fell in love with this like
 

521
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,830
just fell in love with this like
is anyone else seeing this is anyone

522
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
is anyone else seeing this is anyone
 

523
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,990
is anyone else seeing this is anyone
else seeing that

524
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
else seeing that
 

525
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,749
else seeing that
here in a robot is our ability to

526
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
here in a robot is our ability to
 

527
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,909
here in a robot is our ability to
engineer some intelligent beings

528
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
engineer some intelligent beings
 

529
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,829
engineer some intelligent beings
intelligent beings that we could love

530
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
intelligent beings that we could love
 

531
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,750
intelligent beings that we could love
that could love us that we can interact

532
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
that could love us that we can interact
 

533
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:39,990
that could love us that we can interact
with

534
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
with
 

535
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,230
with
in some rich ways that we haven't yet

536
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
in some rich ways that we haven't yet
 

537
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,430
in some rich ways that we haven't yet
discovered

538
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
discovered
 

539
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,590
discovered
like uh almost like when you get a puppy

540
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
like uh almost like when you get a puppy
 

541
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,269
like uh almost like when you get a puppy
it needs to have a dog

542
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
it needs to have a dog
 

543
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,670
it needs to have a dog
and there's this uh immediate bond and

544
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
and there's this uh immediate bond and
 

545
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,030
and there's this uh immediate bond and
love

546
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
love
 

547
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,470
love
and on top of that ability to engineer

548
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
and on top of that ability to engineer
 

549
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,190
and on top of that ability to engineer
it

550
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
it
 

551
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,670
it
it was you know i had to just pause and

552
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
it was you know i had to just pause and
 

553
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,590
it was you know i had to just pause and
and hold myself i imagine i don't have

554
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
and hold myself i imagine i don't have
 

555
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,350
and hold myself i imagine i don't have
kids i imagine there's a magic to that

556
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
kids i imagine there's a magic to that
 

557
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,070
kids i imagine there's a magic to that
as well

558
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
as well
 

559
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,150
as well
or it's a totally new experience it's

or it's a totally new experience it's
 

561
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,710
or it's a totally new experience it's
like what

562
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
like what
 

563
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,949
like what
well yeah the stars though unlike kids

564
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
well yeah the stars though unlike kids
 

565
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,350
well yeah the stars though unlike kids
or the puppy it's only a good thing

566
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360

 

567
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,150

so you felt you weren't terrified like

568
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
so you felt you weren't terrified like
 

569
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,389
so you felt you weren't terrified like
it's

570
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
it's
 

571
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,949
it's
to me when i look at the stars it's

572
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
to me when i look at the stars it's
 

573
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,350
to me when i look at the stars it's
almost paralyzingly scary

574
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
almost paralyzingly scary
 

575
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,470
almost paralyzingly scary
how little we know about the universe

576
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
how little we know about the universe
 

577
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,110
how little we know about the universe
how alone we are i mean somehow it feels

578
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
how alone we are i mean somehow it feels
 

579
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,990

matter of perspective but it feels like
 

585
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,470
matter of perspective but it feels like
wow there's billions of them out there

586
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
wow there's billions of them out there
 

587
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,670
wow there's billions of them out there
and we know nothing about them and then

588
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
and we know nothing about them and then
 

589
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,750
and we know nothing about them and then
also immediately to me somehow mortality

590
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
also immediately to me somehow mortality
 

591
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,790
also immediately to me somehow mortality
comes into it

592
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
comes into it
 

593
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,470
comes into it
i mean how did that make you feel at

that time i think as a child without
 

597
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,630
that time i think as a child without
articulating it i felt that same way

598
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
articulating it i felt that same way
 

599
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,630
articulating it i felt that same way
just like wow this is terrifying what's

what does it mean about us here uh you

604
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
what does it mean about us here uh you
 

605
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,150
what does it mean about us here uh you
you're a scientist an exo world class

606
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
you're a scientist an exo world class
 

607
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,230
you're a scientist an exo world class
scientist planetary scientist

608

astronomer uh now i'm a bit of an idiot

610
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
astronomer uh now i'm a bit of an idiot
 

611
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,350

who likes to ask silly questions so some

612
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,360
who likes to ask silly questions so some
 

613
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,949
who likes to ask silly questions so some
questions are a little bit in the realm

614
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
questions are a little bit in the realm
 

615
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,550
questions are a little bit in the realm
of speculation

616
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
of speculation
 

617
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,110
of speculation
almost philosophical because we know so

618
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
almost philosophical because we know so
 

619
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,590
almost philosophical because we know so
little

620
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
little
 

621
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,750
little
and one of the awesome things about your

622
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
and one of the awesome things about your
 

623
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,829
and one of the awesome things about your
work is you've actually put data and

624
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
work is you've actually put data and
 

625
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,590
work is you've actually put data and
real science behind some of the biggest

626
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:19,600
real science behind some of the biggest
 

627
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,350
real science behind some of the biggest
questions that we're all curious about

628
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
questions that we're all curious about
 

629
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,190
questions that we're all curious about
but nevertheless many of the questions

630
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
but nevertheless many of the questions
 

631
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,430
but nevertheless many of the questions
might be a little bit speculative

632
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440
might be a little bit speculative
 

633
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,949
might be a little bit speculative
so on that topic uh just in your sense

634
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:28,959
so on that topic uh just in your sense
 

635
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,470
so on that topic uh just in your sense
do you think

636
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:30,480
do you think
 

637
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,310
do you think
we're alone in the universe human beings

638
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
we're alone in the universe human beings
 

639
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,790
we're alone in the universe human beings
do you think there's life out there well

640
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
do you think there's life out there well
 

641
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,470
do you think there's life out there well
lex the funny thing is is that as a

lex the funny thing is is that as a
 

643
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,310

naturally yeah we naturally resist that
 

653
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,550
naturally yeah we naturally resist that
because we want numbers and hard facts

654
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
because we want numbers and hard facts

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
question it's a great question and it's
 

659
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,670
question it's a great question and it's
one we all wonder about

660
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
one we all wonder about
 

661
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,110
one we all wonder about
but i have to give you the scientist

662
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
but i have to give you the scientist
 

663
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,269
but i have to give you the scientist
answer first yeah sure which is

664
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
answer first yeah sure which is
 

665
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,870
answer first yeah sure which is
we'll have the capability to answer that

666
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
we'll have the capability to answer that
 

667
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,069
we'll have the capability to answer that
question soon even starting soon

668
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
question soon even starting soon
 

669
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,230
question soon even starting soon
how do you define soon how do i define

670
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
how do you define soon how do i define
 

671
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,829
how do you define soon how do i define
science what do you so much happen in

672
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
science what do you so much happen in
 

673
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,670
science what do you so much happen in
the last 100 years

674
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
the last 100 years
 

675
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,949
the last 100 years
right right and there's a difference

676
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
right right and there's a difference
 

677
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,949
right right and there's a difference
right if it's 10 years or 20 years or

678
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:10,959
right if it's 10 years or 20 years or
 

679
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,069
right if it's 10 years or 20 years or
100 years yeah

680
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
100 years yeah
 

681
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,030
100 years yeah
there's a difference in that well soon

682
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
there's a difference in that well soon
 

683
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,069
there's a difference in that well soon
could be a decade

684
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
could be a decade
 

685
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,470
could be a decade
or two decades and then by the way

686
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
or two decades and then by the way
 

687
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,150
or two decades and then by the way
journalists usually don't like that or

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
journalists usually don't like that or
 

689
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,069
journalists usually don't like that or
the people want like tomorrow they want

00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
which is needed for life as we know it

to look for gases that don't belong that
 

709
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,389
to look for gases that don't belong that
we might attribute to life so we have to

710
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
we might attribute to life so we have to
 

711
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,630
we might attribute to life so we have to
do some really nitty-gritty

712
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
do some really nitty-gritty
 

713
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,030
do some really nitty-gritty
astronomy so the the promising way to

714
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
astronomy so the the promising way to
 

715
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,550
astronomy so the the promising way to
answer this question

716
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
answer this question
 

717
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,030
answer this question
scientifically is to look for hints of

718
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
scientifically is to look for hints of
 

719
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,389
scientifically is to look for hints of
life that's where like many of your

720
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:52,399
life that's where like many of your
 

721
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,590
life that's where like many of your
ideas come in

722
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
ideas come in
 

723
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,590
ideas come in
of what kind of hints why might we

724
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
of what kind of hints why might we
 

725
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,030
of what kind of hints why might we
actually see about this

726
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
actually see about this
 

727
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,470
actually see about this
right right that's exactly what we need

728
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
right right that's exactly what we need
 

729
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,190
right right that's exactly what we need
to do and i like the word you chose hint

730
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
to do and i like the word you chose hint
 

731
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,710
to do and i like the word you chose hint
because it's going to be a hint it's not

732
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
because it's going to be a hint it's not
 

733
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,629
because it's going to be a hint it's not
going to be a 100 percent yay we found

734
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
going to be a 100 percent yay we found
 

735
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,350
going to be a 100 percent yay we found
it

736
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
it
 

737
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,710
it
and then it will take future generations

738
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
and then it will take future generations
 

739
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,590
and then it will take future generations
to do more careful work to hopefully

740
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
to do more careful work to hopefully
 

741
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,509
to do more careful work to hopefully
even find a way to send a probe to these

742
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
even find a way to send a probe to these
 

743
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,590
even find a way to send a probe to these
distant exoplanets

744
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
distant exoplanets
 

745
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,829
distant exoplanets
and to really figure this out for us i

746
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
and to really figure this out for us i
 

747
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,350
and to really figure this out for us i
mean we'll talk about the details

748
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
mean we'll talk about the details
 

749
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,990
mean we'll talk about the details
those are fun but like uh back to the

750
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
those are fun but like uh back to the
 

751
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,710
those are fun but like uh back to the
speculation

752
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,720
speculation
 

753
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,750
speculation
zoomed out big pictures yes

754
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760
zoomed out big pictures yes
 

755
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,910
zoomed out big pictures yes
i believe absolutely there is life out

756
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
i believe absolutely there is life out
 

757
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,590
i believe absolutely there is life out
there somewhere

758
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
there somewhere
 

759
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,990
there somewhere
because there the vastness of the

760
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
because there the vastness of the
 

761
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,629
because there the vastness of the
universe

762
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
universe
 

763
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,670
universe
is incredible it's so breathtaking when

764
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
is incredible it's so breathtaking when
 

765
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,190
is incredible it's so breathtaking when
we look at the night sky if you can go

766
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
we look at the night sky if you can go
 

767
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,150
we look at the night sky if you can go
to that dark sky

768
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
to that dark sky
 

769
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,470
to that dark sky
you can see you know many many hundred

770
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
you can see you know many many hundred
 

771
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,190
you can see you know many many hundred
or even

772
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
or even
 

773
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,230
or even
if you have good eyesight and you're

774
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
if you have good eyesight and you're
 

775
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,670
if you have good eyesight and you're
somewhere very dark you could see

776
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
somewhere very dark you could see
 

777
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,190
somewhere very dark you could see
thousands of stars

778
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
thousands of stars
 

779
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,910
thousands of stars
but in our galaxy we have hundreds of

780
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
but in our galaxy we have hundreds of
 

781
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,590
but in our galaxy we have hundreds of
billions of stars

782
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
billions of stars
 

783
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,190
billions of stars
and our universe has hundreds of

784
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
and our universe has hundreds of
 

785
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,590
and our universe has hundreds of
billions of galaxies

786
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
billions of galaxies
 

787
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,190
billions of galaxies
so think about all those stars out there

788
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
so think about all those stars out there
 

789
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,590
so think about all those stars out there
and even if planets are rare even if

790
00:12:59,590 --> 00:12:59,600
and even if planets are rare even if
 

791
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,710
and even if planets are rare even if
life is rare

792
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
life is rare
 

793
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,550
life is rare
just because the number of stars is so

794
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
just because the number of stars is so
 

795
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,069
just because the number of stars is so
huge

796
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
huge
 

797
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,670
huge
things have to come together somewhere

798
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
things have to come together somewhere
 

799
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,350
things have to come together somewhere
someplace in our universe yeah it's so

800
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
someplace in our universe yeah it's so
 

801
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,030
someplace in our universe yeah it's so
amazing to think that somebody might be

802
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
amazing to think that somebody might be
 

803
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,030
amazing to think that somebody might be
looking up on another

804
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
looking up on another
 

805
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,710
looking up on another
planet in a distant galaxy

806
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720

 

807
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,430

and get back to in our lifetime at least

808
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
and get back to in our lifetime at least
 

809
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,629
and get back to in our lifetime at least
the short term

810
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
the short term
 

811
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,949
the short term
we have to we only have the nearest

812
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
we have to we only have the nearest
 

813
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,750
we have to we only have the nearest
stars

814
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
stars
 

815
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,910
stars
to look at it's true that there are so

816
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
to look at it's true that there are so
 

817
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,110
to look at it's true that there are so
many stars

818
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
many stars
 

819
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,790
many stars
so many hosts for planets that might

820
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
so many hosts for planets that might
 

821
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,509
so many hosts for planets that might
have life but in the practical

822
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
have life but in the practical
 

823
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,990
have life but in the practical
question of will we find it it has to be

824
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
question of will we find it it has to be
 

825
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,870
question of will we find it it has to be
a star

826
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
a star
 

827
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,190
a star
quite close to earth like a few light

828
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
quite close to earth like a few light
 

829
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,030
quite close to earth like a few light
years tens of light years maybe hundreds

830
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
years tens of light years maybe hundreds
 

831
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,829
years tens of light years maybe hundreds
of light years

832
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
of light years
 

833
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,750
of light years
and by the way you've introduced me to a

834
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
and by the way you've introduced me to a
 

835
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,030
and by the way you've introduced me to a
tool of

836
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
tool of
 

837
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,069
tool of
eyes on exoplanets i think

838
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
eyes on exoplanets i think
 

839
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,389
eyes on exoplanets i think
that nasa has put together isolated

840
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
that nasa has put together isolated
 

841
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,509
that nasa has put together isolated
clinics that's it

842
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
clinics that's it
 

843
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,670
clinics that's it
software you guys that's so cool uh but

844
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
software you guys that's so cool uh but
 

845
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,949
software you guys that's so cool uh but
anyway uh

846
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
anyway uh
 

847
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,509
anyway uh
can you give a sense of like who our

848
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
can you give a sense of like who our
 

849
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,310
can you give a sense of like who our
neighbors are

850
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
neighbors are
 

851
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,750
neighbors are
like you said uh hundreds of light years

852
00:13:59,750 --> 00:13:59,760
like you said uh hundreds of light years
 

853
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,790
like you said uh hundreds of light years
like how many stars are close by

854
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
like how many stars are close by
 

855
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,189
like how many stars are close by
at like what what's our neighborhood

856
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
at like what what's our neighborhood
 

857
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,389
at like what what's our neighborhood
like we're talking about

858
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
like we're talking about
 

859
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,509
like we're talking about
five ten stars that we might actually

860
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
five ten stars that we might actually
 

861
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,790
five ten stars that we might actually
have a chance

862
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
have a chance
 

863
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,150
have a chance
to zoom in on i'm talking about maybe a

864
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,160
to zoom in on i'm talking about maybe a
 

865
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,509
to zoom in on i'm talking about maybe a
dozen or two dozen

866
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
dozen or two dozen
 

867
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,389
dozen or two dozen
stars and those are that's with planets

868
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
stars and those are that's with planets
 

869
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,310
stars and those are that's with planets
that look

870
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:20,320
that look
 

871
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,790
that look
suitable for us to follow up in detail

872
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
suitable for us to follow up in detail
 

873
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,430
suitable for us to follow up in detail
for life

874
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
for life
 

875
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,389
for life
right one thing that's really exciting

876
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
right one thing that's really exciting
 

877
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,590
right one thing that's really exciting
in this field is that

878
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
in this field is that
 

879
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,150
in this field is that
the very nearest star to earth called

880
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
the very nearest star to earth called
 

881
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,829
the very nearest star to earth called
proxima centauri

882
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:31,839
proxima centauri
 

883
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,670
proxima centauri
it's part of the alpha centauri star

884
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
it's part of the alpha centauri star
 

885
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,030
it's part of the alpha centauri star
system cool name by the way yeah

886
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
system cool name by the way yeah
 

887
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,389
system cool name by the way yeah
approximately whoever names them

888
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
approximately whoever names them
 

889
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,310
approximately whoever names them
nearby okay but it sounds cool proxima

890
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
nearby okay but it sounds cool proxima
 

891
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,949
nearby okay but it sounds cool proxima
proxima centauri appears to have a

892
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
proxima centauri appears to have a
 

893
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,629
proxima centauri appears to have a
planet around it that's an earth map

894
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:44,639
planet around it that's an earth map
 

895
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,710
planet around it that's an earth map
about an earth mass planet

896
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
about an earth mass planet
 

897
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,710
about an earth mass planet
in the so-called habitable zone or the

898
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
in the so-called habitable zone or the
 

899
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,790
in the so-called habitable zone or the
goldilocks zone of the host star

900
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
goldilocks zone of the host star
 

901
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,310
goldilocks zone of the host star
so think about how incredible that is

902
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
so think about how incredible that is
 

903
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,470
so think about how incredible that is
like out of all the stars out there even

904
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
like out of all the stars out there even
 

905
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,910
like out of all the stars out there even
the very nearest star

906
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:55,920
the very nearest star
 

907
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,829
the very nearest star
has planets and has a planet of huge

908
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
has planets and has a planet of huge
 

909
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,350
has planets and has a planet of huge
interest to us

910
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
interest to us
 

911
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,189
interest to us
yeah okay so can we talk about that

912
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
yeah okay so can we talk about that
 

913
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,269
yeah okay so can we talk about that
planet what uh

914
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:03,279
planet what uh
 

915
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,790
planet what uh
uh what what does it mean to be maybe

916
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
uh what what does it mean to be maybe
 

917
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,310
uh what what does it mean to be maybe
possibly habitable habitable uh

918
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:10,320
possibly habitable habitable uh
 

919
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,430
possibly habitable habitable uh
you know what uh what is how does size

920
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:13,440
you know what uh what is how does size
 

921
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,790
you know what uh what is how does size
come into play

922
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:14,800
come into play
 

923
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,189
come into play
how does um you know what we know about

924
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
how does um you know what we know about
 

925
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,949
how does um you know what we know about
gases and what kind of things are

926
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
gases and what kind of things are
 

927
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,629
gases and what kind of things are
necessary for life

928
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
necessary for life
 

929
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,310
necessary for life
you know what are the factors that you

930
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
you know what are the factors that you
 

931
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,550
you know what are the factors that you
make you think that it's habitable

932
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
make you think that it's habitable
 

933
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,550
make you think that it's habitable
and by the way i mean maybe one way to

934
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
and by the way i mean maybe one way to
 

935
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,910
and by the way i mean maybe one way to
talk about that is

936
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
talk about that is
 

937
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,710
talk about that is
people know about the drake equation

938
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
people know about the drake equation
 

939
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,710
people know about the drake equation
which is

940
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:34,720
which is
 

941
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,430
which is
a very high level almost framework to

942
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
a very high level almost framework to
 

943
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,310
a very high level almost framework to
think about what is the probability that

944
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
think about what is the probability that
 

945
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,670
think about what is the probability that
correct me if i'm wrong that there's

946
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
correct me if i'm wrong that there's
 

947
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,749
correct me if i'm wrong that there's
life out there uh

948
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
life out there uh
 

949
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,389
life out there uh
and intelligent life i think i don't

950
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
and intelligent life i think i don't
 

951
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:46,870
and intelligent life i think i don't
know

952
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
know
 

953
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,430
know
but then the equation named after you

954
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
but then the equation named after you
 

955
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,189
but then the equation named after you
now

956
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
now
 

957
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,150
now
which i think nicely focuses in on the

958
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
which i think nicely focuses in on the
 

959
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,110
which i think nicely focuses in on the
more

960
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
more
 

961
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,150
more
achievable and interesting uh part of

962
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
achievable and interesting uh part of
 

963
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,629
achievable and interesting uh part of
that

964
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:58,639
that
 

965
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,870
that
question which is on whether there is

966
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
question which is on whether there is
 

967
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,749
question which is on whether there is
habitable

968
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
habitable
 

969
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,470
habitable
planets out there or how many i guess

970
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
planets out there or how many i guess
 

971
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,670
planets out there or how many i guess
right

972
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
right
 

973
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,990
right
so the funny thing is was one time i met

974
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
so the funny thing is was one time i met
 

975
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,269
so the funny thing is was one time i met
frank drake

976
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
frank drake
 

977
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,350
frank drake
and i asked if he minded if i took his

978
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
and i asked if he minded if i took his
 

979
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,430
and i asked if he minded if i took his
equation and kind of

980
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
equation and kind of
 

981
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,509
equation and kind of
revamped it for this new field of

982
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
revamped it for this new field of
 

983
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,110
revamped it for this new field of
exoplanet astronomy

984
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
exoplanet astronomy
 

985
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,670
exoplanet astronomy
he was totally cool with it he's he got

986
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
he was totally cool with it he's he got
 

987
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,509
he was totally cool with it he's he got
total approval well maybe uh

988
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
total approval well maybe uh
 

989
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,949
total approval well maybe uh
okay so i'm not sure if he'd actually

990
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
okay so i'm not sure if he'd actually
 

991
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,189
okay so i'm not sure if he'd actually
read the stuff about my equation but he

992
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:25,199
read the stuff about my equation but he
 

993
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,310
read the stuff about my equation but he
was cool with it he was

994
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
was cool with it he was
 

995
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,189
was cool with it he was
cool with it uh okay so i just said like

996
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
cool with it uh okay so i just said like
 

997
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,629
cool with it uh okay so i just said like
15 different things but

998
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
15 different things but
 

999
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,670
15 different things but
maybe can you tell from your perspective

1000
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
maybe can you tell from your perspective
 

1001
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,189
maybe can you tell from your perspective
what is the drake equation

1002
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
what is the drake equation
 

1003
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,749
what is the drake equation
and what is sorry the seeger equation

1004
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
and what is sorry the seeger equation
 

1005
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,749
and what is sorry the seeger equation
sure well the drake equation as you said

1006
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
sure well the drake equation as you said
 

1007
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,509
sure well the drake equation as you said
it's a framework

1008
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
it's a framework
 

1009
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,550
it's a framework
it's a description of the number of

1010
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
it's a description of the number of
 

1011
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,629
it's a description of the number of
civilizations out there

1012
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
civilizations out there
 

1013
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,910

so if you think of like if you think of

1018
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
so if you think of like if you think of
 

1019
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,910
so if you think of like if you think of
the movie contact you've seen contact

1020
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
the movie contact you've seen contact
 

1021
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,790
the movie contact you've seen contact
right

1022
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
right
 

1023
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,629
right
we're hoping to get we're listening in

1024
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
we're hoping to get we're listening in
 

1025
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,829
we're hoping to get we're listening in
actually it's an active field of

1026
00:16:59,829 --> 00:16:59,839
actually it's an active field of
 

1027
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,389
actually it's an active field of
research

1028

a message and the drake equation

1036
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
a message and the drake equation
 

1037
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,470
a message and the drake equation
came like at the start of that whole

1038
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
came like at the start of that whole
 

1039
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,590
came like at the start of that whole
field to put the factors down on paper

field to put the factors down on paper
 

1041
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,309
field to put the factors down on paper
to sort of illustrate what is involved

1042
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
to sort of illustrate what is involved
 

1043
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,230
to sort of illustrate what is involved
to kind of estimating and there's no

1044
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
to kind of estimating and there's no
 

1045
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,829
to kind of estimating and there's no
real estimate or a prediction of how

many civilizations are out there

1048
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:21,360
many civilizations are out there
 

1049
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,870
many civilizations are out there
but it's a way to frame the question and

1050
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
but it's a way to frame the question and
 

1051
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,510
but it's a way to frame the question and
show you each term that's involved

1052
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
show you each term that's involved
 

1053
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,829
show you each term that's involved
so i took the drake equation and i

1054
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
so i took the drake equation and i
 

1055
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,990
so i took the drake equation and i
called it a revised drake equation

1056
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
called it a revised drake equation
 

1057
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,270
called it a revised drake equation
and i recast it for the search for

1058
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
and i recast it for the search for
 

1059
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,630
and i recast it for the search for
planets by more traditional astronomy

1061
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,669
planets by more traditional astronomy
means

1062
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:37,679
means

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,190
what you get
so yeah so okay so what are what are

1112
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
so yeah so okay so what are what are
 

1113
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,270
so yeah so okay so what are what are
i mean what are the variables but maybe

1114
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
i mean what are the variables but maybe
 

1115
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,950
i mean what are the variables but maybe
also what are like the critical

1116
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
also what are like the critical
 

1117
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,549
also what are like the critical
variables so in my equation i set out to

1118
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:28,559
variables so in my equation i set out to
 

1119
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,909
variables so in my equation i set out to
what are the numbers of

1120
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
what are the numbers of
 

1121
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,750
what are the numbers of
inhabited planets that show signs of

1122
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760
inhabited planets that show signs of
 

1123
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,590
inhabited planets that show signs of
life by way of gases in the atmosphere

1124
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:35,600
life by way of gases in the atmosphere
 

1125
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,350
life by way of gases in the atmosphere
that can be attributed to life

1126
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:37,360
that can be attributed to life
 

1127
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,549
that can be attributed to life
i could just walk through the terms

1128
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:38,559
i could just walk through the terms
 

1129
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,549
i could just walk through the terms
that's super simple the first thing i

1130
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:40,559
that's super simple the first thing i
 

1131
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,070
that's super simple the first thing i
say is what are the number of stars

1132
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,080
say is what are the number of stars
 

1133
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,270
say is what are the number of stars
available and it's not that

1134
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
available and it's not that
 

1135
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,950
available and it's not that
those trillions and trillions of stars

1136
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
those trillions and trillions of stars
 

1137
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,630
those trillions and trillions of stars
everywhere it's what are available to

1138
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
everywhere it's what are available to
 

1139
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,710
everywhere it's what are available to
like a specific search

1140
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
like a specific search
 

1141
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,230
like a specific search
and so for example the mit led nasa

1142
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,230
is surveying the sky looking for all
kinds of planets but it can also

1148
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
kinds of planets but it can also
 

1149
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,870
kinds of planets but it can also
it also has stars it has about 30 000

1150
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
it also has stars it has about 30 000
 

1151
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,549
it also has stars it has about 30 000
red dwarf stars

1152
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
red dwarf stars
 

1153
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,029
red dwarf stars
so we just take a number of stars that a

1154
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
so we just take a number of stars that a
 

1155
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,630
so we just take a number of stars that a
given survey can access

1156
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
given survey can access
 

1157
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,870
given survey can access
so that's what the number of stars is

1158
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:10,880
so that's what the number of stars is
 

1159
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,029
so that's what the number of stars is
then i wanted to know what kind of stars

1160
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
then i wanted to know what kind of stars
 

1161
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,909
then i wanted to know what kind of stars
are

1162
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
are
 

1163
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,029
are
uh quiet a quiet i called it

1164
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
uh quiet a quiet i called it
 

1165
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,950
uh quiet a quiet i called it
a fraction of those stars that is quiet

1166
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
a fraction of those stars that is quiet
 

1167
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,710
a fraction of those stars that is quiet
in the case of tess the way it's looking

1168
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
in the case of tess the way it's looking
 

1169
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,909
in the case of tess the way it's looking
for planets

1170
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:21,919
for planets
 

1171
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,909
for planets
is planets that transit the star they go

1172
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:23,919
is planets that transit the star they go
 

1173
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,350
is planets that transit the star they go
in front of the star as seen from the

1174
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,360
in front of the star as seen from the
 

1175
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,630
in front of the star as seen from the
telescope

1176
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
telescope
 

1177
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,990
telescope
but it turns out that some stars are

1178
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
but it turns out that some stars are
 

1179
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,669
but it turns out that some stars are
very active they're variable

1180
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
very active they're variable
 

1181
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,830
very active they're variable
and they brighten and dim with time and

1182
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
and they brighten and dim with time and
 

1183
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,070
and they brighten and dim with time and
that interferes with our observation

1184
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
that interferes with our observation
 

1185
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,669
that interferes with our observation
i apologize to interrupt so it's a

1186
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
i apologize to interrupt so it's a
 

1187
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,590
i apologize to interrupt so it's a
transiting planet so you're

1188
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
transiting planet so you're
 

1189
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,510
transiting planet so you're
really looking for a black blob

1190
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
really looking for a black blob
 

1191
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,830
really looking for a black blob
essentially that blocks the light

1192
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:41,840
essentially that blocks the light
 

1193
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,510
essentially that blocks the light
we're looking for a black blob that

1194
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
we're looking for a black blob that
 

1195
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,190
we're looking for a black blob that
blocks light and then trying to say

1196
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
blocks light and then trying to say
 

1197
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,430
blocks light and then trying to say
something about the size of the planet

1198
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
something about the size of the planet
 

1199
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,310
something about the size of the planet
uh from the frequency of that black

1200
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
uh from the frequency of that black
 

1201
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,150
uh from the frequency of that black
blobs appearance and the size of that

1202
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
blobs appearance and the size of that
 

1203
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,830
blobs appearance and the size of that
black blob that kind of thing yeah but

1204
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
black blob that kind of thing yeah but
 

1205
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,950
black blob that kind of thing yeah but
let's just say that

1206
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:54,960
let's just say that
 

1207
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,470
let's just say that
out of all the stars there are

1208
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
out of all the stars there are
 

1209
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,470
out of all the stars there are
accessible to whatever telescope some of

1210
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
accessible to whatever telescope some of
 

1211
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,430
accessible to whatever telescope some of
them are just bad

1212
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
them are just bad
 

1213
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,789
them are just bad
for whatever reason you're not gonna be

1214
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
for whatever reason you're not gonna be
 

1215
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,630
for whatever reason you're not gonna be
able to find planets around them so i

1216
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:02,640
able to find planets around them so i
 

1217
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,310
able to find planets around them so i
need to know the fraction

1218
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
need to know the fraction
 

1219
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,310
need to know the fraction
of those that are that are good so again

1220
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,320
of those that are that are good so again
 

1221
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,070
of those that are that are good so again
we have the number of stars the fraction

1222
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
we have the number of stars the fraction
 

1223
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,110
we have the number of stars the fraction
of them that we can actually find

1224
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
of them that we can actually find
 

1225
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,630
of them that we can actually find
planets around

1226
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
planets around
 

1227
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,190
planets around
um and by the way is our sun set one

1228
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
um and by the way is our sun set one
 

1229
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,630
um and by the way is our sun set one
such

1230
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:14,640
such
 

1231
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,190
such
is is our sun quiet our sun is quiet

1232
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
is is our sun quiet our sun is quiet
 

1233
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,230
is is our sun quiet our sun is quiet
okay

1234
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
okay
 

1235
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,310
okay
so i have actually two terms one

1236
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,320
so i have actually two terms one
 

1237
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,870
so i have actually two terms one
describes how quiet they are and one is

1238
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
describes how quiet they are and one is
 

1239
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,350
describes how quiet they are and one is
if we can find a planet around that star

1240
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,360
if we can find a planet around that star
 

1241
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,590
if we can find a planet around that star
these transiting planets for example

1242
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
these transiting planets for example
 

1243
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,750
these transiting planets for example
not all planets transit because the

1244
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
not all planets transit because the
 

1245
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,110
not all planets transit because the
planet would have to be orbiting that

1246
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
planet would have to be orbiting that
 

1247
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,669
planet would have to be orbiting that
star

1248
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:31,679
star
 

1249
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,070
star
in this kind of plane as viewed from you

1250
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080
in this kind of plane as viewed from you
 

1251
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,070
in this kind of plane as viewed from you
but if a star is for example orbiting in

1252
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080
but if a star is for example orbiting in
 

1253
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,430
but if a star is for example orbiting in
the plane of the sky it will never

1254
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:39,440
the plane of the sky it will never
 

1255
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,149
the plane of the sky it will never
transit

1256
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
transit
 

1257
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,789
transit
it will never go in front of the star so

1258
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799
it will never go in front of the star so
 

1259
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,390
it will never go in front of the star so
in that case we have to have a fraction

1260
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
in that case we have to have a fraction
 

1261
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:44,789
in that case we have to have a fraction
that

1262
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:44,799
that
 

1263
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,950
that
takes into account that kind of

1264
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:46,960
takes into account that kind of
 

1265
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,990
takes into account that kind of
geometric

1266
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,000
geometric
 

1267
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,310
geometric
factor and hopefully it's right i mean

1268
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
factor and hopefully it's right i mean
 

1269
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,830
factor and hopefully it's right i mean
you can assume that it's uniformly

1270
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
you can assume that it's uniformly
 

1271
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,590
you can assume that it's uniformly
distributed hopefully yes we can assume

1272
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
distributed hopefully yes we can assume
 

1273
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,110
distributed hopefully yes we can assume
and there's evidence that it's uniformly

1274
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
and there's evidence that it's uniformly
 

1275
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,789
and there's evidence that it's uniformly
distributed yes

1276
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
distributed yes
 

1277
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,950
distributed yes
so then the next so all of these factors

1278
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
so then the next so all of these factors
 

1279
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,909
so then the next so all of these factors
so far

1280
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
so far

those are all things we can measure and

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
those are all things we can measure and
 

1295
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,029
those are all things we can measure and
there's one more term in the seeger

1296
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
there's one more term in the seeger
 

1297
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,789
there's one more term in the seeger

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,230
i call it fraction of planets in the

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
certain set of stars we know from our
 

1309
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,789
certain set of stars we know from our
the kepler space telescope that operated

1310
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
the kepler space telescope that operated
 

1311
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,230
the kepler space telescope that operated
for a number of years

1312
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
for a number of years
 

1313
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,909
for a number of years
we have estimates for how many planets

1314
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:29,919
we have estimates for how many planets
 

1315
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,270
we have estimates for how many planets
are in the so-called habitable zone of

1316
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,280
are in the so-called habitable zone of
 

1317
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,190
are in the so-called habitable zone of
the host star for a certain type of star

1318
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
the host star for a certain type of star
 

1319
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,270
the host star for a certain type of star
so all those we have measurable and then

1320
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:35,280
so all those we have measurable and then
 

1321
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,710
so all those we have measurable and then
like the drake equation itself there are

1322
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
like the drake equation itself there are
 

1323
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,909
like the drake equation itself there are
some terms we can

1324
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:37,919
some terms we can
 

1325
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,630
some terms we can
not measure and those ones i call them

1326
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
not measure and those ones i call them
 

1327
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,510
not measure and those ones i call them
fl

1328
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
fl
 

1329
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,909
fl
fraction of all those planets that have

1330
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
fraction of all those planets that have
 

1331
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,070
fraction of all those planets that have
life on them

1332
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,080
life on them
 

1333
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,430
life on them
because we don't know what that is and

1334
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440
because we don't know what that is and
 

1335
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,710
because we don't know what that is and
fs i called for spectroscopy

1336
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
fs i called for spectroscopy
 

1337
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,909
fs i called for spectroscopy
the fraction that have we can use our

1338
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
the fraction that have we can use our
 

1339
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,029
the fraction that have we can use our
telescope and instrument tools to

1340
00:21:57,029 --> 00:21:57,039
telescope and instrument tools to
 

1341
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,029
telescope and instrument tools to
look for light actually fs was the ones

1342
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
look for light actually fs was the ones
 

1343
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,710
look for light actually fs was the ones
that the planets that

1344
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
that the planets that
 

1345
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,950
that the planets that
that have life that actually gives off a

1346
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:02,960
that have life that actually gives off a
 

1347
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,190
that have life that actually gives off a
gas a useful gas that might accumulate

1348
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
gas a useful gas that might accumulate
 

1349
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,549
gas a useful gas that might accumulate
in the atmosphere

1350
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
in the atmosphere
 

1351
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,990
in the atmosphere
so we could eventually observe it uh

1352
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
so we could eventually observe it uh
 

1353
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,789
so we could eventually observe it uh
how do the fl and fs interplay so these

1354
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
how do the fl and fs interplay so these
 

1355
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,909
how do the fl and fs interplay so these
are separate terms

1356
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
are separate terms
 

1357
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,830
are separate terms
separate terms and so so for example

1358
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
separate terms and so so for example
 

1359
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,390
separate terms and so so for example
you could imagine so for example you

1360
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
you could imagine so for example you
 

1361
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,390
you could imagine so for example you
could imagine life

1362
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
could imagine life
 

1363
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,830
could imagine life
like us humans we breathe out carbon

1364
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
like us humans we breathe out carbon
 

1365
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,390
like us humans we breathe out carbon
dioxide

1366
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
dioxide
 

1367
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,990
dioxide
but our planet earth we already have a

1368
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
but our planet earth we already have a
 

1369
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,590
but our planet earth we already have a
lot of carbon dioxide on it

1370
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
lot of carbon dioxide on it
 

1371
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,950
lot of carbon dioxide on it
well we have hundreds of parts per

1372
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
well we have hundreds of parts per
 

1373
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,390
well we have hundreds of parts per
million but it has a really strong

1374
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
million but it has a really strong
 

1375
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,350
million but it has a really strong
signal

1376
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
signal
 

1377
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,870
signal
so us humans breathing out carbon

1378
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
so us humans breathing out carbon
 

1379
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,630
so us humans breathing out carbon
dioxide it's not helpful for any

1380
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
dioxide it's not helpful for any
 

1381
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,149
dioxide it's not helpful for any
intelligent beings that are looking back

1382
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:38,159
intelligent beings that are looking back
 

1383
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:38,870
intelligent beings that are looking back
at earth

1384
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
at earth
 

1385
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,310
at earth
because there's already a lot of there's

1386
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
because there's already a lot of there's
 

1387
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,750
because there's already a lot of there's
already enough carbon dioxide we're not

1388
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
already enough carbon dioxide we're not
 

1389
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,789
already enough carbon dioxide we're not
adding to it

1390
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
adding to it
 

1391
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,270
adding to it
so if there is life on a planet and it's

1392
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
so if there is life on a planet and it's
 

1393
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,950
so if there is life on a planet and it's
outputting a boring gas that's not

1394
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:46,960
outputting a boring gas that's not
 

1395
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,870
outputting a boring gas that's not
helpful for us to uniquely

1396
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:48,880
helpful for us to uniquely
 

1397
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,549
helpful for us to uniquely
identify as being made by life versus

1398
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
identify as being made by life versus
 

1399
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,070
identify as being made by life versus
just being there anyway

1400
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
just being there anyway
 

1401
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,830
just being there anyway
then it's not helpful so i separated

1402
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:55,840
then it's not helpful so i separated
 

1403
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,669
then it's not helpful so i separated
those two terms out

1404
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679
those two terms out
 

1405
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,310
those two terms out
soon i think we'll have evidence that

1406
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
soon i think we'll have evidence that
 

1407
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,909
soon i think we'll have evidence that
planets that can support life

1408
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
planets that can support life
 

1409
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,909
planets that can support life
at least are common so

1410
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
at least are common so
 

1411
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,990
at least are common so
okay this is such an awesome topic i

1412
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
okay this is such an awesome topic i
 

1413
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,789
okay this is such an awesome topic i
have a million questions uh

1414
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:10,799
have a million questions uh
 

1415
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,710
have a million questions uh
what okay i know it's a little bit of

1416
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
what okay i know it's a little bit of
 

1417
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,789
what okay i know it's a little bit of
speculation but what's your sense about

1418
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
speculation but what's your sense about
 

1419
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,190
speculation but what's your sense about
that

1420
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
that
 

1421
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,789
that
uh i think fs which is like

1422
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
uh i think fs which is like
 

1423
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,070
uh i think fs which is like
that uh life would produce

1424
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,080
that uh life would produce
 

1425
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,909
that uh life would produce
interesting gases that would be able to

1426
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919
interesting gases that would be able to
 

1427
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,230
interesting gases that would be able to
detect like is there

1428
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,240
detect like is there
 

1429
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,870
detect like is there
one is there scientific evidence and and

1430
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:28,880
one is there scientific evidence and and
 

1431
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,590
one is there scientific evidence and and
second is there some intuition around

1432
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
second is there some intuition around
 

1433
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,630
second is there some intuition around
life producing gases detectable hints in

1434
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,640
life producing gases detectable hints in
 

1435
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,350
life producing gases detectable hints in
terms of

1436
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
terms of
 

1437
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,070
terms of
chemistry so interestingly enough that

1438
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,080
chemistry so interestingly enough that
 

1439
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,390
chemistry so interestingly enough that
entire question

1440
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
entire question
 

1441
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,630
entire question
relates to i'm gonna say almost my

1442
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640
relates to i'm gonna say almost my
 

1443
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,310
relates to i'm gonna say almost my
life's work yeah the work i'm doing now

1444
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:44,320
life's work yeah the work i'm doing now
 

1445
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,830
life's work yeah the work i'm doing now
and the work i'm doing for the next 20

1446
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
and the work i'm doing for the next 20
 

1447
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,149
and the work i'm doing for the next 20
years

1448
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,159
years
 

1449
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,430
years
and i wish i could give you a concrete

1450
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:47,440
and i wish i could give you a concrete
 

1451
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,430
and i wish i could give you a concrete
number like one percent like on

1452
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,440
number like one percent like on
 

1453
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,110
number like one percent like on
the worst days it's one percent let's

1454
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,120
the worst days it's one percent let's
 

1455
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,549
the worst days it's one percent let's
say in my mind

1456
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
say in my mind
 

1457
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,310
say in my mind
you know in the best days it's like 80

1458
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:54,320
you know in the best days it's like 80
 

1459
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,990
you know in the best days it's like 80
and i could actually go into

1460
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,000
and i could actually go into
 

1461
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,590
and i could actually go into
a lot of detail here but i'll just give

1462
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
a lot of detail here but i'll just give
 

1463
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,750
a lot of detail here but i'll just give
you the simplest things

1464
00:23:59,750 --> 00:23:59,760
you the simplest things
 

1465
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,990
you the simplest things
so first of all we make an assumption

1466
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
so first of all we make an assumption
 

1467
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,669
so first of all we make an assumption
that like us

1468
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:03,679
that like us
 

1469
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,149
that like us
and our life here on earth life uses

1470
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:06,159
and our life here on earth life uses
 

1471
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,510
and our life here on earth life uses
chemistry

1472
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:07,520
chemistry
 

1473
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,350
chemistry
so we use chemistry because we eat food

1474
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,360
so we use chemistry because we eat food
 

1475
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,510
so we use chemistry because we eat food
we breathe air and we have metabolism

1476
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
we breathe air and we have metabolism
 

1477
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,549
we breathe air and we have metabolism
that

1478
00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
that
 

1479
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,350
that
to break down food to get energy to

1480
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
to break down food to get energy to
 

1481
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,549
to break down food to get energy to
store energy

1482
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
store energy
 

1483
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,950
store energy
and then ultimately to use it and all

1484
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:18,960
and then ultimately to use it and all
 

1485
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,870
and then ultimately to use it and all
life here has some kind of byproduct in

1486
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
life here has some kind of byproduct in
 

1487
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,149
life here has some kind of byproduct in
doing all that some kind of waste

1488
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:22,159
doing all that some kind of waste
 

1489
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,230
doing all that some kind of waste
product that goes into the atmosphere

1490
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,240
product that goes into the atmosphere
 

1491
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,269
product that goes into the atmosphere
so i like to think that life everywhere

1492
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
so i like to think that life everywhere
 

1493
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,470
so i like to think that life everywhere
uses chemistry

1494
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
uses chemistry
 

1495
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,029
uses chemistry
some people have imagined like uh let's

1496
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
some people have imagined like uh let's
 

1497
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:31,990
some people have imagined like uh let's
imagine like a windmill

1498
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,000
imagine like a windmill
 

1499
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,630
imagine like a windmill
like mechanical energy just getting

1500
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
like mechanical energy just getting
 

1501
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,870
like mechanical energy just getting
energy and using it without storing it

1502
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
energy and using it without storing it
 

1503
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,310
energy and using it without storing it
and if there was life like that it might

1504
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
and if there was life like that it might
 

1505
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,630
and if there was life like that it might
not need to output a gas

1506
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,640
not need to output a gas
 

1507
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,070
not need to output a gas
so we make this basic assumption of

1508
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
so we make this basic assumption of
 

1509
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,830
so we make this basic assumption of
chemistry that's the first thing

1510
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:43,840
chemistry that's the first thing
 

1511
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,830
chemistry that's the first thing
the second more complicated thing that i

1512
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:45,840
the second more complicated thing that i
 

1513
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,510
the second more complicated thing that i
and my team work on is what happens to

1514
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
and my team work on is what happens to
 

1515
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,789
and my team work on is what happens to
the gas once it is

1516
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:48,799
the gas once it is
 

1517
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,549
the gas once it is
produced by life it goes into the

1518
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:50,559
produced by life it goes into the
 

1519
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,870
produced by life it goes into the
atmosphere and a lot of gas

1520
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:52,880
atmosphere and a lot of gas
 

1521
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,590
atmosphere and a lot of gas
is just destroyed immediately actually

1522
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
is just destroyed immediately actually
 

1523
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:55,990
is just destroyed immediately actually
by

1524
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,000
by
 

1525
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,110
by
ultraviolet radiation or by oxygen

1526
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
ultraviolet radiation or by oxygen
 

1527
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,430
ultraviolet radiation or by oxygen
oxygen's incredibly

1528
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
oxygen's incredibly
 

1529
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,750
oxygen's incredibly
um destructive to a lot of gases so the

1530
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
um destructive to a lot of gases so the
 

1531
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,549
um destructive to a lot of gases so the
gas can

1532
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,559
gas can
 

1533
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,070
gas can
be produced by life but it could be just

1534
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
be produced by life but it could be just
 

1535
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,470
be produced by life but it could be just
completely destroyed by its environment

1536
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:08,480
completely destroyed by its environment
 

1537
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,510
completely destroyed by its environment
i guess we should pause on that that

1538
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
i guess we should pause on that that
 

1539
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,590
i guess we should pause on that that
you mentioned your life's work i mean

1540
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
you mentioned your life's work i mean
 

1541
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,390
you mentioned your life's work i mean
this is just a beautiful idea

1542
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,400
this is just a beautiful idea
 

1543
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,390
this is just a beautiful idea
that uh it's kind of paralyzing when you

1544
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:18,400
that uh it's kind of paralyzing when you
 

1545
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,149
that uh it's kind of paralyzing when you
look out there and you wonder is there a

1546
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
look out there and you wonder is there a
 

1547
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,750
look out there and you wonder is there a
life out there

1548
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
life out there
 

1549
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,310
life out there
a b is it's the first paralyzing

1550
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:24,320
a b is it's the first paralyzing
 

1551
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,750
a b is it's the first paralyzing
actually before i encountered your work

1552
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:25,760
actually before i encountered your work
 

1553
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,029
actually before i encountered your work
i feel like an idiot

1554
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
i feel like an idiot
 

1555
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,549
i feel like an idiot
but you know uh it feels like there's no

1556
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
but you know uh it feels like there's no
 

1557
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,630
but you know uh it feels like there's no
tool to answer that question

1558
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
tool to answer that question
 

1559
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,750
tool to answer that question
and then what you kind of provided

1560
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:35,760
and then what you kind of provided
 

1561
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,190
and then what you kind of provided
is this cool idea that it might be

1562
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,200
is this cool idea that it might be
 

1563
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,630
is this cool idea that it might be
possible to answer that by looking at

1564
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
possible to answer that by looking at
 

1565
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,390
possible to answer that by looking at
the gases i mean that's a really

1566
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
the gases i mean that's a really
 

1567
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,070
the gases i mean that's a really
interesting that's a beautiful idea and

1568
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
interesting that's a beautiful idea and
 

1569
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,750
interesting that's a beautiful idea and
uh yeah so we could just pause on like

1570
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
uh yeah so we could just pause on like
 

1571
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,149
uh yeah so we could just pause on like
that's as a powerful tool i think

1572
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
that's as a powerful tool i think
 

1573
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,990
that's as a powerful tool i think
that uh to build the intuition wrong

1574
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,000
that uh to build the intuition wrong
 

1575
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,510
that uh to build the intuition wrong
because i was totally clueless about it

1576
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
because i was totally clueless about it
 

1577
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,350
because i was totally clueless about it
and that was kind it's kind of exciting

1578
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
and that was kind it's kind of exciting
 

1579
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,950
and that was kind it's kind of exciting
i mean i'm sure there's a

1580
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
i mean i'm sure there's a
 

1581
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,230
i mean i'm sure there's a
folks probably early on in your life uh

1582
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
folks probably early on in your life uh
 

1583
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,990
folks probably early on in your life uh
who were very skeptical about this

1584
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
who were very skeptical about this
 

1585
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,430
who were very skeptical about this
notion well

1586
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
notion well
 

1587
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,470
notion well
maybe i'm not sure but it's generally

1588
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
maybe i'm not sure but it's generally
 

1589
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,830
maybe i'm not sure but it's generally
you would want to be skeptical it's like

1590
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:11,840
you would want to be skeptical it's like
 

1591
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,190
you would want to be skeptical it's like
well

1592
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
well
 

1593
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,549
well
all these kinds of other things could

1594
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
all these kinds of other things could
 

1595
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,630
all these kinds of other things could
generate gases you know all those

1596
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640
generate gases you know all those
 

1597
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,950
generate gases you know all those
oh that's so true and that's a big part

1598
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:18,960
oh that's so true and that's a big part
 

1599
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,430
oh that's so true and that's a big part
of this growing field is how to

1600
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,440
of this growing field is how to
 

1601
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,190
of this growing field is how to
make sure that this gas isn't produced

1602
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:23,200
make sure that this gas isn't produced
 

1603
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,470
make sure that this gas isn't produced
by another effect

1604
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
by another effect
 

1605
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,950
by another effect
but i do want to you know again pausing

1606
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:26,960
but i do want to you know again pausing
 

1607
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,710
but i do want to you know again pausing
on that and going back a bit

1608
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:28,720
on that and going back a bit
 

1609
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,710
on that and going back a bit
it's incredible to think but like at

1610
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:30,720
it's incredible to think but like at
 

1611
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,310
it's incredible to think but like at
least almost 100 years ago

1612
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
least almost 100 years ago
 

1613
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,750
least almost 100 years ago
there's a record of someone talking

1614
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
there's a record of someone talking
 

1615
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,470
there's a record of someone talking
about the idea of a gas being an

1616
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
about the idea of a gas being an
 

1617
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,470
about the idea of a gas being an
indicator of life elsewhere oh

1618
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,480
indicator of life elsewhere oh
 

1619
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,470
indicator of life elsewhere oh
that idea was floating about it was

1620
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,480
that idea was floating about it was
 

1621
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,669
that idea was floating about it was
totally floating about

1622
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
totally floating about
 

1623
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,070
totally floating about
and it comes down to oxygen which on our

1624
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,080
and it comes down to oxygen which on our
 

1625
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,149
and it comes down to oxygen which on our
planet fills our atmosphere

1626
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:46,159
planet fills our atmosphere
 

1627
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,350
planet fills our atmosphere
to 20 by volume and you know we rely on

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,360
to 20 by volume and you know we rely on
 

1629
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,390
to 20 by volume and you know we rely on
oxygen to breathe

1630
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
oxygen to breathe
 

1631
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,669
oxygen to breathe
you know when they you hear about the

1632
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
you know when they you hear about the
 

1633
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,110
you know when they you hear about the
people on mount everest running out of

1634
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,120
people on mount everest running out of
 

1635
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,070
people on mount everest running out of
air

1636
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,080
air
 

1637
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,430
air
they're really running out of oxygen

1638
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
they're really running out of oxygen
 

1639
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,710
they're really running out of oxygen
well they're running out of oxygen

1640
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:56,720
well they're running out of oxygen
 

1641
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,470
well they're running out of oxygen
because the air is getting thinner

1642
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
because the air is getting thinner
 

1643
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,830
because the air is getting thinner
as you they climb up the mountain but

1644
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
as you they climb up the mountain but
 

1645
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,269
as you they climb up the mountain but
without plants and bacteria there's

1646
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
without plants and bacteria there's
 

1647
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,710
without plants and bacteria there's
plants that bacteria that also

1648
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
plants that bacteria that also
 

1649
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,789
plants that bacteria that also
photosynthesizes and produces oxygen as

1650
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
photosynthesizes and produces oxygen as
 

1651
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,549
photosynthesizes and produces oxygen as
a waste product without those we would

1652
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
a waste product without those we would
 

1653
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,789
a waste product without those we would
have virtually no oxygen

1654
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
have virtually no oxygen
 

1655
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,269
have virtually no oxygen
our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen

1656
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen
 

1657
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,430
our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen
so yeah what uh if you were to analyze

1658
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
so yeah what uh if you were to analyze
 

1659
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,110
so yeah what uh if you were to analyze
uh earth is oxygen the strong indicator

1660
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
uh earth is oxygen the strong indicator
 

1661
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,430
uh earth is oxygen the strong indicator
here

1662
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
here
 

1663
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,950
here
oxygen is a huge indicator and that's

1664
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
oxygen is a huge indicator and that's
 

1665
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,070
oxygen is a huge indicator and that's
what we're hoping that there is an

1666
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,080
what we're hoping that there is an
 

1667
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,909
what we're hoping that there is an
intelligent civilization

1668
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
intelligent civilization
 

1669
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,830
intelligent civilization
not too far from here around a planet

1670
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
not too far from here around a planet
 

1671
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,750
not too far from here around a planet
orbiting a nearby star

1672
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:29,760
orbiting a nearby star
 

1673
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,350
orbiting a nearby star
with the kind of telescopes we're trying

1674
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
with the kind of telescopes we're trying
 

1675
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,590
with the kind of telescopes we're trying
to build and they're looking back at our

1676
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
to build and they're looking back at our
 

1677
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,870
to build and they're looking back at our
sun and they've seen our earth and they

1678
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
sun and they've seen our earth and they
 

1679
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,350
sun and they've seen our earth and they
see oxygen and they

1680
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,360
see oxygen and they
 

1681
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,070
see oxygen and they
they probably won't be like 100.00 sure

1682
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
they probably won't be like 100.00 sure
 

1683
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,350
they probably won't be like 100.00 sure
that there's life making it

1684
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:41,360
that there's life making it
 

1685
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,870
that there's life making it
but if they go through all the possible

1686
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
but if they go through all the possible
 

1687
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,549
but if they go through all the possible
scenarios they'll be left with a pretty

1688
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:44,559
scenarios they'll be left with a pretty
 

1689
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,669
scenarios they'll be left with a pretty
strong hint

1690
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
strong hint
 

1691
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,470
strong hint
that there's life here yeah okay but how

1692
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
that there's life here yeah okay but how
 

1693
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,750
that there's life here yeah okay but how
do you detect

1694
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
do you detect
 

1695
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,470
do you detect
that type of gases that are on the

1696
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,480
that type of gases that are on the
 

1697
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,590
that type of gases that are on the
planet

that
 

1703
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,909
that
that's what people were skeptical about

1704
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
that's what people were skeptical about
 

1705
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,110
that's what people were skeptical about
when i first started working on

1706
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
when i first started working on
 

1707
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,830
when i first started working on
exoplanets long time ago

1708
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
exoplanets long time ago
 

1709
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,669
exoplanets long time ago
people didn't believe we would ever ever

1710
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:05,679
people didn't believe we would ever ever
 

1711
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,750
people didn't believe we would ever ever
ever study an exoplanet atmosphere of

1712
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
ever study an exoplanet atmosphere of
 

1713
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,269
ever study an exoplanet atmosphere of
any kind

1714

any kind
 

1715
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,029
any kind
and now dozens of them are studied

1716
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:11,039
and now dozens of them are studied
 

1717
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,310
and now dozens of them are studied
there's a whole field of people

1718

there's a whole field of people
 

1719
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,909
there's a whole field of people
hundreds of people working on exoplanet

1720
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:13,919
hundreds of people working on exoplanet
 

1721
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,990
hundreds of people working on exoplanet
atmospheres actually wow

1722
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
atmospheres actually wow
 

1723
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,510
atmospheres actually wow
but first there was a point where people

1724
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
but first there was a point where people
 

1725
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,310
but first there was a point where people
didn't even know there was exoplanets

1726
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
didn't even know there was exoplanets
 

1727
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,990
didn't even know there was exoplanets
right when was the first exoplanet

1728
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
right when was the first exoplanet
 

1729
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,310
right when was the first exoplanet
detected the first exoplanet around a

1730
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,320
detected the first exoplanet around a
 

1731
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,310
detected the first exoplanet around a
sun-like star anyway was detected in the

1732
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
sun-like star anyway was detected in the
 

1733
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,070
sun-like star anyway was detected in the
mid-1990s

1734
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
mid-1990s
 

1735
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,909
mid-1990s
that was a big deal i kind of vaguely

1736
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:29,919
that was a big deal i kind of vaguely
 

1737
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,590
that was a big deal i kind of vaguely
remember that well at the time it was a

1738
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
remember that well at the time it was a
 

1739
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,029
remember that well at the time it was a
big deal but it was also incredibly

1740
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:33,039
big deal but it was also incredibly
 

1741
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,389
big deal but it was also incredibly
controversial

1742
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:34,399
controversial
 

1743
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,590
controversial
because in exo you know planets

1744
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
because in exo you know planets
 

1745
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,590
because in exo you know planets
we only had one example of a planetary

1757
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,990
first exoplanet around a sun-like star
was incredibly close to its star it's

was incredibly close to its star it's
 

1759
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,149
was incredibly close to its star it's
star so close that people just couldn't

an exoplanet is our name like is the
 

1769
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,669
an exoplanet is our name like is the
name that we call

1770
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
name that we call
 

1771
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,149
name that we call
a planet orbiting a star other than our

right extra solar i guess is the number

1776
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
right extra solar i guess is the number
 

1777
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,710
right extra solar i guess is the number
you can call it extrasolar

1778
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
you can call it extrasolar
 

1779
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,630
you can call it extrasolar
exoplanet is simpler but i think it's

1780
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:12,640
exoplanet is simpler but i think it's
 

1781
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,870
exoplanet is simpler but i think it's
worth pausing to remember

1782
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:14,880
worth pausing to remember
 

1783
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,950
worth pausing to remember
that each one of those stars out there

1784
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:16,960
that each one of those stars out there
 

1785
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,190
that each one of those stars out there
in our night sky is the sun

1786
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:19,200
in our night sky is the sun
 

1787
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,630
in our night sky is the sun
right and you know our sun has planets

1788
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,640
right and you know our sun has planets
 

1789
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,190
right and you know our sun has planets
mercury venus earth mars etc

1790
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,200
mercury venus earth mars etc
 

1791
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,029
mercury venus earth mars etc
and so for a long time people have

1792
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
and so for a long time people have
 

1793
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,430
and so for a long time people have
wondered do those other stars or other

1794
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
wondered do those other stars or other
 

1795
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,950
wondered do those other stars or other
suns have planets

1796
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:28,960
suns have planets
 

1797
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,630
suns have planets
and they do and it appears that nearly

1798
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
and they do and it appears that nearly
 

1799
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,710
and they do and it appears that nearly
every star has a planet has a planet we

1800
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:32,720
every star has a planet has a planet we
 

1801
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,750
every star has a planet has a planet we
call exoplanet

1802
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
call exoplanet
 

1803
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,110
call exoplanet
and there are thousands of known

1804
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
and there are thousands of known
 

1805
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,070
and there are thousands of known
exoplanets already so there's already

1806
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
exoplanets already so there's already
 

1807
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,470
exoplanets already so there's already
yeah like there's so many things about

1808
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:40,480
yeah like there's so many things about
 

1809
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,110
yeah like there's so many things about
space

1810
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
space
 

1811
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,669
space
that it's hard to put in into one's

1812
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:43,679
that it's hard to put in into one's
 

1813
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:44,549
that it's hard to put in into one's
brain

1814
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
brain
 

1815
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,430
brain
because it starts filling it with awe so

1816
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
because it starts filling it with awe so
 

1817
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,029
because it starts filling it with awe so
yeah if you visualize

1818
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
yeah if you visualize
 

1819
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,510
yeah if you visualize
the fact that the stars that we see in

1820
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:51,520
the fact that the stars that we see in
 

1821
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,870
the fact that the stars that we see in
the sky

1822
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:52,880
the sky
 

1823
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,510
the sky
aren't just stars they're like they're

1824
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
aren't just stars they're like they're
 

1825
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,950
aren't just stars they're like they're
sons

1826
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:56,960
sons
 

1827
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,389
sons
and they very likely as you're saying

1828
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
and they very likely as you're saying
 

1829
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,510
and they very likely as you're saying
will have planets around them there's

1830
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
will have planets around them there's
 

1831
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,190
will have planets around them there's
all these planets

1832
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
all these planets
 

1833
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,190
all these planets
roaming about in this like dimly lit

1834
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
roaming about in this like dimly lit
 

1835
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,549
roaming about in this like dimly lit
darkness with potentially uh

1836
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
darkness with potentially uh
 

1837
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,870
darkness with potentially uh
life i mean it's just mind-blowing but

1838
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880
life i mean it's just mind-blowing but
 

1839
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,230
life i mean it's just mind-blowing but
um maybe can you

1840
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,240
um maybe can you
 

1841
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,310
um maybe can you
give a brief like history of

1842
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:20,320
give a brief like history of
 

1843
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,149
give a brief like history of
and like of discovering all the

1844
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:22,159
and like of discovering all the
 

1845
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,310
and like of discovering all the
exoplanets so there's no exoplanets in

1846
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
exoplanets so there's no exoplanets in
 

1847
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,070
exoplanets so there's no exoplanets in
the 90s

1848
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,080
the 90s
 

1849
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,310
the 90s
and then there's a lot of exoplanets now

1850
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320
and then there's a lot of exoplanets now
 

1851
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,750
and then there's a lot of exoplanets now
so how did that come about so many

1852
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:29,760
so how did that come about so many
 

1853
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,350
so how did that come about so many
planets

1854
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,360
planets
 

1855
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,909
planets
how did it come about well maybe another

1856
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:33,919
how did it come about well maybe another
 

1857
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,909
how did it come about well maybe another
way to ask is what is the methodology

1858
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:35,919
way to ask is what is the methodology
 

1859
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,750
way to ask is what is the methodology
that was used to discover them i can say

1860
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:37,760
that was used to discover them i can say
 

1861
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,870
that was used to discover them i can say
that

1862
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
that
 

1863
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,310
that
but i'd like to just say something else

1864
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,320
but i'd like to just say something else
 

1865
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,950
but i'd like to just say something else
first where so in exoplanets

1866
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
first where so in exoplanets
 

1867
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,549
first where so in exoplanets
you know the line between what is

1868
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559
you know the line between what is
 

1869
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,950
you know the line between what is
considered completely crazy

1870
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:46,960
considered completely crazy
 

1871
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,389
considered completely crazy
and what is considered mainstream

1872
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:48,399
and what is considered mainstream
 

1873
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,350
and what is considered mainstream
research legit is constantly shifting

1874
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,360
research legit is constantly shifting
 

1875
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,590
research legit is constantly shifting
this is awesome yeah so before when i

1876
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
this is awesome yeah so before when i
 

1877
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,950
this is awesome yeah so before when i
started on exoplanets

1878
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
started on exoplanets
 

1879
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,710
started on exoplanets
it was still sketchy like it wasn't

1880
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:56,720
it was still sketchy like it wasn't
 

1881
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,870
it was still sketchy like it wasn't
considered a career or a thing

1882
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
considered a career or a thing
 

1883
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,029
considered a career or a thing
a place where you should be investing

1884
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:01,039
a place where you should be investing
 

1885
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,470
a place where you should be investing
and right now

1886
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
and right now
 

1887
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,029
and right now
now today it's so many people are

1888
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:05,039
now today it's so many people are
 

1889
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:05,990
now today it's so many people are
working in this field

1890
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
working in this field
 

1891
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,750
working in this field
a good i don't know at least a thousand

1892
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:07,760
a good i don't know at least a thousand
 

1893
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,190
a good i don't know at least a thousand
probably more i don't know if that

1894
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
probably more i don't know if that
 

1895
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,870
probably more i don't know if that
sounds like a lot to you but it's a lot

1896
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
sounds like a lot to you but it's a lot
 

1897
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,669
sounds like a lot to you but it's a lot
no it's a legitimate field of inquiry

1898
00:31:13,669 --> 00:31:13,679
no it's a legitimate field of inquiry
 

1899
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,029
no it's a legitimate field of inquiry
yeah legitimate field of increase and

1900
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,039
yeah legitimate field of increase and
 

1901
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,549
yeah legitimate field of increase and
what's helped us is everything that's

1902
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:16,559
what's helped us is everything that's
 

1903
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,190
what's helped us is everything that's
helped

1904
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:17,200
helped
 

1905
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,669
helped
everyone else it's software it's

1906
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:19,679
everyone else it's software it's
 

1907
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,509
everyone else it's software it's
computers it's hardware

1908
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:21,519
computers it's hardware
 

1909
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,630
computers it's hardware
it's like our phones you have a

1910
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
it's like our phones you have a
 

1911
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,149
it's like our phones you have a
fantastic detector in there like they

1912
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:24,159
fantastic detector in there like they
 

1913
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,590
fantastic detector in there like they
didn't always have that i don't know if

1914
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:25,600
didn't always have that i don't know if
 

1915
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,710
didn't always have that i don't know if
you remember

1916
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:26,720
you remember
 

1917
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,389
you remember
the so-called olden days we didn't have

1918
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:28,399
the so-called olden days we didn't have
 

1919
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,310
the so-called olden days we didn't have
digital cameras we had film

1920
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,320
digital cameras we had film
 

1921
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,990
digital cameras we had film
you take a film camera you send the film

1922
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,000
you take a film camera you send the film
 

1923
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,350
you take a film camera you send the film
away and eventually it comes back and

1924
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,360
away and eventually it comes back and
 

1925
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,710
away and eventually it comes back and
then you see your pictures

1926
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
then you see your pictures
 

1927
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,789
then you see your pictures
and they could all be horrible yeah so

1928
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799
and they could all be horrible yeah so
 

1929
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,830
and they could all be horrible yeah so
yeah it sent me digital

1930
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
yeah it sent me digital
 

1931
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,430
yeah it sent me digital
it just changed everything data changed

1932
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,440
it just changed everything data changed
 

1933
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,350
it just changed everything data changed
everything yeah and so one thing that

1934
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
everything yeah and so one thing that
 

1935
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,750
everything yeah and so one thing that
really helped exoplanets were detectors

1936
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
really helped exoplanets were detectors
 

1937
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,070
really helped exoplanets were detectors
that were very sensitive because when

1938
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
that were very sensitive because when
 

1939
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,269
that were very sensitive because when
we're looking for

1940
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:47,279
we're looking for
 

1941
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,990
we're looking for
this the transiting planets what we're

1942
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,000
this the transiting planets what we're
 

1943
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,509
this the transiting planets what we're
doing is we're monitoring a star's

1944
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:51,519
doing is we're monitoring a star's
 

1945
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,590
doing is we're monitoring a star's
brightness as a function of time

1946
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
brightness as a function of time
 

1947
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,190
brightness as a function of time
it's like click taking a picture of the

1948
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:55,200
it's like click taking a picture of the
 

1949
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,950
it's like click taking a picture of the
stars every few seconds

1950
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
stars every few seconds
 

1951
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,830
stars every few seconds
or minutes and we're measuring the

1952
00:31:59,830 --> 00:31:59,840
or minutes and we're measuring the
 

1953
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,029
or minutes and we're measuring the
brightness of a star

1954
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
brightness of a star
 

1955
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,830
brightness of a star
like every frame and we're looking for a

1956
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:03,840
like every frame and we're looking for a
 

1957
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,750
like every frame and we're looking for a
drop in brightness that's characteristic

1958
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:05,760
drop in brightness that's characteristic
 

1959
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,389
drop in brightness that's characteristic
of a planet going in front of the star

1960
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:08,399
of a planet going in front of the star
 

1961
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,430
of a planet going in front of the star
and then finishing its so-called transit

1962
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:11,440
and then finishing its so-called transit
 

1963
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,590
and then finishing its so-called transit
and to make that measurement we have to

1964
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:13,600
and to make that measurement we have to
 

1965
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,669
and to make that measurement we have to
have precise detectors

1966
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:15,679
have precise detectors
 

1967
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,990
have precise detectors
and uh the the detectors that are making

1968
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,000
and uh the the detectors that are making
 

1969
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,190
and uh the the detectors that are making
the measurement

1970
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,200
the measurement
 

1971
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,990
the measurement
can you do it from earth is it uh are

1972
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,000
can you do it from earth is it uh are
 

1973
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,909
can you do it from earth is it uh are
they floating about in space

1974
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:23,919
they floating about in space
 

1975
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,549
they floating about in space
like what kind of telescope both so on

1976
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
like what kind of telescope both so on
 

1977
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,470
like what kind of telescope both so on
the ground people are using telescopes

1978
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
the ground people are using telescopes
 

1979
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,070
the ground people are using telescopes
small telescopes that are almost just

1980
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
small telescopes that are almost just
 

1981
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,230
small telescopes that are almost just
like a glorified telephoto lens

1982
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,240
like a glorified telephoto lens
 

1983
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,830
like a glorified telephoto lens
and they're looking at big swaths of the

1984
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:33,840
and they're looking at big swaths of the
 

1985
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,990
and they're looking at big swaths of the
sky and from the ground

1986
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
sky and from the ground
 

1987
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,669
sky and from the ground
people can find giant planets like the

1988
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:37,679
people can find giant planets like the
 

1989
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,990
people can find giant planets like the
size of jupiter so it's about 10 to 12

1990
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
size of jupiter so it's about 10 to 12
 

1991
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,430
size of jupiter so it's about 10 to 12
times the size of earth

1992
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440
times the size of earth
 

1993
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,190
times the size of earth
we can find big planets because we can

1994
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
we can find big planets because we can
 

1995
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,710
we can find big planets because we can
reach about

1996
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:44,720
reach about
 

1997
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,029
reach about
one percent precision so i'm not sure

1998
00:32:47,029 --> 00:32:47,039
one percent precision so i'm not sure
 

1999
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,389
one percent precision so i'm not sure
how much technical you want to get but

2000
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:48,399
how much technical you want to get but
 

2001
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,990
how much technical you want to get but
well yeah well how many pixels are we

2002
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
well yeah well how many pixels are we
 

2003
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,789
well yeah well how many pixels are we
talking about like what uh

2004
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
talking about like what uh
 

2005
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,029
talking about like what uh
you mentioned phones there's a bunch of

2006
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:55,039
you mentioned phones there's a bunch of
 

2007
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,149
you mentioned phones there's a bunch of
uh megapixels

2008
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:56,159
uh megapixels
 

2009
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,870
uh megapixels
i think so for exoplanets you want to

2010
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,880
i think so for exoplanets you want to
 

2011
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,389
i think so for exoplanets you want to
think about it as like a pixel or less

2012
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:00,399
think about it as like a pixel or less
 

2013
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:01,909
think about it as like a pixel or less
than a pixel we're not getting any

2014
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
than a pixel we're not getting any
 

2015
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,669
than a pixel we're not getting any
information

2016
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:03,679
information
 

2017
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,350
information
but to be more technical our telescope

2018
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
but to be more technical our telescope
 

2019
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,870
but to be more technical our telescope
you know spreads the light out over many

2020
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:06,880
you know spreads the light out over many
 

2021
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,669
you know spreads the light out over many
pixels

2022
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:07,679
pixels
 

2023
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,269
pixels
but we're not getting information we're

2024
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:09,279
but we're not getting information we're
 

2025
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,070
but we're not getting information we're
not tiling the planet with pixels

2026
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,080
not tiling the planet with pixels
 

2027
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,070
not tiling the planet with pixels
it's just like a point of light or in

2028
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,080
it's just like a point of light or in
 

2029
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,669
it's just like a point of light or in
most cases we don't even see the planet

2030
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
most cases we don't even see the planet
 

2031
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,269
most cases we don't even see the planet
itself just the planet's effect on the

2032
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:17,279
itself just the planet's effect on the
 

2033
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:17,669
itself just the planet's effect on the
star

2034
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:17,679
star
 

2035
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,590
star
but another thing that really helped was

2036
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,600
but another thing that really helped was
 

2037
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,029
but another thing that really helped was
computers because

2038
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:21,039
computers because
 

2039
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,470
computers because
transiting planets are actually quite

2040
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
transiting planets are actually quite
 

2041
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,990
transiting planets are actually quite
rare i mean they don't all go in front

2042
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
rare i mean they don't all go in front
 

2043
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,269
rare i mean they don't all go in front
of their star right

2044
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
of their star right
 

2045
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,269
of their star right
and so to find transiting planets we

2046
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:27,279
and so to find transiting planets we
 

2047
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,509
and so to find transiting planets we
look at a big part of the sky at once or

2048
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:29,519
look at a big part of the sky at once or
 

2049
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,230
look at a big part of the sky at once or
we look at

2050
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240
we look at
 

2051
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,750
we look at
tens of thousands or hundreds of

2052
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
tens of thousands or hundreds of
 

2053
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,509
tens of thousands or hundreds of
thousands or even in some cases millions

2054
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:33,519
thousands or even in some cases millions
 

2055
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,269
thousands or even in some cases millions
of stars at one time

2056
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
of stars at one time
 

2057
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,470
of stars at one time
and so you know you're not going to do

2058
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:36,480
and so you know you're not going to do
 

2059
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,909
and so you know you're not going to do
this by hand going through a million

2060
00:33:37,909 --> 00:33:37,919
this by hand going through a million
 

2061
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:38,870
this by hand going through a million
stars

2062
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:38,880

2063
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,190
stars
counting up the brightness we so we have

2064
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,200
counting up the brightness we so we have
 

2065
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,630
counting up the brightness we so we have
computer software and

2066
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
computer software and
 

2067
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,750
computer software and
computer code that does the job for us

2068
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:45,760
computer code that does the job for us
 

2069
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,549
computer code that does the job for us
and looks for

2070
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
and looks for
 

2071
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,149
and looks for
a you know counts the brightness and

2072
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:48,159
a you know counts the brightness and
 

2073
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,149
a you know counts the brightness and
looks for a signal

2074
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:50,159
looks for a signal
 

2075
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,830
looks for a signal
that could be due to a transiting planet

2076
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:51,840
that could be due to a transiting planet
 

2077
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,990
that could be due to a transiting planet
and you know i just finished a job

2078
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,000
and you know i just finished a job
 

2079
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,470
and you know i just finished a job
called uh deputy science director for

2080
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
called uh deputy science director for
 

2081
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,190
called uh deputy science director for
the mit led nasa mission test

2082
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,200
the mit led nasa mission test
 

2083
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,630
the mit led nasa mission test
and it was my purview to make sure that

2084
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:02,640
and it was my purview to make sure that
 

2085
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,750
and it was my purview to make sure that
we got the

2086
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,760
we got the
 

2087
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,149
we got the
planet candidates the transiting light

2088
00:34:06,149 --> 00:34:06,159
planet candidates the transiting light
 

2089
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,909
planet candidates the transiting light
curves out to the community so people

2090
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
curves out to the community so people
 

2091
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,349
curves out to the community so people
could follow them up

2092
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:09,359
could follow them up
 

2093
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,109
could follow them up
and figure out if they're actual planets

2094
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119
and figure out if they're actual planets
 

2095
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,030
and figure out if they're actual planets
or false positives

2096
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
or false positives
 

2097
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,190
or false positives
so publish the data so that people could

2098
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,200
so publish the data so that people could
 

2099
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,430
so publish the data so that people could
just uh yeah publish data all the

2100
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:17,440
just uh yeah publish data all the
 

2101
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,950
just uh yeah publish data all the
all the data scientists out there could

2102
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:18,960
all the data scientists out there could
 

2103
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,869
all the data scientists out there could
crunch and see if they can exactly

2104
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
crunch and see if they can exactly
 

2105
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,030
crunch and see if they can exactly
they can discover something and in fact

2106
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
they can discover something and in fact
 

2107
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,790
they can discover something and in fact
the nasa policy for this mission

2108
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
the nasa policy for this mission
 

2109
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,550
the nasa policy for this mission
is that all the data becomes public as

2110
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:26,560
is that all the data becomes public as
 

2111
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,069
is that all the data becomes public as
soon as possible

2112
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:28,079
soon as possible
 

2113
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,909
soon as possible
so anyone could act it's not as easy as

2114
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:29,919
so anyone could act it's not as easy as
 

2115
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,430
so anyone could act it's not as easy as
it sounds though to download the data

2116
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,440
it sounds though to download the data
 

2117
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,349
it sounds though to download the data
and look for planets

2118
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359
and look for planets
 

2119
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,829
and look for planets
but there is a group called

2120
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:34,839
but there is a group called
 

2121
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,510
but there is a group called
planethunters.org and they take the data

2122
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,520
planethunters.org and they take the data
 

2123
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,950
planethunters.org and they take the data
and they actually crowdsource it out to

2124
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:38,960
and they actually crowdsource it out to
 

2125
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,550
and they actually crowdsource it out to
people to look for planets yeah and they

2126
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:40,560
people to look for planets yeah and they
 

2127
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,829
people to look for planets yeah and they
often find

2128
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839
often find
 

2129
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,430
often find
fine signals that our computers and our

2130
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:43,440
fine signals that our computers and our
 

2131
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,030
fine signals that our computers and our
team missed so

2132
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040
team missed so
 

2133
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,750
team missed so
we mentioned exoplanets what about earth

2134
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:47,760
we mentioned exoplanets what about earth
 

2135
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,230
we mentioned exoplanets what about earth
like

2136
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
like
 

2137
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,990
like
or i don't know what the right

2138
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,000
or i don't know what the right
 

2139
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,230
or i don't know what the right
distinction is if is it habitable or is

2140
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,240
distinction is if is it habitable or is
 

2141
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,589
distinction is if is it habitable or is
it earth-like planets

2142
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:53,599
it earth-like planets
 

2143
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,270
it earth-like planets
but what are those different categories

2144
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,280
but what are those different categories
 

2145
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,869
but what are those different categories
and how can we tell the difference and

2146
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
and how can we tell the difference and
 

2147
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,990
and how can we tell the difference and
detect each

2148
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,000
detect each
 

2149
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,670
detect each
right right so we're not at earth-like

2150
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
right right so we're not at earth-like
 

2151
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,109
right right so we're not at earth-like
planets yet

2152
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:01,119
planets yet
 

2153
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,109
planets yet
all the planets we're finding are so

2154
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:03,119
all the planets we're finding are so
 

2155
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,870
all the planets we're finding are so
different from

2156
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:04,880
different from
 

2157
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,630
different from
what we have in our solar system they're

2158
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:06,640
what we have in our solar system they're
 

2159
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,550
what we have in our solar system they're
just easier planets to find but like

2160
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
just easier planets to find but like
 

2161
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,030
just easier planets to find but like
in which way for example there could be

2162
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
in which way for example there could be
 

2163
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,710
in which way for example there could be
a jupiter-sized planet where an earth

2164
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
a jupiter-sized planet where an earth
 

2165
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,550
a jupiter-sized planet where an earth
should be

2166
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:14,560
should be
 

2167
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,430
should be
we find planets that are the same size

2168
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:17,440
we find planets that are the same size
 

2169
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,470
we find planets that are the same size
as earth

2170
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:18,480
as earth
 

2171
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,710
as earth
but are orbiting way closer to their

2172
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:20,720
but are orbiting way closer to their
 

2173
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,829
but are orbiting way closer to their
star than mercury is to our sun

2174
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:23,839
star than mercury is to our sun
 

2175
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,910
star than mercury is to our sun
and they're so close that because close

2176
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
and they're so close that because close
 

2177
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,870
and they're so close that because close
to a star means they also orbit faster

2178
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:28,880
to a star means they also orbit faster
 

2179
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,030
to a star means they also orbit faster
and some of these hot super earths we

2180
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,040
and some of these hot super earths we
 

2181
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,230
and some of these hot super earths we
call them

2182
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,240
call them
 

2183
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,990
call them
their year their time to go around their

star is less than a day
 

2187
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,310
star is less than a day
and they're heated so much by their star

they're heated so much by the star
we think the surface is hot enough to

2192
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:41,839
we think the surface is hot enough to
 

2193
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,430
we think the surface is hot enough to
melt rock so instead of

00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,440
melt rock so instead of
 

2195
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,910
melt rock so instead of
running out by the bay or the river

running out by the bay or the river
 

2197
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,270
running out by the bay or the river
you'll have like liquid lava

2198
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:47,280
you'll have like liquid lava
 

2199
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,990
you'll have like liquid lava
there'll be liquid lava lakes on these

2200
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:50,000
there'll be liquid lava lakes on these
 

2201
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,030
there'll be liquid lava lakes on these
planets we think

00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,040
planets we think
 

2203
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,069
planets we think
and life can't survive way too hot

2204
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:54,079
and life can't survive way too hot
 

2205
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,150
and life can't survive way too hot
the molecules for life would just be

we have some other planets one of the
 

2215
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,910
we have some other planets one of the
most mysterious things out there

most mysterious things out there
 

2217
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,630
most mysterious things out there
factoid if you will is that the most

2218
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:06,640
factoid if you will is that the most
 

2219
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,390
factoid if you will is that the most
common type of planet we know about so

2220
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:08,400
common type of planet we know about so
 

2221
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,190
common type of planet we know about so
far

2222
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:09,200
far
 

2223
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,670
far
is a planet that's in between earth and

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:11,680
is a planet that's in between earth and
 

2225
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,630
is a planet that's in between earth and
neptune size

neptune size
 

2227
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,230
neptune size
it's two to three times the size of

2228
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,240
it's two to three times the size of
 

2229
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,630
it's two to three times the size of
earth and we have no solar system

00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:16,640
earth and we have no solar system
 

2231
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,589
earth and we have no solar system
counterpart of that planet

2232
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
counterpart of that planet
 

2233
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,670
counterpart of that planet
that is like going outside to the forest

2234
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:21,680
that is like going outside to the forest
 

2235
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,790
that is like going outside to the forest
and finding some kind of

2236
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
and finding some kind of
 

2237
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,950
and finding some kind of
creature or animal that just no one has

2238
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
creature or animal that just no one has
 

2239
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,310
creature or animal that just no one has
ever seen before and then discovering

2240
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,320
ever seen before and then discovering
 

2241
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,109
ever seen before and then discovering
that is the most common thing out there

2242
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,119
that is the most common thing out there
 

2243
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,470
that is the most common thing out there
and so we're not even sure what they are

2244
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,480
and so we're not even sure what they are
 

2245
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,829
and so we're not even sure what they are
we have a lot of thoughts as to the

2246
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:31,839
we have a lot of thoughts as to the
 

2247
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,510
we have a lot of thoughts as to the
different types of planet it could be

2248
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
different types of planet it could be
 

2249
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,589
different types of planet it could be
that people don't really know i mean

2250
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:35,599
that people don't really know i mean
 

2251
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,950
that people don't really know i mean
what are your thoughts about what it

2252
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
what are your thoughts about what it
 

2253
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,670
what are your thoughts about what it
could be

2254
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:37,680
could be
 

2255
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,109
could be
well one thought and this is more when

2256
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
well one thought and this is more when
 

2257
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,670
well one thought and this is more when
we want to be rather than might be

2258
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,680
we want to be rather than might be
 

2259
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,870
we want to be rather than might be
is that these so-called mini neptunes we

2260
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:44,880
is that these so-called mini neptunes we
 

2261

is that these so-called mini neptunes we
call them

2262
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:45,760
call them
 

2263
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,230
call them
that they are water worlds that they

2264
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
that they are water worlds that they
 

2265
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,230
that they are water worlds that they
could be scaled up versions of jupiter's

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,510
could be scaled up versions of jupiter's
icy moons

2268
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:51,520
icy moons
 

2269
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,150
icy moons
such that they are planets that are made

2270
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
such that they are planets that are made
 

2271
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,589
such that they are planets that are made
of more than half of water

2272
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:55,599
of more than half of water
 

2273
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,829
of more than half of water
by mass so yeah and what's the

2274
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:57,839
by mass so yeah and what's the
 

2275
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,910
by mass so yeah and what's the
connection between water and life

2276
00:36:59,910 --> 00:36:59,920
connection between water and life
 

2277
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,990
connection between water and life
and the possibility of seeing that from

2278
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,000
and the possibility of seeing that from
 

2279
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,990
and the possibility of seeing that from
a gas perspective

2280
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
a gas perspective
 

2281
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,230
a gas perspective
okay so all life on earth needs liquid

2282
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
okay so all life on earth needs liquid
 

2283
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,349
okay so all life on earth needs liquid
water

2284
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:07,359
water
 

2285
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,829
water
and so there's been this idea in

2286
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
and so there's been this idea in
 

2287
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,670
and so there's been this idea in
astronomy or astrobiology for a long

2288
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,680
astronomy or astrobiology for a long
 

2289
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,950
astronomy or astrobiology for a long
time called follow the water

2290
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,960
time called follow the water
 

2291
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,870
time called follow the water
find water that will give you a chance

2292
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880
find water that will give you a chance
 

2293
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,150
find water that will give you a chance
of finding life

2294
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,160
of finding life
 

2295
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,390
of finding life
but we could still zoom out and the kind

2296
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:18,400
but we could still zoom out and the kind
 

2297
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,150
but we could still zoom out and the kind
of the community

2298
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:20,160
of the community
 

2299
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,230
of the community
consensus is that we need some kind of

2300
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:22,240
consensus is that we need some kind of
 

2301
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,349
consensus is that we need some kind of
liquid

2302
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:23,359
liquid
 

2303
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,750
liquid
for life to originate and to survive

2304
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760
for life to originate and to survive
 

2305
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,069
for life to originate and to survive
because molecules have to react

2306
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:28,079
because molecules have to react
 

2307
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,510
because molecules have to react
if you don't have a way that molecules

2308
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
if you don't have a way that molecules
 

2309
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,349
if you don't have a way that molecules
can interact with each other

2310
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:31,359
can interact with each other
 

2311
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,510
can interact with each other
you can't really make anything and so

2312
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
you can't really make anything and so
 

2313
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,950
you can't really make anything and so
when we think of all the liquids out

2314
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:34,960
when we think of all the liquids out
 

2315
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,510
when we think of all the liquids out
there water is the most abundant

2316
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
there water is the most abundant
 

2317
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,430
there water is the most abundant
liquid in terms of planetary materials

there really aren't that many liquids

2320
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:40,960
there really aren't that many liquids
 

2321
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,109
there really aren't that many liquids
like i mentioned liquid rock way too hot

2322
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:43,119
like i mentioned liquid rock way too hot
 

2323
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,390
like i mentioned liquid rock way too hot
for life

2324
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
for life
 

2325
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,030
for life
we have some really cold liquids like

2326
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
we have some really cold liquids like
 

2327
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,030
we have some really cold liquids like
almost gasoline like ethane and methane

2328
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,040
almost gasoline like ethane and methane

one of saturn's moons titan that's so

2332
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,040
one of saturn's moons titan that's so
 

2333
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,670
one of saturn's moons titan that's so
cold though

2334
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
cold though
 

2335
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,430
cold though
and for exoplanets we can't study really

2336
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,440
and for exoplanets we can't study really
 

2337
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,950
and for exoplanets we can't study really
cold planets because they're just simply

2338

cold planets because they're just simply
 

2339
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,349
cold planets because they're just simply
too

2340

too
 

2341

too
dark and too cold so we usually so we're

dark and too cold so we usually so we're
 

2343

and
to your point it's remember as

to your point it's remember as
 

2351
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,430
to your point it's remember as
we talked about how planets are less

2352
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,440
we talked about how planets are less
 

2353
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,230
we talked about how planets are less
than a pixel

than a pixel
 

2355
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,550
than a pixel
in in that way to say so we can't see

2356
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:14,560
in in that way to say so we can't see
 

2357

in in that way to say so we can't see
oceans on planet we're not going to see

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,870
but we can see gases in the atmosphere
and if it's a small rocky planet

00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:22,880
and if it's a small rocky planet
 

2365

it's a small if we see a small rocky

atmosphere
 

2373
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,430
atmosphere
we're pretty sure that means there has

00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:31,440
we're pretty sure that means there has
 

2375
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,069
we're pretty sure that means there has
to be a liquid water reservoir

to be a liquid water reservoir
 

2377
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,069
to be a liquid water reservoir
because it's not intuitive in any way

2378
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:36,079
because it's not intuitive in any way
 

2379
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,270
because it's not intuitive in any way
but water

2380
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,280
but water
 

2381
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,430
but water
is broken up by ultraviolet radiation

2382
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:39,440
is broken up by ultraviolet radiation
 

2383
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,310
is broken up by ultraviolet radiation
from the star

from the star
 

2385
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,349
from the star
or from the sun and on most planets

when water is broken up into and o the h
the hydrogen will escape to space

the hydrogen will escape to space
 

2391
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,150
the hydrogen will escape to space
because just like when you think of

2392
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,160
because just like when you think of
 

2393
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,069
because just like when you think of
a child letting go of a helium-filled

balloon it
 

2397
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,750
balloon it
floats upwards and hydrogen's a light

2398
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:55,760
floats upwards and hydrogen's a light
 

2399
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,190
floats upwards and hydrogen's a light
gas and will leave from earth

2400
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,200
gas and will leave from earth
 

2401
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,349
gas and will leave from earth
leave from the planet so ultimately if

2402
00:38:59,349 --> 00:38:59,359
leave from the planet so ultimately if
 

2403
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,470
leave from the planet so ultimately if
you have water

2404
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
you have water
 

2405
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,390
you have water
unless there's an ocean like a way to

2406
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:02,400
unless there's an ocean like a way to
 

2407
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,829
unless there's an ocean like a way to
keep replenishing water vapor in the

00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
keep replenishing water vapor in the
 

2409
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,430
keep replenishing water vapor in the
atmosphere that water vapor should be

atmosphere that water vapor should be
 

2411
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,790

destroyed
 

2413
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,670
destroyed
by ultraviolet radiation got it so

2414
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:09,680
by ultraviolet radiation got it so
 

2415
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,630
by ultraviolet radiation got it so
there's a

2416
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:10,640
there's a
 

2417
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,069
there's a
okay so there's a need for liquid

2418
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:14,079
okay so there's a need for liquid
 

2419
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,390
okay so there's a need for liquid
i mean i guess what is water well is

2420
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,400
i mean i guess what is water well is
 

2421
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,349
i mean i guess what is water well is
water essential is

2422
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:17,359
water essential is
 

2423
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,430
water essential is
other liquids i mean the chemistry here

2424
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
other liquids i mean the chemistry here
 

2425
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,710
other liquids i mean the chemistry here
is probably super complicated there's

2426
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:20,720
is probably super complicated there's
 

2427
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,150
is probably super complicated there's
not it does but you know there's not an

infinite number of liquids
 

2431
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,349
infinite number of liquids
right there's maybe like five liquids

2432
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:25,359
right there's maybe like five liquids
 

2433
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,270
right there's maybe like five liquids
that can exist inside or on the surface

2434
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:27,280
that can exist inside or on the surface
 

2435
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,390
that can exist inside or on the surface
of a planet

2436
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:28,400
of a planet
 

2437
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,470
of a planet
and water is the one that exists for the

and water is the one that exists for the
 

2439
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,910
and water is the one that exists for the
largest range of temperatures and

pressures
and it's also the easiest type of planet

2444
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:35,119
and it's also the easiest type of planet
 

2445
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,550
and it's also the easiest type of planet
for us to find and study as one with

2446
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:36,560
for us to find and study as one with
 

2447
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,349
for us to find and study as one with
water vapor

we have to have that dream condition so

2478
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
we have to have that dream condition so
 

2479
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,069
we have to have that dream condition so
the dream condition is like

2480
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
the dream condition is like
 

2481
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,870
the dream condition is like
life is just super abundant out there

2482

life is just super abundant out there
 

2483
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,750
life is just super abundant out there
yeah the dream

2484
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:17,760
yeah the dream
 

2485
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,829
yeah the dream
yes the dream condition is that life is

2486
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:19,839
yes the dream condition is that life is
 

2487
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,150
yes the dream condition is that life is
super abundant and it's based on

2488
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:22,160
super abundant and it's based on
 

2489
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,510
super abundant and it's based on
the thought that if there is a planet

2490
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,520
the thought that if there is a planet
 

2491
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,670
the thought that if there is a planet
with water

2492
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:25,680
with water
 

2493
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,430
with water
and continents that it also has the

and continents that it also has the
 

2495
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,430
and continents that it also has the
ingredients for life and that

2496
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,440
ingredients for life and that
 

2497
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,550
ingredients for life and that
the kind of base does the base

2498
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:32,560
the kind of base does the base
 

2499
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,829
the kind of base does the base
the base kernel thought is that if the

2500
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
the base kernel thought is that if the
 

2501
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,430
the base kernel thought is that if the
ingredients for life is there life will

2502
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:37,440
ingredients for life is there life will
 

2503
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,230

that's what we're holding on with the

2506
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:40,319
that's what we're holding on with the
 

2507
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,230
that's what we're holding on with the
relatively high probability

relatively high probability
 

2509
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,630
relatively high probability
yes that's that's it okay let's go into

2510
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640
yes that's that's it okay let's go into
 

2511

yes that's that's it okay let's go into

to evolve to be intelligent

i'm not convinced the life is anywhere
near here only because

near here only because
 

2547
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,950
near here only because
if it's hard for intelligent life to

if it's hard for intelligent life to

if it's hard for intelligent life to

00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
himself but he's either really dumb
 

2597
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,430

or he's a super genius just pretending
 

2599
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,790
or he's a super genius just pretending
to be dumb yeah

2600

i mean it's possible he's he's a
 

2603
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,270
i mean it's possible he's he's a
multi-dimensional projection

2604
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,280
multi-dimensional projection
 

2605
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,870
multi-dimensional projection
of alien life uh here monitoring

2606
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:24,880
of alien life uh here monitoring
 

2607
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,829
of alien life uh here monitoring
uh one of the you know one of the top

2608
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:27,839
uh one of the you know one of the top
 

2609
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,430
uh one of the you know one of the top
scientists in the world trying to find

2610
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
scientists in the world trying to find
 

2611
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,510
scientists in the world trying to find
aliens just to make sure

2612
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,520
aliens just to make sure
 

2613
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,589
aliens just to make sure
just just to make sure that humans don't

2614
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:33,599
just just to make sure that humans don't
 

2615
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,270
just just to make sure that humans don't
get out of hand that's funny oh

2616
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,280
get out of hand that's funny oh
 

2617
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,870
get out of hand that's funny oh
i'm definitely going to go in and ask

2618
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:36,880
i'm definitely going to go in and ask
 

2619
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,030
i'm definitely going to go in and ask
him ask him about that

2620
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,040
him ask him about that
 

2621
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,870
him ask him about that
ask him about that he's on to something

2622
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:40,880
ask him about that he's on to something
 

2623
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,470
ask him about that he's on to something
yeah what might we

2624
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:42,480
yeah what might we
 

2625
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,829
yeah what might we
look for in terms of signs of

2626
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:43,839
look for in terms of signs of
 

2627
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,309
look for in terms of signs of
intelligent life

2628
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319
intelligent life
 

2629
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,670
intelligent life
from your toolkit do you think there are

2630
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,680
from your toolkit do you think there are
 

2631
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,630
from your toolkit do you think there are
things

2632
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640
things
 

2633
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,670
things
that we should we might be able to use

2634
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:53,680
that we should we might be able to use
 

2635
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,589
that we should we might be able to use
or maybe in the next couple of decades

2636
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:55,599
or maybe in the next couple of decades
 

2637
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,870
or maybe in the next couple of decades
discover

2638
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
discover
 

2639
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,589
discover
that would be different than life that's

2640
00:42:59,589 --> 00:42:59,599
that would be different than life that's
 

2641
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,710
that would be different than life that's
like bacteria

2642
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:00,720
like bacteria
 

2643
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,069
like bacteria
that's primitive life i still love seti

2644
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:04,079
that's primitive life i still love seti
 

2645
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,309
that's primitive life i still love seti
search for extraterrestrial intelligence

2646
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:06,319
search for extraterrestrial intelligence
 

2647
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,750
search for extraterrestrial intelligence
i like to hope that if there is a

2648
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:07,760
i like to hope that if there is a
 

2649
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,349
i like to hope that if there is a
civilization out there they're trying to

2650
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:09,359
civilization out there they're trying to
 

2651
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,870
civilization out there they're trying to
send us a message

2652
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:10,880
send us a message
 

2653
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,790
send us a message
i think like think about it i don't know

2654
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
i think like think about it i don't know
 

2655
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,990
i think like think about it i don't know
what are your thoughts like if you think

2656
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:14,000
what are your thoughts like if you think
 

2657
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,589
what are your thoughts like if you think
about our earth

2658
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:15,599
about our earth
 

2659
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,150
about our earth
there's no structure we've built that

2660
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,160
there's no structure we've built that
 

2661
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,750
there's no structure we've built that
intelligent civilizations could see from

2662
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:19,760
intelligent civilizations could see from
 

2663
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,390
intelligent civilizations could see from
far away

2664
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:20,400
far away
 

2665
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,910
far away
there's literally nothing not even the

2666
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:21,920
there's literally nothing not even the
 

2667
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,390
there's literally nothing not even the
great wall of china and so to think like

2668
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:24,400
great wall of china and so to think like
 

2669
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,069
great wall of china and so to think like
why would this other civilization

2670
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:26,079
why would this other civilization
 

2671
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,829
why would this other civilization
build a giant structure that we could

2672
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
build a giant structure that we could
 

2673
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,190
build a giant structure that we could
see

2674
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,200
see
 

2675
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,190
see
yeah so with seti the idea is that we're

2676
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,200
yeah so with seti the idea is that we're
 

2677
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,349
yeah so with seti the idea is that we're
both trying to hear signals and send

2678
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:33,359
both trying to hear signals and send
 

2679
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,230
both trying to hear signals and send
signals right

2680
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,240
signals right
 

2681
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,910
signals right
we haven't sent one they call that medi

2682
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:35,920
we haven't sent one they call that medi
 

2683
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,470
we haven't sent one they call that medi
messaging and there's a big kind of

2684
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,480
messaging and there's a big kind of
 

2685
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,790
messaging and there's a big kind of
fear over medi because do you want to

2686
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:40,800
fear over medi because do you want to
 

2687
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,630
fear over medi because do you want to
tell them you're here

2688
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:42,640
tell them you're here
 

2689
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,069
tell them you're here
it's kind of this like let's wait till

2690
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
it's kind of this like let's wait till
 

2691
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,990
it's kind of this like let's wait till
they call us yeah

2692
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,000
they call us yeah
 

2693
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,470
they call us yeah
so uh we should have a dating game we

2694
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:48,480
so uh we should have a dating game we
 

2695
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,270
so uh we should have a dating game we
have to

2696
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:49,280
have to
 

2697
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,270
have to
like how how many days do i wait before

2698
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:51,280
like how how many days do i wait before
 

2699
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,550
like how how many days do i wait before
i call kind of thing

2700
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,560
i call kind of thing
 

2701
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,390
i call kind of thing
yes it and so but the funny thing is if

2702
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:54,400
yes it and so but the funny thing is if
 

2703
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,670
yes it and so but the funny thing is if
no one's sending us a message if

2704
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
no one's sending us a message if
 

2705
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,109
no one's sending us a message if
everybody's only listening

2706
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:57,119
everybody's only listening
 

2707
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,150
everybody's only listening
how do you make progress that's right

2708
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,160
how do you make progress that's right
 

2709
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,150
how do you make progress that's right
and so i mean but there's also

2710
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:02,160
and so i mean but there's also
 

2711
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,309
and so i mean but there's also
there's the voyager spacecraft so we we

2712
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:04,319
there's the voyager spacecraft so we we
 

2713
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,710
there's the voyager spacecraft so we we
have these little pixels of

2714
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:06,720
have these little pixels of
 

2715
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,750
have these little pixels of
uh robots flying out all over the place

2716
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:09,760
uh robots flying out all over the place
 

2717
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,150
uh robots flying out all over the place
some of them like the voyager reach out

2718
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,160
some of them like the voyager reach out
 

2719
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,109
some of them like the voyager reach out
really far

2720
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
really far
 

2721
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,030
really far
and they have some stuff stuff on them

2722
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,040
and they have some stuff stuff on them
 

2723
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,150
and they have some stuff stuff on them
okay i just

2724
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,160
okay i just
 

2725
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,430
okay i just
we do we have the voyager but they're

2726
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,440
we do we have the voyager but they're
 

2727
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,950
we do we have the voyager but they're
not really going anywhere in particular

2728
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
not really going anywhere in particular
 

2729
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,750
not really going anywhere in particular
and they're moving

2730
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:19,760
and they're moving
 

2731
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,069
and they're moving
very very slowly on a cosmic scale yeah

2732
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:22,079
very very slowly on a cosmic scale yeah
 

2733
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,109
very very slowly on a cosmic scale yeah
and let me say

2734
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
and let me say
 

2735
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,950
and let me say
they're far is kind of silly because

2736
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
they're far is kind of silly because
 

2737
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,870
they're far is kind of silly because
yeah it's all relative in astronomy it's

2738
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
yeah it's all relative in astronomy it's
 

2739
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,030
yeah it's all relative in astronomy it's
all relative yeah

2740
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040
all relative yeah
 

2741
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,510
all relative yeah
yeah i just i so from uh if you look at

2742
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:31,520
yeah i just i so from uh if you look at
 

2743
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,470
yeah i just i so from uh if you look at
earth from an alien perspective

2744
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,480
earth from an alien perspective
 

2745
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,069
earth from an alien perspective
from visually and from gas composition

2746
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:38,079
from visually and from gas composition
 

2747
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,910
from visually and from gas composition
i wonder if it's possible to determine

2748
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:39,920
i wonder if it's possible to determine
 

2749
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,670
i wonder if it's possible to determine
the degree

2750
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:41,680
the degree
 

2751
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,870
the degree
of maybe um productive

2752
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:44,880
of maybe um productive
 

2753
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,510
of maybe um productive
energy use i wonder if it's possible to

2754
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:47,520
energy use i wonder if it's possible to
 

2755
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,790
energy use i wonder if it's possible to
tell

2756
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:48,800
tell
 

2757
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,829
tell
like how busy these earthlings are well

2758
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:51,839
like how busy these earthlings are well
 

2759
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,069
like how busy these earthlings are well
let's zoom out again and think about

2760
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:54,079
let's zoom out again and think about
 

2761
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,510
let's zoom out again and think about
oxygen

2762
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:55,520
oxygen
 

2763
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,750
oxygen
so when cyanobacteria arose like

2764
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:57,760
so when cyanobacteria arose like
 

2765
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,589
so when cyanobacteria arose like
billions of years ago and figured out

2766
00:44:59,589 --> 00:44:59,599
billions of years ago and figured out
 

2767
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,270
billions of years ago and figured out
how to harness the energy of the sun for

2768
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,280
how to harness the energy of the sun for
 

2769
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,870
how to harness the energy of the sun for
photosynthesis

2770
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:02,880
photosynthesis
 

2771
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,589
photosynthesis
they re-engineered the entire atmosphere

2772
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:05,599
they re-engineered the entire atmosphere
 

2773
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,550
they re-engineered the entire atmosphere
20

2774
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:06,560
20
 

2775
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,670
20
of the atmosphere has oxygen now like

2776
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:09,680
of the atmosphere has oxygen now like
 

2777
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,589
of the atmosphere has oxygen now like
that is a huge scale you know they

2778
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
that is a huge scale you know they
 

2779
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,950
that is a huge scale you know they
almost poisoned everything else

2780
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:12,960
almost poisoned everything else
 

2781
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,109
almost poisoned everything else
by making this what was apparently very

2782
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:15,119
by making this what was apparently very
 

2783
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:17,190
by making this what was apparently very
poisonous to everything that was alive

2784
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:17,200
poisonous to everything that was alive
 

2785
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,710
poisonous to everything that was alive
but imagine so are we doing anything at

2786
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:18,720
but imagine so are we doing anything at
 

2787
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,470
but imagine so are we doing anything at
that scale like are we changing anything

2788
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:20,480
that scale like are we changing anything
 

2789
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,349
that scale like are we changing anything
in like 20

2790
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:21,359
in like 20
 

2791
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,950
in like 20
of the earth with a giant structure or

2792
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:22,960
of the earth with a giant structure or
 

2793
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,390
of the earth with a giant structure or
20 of this or 20

2794
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,400
20 of this or 20
 

2795
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,109
20 of this or 20
of that like we aren't actually yeah

2796
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:27,119
of that like we aren't actually yeah
 

2797
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,390
of that like we aren't actually yeah
yeah that's

2798
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:28,400
yeah that's
 

2799
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,309
yeah that's
that's uh that's humbling to think that

2800
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319
that's uh that's humbling to think that
 

2801
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,829
that's uh that's humbling to think that
we're not actually having that much of

2802
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:31,839
we're not actually having that much of
 

2803
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:32,870
we're not actually having that much of
an impact i know

2804
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:32,880
an impact i know
 

2805
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,069
an impact i know
but we are because in a way we're

2806
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:34,079
but we are because in a way we're
 

2807
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,670
but we are because in a way we're
destroying our entire planet but it's

2808
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:35,680
destroying our entire planet but it's
 

2809
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,470
destroying our entire planet but it's
humbling to think that from far away

2810
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,480
humbling to think that from far away
 

2811
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,630
humbling to think that from far away
people probably can't even tell but from

2812
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:40,640
people probably can't even tell but from
 

2813
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,030
people probably can't even tell but from
the perspective of the planet

2814
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040
the perspective of the planet
 

2815
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,630
the perspective of the planet
when we say we're destroying you know

2816
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
when we say we're destroying you know
 

2817
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,550
when we say we're destroying you know
global warming all that kind of stuff

2818
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
global warming all that kind of stuff
 

2819
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,630
global warming all that kind of stuff
um what we really mean is we're

2820
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:48,640
um what we really mean is we're
 

2821
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,309
um what we really mean is we're
destroying it

2822
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:50,319
destroying it
 

2823
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,069
destroying it
for a bunch of different species

2824
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:52,079
for a bunch of different species
 

2825
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,829
for a bunch of different species
including humans

2826
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:53,839
including humans
 

2827
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,670
including humans
but like i think the earth will be okay

2828
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
but like i think the earth will be okay
 

2829
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,109
but like i think the earth will be okay
oh the earth will be the earth will

2830
00:45:57,109 --> 00:45:57,119
oh the earth will be the earth will
 

2831
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,630
oh the earth will be the earth will
remain

2832
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:58,640
remain
 

2833
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,230
remain
whatever whatever happened to us the

2834
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:00,240
whatever whatever happened to us the
 

2835
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,510
whatever whatever happened to us the
earth will still be here and it'll still

2836
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:01,520
earth will still be here and it'll still
 

2837
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,589
earth will still be here and it'll still
be difficult to detect any difference

2838
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:03,599
be difficult to detect any difference
 

2839
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,270
be difficult to detect any difference
like it's sad to think that

2840
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:05,280
like it's sad to think that
 

2841
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,150
like it's sad to think that
if humans destroy ourselves except

2842
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
if humans destroy ourselves except
 

2843
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,750
if humans destroy ourselves except
potentially when you clear war

2844
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
potentially when you clear war
 

2845
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,750
potentially when you clear war
it'd be hard to tell that anything even

2846
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:11,760
it'd be hard to tell that anything even
 

2847
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,430
it'd be hard to tell that anything even
happened yeah it will be hard to tell

2848
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
happened yeah it will be hard to tell
 

2849
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:13,990
happened yeah it will be hard to tell
from far away

2850
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:14,000
from far away
 

2851
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,710
from far away
that anything happened what about what

2852
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:16,720
that anything happened what about what
 

2853
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,390
that anything happened what about what
are your thoughts now this is really

2854
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:18,400
are your thoughts now this is really
 

2855
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,109
are your thoughts now this is really
getting into speculation land there

2856
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:21,119
getting into speculation land there
 

2857
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,150
getting into speculation land there
you've you've mentioned exoplanets were

2858
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
you've you've mentioned exoplanets were
 

2859
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,550
you've you've mentioned exoplanets were
in the realm of you know there's this

2860
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:26,560
in the realm of you know there's this
 

2861
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,750
in the realm of you know there's this
beautiful edge

2862
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:27,760
beautiful edge
 

2863
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,270
beautiful edge
between science and science fiction

2864
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:31,280
between science and science fiction
 

2865
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,870
between science and science fiction
that uh some of us a rare few are brave

2866
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:34,880
that uh some of us a rare few are brave
 

2867
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,829
that uh some of us a rare few are brave
enough to walk

2868
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:35,839
enough to walk
 

2869
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,910
enough to walk
i think in academia you were brave

2870
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:37,920
i think in academia you were brave
 

2871
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,750
i think in academia you were brave
enough to do that

2872
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
enough to do that
 

2873
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,270
enough to do that
i think in some sense artificial

2874
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
i think in some sense artificial
 

2875
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,630
i think in some sense artificial
intelligence sometimes walks that line

2876
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
intelligence sometimes walks that line
 

2877
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,990
intelligence sometimes walks that line
a little bit um there is so much

2878
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,000
a little bit um there is so much
 

2879
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,069
a little bit um there is so much
excitement about

2880
00:46:49,069 --> 00:46:49,079
excitement about
 

2881
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,910
excitement about
extraterrestrial life and aliens in this

2882
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:51,920
extraterrestrial life and aliens in this
 

2883
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,870
extraterrestrial life and aliens in this
world

2884
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:52,880
world
 

2885
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,270
world
i mean i don't know what how to

2886
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
i mean i don't know what how to
 

2887
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,309
i mean i don't know what how to
comprehend

2888
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
comprehend
 

2889
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,670
comprehend
that excitement but to me it's great to

2890
00:46:59,670 --> 00:46:59,680
that excitement but to me it's great to
 

2891
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,790
that excitement but to me it's great to
see people

2892
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:00,800
see people
 

2893
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,950
see people
curious because to me extraterrestrial

2894
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
curious because to me extraterrestrial
 

2895
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,630
curious because to me extraterrestrial
life and aliens

2896
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:04,640
life and aliens
 

2897
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,150
life and aliens
is at the core a scientific question

2898
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,160
is at the core a scientific question
 

2899
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,069
is at the core a scientific question
and it's almost looks like people are

2900
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:10,079
and it's almost looks like people are
 

2901
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,910
and it's almost looks like people are
excited about science they're

2902
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:11,920
excited about science they're
 

2903
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,829
excited about science they're
excited by discovery discovery right

2904
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:15,839
excited by discovery discovery right
 

2905
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,589
excited by discovery discovery right
and then the possibility that there's

2906
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:17,599
and then the possibility that there's
 

2907
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,910
and then the possibility that there's
alien life that visited earth

2908
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
alien life that visited earth
 

2909
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,190
alien life that visited earth
or is here on earth now is

2910
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:23,200
or is here on earth now is
 

2911
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,270
or is here on earth now is
is uh excitement about discovery

2912
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:27,280
is uh excitement about discovery
 

2913
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,710
is uh excitement about discovery
in your lifetime essentially i mean

2914
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:30,720
in your lifetime essentially i mean
 

2915
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,150
in your lifetime essentially i mean
what do you make what do you make of

2916
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,160
what do you make what do you make of
 

2917
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,829
what do you make what do you make of
that there's recent events where darpa

2918
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:35,839
that there's recent events where darpa
 

2919
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,109
that there's recent events where darpa
um or dod released footage

2920
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:39,119
um or dod released footage
 

2921
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,790
um or dod released footage
of uh these um unmanned

2922
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:42,800
of uh these um unmanned
 

2923
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,630
of uh these um unmanned
aerial phenomena they're calling them

2924
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:44,640
aerial phenomena they're calling them
 

2925
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,990
aerial phenomena they're calling them
now uap

2926

they got everybody like super excited
 

2929
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,829
they got everybody like super excited
like maybe there is like what

2930
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:49,839
like maybe there is like what
 

2931
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,150
like maybe there is like what
what what's what's here on earth uh do

2932
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:52,160
what what's what's here on earth uh do
 

2933
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,829
what what's what's here on earth uh do
you follow

2934
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
you follow
 

2935
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,630
you follow
the this world of people who are

2936
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:56,640
the this world of people who are
 

2937
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,270
the this world of people who are
thinking about

2938
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:57,280
thinking about
 

2939
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,750
thinking about
aliens that are already here or have

2940
00:47:59,750 --> 00:47:59,760
aliens that are already here or have
 

2941
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,270
aliens that are already here or have
visited i don't really follow it they

2942
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:01,280
visited i don't really follow it they
 

2943
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,030
visited i don't really follow it they
follow me i'd say

2944
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,040
follow me i'd say
 

2945
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,030
follow me i'd say
because in this field if you're a

2946
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
because in this field if you're a
 

2947
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,750
because in this field if you're a
scientist of any kind you get

2948
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:07,760
scientist of any kind you get
 

2949
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,870
scientist of any kind you get
the people contact us me

2950
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:10,880
the people contact us me
 

2951
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,030
the people contact us me
there's a lot of them about hey i have

2952
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,040
there's a lot of them about hey i have
 

2953

stuff you should see
 

2955
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,990
stuff you should see
hey the aliens are already here i need

2956
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,000
hey the aliens are already here i need
 

2957
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,349
hey the aliens are already here i need
to tell you about it

2958
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:17,359
to tell you about it
 

2959
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,630
to tell you about it
and i know there are people out there

2960
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:18,640
and i know there are people out there
 

2961
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,950
and i know there are people out there
who really believe

2962
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:20,960
who really believe
 

2963
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,630
who really believe
there's a psychology to it there's a

2964
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
there's a psychology to it there's a
 

2965
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,990
there's a psychology to it there's a
psychology to it and

2966
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,000
psychology to it and
 

2967
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,910
psychology to it and
it's fascinating but okay so it's

2968
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:25,920
it's fascinating but okay so it's
 

2969
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,430
it's fascinating but okay so it's
similar to artificial intelligence but i

2970
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
similar to artificial intelligence but i
 

2971
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,190
similar to artificial intelligence but i
still but like you i'm still enamored

2972
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,200
still but like you i'm still enamored
 

2973
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,870
still but like you i'm still enamored
with the point that it is out there

2974
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:30,880
with the point that it is out there
 

2975
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,470
with the point that it is out there
and that people believe so strongly and

2976
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:32,480
and that people believe so strongly and
 

2977
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,030
and that people believe so strongly and
that so many people out there

2978
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,040
that so many people out there
 

2979
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,549
that so many people out there
believe i believe and uh

2980
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:38,559
believe i believe and uh
 

2981
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,109
believe i believe and uh
i don't know i i i'm not as allergic to

2982
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:41,119
i don't know i i i'm not as allergic to
 

2983
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:41,589
i don't know i i i'm not as allergic to
it as

2984
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:41,599
it as
 

2985
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,390
it as
some scientists are because ultimately

2986
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:44,400
some scientists are because ultimately
 

2987
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,109
some scientists are because ultimately
if aliens

2988
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
if aliens
 

2989
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,349
if aliens
showed up or do show up or have showed

2990
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:47,359
showed up or do show up or have showed
 

2991
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,109
showed up or do show up or have showed
up

2992
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:49,119
up
 

2993
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,710
up
you know these are going to be very

2994
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:50,720
you know these are going to be very
 

2995
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,109
you know these are going to be very
difficult to study scientific phenomena

2996
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:55,119

 

2997
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,069

like in fact like going back to cats and

2998
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:58,079
like in fact like going back to cats and
 

2999
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:58,549
like in fact like going back to cats and
dogs

3000
00:48:58,549 --> 00:48:58,559
dogs
 

3001
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,829
dogs
like i just i think we should be more

3002
00:49:01,829 --> 00:49:01,839
like i just i think we should be more
 

3003
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,069
like i just i think we should be more
open-minded about

3004
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:04,079
open-minded about
 

3005
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,109
open-minded about
uh developing new tools and looking for

3006
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:07,119
uh developing new tools and looking for
 

3007
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,630
uh developing new tools and looking for
intelligent life on earth that we

3008
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:08,640
intelligent life on earth that we
 

3009
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,069
intelligent life on earth that we
haven't yet found

3010
00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:10,079
haven't yet found
 

3011
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,910
haven't yet found
or even understanding the nature of our

3012
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:11,920
or even understanding the nature of our
 

3013
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,829
or even understanding the nature of our
own intelligence

3014
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:13,839
own intelligence
 

3015
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,630
own intelligence
because it kind of is an alien life form

3016
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
because it kind of is an alien life form
 

3017
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,670
because it kind of is an alien life form
the thing that's living

3018
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:17,680
the thing that's living
 

3019
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,589
the thing that's living
you know in our skull it's so true when

3020
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
you know in our skull it's so true when
 

3021
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:21,190
you know in our skull it's so true when
we don't understand consciousness

3022
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,200
we don't understand consciousness
 

3023
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,150
we don't understand consciousness
yeah it's true we don't understand how

3024
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,160
yeah it's true we don't understand how
 

3025
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,349
yeah it's true we don't understand how
biology is hard

3026
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
biology is hard
 

3027
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,910
biology is hard
you know unpacking it and working it all

3028
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:27,920
you know unpacking it and working it all
 

3029
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,390
you know unpacking it and working it all
out it's a stretch and they say too that

3030
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:30,400
out it's a stretch and they say too that
 

3031
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,390
out it's a stretch and they say too that
our thinking mind is like the tip of the

3032
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:32,400
our thinking mind is like the tip of the
 

3033
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,589
our thinking mind is like the tip of the
pyramid

3034

is that we need to see major evidence

3046
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:46,640
is that we need to see major evidence
 

3047
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,750

not like a sketchy picture of something
 

3049
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,510
not like a sketchy picture of something
we need some cold hard evidence and we

3050
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,520
we need some cold hard evidence and we
 

3051
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,349
we need some cold hard evidence and we
just don't have that

3052
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
just don't have that
 

3053
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,030
just don't have that
that's exactly right but from my

3054
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,040
that's exactly right but from my
 

3055
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,710
that's exactly right but from my
perspective i

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,510
reasonable to think about i don't know
if the observable universe

3232
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:49,520
if the observable universe
 

3233
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,990
if the observable universe
is like way too big to think about but

3234
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,000
is like way too big to think about but
 

3235
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,589
is like way too big to think about but
in terms of when we think about how many

3236
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:53,599
in terms of when we think about how many
 

3237
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,510
in terms of when we think about how many
habitable planets there are

3238
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:55,520
habitable planets there are
 

3239
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,750
habitable planets there are
what are the numbers we're working with

3240
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:57,760
what are the numbers we're working with
 

3241
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,710
what are the numbers we're working with
in your sense

3242
00:52:58,710 --> 00:52:58,720
in your sense
 

3243
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,710
in your sense
what are the scales honestly the numbers

3244
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:00,720
what are the scales honestly the numbers
 

3245
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,950
what are the scales honestly the numbers
are probably like billions of trillions

3246
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:02,960
are probably like billions of trillions
 

3247
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,589
are probably like billions of trillions
of stars yeah you know in the uk i think

3248
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:05,599
of stars yeah you know in the uk i think
 

3249
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,790
of stars yeah you know in the uk i think
i don't know if we do that here but they

3250
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:06,800
i don't know if we do that here but they
 

3251
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,390
i don't know if we do that here but they
will call a billion trillion

3252
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
will call a billion trillion
 

3253
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,990
will call a billion trillion
where you put like 1 billion followed by

3254
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,000
where you put like 1 billion followed by
 

3255
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,430
where you put like 1 billion followed by
a trillion

3256
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,440
a trillion
 

3257
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,790
a trillion
yeah it's kind of weird but here i don't

3258
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:12,800
yeah it's kind of weird but here i don't
 

3259
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,230
yeah it's kind of weird but here i don't
even know how to say the number 10 to

3260
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:14,240
even know how to say the number 10 to
 

3261
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,670
even know how to say the number 10 to
the 20. like if you know what that is

3262
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:15,680
the 20. like if you know what that is
 

3263
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,670
the 20. like if you know what that is
that's 1 followed by 20 zeros that's a

3264
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:17,680
that's 1 followed by 20 zeros that's a
 

3265
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,390
that's 1 followed by 20 zeros that's a
big number

3266
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:18,400
big number
 

3267
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,990
big number
and we don't have a name for that number

3268
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000
and we don't have a name for that number
 

3269
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,750
and we don't have a name for that number
there's so many

3270
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:21,760
there's so many
 

3271
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,430
there's so many
per star i think we kind of mentioned

3272
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:23,440
per star i think we kind of mentioned
 

3273
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,589
per star i think we kind of mentioned
this is there a good sense there's

3274
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:25,599
this is there a good sense there's
 

3275
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,349
this is there a good sense there's
probably argument about this but

3276
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:27,359
probably argument about this but
 

3277
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,270
probably argument about this but
per star how many planets are there

3278
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
per star how many planets are there
 

3279
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,870
per star how many planets are there
is there we don't have that number yet

3280
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:32,880
is there we don't have that number yet
 

3281
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,470
is there we don't have that number yet
per se you know we're not really there

3282
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:34,480
per se you know we're not really there
 

3283
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,109
per se you know we're not really there
but

3284
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:35,119
but
 

3285
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,950
but
some people think that there's many

3286
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:36,960
some people think that there's many
 

3287
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,710
some people think that there's many
planets per star there's this analogy of

3288
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:40,720
planets per star there's this analogy of
 

3289
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,109
planets per star there's this analogy of
filling the coffee cup like you know you

3290
00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:43,119
filling the coffee cup like you know you
 

3291
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,710
filling the coffee cup like you know you
don't usually just pour one drop you

3292
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:44,720
don't usually just pour one drop you
 

3293
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,190
don't usually just pour one drop you
fill it

3294
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:45,200
fill it
 

3295
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,910
fill it
and that planetary systems we see stars

3296
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:47,920
and that planetary systems we see stars
 

3297
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,549
and that planetary systems we see stars
being born

3298
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
being born
 

3299
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,030
being born
that have a disk of gas and dust and

3300
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:51,040
that have a disk of gas and dust and
 

3301
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,030
that have a disk of gas and dust and
that ultimately forms planets

3302
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,040
that ultimately forms planets
 

3303
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,270
that ultimately forms planets
so the idea this kind of concept is that

3304
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:55,280
so the idea this kind of concept is that
 

3305
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,549
so the idea this kind of concept is that
planets

3306
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:56,559
planets
 

3307
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,870
planets
so many planets form too many and

3308
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:58,880
so many planets form too many and
 

3309
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,390
so many planets form too many and
eventually some get kicked out

3310
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:00,400
eventually some get kicked out
 

3311
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,589
eventually some get kicked out
and you're left with like a full

3312
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:01,599
and you're left with like a full
 

3313
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,349
and you're left with like a full
planetary system a dynamically full

3314
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:03,359
planetary system a dynamically full
 

3315
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,950
planetary system a dynamically full
system and so there have to be a lot

3316
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:04,960
system and so there have to be a lot
 

3317
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,910
system and so there have to be a lot
because so many form

3318
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920
because so many form
 

3319
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,790
because so many form
and a bunch survive that i mean that

3320
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800
and a bunch survive that i mean that
 

3321
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,870
and a bunch survive that i mean that
that makes perfect intuitive sense right

3322
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:10,880
that makes perfect intuitive sense right
 

3323
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,109
that makes perfect intuitive sense right
like why wouldn't that happen

3324
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
like why wouldn't that happen
 

3325
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,790
like why wouldn't that happen
right well there's other thoughts too

3326
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:14,800
right well there's other thoughts too
 

3327
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,430
right well there's other thoughts too
though these big planets that are really

3328
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440
though these big planets that are really
 

3329
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,870
though these big planets that are really
close to the star

3330
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:18,880
close to the star
 

3331
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,710
close to the star
we think they formed far away from the

3332
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:20,720
we think they formed far away from the
 

3333
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,230
we think they formed far away from the
star where there's enough material to

3334
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
star where there's enough material to
 

3335
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:22,870
star where there's enough material to
form

3336
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:22,880
form
 

3337
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,349
form
and they migrated inwards and some of

3338
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:25,359
and they migrated inwards and some of
 

3339
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,109
and they migrated inwards and some of
these planets migrating inwards due to

3340
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:27,119
these planets migrating inwards due to
 

3341
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,549
these planets migrating inwards due to
interaction with other planets or with

3342
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:28,559
interaction with other planets or with
 

3343
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,150
interaction with other planets or with
the disk itself they may have cleared it

3344
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:30,160
the disk itself they may have cleared it
 

3345
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,910
the disk itself they may have cleared it
out

3346
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
out
 

3347
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,750
out
like kicked other planets out of the

3348
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:33,760
like kicked other planets out of the
 

3349
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,510
like kicked other planets out of the
system so there's a lot of ideas

3350
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:35,520
system so there's a lot of ideas
 

3351
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,309
system so there's a lot of ideas
floating around

3352
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
floating around
 

3353
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,750
floating around
we're not entirely sure and what about

3354
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:39,760
we're not entirely sure and what about
 

3355
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,510
we're not entirely sure and what about
earth-like planets is that that's

3356
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:41,520
earth-like planets is that that's
 

3357
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,750
earth-like planets is that that's
another level of uncertainty that it's a

3358
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:43,760
another level of uncertainty that it's a
 

3359
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,349
another level of uncertainty that it's a
level of uncertainty if we think of an

3360
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
level of uncertainty if we think of an
 

3361
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,270
level of uncertainty if we think of an
earth-like planet

3362
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
earth-like planet
 

3363
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,430
earth-like planet
being an earth around a sun in the same

we're not there yet you know we're not

we're not there yet you know we're not
able to detect enough of those to

have extrapolated
 

3381
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,589
have extrapolated
and they will say as many as one in five

what's motivating us

3536
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:29,280
what's motivating us
 

3537
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,510
what's motivating us
so really uh you see exploration is a

3538
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:31,520
so really uh you see exploration is a
 

3539
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,109
so really uh you see exploration is a
long term investment into something

3540
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:33,119
long term investment into something
 

3541

but i mean there's an exciting longing
 

3553
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,510
but i mean there's an exciting longing
to um

3554
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
to um
 

3555
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,950
to um
visit earth-like planets elsewhere

3556
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:50,960
visit earth-like planets elsewhere
 

3557
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,069
visit earth-like planets elsewhere
so what's the closest

3558
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:54,079
so what's the closest
 

3559
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,470
so what's the closest
uh earth-like planet you think is worth

3560
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:56,480
uh earth-like planet you think is worth
 

3561
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,670
uh earth-like planet you think is worth
visiting and how

3562
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:57,680
visiting and how
 

3563
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,950
visiting and how
how hard is it wow it is

3564
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:00,960
how hard is it wow it is
 

3565
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,190
how hard is it wow it is
very hard i mean our nearest call it

3566
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:03,200
very hard i mean our nearest call it
 

3567
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,950
very hard i mean our nearest call it
earth mass planet it's orbiting a star

3568
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:04,960
earth mass planet it's orbiting a star
 

3569
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,470
earth mass planet it's orbiting a star
very different from our own sun an m

3570
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480
very different from our own sun an m
 

3571
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,109
very different from our own sun an m
dwarf star

3572
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:07,119
dwarf star
 

3573
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,150
dwarf star
a small red star proxima centauri

3574
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:10,160
a small red star proxima centauri
 

3575
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,789
a small red star proxima centauri
it's over four light years away and we

3576
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:12,799
it's over four light years away and we
 

3577
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,190
it's over four light years away and we
can't travel at the speed of light

3578
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:15,200
can't travel at the speed of light
 

3579
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,870
can't travel at the speed of light
we can't even try i mean it would take

3580
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:16,880
we can't even try i mean it would take
 

3581
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,470
we can't even try i mean it would take
tens of thousands of years to get there

3582
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
tens of thousands of years to get there
 

3583
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,670
tens of thousands of years to get there
with conventional methods so you know

3584
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:19,680
with conventional methods so you know
 

3585
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,030
with conventional methods so you know
the movies like

3586
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:21,040
the movies like
 

3587
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,870
the movies like
multi-dimensional yeah this movie

3588
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:22,880
multi-dimensional yeah this movie
 

3589

multi-dimensional yeah this movie
passenger have you seen that movie

3590
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:24,720
passenger have you seen that movie
 

3591
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,270
passenger have you seen that movie
passenger it's about a big spaceship

3592
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
passenger it's about a big spaceship
 

3593
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,910
passenger it's about a big spaceship
that

3594
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:27,920
that
 

3595
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,430
that
is traveling to another planet and

3596
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,440
is traveling to another planet and
 

3597
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,870
is traveling to another planet and
everyone's hibernating i won't give you

3598
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
everyone's hibernating i won't give you
 

3599

everyone's hibernating i won't give you
the spoiler alert because one person

3600
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:32,160
the spoiler alert because one person
 

3601
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,750
the spoiler alert because one person
wakes up and then it's kind of a problem

3602
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:33,760
wakes up and then it's kind of a problem
 

3603
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,910
wakes up and then it's kind of a problem
okay got it but yeah the

3604
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:35,920
okay got it but yeah the
 

3605
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,390
okay got it but yeah the
multi-generational ships i mean

3606
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:38,400
multi-generational ships i mean
 

3607
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,789
multi-generational ships i mean
when you think about where we're headed

3608
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
when you think about where we're headed
 

3609
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:41,990
when you think about where we're headed
as a species

3610
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:42,000
as a species
 

3611
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,549
as a species
maybe we don't send people maybe we end

3612
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:44,559
maybe we don't send people maybe we end
 

3613
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,710
maybe we don't send people maybe we end
up sending

3614
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:46,720
up sending
 

3615
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,549
up sending
raw biological materials and

3616
00:58:48,549 --> 00:58:48,559
raw biological materials and
 

3617
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,190
raw biological materials and
instructions to print out

3618
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:51,200
instructions to print out
 

3619
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,950
instructions to print out
humans it sounds kind of far-fetched but

3620
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
humans it sounds kind of far-fetched but
 

3621
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,230
humans it sounds kind of far-fetched but
already we're

3622
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:54,240
already we're
 

3623
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,069
already we're
printing like liver cells in the lab and

3624
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
printing like liver cells in the lab and
 

3625
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,150
printing like liver cells in the lab and
beating heart cells

3626
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
beating heart cells
 

3627
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,349
beating heart cells
we're starting to reconstruct body parts

3628
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:01,359
we're starting to reconstruct body parts
 

3629
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,870
we're starting to reconstruct body parts
i mean the thing is it is so hard to get

3630
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:02,880
i mean the thing is it is so hard to get
 

3631
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,589
i mean the thing is it is so hard to get
to another planet that this thought of

3632
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:05,599
to another planet that this thought of
 

3633
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,510
to another planet that this thought of
printing humans or printing life forms

3634
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:07,520
printing humans or printing life forms
 

3635
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,109
printing humans or printing life forms
actually could be easier

3636
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:09,119
actually could be easier
 

3637
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,309
actually could be easier
yeah that's somehow so sad

3638
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:12,319
yeah that's somehow so sad
 

3639
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,549
yeah that's somehow so sad
to think to think of the idea that we

3640
00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:14,559
to think to think of the idea that we
 

3641
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,710
to think to think of the idea that we
would launch a successful

3642
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:16,720
would launch a successful
 

3643
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,589
would launch a successful
spaceship that has multi-generational

3644
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:19,599
spaceship that has multi-generational
 

3645
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:19,990
spaceship that has multi-generational
like

3646
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:20,000
like
 

3647
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,270
like
non-human life and it's going to reach

3648
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,280
non-human life and it's going to reach
 

3649
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,910
non-human life and it's going to reach
other intelligent life and by the time

3650
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
other intelligent life and by the time
 

3651
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,190
other intelligent life and by the time
they figure out where it came from

3652
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:29,200
they figure out where it came from
 

3653
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,990
they figure out where it came from
human civilization will be extinct wow

3654
00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:32,000
human civilization will be extinct wow
 

3655
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,950
human civilization will be extinct wow
yeah that is really

3656
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:32,960
yeah that is really
 

3657
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,030
yeah that is really
exciting that's so that's one you

3658
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:35,040
exciting that's so that's one you
 

3659
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,470
exciting that's so that's one you
there's a there's a tempting thing to

3660
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:36,480
there's a there's a tempting thing to
 

3661
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,589
there's a there's a tempting thing to
think about what are the possible

3662
00:59:37,589 --> 00:59:37,599
think about what are the possible
 

3663
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,190
think about what are the possible
trajectories so

3664
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:39,200
trajectories so
 

3665
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,870
trajectories so
uh you know elon keeps talking about

3666
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:42,880
uh you know elon keeps talking about
 

3667
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,030
uh you know elon keeps talking about
multi-uh planetary

3668
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,040
multi-uh planetary
 

3669
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,589
multi-uh planetary
us becoming multi-planetary species i

3670
00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:47,599
us becoming multi-planetary species i
 

3671
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:48,150
us becoming multi-planetary species i
mean

3672
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:48,160
mean
 

3673
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,190
mean
sure mars is a part of that but like

3674
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:51,200
sure mars is a part of that but like
 

3675
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,950
sure mars is a part of that but like
the dream is to really expand outside

3676
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:54,960
the dream is to really expand outside
 

3677
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,870
the dream is to really expand outside
the solar system

3678
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:56,880
the solar system
 

3679
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,589
the solar system
and it's it's not clear just like as you

3680
00:59:59,589 --> 00:59:59,599
and it's it's not clear just like as you
 

3681
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:00,069
and it's it's not clear just like as you
said

like what the actual scientific
 

3685
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,150
like what the actual scientific
engineering steps that are required

to to take it seems like so daunting

3688
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
to to take it seems like so daunting
 

3689
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,750
to to take it seems like so daunting
so daunting so like this the smart thing

01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,789
so daunting so like this the smart thing
seems to be

3692
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:10,799
seems to be
 

3693
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:13,990
seems to be
to do the most achievable near

3694
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,000
to do the most achievable near
 

3695
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,230
to do the most achievable near
daunting task even if there doesn't seem

daunting task even if there doesn't seem
 

3697
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,069
daunting task even if there doesn't seem
to be a commercial application

3698
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:18,079
to be a commercial application
 

3699
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,510
to be a commercial application
which i think is colonizing mars but

3700
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:21,520
which i think is colonizing mars but
 

3701
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,549
which i think is colonizing mars but
like from your perspective is there some

3702
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:24,559
like from your perspective is there some
 

3703
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,750
like from your perspective is there some
manhattan project style

3704
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:27,760
manhattan project style
 

3705
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,589
manhattan project style
huge project in space that

3706
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:31,599
huge project in space that
 

3707
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,670
huge project in space that
we might want to take on and you've had

3708
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:33,680
we might want to take on and you've had
 

3709
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,710
we might want to take on and you've had
roles

3710
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:34,720
roles
 

3711
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,950
roles
you had scientist hat roles and then you

3712
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
you had scientist hat roles and then you
 

3713
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,630
you had scientist hat roles and then you
also have roles in terms of

3714
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:38,640
also have roles in terms of
 

3715
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,910
also have roles in terms of
being on like committees and stuff

3716
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:39,920
being on like committees and stuff
 

3717
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,990
being on like committees and stuff
determining where funding goes

3718
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,000
determining where funding goes
 

3719
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,270
determining where funding goes
and so on so like is there a huge like

3720
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:45,280
and so on so like is there a huge like
 

3721
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,589
and so on so like is there a huge like
multi-trillion we've been throwing the t

3722
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:47,599
multi-trillion we've been throwing the t
 

3723
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:48,390
multi-trillion we've been throwing the t
word around

3724
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:48,400
word around
 

3725
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,789
word around
recently a lot but these huge projects

3726
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:50,799
recently a lot but these huge projects
 

3727
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:51,990
recently a lot but these huge projects
that we might want to take on

3728
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:52,000
that we might want to take on
 

3729
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,910
that we might want to take on
well first of all we want to find the

3730
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:53,920
well first of all we want to find the
 

3731
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,109
well first of all we want to find the
planets like earth first

3732
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,119
planets like earth first
 

3733
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,630
planets like earth first
like just even finding those earth-like

3734
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:56,640
like just even finding those earth-like
 

3735
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,470
like just even finding those earth-like
planets is a billion dollar endeavor

3736
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:58,480
planets is a billion dollar endeavor
 

3737
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,430
planets is a billion dollar endeavor
billions of dollars endeavor and that's

3738
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
billions of dollars endeavor and that's
 

3739
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,549
billions of dollars endeavor and that's
so hard because

3740
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:02,559
so hard because
 

3741
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,670
so hard because
an earth is so small so less massive and

3742
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:05,680
an earth is so small so less massive and
 

3743
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,829
an earth is so small so less massive and
so faint compared to our sun

3744
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:07,839
so faint compared to our sun
 

3745
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:09,750
so faint compared to our sun
it's the proverbial needle in a haystack

3746
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:09,760
it's the proverbial needle in a haystack
 

3747
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,349
it's the proverbial needle in a haystack
but worse and

3748
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:11,359
but worse and
 

3749
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,510
but worse and
we need very sophisticated space-based

3750
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:13,520
we need very sophisticated space-based
 

3751
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,109
we need very sophisticated space-based
telescopes to be able to find these

3752
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
telescopes to be able to find these
 

3753
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,150
telescopes to be able to find these
planets and to look

3754
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:16,160
planets and to look
 

3755
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,230
planets and to look
look at them and see which ones have

3756
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
look at them and see which ones have
 

3757
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,829
look at them and see which ones have
water and which ones have signs of life

3758
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:19,839
water and which ones have signs of life
 

3759
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:20,230
water and which ones have signs of life
on them

3760
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:20,240
on them
 

3761
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,549
on them
yeah the the star shade project that

3762
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
yeah the the star shade project that
 

3763
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,349
yeah the the star shade project that
your

3764
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:23,359
your
 

3765
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,109
your
shade starship yeah this is probably the

3766
01:01:25,109 --> 01:01:25,119
shade starship yeah this is probably the
 

3767
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,349
shade starship yeah this is probably the
most badass thing i've ever seen right

3768
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:27,359
most badass thing i've ever seen right
 

3769
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:30,150
most badass thing i've ever seen right
you know what's interesting so what's

3770
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160
you know what's interesting so what's
 

3771
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,990
you know what's interesting so what's
amazing about starshade is it was first

3772
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:32,000
amazing about starshade is it was first
 

3773
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,470
amazing about starshade is it was first
conceived of in the 1960s

3774
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:34,480
conceived of in the 1960s
 

3775
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,630
conceived of in the 1960s
imagine that and revisited every decade

3776
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:36,640
imagine that and revisited every decade
 

3777
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,230
imagine that and revisited every decade
until now when we think we can actually

3778
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:38,240
until now when we think we can actually
 

3779
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,990
until now when we think we can actually
build it and starshade

3780
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:40,000
build it and starshade
 

3781
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,950
build it and starshade
is a giant specially shaped screen it is

3782
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:42,960
is a giant specially shaped screen it is
 

3783
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,910
is a giant specially shaped screen it is
about

3784
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:43,920
about
 

3785
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,109
about
there's different versions of it but

3786
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:45,119
there's different versions of it but
 

3787
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,430
there's different versions of it but
think about 30 meters in diameter

3788
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:47,440
think about 30 meters in diameter
 

3789
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,670
think about 30 meters in diameter
so you're blocking out the sun you're

3790
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:49,680
so you're blocking out the sun you're
 

3791
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,990
so you're blocking out the sun you're
effectively blocking out the star

3792
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:52,000
effectively blocking out the star
 

3793
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,430
effectively blocking out the star
yeah so that you can see the planet

3794
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
yeah so that you can see the planet
 

3795
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,109
yeah so that you can see the planet
directly and starshade

3796
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:55,119
directly and starshade
 

3797
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,710
directly and starshade
would have a spacecraft attached to it

3798
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:56,720
would have a spacecraft attached to it
 

3799
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,230
would have a spacecraft attached to it
and it would fly in space

3800
01:01:58,230 --> 01:01:58,240
and it would fly in space
 

3801
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,150
and it would fly in space
far away from earth's gravity and it

3802
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:00,160
far away from earth's gravity and it
 

3803
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,910
far away from earth's gravity and it
would have to formation fly with a space

3804
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:01,920
would have to formation fly with a space
 

3805
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,430
would have to formation fly with a space
telescope

3806
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:03,440
telescope
 

3807
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,190
telescope
so the idea is that starshade blocks out

3808
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,200
so the idea is that starshade blocks out
 

3809
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,829
so the idea is that starshade blocks out
the starlight in a very careful way

3810
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
the starlight in a very careful way
 

3811
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,150
the starlight in a very careful way
and it has to block that starlight out

3812
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:10,160
and it has to block that starlight out
 

3813
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,510
and it has to block that starlight out
so that the planet

3814
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,520
so that the planet
 

3815
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,270
so that the planet
that is 10 billion times fainter than

3816
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:13,280
that is 10 billion times fainter than
 

3817
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,750
that is 10 billion times fainter than
the star that only the planet light

3818
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:15,760
the star that only the planet light
 

3819
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,190
the star that only the planet light
goes to the telescope yeah so

3820
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,200
goes to the telescope yeah so
 

3821
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,309
goes to the telescope yeah so
in formation meaning the telescope flies

3822
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:22,319
in formation meaning the telescope flies
 

3823
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:24,230
in formation meaning the telescope flies
and um as you're giving a presentation

3824
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240
and um as you're giving a presentation
 

3825
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,390
and um as you're giving a presentation
on this but like it it would fly

3826
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:26,400
on this but like it it would fly
 

3827
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,430
on this but like it it would fly
like and um this is extremely

3828
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:29,440
like and um this is extremely
 

3829
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,829
like and um this is extremely
high precision endeavor yeah we had this

3830
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:31,839
high precision endeavor yeah we had this
 

3831
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:32,789
high precision endeavor yeah we had this
analogy like

3832
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:32,799
analogy like
 

3833
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:34,950
analogy like
asking a friend to hold up a dime five

3834
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
asking a friend to hold up a dime five
 

3835
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,230
asking a friend to hold up a dime five
miles away yeah

3836
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:36,240
miles away yeah
 

3837
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,069
miles away yeah
perfectly like at the perfect line of

3838
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:38,079
perfectly like at the perfect line of
 

3839
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,230
perfectly like at the perfect line of
sight with you yeah

3840
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:40,240
sight with you yeah
 

3841
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,670
sight with you yeah
and the shape of it is pretty cool i

3842
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:41,680
and the shape of it is pretty cool i
 

3843
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,670
and the shape of it is pretty cool i
mean uh i don't know exactly what the

3844
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:43,680
mean uh i don't know exactly what the
 

3845
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,670
mean uh i don't know exactly what the
physics of that like what the optics are

3846
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
physics of that like what the optics are
 

3847
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,910
physics of that like what the optics are
that require that shape i can tell you

3848
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:47,920
that require that shape i can tell you
 

3849
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,430
that require that shape i can tell you
it turns out that if you block out a

3850
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:49,440
it turns out that if you block out a
 

3851
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:49,910
it turns out that if you block out a
star

3852
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:49,920
star
 

3853
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,430
star
imagine blocking out a star with a

3854
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:51,440
imagine blocking out a star with a
 

3855
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,430
imagine blocking out a star with a
circle circularly or a square shaped

3856
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,440
circle circularly or a square shaped
 

3857
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,549
circle circularly or a square shaped
screen

3858
01:02:54,549 --> 01:02:54,559
screen
 

3859
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,870
screen
you wouldn't actually be blocking it

3860
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:56,880
you wouldn't actually be blocking it
 

3861
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,829
you wouldn't actually be blocking it
because the star

3862
01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:57,839
because the star
 

3863
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,430
because the star
acts like a wave the starlight can act

3864
01:02:59,430 --> 01:02:59,440
acts like a wave the starlight can act
 

3865
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,870
acts like a wave the starlight can act
like a wave and it would actually

3866
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:00,880
like a wave and it would actually
 

3867
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,750
like a wave and it would actually
bend around the edges of the screen and

3868
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:03,760
bend around the edges of the screen and
 

3869
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,029
bend around the edges of the screen and
so instead of blocking out the light

3870
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:05,039
so instead of blocking out the light
 

3871
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,309
so instead of blocking out the light
you're expecting to see nothing you

3872
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:06,319
you're expecting to see nothing you
 

3873
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,470
you're expecting to see nothing you
would see ripples

3874
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:08,480
would see ripples
 

3875
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,230
would see ripples
and the analogy that i love to give it's

3876
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
and the analogy that i love to give it's
 

3877
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,150
and the analogy that i love to give it's
like throwing a pebble in a pond

3878
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:12,160
like throwing a pebble in a pond
 

3879
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,670
like throwing a pebble in a pond
you get those ripples you get these

3880
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:13,680
you get those ripples you get these
 

3881
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,190
you get those ripples you get these
concentric

3882
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:15,200
concentric
 

3883
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,630
concentric
ripples and they go out and light would

3884
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640
ripples and they go out and light would
 

3885
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,390
ripples and they go out and light would
do something quite similar

3886
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,400
do something quite similar
 

3887
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,549
do something quite similar
you'd actually see ripples of light and

3888
01:03:20,549 --> 01:03:20,559
you'd actually see ripples of light and
 

3889
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,470
you'd actually see ripples of light and
those ripples of light

3890
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:22,480
those ripples of light
 

3891
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,990
those ripples of light
they're actually way brighter than the

3892
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,000
they're actually way brighter than the
 

3893
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,230
they're actually way brighter than the
planet we'd be looking for

3894
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:26,240
planet we'd be looking for
 

3895
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,829
planet we'd be looking for
so yeah so they would introduce this

3896
01:03:27,829 --> 01:03:27,839
so yeah so they would introduce this
 

3897
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,910
so yeah so they would introduce this
noise that's yeah noise and so this star

3898
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:29,920
noise that's yeah noise and so this star
 

3899
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,549
noise that's yeah noise and so this star
shade

3900
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:30,559
shade
 

3901
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,390
shade
it's like a mathematical solution to the

3902
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,400
it's like a mathematical solution to the
 

3903
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,950
it's like a mathematical solution to the
problem of diffraction it's called

3904
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:34,960
problem of diffraction it's called
 

3905
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,430
problem of diffraction it's called
and this is what the first person who

3906
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
and this is what the first person who
 

3907
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,190
and this is what the first person who
thought about star shade in the 1960s

3908
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
thought about star shade in the 1960s
 

3909
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,430
thought about star shade in the 1960s
worked out the mathematical shape or one

3910
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
worked out the mathematical shape or one
 

3911
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,910
worked out the mathematical shape or one
solute one family of solutions and the

3912
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:43,920
solute one family of solutions and the
 

3913
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,510
solute one family of solutions and the
idea is that when the star shade

3914
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520
idea is that when the star shade
 

3915
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,270
idea is that when the star shade
this very special shape like a giant

3916
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,280
this very special shape like a giant
 

3917
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,029
this very special shape like a giant
flower with petals

3918
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,039
flower with petals
 

3919
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,990
flower with petals
when it blocks out the light the light

3920
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,000
when it blocks out the light the light
 

3921
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,589
when it blocks out the light the light
bends around the edges but interacts

3922
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:53,599
bends around the edges but interacts
 

3923
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,510
bends around the edges but interacts
with itself in a way to give you a very

3924
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:55,520
with itself in a way to give you a very
 

3925
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,029
with itself in a way to give you a very
very dark image

3926
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:57,039
very dark image
 

3927
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,470
very dark image
it would be like throwing a pebble in a

3928
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:58,480
it would be like throwing a pebble in a
 

3929
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,670
it would be like throwing a pebble in a
pond and instead of getting ripples

3930
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:01,680
pond and instead of getting ripples
 

3931
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,829
pond and instead of getting ripples
the pond would be perfectly smooth like

3932
01:04:03,829 --> 01:04:03,839
the pond would be perfectly smooth like
 

3933
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,670
the pond would be perfectly smooth like
incredibly smooth to one part in 10

3934
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:05,680
incredibly smooth to one part in 10
 

3935
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,470
incredibly smooth to one part in 10
billion

3936
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
billion
 

3937
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,230
billion
and all the waves would be on the outer

3938
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:08,240
and all the waves would be on the outer
 

3939
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,910
and all the waves would be on the outer
edges far away from where you dropped

3940
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:09,920
edges far away from where you dropped
 

3941
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,470
edges far away from where you dropped
that petal

3942
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:10,480
that petal
 

3943
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,029
that petal
pebble and so what this camera would be

3944
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:13,039
pebble and so what this camera would be
 

3945
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:13,670
pebble and so what this camera would be
able to

3946
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:13,680
able to
 

3947
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,589
able to
uh this camera this telescope would be

3948
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:15,599
uh this camera this telescope would be
 

3949
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:16,950
uh this camera this telescope would be
able to

3950
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:16,960
able to
 

3951
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,190
able to
get uh get some signal from the planet

3952
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:19,200
get uh get some signal from the planet
 

3953
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,789
get uh get some signal from the planet
then yes and it would be hard because

3954
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:20,799
then yes and it would be hard because
 

3955
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,630
then yes and it would be hard because
the planet is so faint but with the star

3956
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:22,640
the planet is so faint but with the star
 

3957
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,470
the planet is so faint but with the star
out of the way the glare of that bright

3958
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:24,480
out of the way the glare of that bright
 

3959
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,589
out of the way the glare of that bright
bright bright star

3960
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:25,599
bright bright star
 

3961
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,470
bright bright star
with that out of the way then it becomes

3962
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:28,480
with that out of the way then it becomes
 

3963
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,309
with that out of the way then it becomes
a much more manageable task

3964
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:30,319
a much more manageable task
 

3965
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,230
a much more manageable task
so how do we get that thing out there

3966
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:32,240
so how do we get that thing out there
 

3967
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,150
so how do we get that thing out there
we're working with unlimited money okay

3968
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:34,160
we're working with unlimited money okay
 

3969
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,670
we're working with unlimited money okay
working with unlimited money um

3970
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:35,680
working with unlimited money um
 

3971
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,589
working with unlimited money um
we have some more engineering problems

3972
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:37,599
we have some more engineering problems
 

3973
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:38,950
we have some more engineering problems
to solve but not too many more

3974
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:38,960
to solve but not too many more
 

3975
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,710
to solve but not too many more
we've been burning down our so-called

3976
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:40,720
we've been burning down our so-called
 

3977
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,230
we've been burning down our so-called
tall pool list

3978
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,240
tall pool list
 

3979
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,750
tall pool list
and then we just what kind of list we

3980
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:43,760
and then we just what kind of list we
 

3981
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,270
and then we just what kind of list we
call it tall techno

3982
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
call it tall techno
 

3983
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,990
call it tall techno
uh technology tall pole it's the phrase

3984
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
uh technology tall pole it's the phrase
 

3985
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,870
uh technology tall pole it's the phrase
where

3986
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:48,880
where
 

3987
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,069
where
you have to figure out what are your

3988
01:04:50,069 --> 01:04:50,079
you have to figure out what are your
 

3989
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,069
you have to figure out what are your
hardest problems and then break those

3990
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079
hardest problems and then break those
 

3991
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:52,870
hardest problems and then break those
down to solve

3992
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:52,880
down to solve
 

3993
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,029
down to solve
so the starshade one of the really hard

3994
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:55,039
so the starshade one of the really hard
 

3995
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,109
so the starshade one of the really hard
problems was how did formation fly

3996
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:57,119
problems was how did formation fly
 

3997
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,750
problems was how did formation fly
at tens of thousands of kilometers it's

3998
01:04:59,750 --> 01:04:59,760
at tens of thousands of kilometers it's
 

3999
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,390
at tens of thousands of kilometers it's
like wow

4000
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:00,400
like wow
 

4001
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,950
like wow
that is insane and the team broke that

4002
01:05:02,950 --> 01:05:02,960
that is insane and the team broke that
 

4003
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,270
that is insane and the team broke that
down actually into a sensing problem

4004
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:05,280
down actually into a sensing problem
 

4005
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,270
down actually into a sensing problem
because of the star shade how do you see

4006
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:07,280
because of the star shade how do you see
 

4007
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,270
because of the star shade how do you see
the star shade precisely enough to

4008
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:09,280
the star shade precisely enough to
 

4009
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,029
the star shade precisely enough to
to control it because if you're shining

4010
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:11,039
to control it because if you're shining
 

4011
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:12,549
to control it because if you're shining
a flashlight you know the beam spreads

4012
01:05:12,549 --> 01:05:12,559
a flashlight you know the beam spreads
 

4013
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:13,510
a flashlight you know the beam spreads
out

4014
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:13,520
out
 

4015
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,670
out
so the star shade has a beacon an led or

4016
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:15,680
so the star shade has a beacon an led or
 

4017
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,750
so the star shade has a beacon an led or
a laser it's going to spread out so much

4018
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:17,760
a laser it's going to spread out so much
 

4019
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,910
a laser it's going to spread out so much
by the time it gets to the telescope the

4020
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:19,920
by the time it gets to the telescope the
 

4021
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,589
by the time it gets to the telescope the
problem wasn't how do you tell the star

4022
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:21,599
problem wasn't how do you tell the star
 

4023
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,029
problem wasn't how do you tell the star
shade how to move around fast enough to

4024
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:23,039
shade how to move around fast enough to
 

4025
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,390
shade how to move around fast enough to
stay in a straight line

4026
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
stay in a straight line
 

4027
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,069
stay in a straight line
the problem was how do you how are you

4028
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
the problem was how do you how are you
 

4029
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,150
the problem was how do you how are you
able to sense it well enough so

4030
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,160
able to sense it well enough so
 

4031
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,470
able to sense it well enough so
problems like that were broken down and

4032
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,480
problems like that were broken down and
 

4033
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,150
problems like that were broken down and
money that came from nasa to solve

4034
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,160
money that came from nasa to solve
 

4035
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,190
money that came from nasa to solve
problems is

4036
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,200
problems is
 

4037
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,109
problems is
put towards solving it so we're we've

4038
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:35,119
put towards solving it so we're we've
 

4039
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,470
put towards solving it so we're we've
got through most of the hard problems

4040
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,480
got through most of the hard problems
 

4041
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,670
got through most of the hard problems
right now another one

4042
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:37,680
right now another one
 

4043
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,589
right now another one
was that star shade even though it's

4044
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:39,599
was that star shade even though it's
 

4045
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:40,789
was that star shade even though it's
looking at a star

4046
01:05:40,789 --> 01:05:40,799
looking at a star
 

4047
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:43,029
looking at a star
light from our own sun could hit the

4048
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:43,039
light from our own sun could hit the
 

4049
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,630
light from our own sun could hit the
edges of the star shade

4050
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
edges of the star shade
 

4051
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,549
edges of the star shade
and bounce off into the telescope

4052
01:05:46,549 --> 01:05:46,559
and bounce off into the telescope
 

4053
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,470
and bounce off into the telescope
believe it or not

4054
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:48,480
believe it or not
 

4055
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,270
believe it or not
and that would actually ruin it because

4056
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,280
and that would actually ruin it because
 

4057
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,470
and that would actually ruin it because
we're trying to see this tiny tiny

4058
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:52,480
we're trying to see this tiny tiny
 

4059
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,589
we're trying to see this tiny tiny
signal so then the question is how do

4060
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:53,599
signal so then the question is how do
 

4061
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,349
signal so then the question is how do
you make a razor thin edge

4062
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:55,359
you make a razor thin edge
 

4063
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:56,710
you make a razor thin edge
like those petal edges would be like

4064
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:56,720
like those petal edges would be like
 

4065
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,390
like those petal edges would be like
have to be like a razor

4066
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:58,400
have to be like a razor
 

4067
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,309
have to be like a razor
what materials can you so there's a

4068
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:00,319
what materials can you so there's a
 

4069
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,990
what materials can you so there's a
series of problems like that so wow so

4070
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000
series of problems like that so wow so
 

4071
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,670
series of problems like that so wow so
there's a materials problem in there

4072
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:03,680
there's a materials problem in there
 

4073
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,309
there's a materials problem in there
some of them

4074
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319

 

4075
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,870

and there's one so we almost finished

4076
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:08,880
and there's one so we almost finished
 

4077
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,390
and there's one so we almost finished
solving all those problems and then it's

4078
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:10,400
solving all those problems and then it's
 

4079
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,910
solving all those problems and then it's
just a matter of

4080
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:11,920
just a matter of
 

4081
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,910
just a matter of
building one and testing it in a full

4082
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:13,920
building one and testing it in a full
 

4083
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,150
building one and testing it in a full
scale size facility

4084
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:16,160
scale size facility
 

4085
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:17,990
scale size facility
and then building the telescope it's

4086
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:18,000
and then building the telescope it's
 

4087
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,109
and then building the telescope it's
just a matter of time to build

4088
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:19,119
just a matter of time to build
 

4089
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:19,750
just a matter of time to build
everything

4090
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:19,760
everything
 

4091
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,549
everything
and get it get it up for lunch so this

4092
01:06:22,549 --> 01:06:22,559
and get it get it up for lunch so this
 

4093
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:23,029
and get it get it up for lunch so this
is

4094
01:06:23,029 --> 01:06:23,039
is
 

4095
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,109
is
an easy close engineering yes this is an

4096
01:06:25,109 --> 01:06:25,119
an easy close engineering yes this is an
 

4097
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,230
an easy close engineering yes this is an
engineering project

4098
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,240
engineering project
 

4099
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,309
engineering project
it's a real engineering project so i

4100
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:28,319
it's a real engineering project so i
 

4101
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,589
it's a real engineering project so i
actually can tell you about two other

4102
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:29,599
actually can tell you about two other
 

4103
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,150
actually can tell you about two other
projects that are not mine

4104
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:32,160
projects that are not mine
 

4105
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,430
projects that are not mine
i like to call starshade mine because

4106
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:35,440
i like to call starshade mine because
 

4107
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,510
i like to call starshade mine because
it was my project that i helped make it

4108
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:37,520
it was my project that i helped make it
 

4109
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,789
it was my project that i helped make it
mainstream

4110
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:38,799
mainstream
 

4111
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:40,630
mainstream
where that line is constantly shifting

4112
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:40,640
where that line is constantly shifting
 

4113
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,990
where that line is constantly shifting
when i started when i got this

4114
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,000
when i started when i got this
 

4115
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,510
when i started when i got this
leadership role on starshade

4116
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
leadership role on starshade
 

4117
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,510
leadership role on starshade
i remember telling people about it and

4118
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:45,520
i remember telling people about it and
 

4119
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,950
i remember telling people about it and
it was definitely not on the mainstream

4120
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:46,960
it was definitely not on the mainstream
 

4121
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,670
it was definitely not on the mainstream
okay line

4122
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:47,680
okay line
 

4123
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,109
okay line
it was on the giggle factor side of the

4124
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:49,119
it was on the giggle factor side of the
 

4125
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,589
it was on the giggle factor side of the
line and people would just laugh like

4126
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:51,599
line and people would just laugh like
 

4127
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:52,950
line and people would just laugh like
that's dead like you could never

4128
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:52,960
that's dead like you could never
 

4129
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,069
that's dead like you could never
formation fly

4130
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:54,079
formation fly
 

4131
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,430
formation fly
or they'd say why are you working on

4132
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:55,440
or they'd say why are you working on
 

4133
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,349
or they'd say why are you working on
that that's just so not it's not this is

4134
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:57,359
that that's just so not it's not this is
 

4135
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:57,990
that that's just so not it's not this is
so awesome

4136
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
so awesome
 

4137
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,589
so awesome
there's a there's a few things you've

4138
01:06:59,589 --> 01:06:59,599
there's a there's a few things you've
 

4139
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:00,950
there's a there's a few things you've
done in your life and that's when i

4140
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:00,960
done in your life and that's when i
 

4141
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,270
done in your life and that's when i
first

4142
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:01,280
first
 

4143
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,470
first
saw starshine i was like what really

4144
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,480
saw starshine i was like what really
 

4145
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,430
saw starshine i was like what really
and then like it sinks in i mean it's

4146
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,440
and then like it sinks in i mean it's
 

4147
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,349
and then like it sinks in i mean it's
the same thing i felt with like elon

4148
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:09,359
the same thing i felt with like elon
 

4149
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,589
the same thing i felt with like elon
musk or certain people who do crazy

4150
01:07:11,589 --> 01:07:11,599
musk or certain people who do crazy
 

4151
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:12,950
musk or certain people who do crazy
stuff

4152
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:12,960
stuff
 

4153
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,109
stuff
like and then and they get they actually

4154
01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:15,119
like and then and they get they actually
 

4155
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,069
like and then and they get they actually
make it work

4156
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:16,079
make it work
 

4157
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,710
make it work
i mean if you get started in formation

4158
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
i mean if you get started in formation
 

4159
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,910
i mean if you get started in formation
flying

4160
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:19,920
flying
 

4161
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,029
flying
to like together i mean how awesome is

4162
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:23,039
to like together i mean how awesome is
 

4163
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:23,349
to like together i mean how awesome is
that

4164
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:23,359
that
 

4165
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,829
that
if you actually make that happen even

4166
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:25,839
if you actually make that happen even
 

4167
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,430
if you actually make that happen even
like from a robot i'm sorry from the

4168
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:27,440
like from a robot i'm sorry from the
 

4169
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,109
like from a robot i'm sorry from the
robotics perspective

4170
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
robotics perspective
 

4171
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,710
robotics perspective
even if it doesn't give us good data

4172
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:30,720
even if it doesn't give us good data
 

4173
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,390
even if it doesn't give us good data
that's just like a cool thing

4174
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:32,400
that's just like a cool thing
 

4175
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,829
that's just like a cool thing
to get out there i mean it's really

4176
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:33,839
to get out there i mean it's really
 

4177
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,910
to get out there i mean it's really
exciting really cool so there's two

4178
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:35,920
exciting really cool so there's two
 

4179
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,430
exciting really cool so there's two
other topics that aren't mine but i

4180
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:37,440
other topics that aren't mine but i
 

4181
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,109
other topics that aren't mine but i
still love them

4182
01:07:39,109 --> 01:07:39,119
still love them
 

4183
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:40,309
still love them
one of them let's just talk about it

4184
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:40,319
one of them let's just talk about it
 

4185
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,549
one of them let's just talk about it
briefly because it's not a probe but

4186
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:42,559
briefly because it's not a probe but
 

4187
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,549
briefly because it's not a probe but
it's the idea to send a telescope very

4188
01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:44,559
it's the idea to send a telescope very
 

4189
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,630
it's the idea to send a telescope very
far away to 500 times the earth sun

4190
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:46,640
far away to 500 times the earth sun
 

4191
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:47,589
far away to 500 times the earth sun
distance

4192
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:47,599
distance
 

4193
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,190
distance
and this is way farther than the voyager

4194
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:49,200
and this is way farther than the voyager
 

4195
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,870
and this is way farther than the voyager
spacecrafts are right now

4196
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:50,880
spacecrafts are right now
 

4197
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,829
spacecrafts are right now
and to use our sun as a gravitational

4198
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:53,839
and to use our sun as a gravitational
 

4199
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:54,630
and to use our sun as a gravitational
lens

4200
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
lens
 

4201
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,470
lens
to use our sun to magnify something

4202
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
to use our sun to magnify something
 

4203
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,950
to use our sun to magnify something
that's behind it

4204
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960
that's behind it
 

4205
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,870
that's behind it
it's got to sink in for a minute yeah

4206
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:00,880
it's got to sink in for a minute yeah
 

4207
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,630
it's got to sink in for a minute yeah
exactly but i mean

4208
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:02,640
exactly but i mean
 

4209
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,910
exactly but i mean
i don't know what the physics of that is

4210
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:03,920
i don't know what the physics of that is
 

4211
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,990
i don't know what the physics of that is
like how to use the sun in astronomy and

4212
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,000
like how to use the sun in astronomy and
 

4213
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,470
like how to use the sun in astronomy and
einstein thought about this initially

4214
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:08,480
einstein thought about this initially
 

4215
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,910
einstein thought about this initially
we can use uh massive objects bend space

4216
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:11,920
we can use uh massive objects bend space
 

4217
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,510
we can use uh massive objects bend space
and so light that should be traveling

4218
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:13,520
and so light that should be traveling
 

4219
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,349
and so light that should be traveling
like straight it actually

4220
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:15,359
like straight it actually
 

4221
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,470
like straight it actually
travels around the warped space and

4222
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:18,480
travels around the warped space and
 

4223
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:19,269
travels around the warped space and
somehow

4224
01:08:19,269 --> 01:08:19,279
somehow
 

4225
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:21,189
somehow
you figure out a way to use that for

4226
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:21,199
you figure out a way to use that for
 

4227
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:22,789
you figure out a way to use that for
magnification

4228
01:08:22,789 --> 01:08:22,799
magnification
 

4229
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,309
magnification
you have a way to use that for

4230
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:24,319
you have a way to use that for
 

4231
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:25,829
you have a way to use that for
magnification that's right

4232
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
magnification that's right
 

4233
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,030
magnification that's right
there are galaxies uh that are lens

4234
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:29,040
there are galaxies uh that are lens
 

4235
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,470
there are galaxies uh that are lens
so-called gravitational lens by

4236
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:30,480
so-called gravitational lens by
 

4237
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,390
so-called gravitational lens by
intervening galaxy

4238
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:32,400
intervening galaxy
 

4239
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,590
intervening galaxy
clusters actually and there are

4240
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:35,600
clusters actually and there are
 

4241
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,910
clusters actually and there are
microlensing events where stars get

4242
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:37,920
microlensing events where stars get
 

4243
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,030
microlensing events where stars get
magnified

4244
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:39,040
magnified
 

4245
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,950
magnified
as an unseen gravitational lens star

4246
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:40,960
as an unseen gravitational lens star
 

4247
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:42,470
as an unseen gravitational lens star
passes in between us and that very

4248
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
passes in between us and that very
 

4249
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,349
passes in between us and that very
distant star

4250
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:43,359
distant star
 

4251
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,829
distant star
it's actually a real tool in astronomy

4252
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:45,839
it's actually a real tool in astronomy
 

4253
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:47,510
it's actually a real tool in astronomy
yeah using gravitational lens

4254
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:47,520
yeah using gravitational lens
 

4255
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,269
yeah using gravitational lens
to magnify because it bends more rays

4256
01:08:49,269 --> 01:08:49,279
to magnify because it bends more rays
 

4257
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,950
to magnify because it bends more rays
towards you than normally would

4258
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:50,960
towards you than normally would
 

4259
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,870
towards you than normally would
you normally see and again we're trying

4260
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:52,880
you normally see and again we're trying
 

4261
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,309
you normally see and again we're trying
to get more

4262
01:08:54,309 --> 01:08:54,319
to get more
 

4263
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,430
to get more
higher resolution images

4264
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:57,440
higher resolution images
 

4265
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,829
higher resolution images
that are basically boiled down to light

4266
01:08:59,829 --> 01:08:59,839
that are basically boiled down to light
 

4267
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,510
that are basically boiled down to light
well it boils down to light

4268
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:01,520
well it boils down to light
 

4269
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,430
well it boils down to light
and then you can maybe get more

4270
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:03,440
and then you can maybe get more
 

4271
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,349
and then you can maybe get more
information about

4272
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:05,359
information about
 

4273
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,749
information about
well in this case you would ask me let's

4274
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:07,759
well in this case you would ask me let's
 

4275
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:08,550
well in this case you would ask me let's
say

4276
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,560
say
 

4277
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,470
say
if this thing could get built it would

4278
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
if this thing could get built it would
 

4279
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,590
if this thing could get built it would
take

4280
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:11,600
take
 

4281
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,950
take
like something like they'd like to say

4282
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
like something like they'd like to say
 

4283
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,110
like something like they'd like to say
25 years to get from here to there

4284
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,120
25 years to get from here to there
 

4285
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,709
25 years to get from here to there
25 years and then it could send some

4286
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:16,719
25 years and then it could send some
 

4287
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,470
25 years and then it could send some
information back to us and then you'd

4288
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:18,480
information back to us and then you'd
 

4289
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,229
information back to us and then you'd
say so sarah how many pixels

4290
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:20,239
say so sarah how many pixels
 

4291
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:21,749
say so sarah how many pixels
and i wouldn't say one or less than one

4292
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:21,759
and i wouldn't say one or less than one
 

4293
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,829
and i wouldn't say one or less than one
i'd say you know it could be like 10 by

4294
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:23,839
i'd say you know it could be like 10 by
 

4295
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,870
i'd say you know it could be like 10 by
10 pixels

4296
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:24,880
10 pixels
 

4297
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,390
10 pixels
it could be 100 pixels which would be

4298
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
it could be 100 pixels which would be
 

4299
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,470
it could be 100 pixels which would be
awesome i mean it's still crazy that we

4300
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:28,480
awesome i mean it's still crazy that we
 

4301
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,550
awesome i mean it's still crazy that we
can get a lot of information from that

4302
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:30,560
can get a lot of information from that
 

4303
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,149
can get a lot of information from that
crazy right and it's crazy for a lot of

4304
01:09:32,149 --> 01:09:32,159
crazy right and it's crazy for a lot of
 

4305
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:33,590
crazy right and it's crazy for a lot of
other reasons because again you have to

4306
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:33,600
other reasons because again you have to
 

4307
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,349
other reasons because again you have to
line up the sun and your target

4308
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:35,359
line up the sun and your target
 

4309
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,829
line up the sun and your target
you'd only have one telescope per target

4310
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
you'd only have one telescope per target
 

4311
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:38,950
you'd only have one telescope per target
because every star

4312
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:38,960
because every star
 

4313
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,229
because every star
is behind the sun in a different way

4314
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:42,239
is behind the sun in a different way
 

4315
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:43,990
is behind the sun in a different way
so it's a lot of complicated things but

4316
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:44,000
so it's a lot of complicated things but
 

4317
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,510
so it's a lot of complicated things but
what about the second the second one

4318
01:09:45,510 --> 01:09:45,520
what about the second the second one
 

4319
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,110
what about the second the second one
it's called starshot you know starshot

4320
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:49,120
it's called starshot you know starshot
 

4321
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:49,829
it's called starshot you know starshot
means like

4322
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:49,839
means like
 

4323
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:53,110
means like
big dreams and it's an initiative by the

4324
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:53,120
big dreams and it's an initiative by the
 

4325
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,350
big dreams and it's an initiative by the
breakthrough foundation

4326
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:55,360
breakthrough foundation
 

4327
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,030
breakthrough foundation
and starshot is the concept to send

4328
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
and starshot is the concept to send
 

4329
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,149
and starshot is the concept to send
thousands of little tiny spacecraft

4330
01:10:02,149 --> 01:10:02,159
thousands of little tiny spacecraft
 

4331
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:03,990
thousands of little tiny spacecraft
which they now call star chip so instead

4332
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:04,000
which they now call star chip so instead
 

4333
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,310
which they now call star chip so instead
of star ship it's star chip

4334
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:06,320
of star ship it's star chip
 

4335
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,910
of star ship it's star chip
and there's a little chip and the star

4336
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:09,920
and there's a little chip and the star
 

4337
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,470
and there's a little chip and the star
chip

4338
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:10,480
chip
 

4339
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,189
chip
so like sending like thousands of little

4340
01:10:13,189 --> 01:10:13,199
so like sending like thousands of little
 

4341
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:14,470
so like sending like thousands of little
turtles being born they're not all going

4342
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:14,480
turtles being born they're not all going
 

4343
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,189
turtles being born they're not all going
to make it

4344
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:15,199
to make it
 

4345
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,630
to make it
mm-hmm because they used to send lots of

4346
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:16,640
mm-hmm because they used to send lots of
 

4347
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,390
mm-hmm because they used to send lots of
them and each of these star

4348
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:18,400
them and each of these star
 

4349
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,669
them and each of these star
chips once they're launched into

4350
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:21,679
chips once they're launched into
 

4351
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,070
chips once they're launched into
i guess low-earth orbit they will deploy

4352
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:24,080
i guess low-earth orbit they will deploy
 

4353
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,430
i guess low-earth orbit they will deploy
a solar sail

4354
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:25,440
a solar sail
 

4355
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,750
a solar sail
that's a few meters in diameter and

4356
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
that's a few meters in diameter and
 

4357
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,709
that's a few meters in diameter and
they'd use it on

4358
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:28,719
they'd use it on
 

4359
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,870
they'd use it on
earth we would have a bank of

4360
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:32,880
earth we would have a bank of
 

4361
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,149
earth we would have a bank of
this one is still a bit on the other

4362
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:34,159
this one is still a bit on the other
 

4363
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:37,830
this one is still a bit on the other
side of the line but we'd have a bank of

4364
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:37,840
side of the line but we'd have a bank of
 

4365
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,470
side of the line but we'd have a bank of
telescopes with lasers there'd be like a

4366
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:40,480
telescopes with lasers there'd be like a
 

4367
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,630
telescopes with lasers there'd be like a
gigawatt power

4368
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:42,640
gigawatt power
 

4369
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,430
gigawatt power
and these lasers would momentarily shine

4370
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:45,440
and these lasers would momentarily shine
 

4371
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,030
and these lasers would momentarily shine
upwards

4372
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:47,040
upwards
 

4373
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,030
upwards
and accelerate they'd hit these sails

4374
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:49,040
and accelerate they'd hit these sails
 

4375
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,310
and accelerate they'd hit these sails
they'd be like a power source for the

sail
 

4379
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,310
sail
and would accelerate the sails to travel

4380
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:54,320
and would accelerate the sails to travel
 

4381
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,110
and would accelerate the sails to travel
at about a 20th the speed of light

01:10:59,669 --> 01:10:59,679
is that is that as crazy as it sounds
 

4385
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:00,149
is that is that as crazy as it sounds
well

yes it's broken down to concrete things
like one of them is well you have to buy

4406
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
like one of them is well you have to buy
 

4407
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,790
like one of them is well you have to buy
the land and make sure the airspace is

4408
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:20,800
the land and make sure the airspace is
 

4409
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,270
the land and make sure the airspace is
okay

4410
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:21,280
okay
 

4411
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,030
okay
with you sending up that much power

4412
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:23,040
with you sending up that much power
 

4413
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,630
with you sending up that much power
overhead

4414
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:24,640
overhead
 

4415
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,310
overhead
another one is you have to have material

4416
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:26,320
another one is you have to have material
 

4417
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,149
another one is you have to have material
on the sail where the lasers won't just

4418
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:28,159
on the sail where the lasers won't just
 

4419
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,189
on the sail where the lasers won't just
uh vaporize it

4420
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:29,199
uh vaporize it
 

4421
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,030
uh vaporize it
and well so there's a lot of a lot of

4422
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:31,040
and well so there's a lot of a lot of
 

4423
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,229
and well so there's a lot of a lot of
issues but anyway these sails would be

4424
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:32,239
issues but anyway these sails would be
 

4425
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,390
issues but anyway these sails would be
accelerated to 20th speed of light

4426
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:34,400
accelerated to 20th speed of light
 

4427
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,910
accelerated to 20th speed of light
and their journey to the nearest star

4428
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:35,920
and their journey to the nearest star
 

4429
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,669
and their journey to the nearest star
would now wouldn't would no longer be

4430
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:37,679
would now wouldn't would no longer be
 

4431
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,590
would now wouldn't would no longer be
tens of thousands of years but could be

4432
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:39,600
tens of thousands of years but could be
 

4433
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,830
tens of thousands of years but could be
20 years okay 20. so it's not not as bad

4434
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:43,840
20 years okay 20. so it's not not as bad
 

4435
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,070
20 years okay 20. so it's not not as bad
as

4436
01:11:44,070 --> 01:11:44,080
as
 

4437
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,510
as
tens of thousands yeah and this um

4438
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
tens of thousands yeah and this um
 

4439
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,510
tens of thousands yeah and this um
these thousands or whatever however many

4440
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
these thousands or whatever however many
 

4441
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,669
these thousands or whatever however many
make it they'll go by the nearest star

4442
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:51,679
make it they'll go by the nearest star
 

4443
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,990
make it they'll go by the nearest star
system and snap a few snap some images

and radio the information back to earth

4446
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
and radio the information back to earth
 

4447
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,590
and radio the information back to earth
because they're traveling so fast they

4448
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:57,600
because they're traveling so fast they
 

4449
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,189
because they're traveling so fast they
can't slow down but they'll zoom by take

01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:02,719
send it back high res yeah but see just
 

4455
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,390
send it back high res yeah but see just
what i want you to pause on for a second

4456
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:04,400
what i want you to pause on for a second
 

4457
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,229
what i want you to pause on for a second
is that just by making that a real

4458
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
is that just by making that a real
 

4459
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,430
is that just by making that a real
concept

4460
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:07,440
concept
 

4461
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,270
concept
and the money given won't make it happen

4462
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:09,280
and the money given won't make it happen
 

4463
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,950
and the money given won't make it happen
but we'll but what it's done is it's

4464
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:10,960
but we'll but what it's done is it's
 

4465
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,550
but we'll but what it's done is it's
planted the seed

4466
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:12,560
planted the seed
 

4467
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,229
planted the seed
and it's shifted that line from what is

4468
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:14,239
and it's shifted that line from what is
 

4469
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:15,990
and it's shifted that line from what is
crazy to what is a real project it's

4470
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,000
crazy to what is a real project it's
 

4471
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,669
crazy to what is a real project it's
shifted it just ever so slightly enough

4472
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:17,679
shifted it just ever so slightly enough
 

4473
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,669
shifted it just ever so slightly enough
i think to plant the seed that we

4474
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
i think to plant the seed that we
 

4475
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,229
i think to plant the seed that we
have to find a way to somehow find a way

4476
01:12:22,229 --> 01:12:22,239
have to find a way to somehow find a way
 

4477
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:23,110
have to find a way to somehow find a way
to get there

4478
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
to get there
 

4479
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,590
to get there
that is again to stay on that that is so

4480
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:25,600
that is again to stay on that that is so
 

4481
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,149
that is again to stay on that that is so
powerful

4482
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:26,159
powerful

take a big crazy idea and

4484
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:29,440
take a big crazy idea and
 

4485
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,310
take a big crazy idea and
break it down into smaller crazy ideas

4486
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:32,320
break it down into smaller crazy ideas
 

4487
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,310
break it down into smaller crazy ideas
order it in a list

4488
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:34,320
order it in a list
 

4489
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,990
order it in a list
and knock it out one at a time

4490
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:38,000
and knock it out one at a time
 

4491
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,709
and knock it out one at a time
uh i don't know i've never heard

4492
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:40,719
uh i don't know i've never heard
 

4493

01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,550
a planet
that that as you right lurches across

4514
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:06,560
that that as you right lurches across
 

4515
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,750
that that as you right lurches across
the galaxy

4516
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:07,760
the galaxy
 

4517
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,910
the galaxy
like a rudderless ship wrapped in

4518
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:09,920
like a rudderless ship wrapped in
 

4519
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,669
like a rudderless ship wrapped in
perpetual darkness

4520
01:13:11,669 --> 01:13:11,679
perpetual darkness
 

4521
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,709
perpetual darkness
it's surface swept by constant storms

4522
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:14,719
it's surface swept by constant storms
 

4523
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:18,229
it's surface swept by constant storms
as black skies raining molten iron

4524
01:13:18,229 --> 01:13:18,239
as black skies raining molten iron
 

4525
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:20,709
as black skies raining molten iron
just like the vision of that the scary

4526
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:20,719
just like the vision of that the scary
 

4527
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:21,910
just like the vision of that the scary
the

4528
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:21,920
the
 

4529
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,270
the
the darkness the

4530
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:25,280
the darkness the
 

4531
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,750
the darkness the
just how not pleasant it is for human

4532
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:27,760
just how not pleasant it is for human
 

4533
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:28,790
just how not pleasant it is for human
life

4534
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:28,800
life
 

4535
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,669
life
just the intensity of that metaphor i

4536
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
just the intensity of that metaphor i
 

4537
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:32,470
just the intensity of that metaphor i
don't know

4538
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:32,480
don't know
 

4539
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,750
don't know
and the reason you use that

4540
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:35,760
and the reason you use that
 

4541
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,910
and the reason you use that
is to paint in a feeling of

4542
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:39,920
is to paint in a feeling of
 

4543
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,350
is to paint in a feeling of
loneliness and despair and despair

4544
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:43,360
loneliness and despair and despair
 

4545
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,390
loneliness and despair and despair
and um

4546
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:46,400
and um
 

4547
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,910
and um
why maybe on the planet side

4548
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:49,920
why maybe on the planet side
 

4549
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,270
why maybe on the planet side
why does it feel maybe it's just me why

4550
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280
why does it feel maybe it's just me why
 

4551
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,990
why does it feel maybe it's just me why
does it feel so profoundly lonely

4552
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:56,000
does it feel so profoundly lonely
 

4553
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,390
does it feel so profoundly lonely
on that kind of planet like what uh

4554
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:00,400
on that kind of planet like what uh
 

4555
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,310
on that kind of planet like what uh
like what i think it's because we all

4556
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,320
like what i think it's because we all
 

4557
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,070
like what i think it's because we all
want to be a part of something

4558
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
want to be a part of something
 

4559
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,390
want to be a part of something
a part of a family or a part of a

4560
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
a part of a family or a part of a
 

4561
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,110
a part of a family or a part of a
community

4562
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:07,120
community
 

4563
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:10,310
community
or a part of something

4564
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
or a part of something
 

4565
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,709
or a part of something
and so our solar system and by the way i

4566
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:12,719
and so our solar system and by the way i
 

4567
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:13,350
and so our solar system and by the way i
only

4568
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,360
only
 

4569
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,630
only
it's sort of like a like when you treat

4570
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:16,640
it's sort of like a like when you treat
 

4571
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,590
it's sort of like a like when you treat
yourself to like

4572
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:17,600
yourself to like
 

4573
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,229
yourself to like
eating an entire tub of ice cream like i

4574
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
eating an entire tub of ice cream like i
 

4575
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,990
eating an entire tub of ice cream like i
sometimes treat myself to imagine things

4576
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,000
sometimes treat myself to imagine things
 

4577
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,790
sometimes treat myself to imagine things
like this

4578
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:22,800
like this
 

4579
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,030
like this
and not just be so cut and dried but

4580
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:25,040
and not just be so cut and dried but
 

4581
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:27,350
and not just be so cut and dried but
when you imagine that this plan is not

4582
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360
when you imagine that this plan is not
 

4583
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,390
when you imagine that this plan is not
because i don't want to give emotions to

4584
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:28,400
because i don't want to give emotions to
 

4585
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,750
because i don't want to give emotions to
a planet per se but the planet's not

4586
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:29,760
a planet per se but the planet's not
 

4587
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,189
a planet per se but the planet's not
part of anything

4588
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:31,199
part of anything
 

4589
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:33,110
part of anything
it's somehow probably um it's just all

4590
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:33,120
it's somehow probably um it's just all
 

4591
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:35,030
it's somehow probably um it's just all
on its own just kind of out there

4592
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:35,040
on its own just kind of out there
 

4593
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,550
on its own just kind of out there
without that warm energy from its sun

4594
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:38,560
without that warm energy from its sun
 

4595
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,189
without that warm energy from its sun
it's just all alone out there to me it

4596
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:41,199
it's just all alone out there to me it
 

4597
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,350
it's just all alone out there to me it
was a little discovery

4598
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:43,360
was a little discovery
 

4599
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,270
was a little discovery
that i actually feel pretty good at

4600
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:45,280
that i actually feel pretty good at
 

4601
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,350
that i actually feel pretty good at
being part of the solar system

4602
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:47,360
being part of the solar system
 

4603
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,350
being part of the solar system
it felt like we have a sun we have like

4604
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:49,360
it felt like we have a sun we have like
 

4605
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,870
it felt like we have a sun we have like
a little family

4606
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
a little family
 

4607
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,510
a little family
and it felt like it sucked for the rogue

4608
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:53,520
and it felt like it sucked for the rogue
 

4609
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,229
and it felt like it sucked for the rogue
planet

4610
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:54,239
planet
 

4611
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,950
planet
yeah to just floating about uh not

4612
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:56,960
yeah to just floating about uh not
 

4613
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,590
yeah to just floating about uh not
floating

4614
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:57,600
floating
 

4615
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,630
floating
of flying uh rudderless

4616
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:00,640
of flying uh rudderless
 

4617
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,709
of flying uh rudderless
by the way how many rogue planets are

4618
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:02,719
by the way how many rogue planets are
 

4619
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:03,910
by the way how many rogue planets are
there

4620
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:03,920
there
 

4621
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,510
there
in your sun you don't know totally i

4622
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:05,520
in your sun you don't know totally i
 

4623
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,270
in your sun you don't know totally i
mean there's some rogue planets

4624
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:07,280
mean there's some rogue planets
 

4625
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,630
mean there's some rogue planets
that are just born on their own i know

4626
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:08,640
that are just born on their own i know
 

4627
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,149
that are just born on their own i know
that sounds really weird to be how can

4628
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:10,159
that sounds really weird to be how can
 

4629
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,669
that sounds really weird to be how can
you be born an orphan

4630
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:11,679
you be born an orphan
 

4631
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:14,390
you be born an orphan
but they just are because most planets

4632
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,400
but they just are because most planets
 

4633
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,510
but they just are because most planets
are born

4634
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:15,520
are born
 

4635
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,149
are born
out of a disk of gas and dust around a

4636
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:18,159
out of a disk of gas and dust around a
 

4637
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:18,870
out of a disk of gas and dust around a
star

4638
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:18,880
star
 

4639
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,390
star
but some of these small planets are like

4640
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
but some of these small planets are like
 

4641
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,070
but some of these small planets are like
totally failed stars they're so failed

4642
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:22,080
totally failed stars they're so failed
 

4643
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,310
totally failed stars they're so failed
they're just small planets on their own

4644
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:24,320
they're just small planets on their own
 

4645
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,910
they're just small planets on their own
but we think that there's probably

4646
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:25,920
but we think that there's probably
 

4647
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,390
but we think that there's probably
honestly there's another path to a rogue

4648
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:28,400
honestly there's another path to a rogue
 

4649
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,990
honestly there's another path to a rogue
planet that's one that's been kicked out

4650
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:30,000
planet that's one that's been kicked out
 

4651
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,110
planet that's one that's been kicked out
of its star system

4652
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:31,120
of its star system
 

4653
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,030
of its star system
by other planets like a game of billiard

4654
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
by other planets like a game of billiard
 

4655
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,430
by other planets like a game of billiard
balls something just gets kicked out

4656
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:35,440
balls something just gets kicked out
 

4657
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,189
balls something just gets kicked out
we actually think there's probably as

4658
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:37,199
we actually think there's probably as
 

4659
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,590
we actually think there's probably as
many rogue planets as stars

4660
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
many rogue planets as stars
 

4661
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,350
many rogue planets as stars
no flying out there um fundamentally

4662
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:43,360
no flying out there um fundamentally
 

4663
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,470
no flying out there um fundamentally
alone

4664
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:44,480
alone
 

4665
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,070
alone
so the book is uh

4666
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:48,080
so the book is uh
 

4667
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,990
so the book is uh
as a memoir is about your life and it uh

4668
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,000
as a memoir is about your life and it uh
 

4669
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,830
as a memoir is about your life and it uh
weaves both your fascination

4670
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:55,840
weaves both your fascination
 

4671
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,110
weaves both your fascination
with planets outside the solar system

4672
01:15:59,110 --> 01:15:59,120
with planets outside the solar system
 

4673
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,390
with planets outside the solar system
and the path of your life

4674
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,400

of world how would we as a species have
got to where we are

5152
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:11,360
got to where we are
 

5153
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,510
got to where we are
so i think that is tied hand in hand

5154
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:13,520
so i think that is tied hand in hand
 

5155
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,470
so i think that is tied hand in hand
with why do we

5156
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
with why do we
 

5157
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,790
with why do we
why do we seek connection it's just that

5158
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:16,800
why do we seek connection it's just that
 

5159
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,149
why do we seek connection it's just that
we were talking about before

5160
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:18,159
we were talking about before
 

5161
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,990
we were talking about before
that subconsciousness that we don't

5162
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,000
that subconsciousness that we don't
 

5163
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,669
that subconsciousness that we don't
understand

5164
01:24:21,669 --> 01:24:21,679
understand
 

5165
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:24,550
understand
yeah coupled you know the other side the

5166
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:24,560
yeah coupled you know the other side the
 

5167
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,310
yeah coupled you know the other side the
flip side of the coin of

5168
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:26,320
flip side of the coin of
 

5169
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:30,790
flip side of the coin of
connection and love is a fear of loss

5170
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:30,800
connection and love is a fear of loss
 

5171
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,510

that's what makes

5174
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:34,400
that's what makes
 

5175
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,709
that's what makes
you appreciate the moment is that the

5176
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:36,719
you appreciate the moment is that the
 

5177
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,070
you appreciate the moment is that the
thing ends

5178
01:24:38,070 --> 01:24:38,080

but is there something that you're
particularly kind of

5442

that that exact glimmer of hope that
 

5449
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:43,669
that that exact glimmer of hope that
there's earth like planets out there

5450
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:43,679
there's earth like planets out there
 

5451
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,910
there's earth like planets out there
i have to i stand behind star shade in

5452
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:45,920
i have to i stand behind star shade in
 

5453
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,110
i have to i stand behind star shade in
all cases so

5454
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,120
all cases so
 

5455
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:49,189
all cases so
but there is this other kind of field

5456
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:49,199
but there is this other kind of field
 

5457
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,189
but there is this other kind of field
that i that everyone is involved in

5458
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:51,199
that i that everyone is involved in
 

5459
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:52,950
that i that everyone is involved in
because star shade is hard

5460
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:52,960
because star shade is hard
 

5461
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,910
because star shade is hard
earths are hard but there are there's

5462

01:29:57,040 --> 01:29:59,030
another category of
planet star type that's easier and these

with my society how do i think outside
 

5619
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:25,669
with my society how do i think outside
the box and the confines of my society

the box and the confines of my society
 

5621
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,030
the box and the confines of my society
which surely carries negative things

yeah and also in the flip side of that
 

5627
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,390
yeah and also in the flip side of that
is if you do take a step outside the box

5628
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:34,400
is if you do take a step outside the box
 

5629
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:35,669
is if you do take a step outside the box

like the answer is yes you absolutely
want to know what's out

5658
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:57,440
want to know what's out
 

5659
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,030
want to know what's out
what's outside but you can't do that if

5660
01:32:59,030 --> 01:32:59,040
what's outside but you can't do that if
 

5661
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,629
what's outside but you can't do that if
you're very it's hard to be objective

5662
01:33:00,629 --> 01:33:00,639
you're very it's hard to be objective
 

5663
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,229
you're very it's hard to be objective
about your own reality

5664
01:33:02,229 --> 01:33:02,239
about your own reality
 

5665
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,149
about your own reality
yeah i mean it's a very human instinct

5666
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:04,159
yeah i mean it's a very human instinct
 

5667
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:07,030
yeah i mean it's a very human instinct
but uh it also the book kind of

5668
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:07,040
but uh it also the book kind of
 

5669
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:11,030
but uh it also the book kind of
shows that it has an effect on you

5670
01:33:11,030 --> 01:33:11,040
shows that it has an effect on you
 

5671
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,709
shows that it has an effect on you
and this it's a really interesting

5672
01:33:12,709 --> 01:33:12,719
and this it's a really interesting
 

5673
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:14,470
and this it's a really interesting
question about our society taking a step

5674
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:14,480
question about our society taking a step
 

5675
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,070
question about our society taking a step
out

5676
01:33:16,070 --> 01:33:16,080
out
 

5677
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,110
out
it's by lois lowry i think

5678
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:19,120
it's by lois lowry i think
 

5679
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,590
it's by lois lowry i think
is how you pronounce it i really do hope

5680
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:21,600
is how you pronounce it i really do hope
 

5681
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:22,950
is how you pronounce it i really do hope
everyone created and it is a young adult

5682
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:22,960
everyone created and it is a young adult
 

5683
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:23,910
everyone created and it is a young adult
book but it's still

5684
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:23,920
book but it's still
 

5685
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,510

it's incredibly i'm really glad i only

5686
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:25,520
it's incredibly i'm really glad i only
 

5687
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:26,790
it's incredibly i'm really glad i only
read it because my kids got it for

5688
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:26,800
read it because my kids got it for
 

5689
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:27,430
read it because my kids got it for
school

5690
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:27,440
school
 

5691
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,790
school
i just thought okay well why don't i

5692
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:28,800
i just thought okay well why don't i
 

5693
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,229
i just thought okay well why don't i
just see what this is about and i just

5694
01:33:30,229 --> 01:33:30,239
just see what this is about and i just
 

5695
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,110
just see what this is about and i just
wow

5696
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:31,120
wow
 

5697
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:34,470
wow
yeah yeah i i think it's also the value

5698
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,480
yeah yeah i i think it's also the value
 

5699
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:35,669
yeah yeah i i think it's also the value
of education i think

5700
01:33:35,669 --> 01:33:35,679
of education i think
 

5701
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,189
of education i think
i think i'm surprised you mentioned i've

5702
01:33:37,189 --> 01:33:37,199
i think i'm surprised you mentioned i've
 

5703
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:38,870
i think i'm surprised you mentioned i've
never really mentioned to anybody

5704
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:38,880
never really mentioned to anybody
 

5705
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,270
never really mentioned to anybody
i'm sure a lot of people had some

5706
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:41,280
i'm sure a lot of people had some
 

5707
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,950
i'm sure a lot of people had some
experience like me and maybe

5708
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:42,960
experience like me and maybe
 

5709
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,390
experience like me and maybe
it's a generational thing though because

5710
01:33:44,390 --> 01:33:44,400
it's a generational thing though because
 

5711
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,750
it's a generational thing though because
like the book came out i think in the

5712
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:45,760
like the book came out i think in the
 

5713
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,110
like the book came out i think in the
90s so

5714
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:47,120
90s so
 

5715
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:49,189
90s so
if you're older then like me that book

5716
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:49,199
if you're older then like me that book
 

5717
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,550
if you're older then like me that book
didn't exist when we were in middle

5718
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:50,560
didn't exist when we were in middle
 

5719
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:51,430
didn't exist when we were in middle
school so

5720
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:51,440
school so
 

5721
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,950
school so
i just do think a lot of people won't

5722
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:52,960
i just do think a lot of people won't
 

5723
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,310
i just do think a lot of people won't
have heard of it but it's an interesting

5724
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:54,320
have heard of it but it's an interesting
 

5725
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,750
have heard of it but it's an interesting
question of like

5726
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:55,760
question of like
 

5727
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,750
question of like
those books i mean i'm reminded often

5728
01:33:59,750 --> 01:33:59,760
those books i mean i'm reminded often
 

5729
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,750
those books i mean i'm reminded often
i suppose the same is true with other

5730
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:01,760
i suppose the same is true with other
 

5731
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,030
i suppose the same is true with other
subjects but books

5732
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:03,040
subjects but books
 

5733
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:06,390
subjects but books
are special at the early age like middle

5734
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:06,400
are special at the early age like middle
 

5735
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,470
are special at the early age like middle
school maybe early high school

5736
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:08,480
school maybe early high school
 

5737
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,470
school maybe early high school
this those can change like the direction

5738
01:34:10,470 --> 01:34:10,480
this those can change like the direction
 

5739
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,590
this those can change like the direction
of your life

5740
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:11,600
of your life
 

5741
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,189
of your life
and also certainly teachers

5742
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:15,199
and also certainly teachers
 

5743
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:17,350
and also certainly teachers
they can change completely the direction

5744
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:17,360
they can change completely the direction
 

5745
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,590
they can change completely the direction
of life there's so many stories about

5746
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:19,600
of life there's so many stories about
 

5747
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,350
of life there's so many stories about
teachers of mathematics teachers of

5748
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:21,360
teachers of mathematics teachers of
 

5749
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,790
teachers of mathematics teachers of
physics

5750
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:22,800
physics
 

5751
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,189
physics
of any kind of subjects basically

5752
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:25,199
of any kind of subjects basically
 

5753
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,270
of any kind of subjects basically
changing the direction of a human's life

5754
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:27,280
changing the direction of a human's life
 

5755
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:30,870
changing the direction of a human's life
that's like not to get on the

5756
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:30,880
that's like not to get on the
 

5757
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,830
that's like not to get on the
uh the whole almost like a political

5758
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:33,840
uh the whole almost like a political
 

5759
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:34,950
uh the whole almost like a political
thing but

5760
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:34,960
thing but
 

5761
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:38,149
thing but
you know we uh we undervalue teachers

5762
01:34:38,149 --> 01:34:38,159
you know we uh we undervalue teachers
 

5763
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:40,870
you know we uh we undervalue teachers
uh it's a special it's a special

5764
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:40,880
uh it's a special it's a special
 

5765
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,390
uh it's a special it's a special
position that they hold

5766
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:42,400
position that they hold
 

5767
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,470
position that they hold
so true yeah well i do have two other

5768
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:44,480
so true yeah well i do have two other
 

5769
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,470
so true yeah well i do have two other
books or two other things

5770
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:46,480
books or two other things
 

5771
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,070
books or two other things
one is something i came across just a

5772
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:48,080
one is something i came across just a
 

5773
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:49,830
one is something i came across just a
few days ago actually

5774
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:49,840
few days ago actually
 

5775
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,390
few days ago actually
it's actually a film called picture a

5776
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:52,400
it's actually a film called picture a
 

5777
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,550
it's actually a film called picture a
scientist

5778
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:54,560
scientist
 

5779
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,910
scientist
and when you picture a scientist you

5780
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:55,920
and when you picture a scientist you
 

5781
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,390
and when you picture a scientist you
probably don't picture the

5782
01:34:58,390 --> 01:34:58,400
probably don't picture the
 

5783
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,870
probably don't picture the
women and women of color in this film

5784
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:00,880
women and women of color in this film
 

5785
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,750
women and women of color in this film
and it is a way to get outside your box

5786
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:03,760
and it is a way to get outside your box
 

5787
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,910
and it is a way to get outside your box
i really think everyone interested in

5788
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:05,920
i really think everyone interested in
 

5789
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,990
i really think everyone interested in
science even just peripherally should

5790

that would like to help you maybe
 

5977
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,310
that would like to help you maybe
on the planetary science side discover

5978
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
on the planetary science side discover
 

5979
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,430
on the planetary science side discover
exoplanets

5980
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:01,440
exoplanets
 

5981
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,830
exoplanets
or maybe bigger picture just succeed in

5982
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
or maybe bigger picture just succeed in
 

5983
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:04,470
or maybe bigger picture just succeed in
life

5984
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:04,480
life
 

5985
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:06,149
life
i do have some advice just to succeed

5986
01:38:06,149 --> 01:38:06,159
i do have some advice just to succeed
 

5987
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:07,669
i do have some advice just to succeed
it's tough advice in a way

5988
01:38:07,669 --> 01:38:07,679
it's tough advice in a way
 

5989
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:10,229
it's tough advice in a way
but it is to find something that you

5990
01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:10,239
but it is to find something that you
 

5991
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:11,750
but it is to find something that you
love doing that you're also

5992
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:11,760
love doing that you're also
 

5993
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,270
love doing that you're also
very good at in some ways the stars have

5994
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:15,280
very good at in some ways the stars have
 

5995
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,030
very good at in some ways the stars have
to align because you've got to find that

5996
01:38:17,030 --> 01:38:17,040
to align because you've got to find that
 

5997
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,310
to align because you've got to find that
thing you're good at or the range of

5998
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:18,320
thing you're good at or the range of
 

5999
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:19,430
thing you're good at or the range of
things

6000
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:19,440
things
 

6001
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:20,870
things
and it actually has to overlap with

6002
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:20,880
and it actually has to overlap with
 

6003
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,470
and it actually has to overlap with
something that actually you love doing

6004
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:22,480
something that actually you love doing
 

6005
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,109
something that actually you love doing
every day

6006
01:38:23,109 --> 01:38:23,119
every day
 

6007
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:26,229
every day
so it's not a tedious job that's the

6008
01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:26,239
so it's not a tedious job that's the
 

6009
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,270
so it's not a tedious job that's the
best way to succeed

6010
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:27,280
best way to succeed
 

6011
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:30,390
best way to succeed
what were the signals that in your own

6012
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:30,400
what were the signals that in your own
 

6013
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,109
what were the signals that in your own
life

you're like what were you good at that
 

6021
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:38,709
you're like what were you good at that
made you

6022
01:38:38,709 --> 01:38:38,719
made you
 

6023
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:42,390
made you
uh pursue a phd and made you

6024
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:42,400
uh pursue a phd and made you
 

6025
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:45,669
uh pursue a phd and made you
pursue the search i mean that was the

6026
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:45,679
pursue the search i mean that was the
 

6027
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,990
pursue the search i mean that was the
one sentence version in my case it was a

6028
01:38:47,990 --> 01:38:48,000
one sentence version in my case it was a
 

6029
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,350
one sentence version in my case it was a
long slog and there were a lot of things

6030
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:49,360
long slog and there were a lot of things
 

6031
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,950
long slog and there were a lot of things
i wasn't good at initially

i wasn't good at initially
 

6033
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:52,390
i wasn't good at initially
but so initially you know i was good at

6034
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:52,400
but so initially you know i was good at
 

6035
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:53,910
but so initially you know i was good at
high school math i was good at high

6036
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:53,920
high school math i was good at high
 

6037
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,109

school science
 

6039
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,510
school science
i loved astronomy and i realized those

6040
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:57,520
i loved astronomy and i realized those
 

6041
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,189
i loved astronomy and i realized those
could all fit together like the day i

6042
01:38:59,189 --> 01:38:59,199
could all fit together like the day i
 

6043
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:00,629
could all fit together like the day i
realized you could be an astronomer for

6044
01:39:00,629 --> 01:39:00,639
realized you could be an astronomer for
 

6045
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:01,189
realized you could be an astronomer for
a job

6046
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:01,199
a job
 

6047
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,950
a job

those things and although my dad wanted
 

6055
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,470
those things and although my dad wanted
me to do something more practical

support myself was another option
 

6061
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,830
support myself was another option
but initially i wasn't that good at

but initially i wasn't that good at
 

6063
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,830
but initially i wasn't that good at
physics it was a slog to just get

6064
01:39:17,830 --> 01:39:17,840
physics it was a slog to just get
 

6065
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,350
physics it was a slog to just get
through school and grad school is a very

6066
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:19,360
through school and grad school is a very
 

6067
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,870
through school and grad school is a very
very long time

6068

very long time
 

6069
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,590
very long time

but ultimately when faced with a choice
 

6071
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,750

through
now i asked some of the smartest people

6080
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:31,840
now i asked some of the smartest people
 

6081
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,430
now i asked some of the smartest people
in the world the most ridiculous

01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:33,440
in the world the most ridiculous
 

6083
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,350
in the world the most ridiculous
question uh we already talked about it a

6084
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:35,360
question uh we already talked about it a
 

6085
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,270
question uh we already talked about it a
little bit but let me ask uh

6086
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:37,280
little bit but let me ask uh
 

6087
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:41,350
little bit but let me ask uh
again why why are we here

6088
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:41,360
again why why are we here
 

6089
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,510
again why why are we here
so uh i think you've uh raised this

6090
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:43,520
so uh i think you've uh raised this
 

6091
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,590
so uh i think you've uh raised this
question when your presentations as like

6092
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:45,600
question when your presentations as like
 

6093
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:46,070
question when your presentations as like
what

6094
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:46,080
what
 

6095
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,149
what
one of the things that we kind of as

6096
01:39:48,149 --> 01:39:48,159
one of the things that we kind of as
 

6097
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:49,590
one of the things that we kind of as
humans long to

6098
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:49,600
humans long to
 

6099
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,310
humans long to
to answer and the search for exoplanets

6100
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,320
to answer and the search for exoplanets
 

6101
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,310
to answer and the search for exoplanets
is kind of part of that

6102
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:54,320
is kind of part of that
 

6103
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,590
is kind of part of that
but what do you think is the meaning of

6104
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:55,600
but what do you think is the meaning of
 

6105
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:57,910
but what do you think is the meaning of
