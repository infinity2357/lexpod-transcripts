00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
a real explorer in jazz and um he had a
 

231
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,350
a real explorer in jazz and um he had a
coherent story so i think i have one and

coherent story so i think i have one and
 

233
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,110
coherent story so i think i have one and
but it's not just the one you live

234
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
but it's not just the one you live
 

235
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,869
but it's not just the one you live
it's the one you think about later what

a good historian does is they

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
a good historian does is they
 

239
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,390
a good historian does is they
look back and they revisit um i think

240
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
look back and they revisit um i think
 

241
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,509
look back and they revisit um i think
what happening right now

242
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
what happening right now
 

243
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,470
what happening right now
is not ai that was an intellectual

244
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
is not ai that was an intellectual
 

245
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,270
is not ai that was an intellectual
aspiration

246
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
aspiration
 

247
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,509

um that's still alive today is an

248
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
um that's still alive today is an
 

249
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,390
um that's still alive today is an
aspiration

250
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
aspiration
 

251
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,909
aspiration
but i think this is akin to the

252
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
but i think this is akin to the
 

253
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,509
but i think this is akin to the
development of chemical engineering

254
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
development of chemical engineering
 

255
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,030
development of chemical engineering
from chemistry or electrical engineering

256
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,040
from chemistry or electrical engineering
 

257
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,670
from chemistry or electrical engineering
from from electromagnetism

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,030
from from electromagnetism
so if you go back to the 30s or 40s

260
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
so if you go back to the 30s or 40s
 

261
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,710
so if you go back to the 30s or 40s
there wasn't yet chemical engineering

262
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
there wasn't yet chemical engineering
 

263
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,390
there wasn't yet chemical engineering
there was chemistry there was fluid flow

264
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
there was chemistry there was fluid flow
 

265
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,870
there was chemistry there was fluid flow
there was

266
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
there was
 

267
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,710
there was
mechanics and so on but people

268
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
mechanics and so on but people
 

269
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,270
mechanics and so on but people
pretty clearly viewed interesting goals

270
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
pretty clearly viewed interesting goals
 

271
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,790
pretty clearly viewed interesting goals
try to build factories that

272
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
try to build factories that
 

273
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,870
try to build factories that
you make chemicals products and do it

274
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:42,880
you make chemicals products and do it
 

275
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,710
you make chemicals products and do it
viably safely

make good ones do it at scale
 

279
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,350
make good ones do it at scale
so people started to try to do that of

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
so people started to try to do that of
 

281
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,189
so people started to try to do that of
course and some factories worked some

that's not quite true but you know

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,630
that's not quite true but you know
mostly we don't know and that's even

just about the biochemistry of the brain

fine you know by all means go for it

634
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
fine you know by all means go for it
 

635
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,509

it's just not scientific at this point

636

it's just not scientific at this point
 

637
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,430
it's just not scientific at this point
it's just it's so it's like kind of

638
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
it's just it's so it's like kind of
 

639
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,110
it's just it's so it's like kind of
sitting in a satellite and watching the

about the micro economy even though you

646

about the micro economy even though you
 

647
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,190
about the micro economy even though you
don't have microeconomic concepts

648
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
don't have microeconomic concepts
 

649
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,949
don't have microeconomic concepts
i mean it's really that kind of thing

650
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
i mean it's really that kind of thing
 

651
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,630
i mean it's really that kind of thing
and so yes can you find some signals

652
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
and so yes can you find some signals
 

653
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,310
and so yes can you find some signals
that do something interesting or useful

654
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
that do something interesting or useful
 

655
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,509
that do something interesting or useful
can you control a cursor or mouse

656
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
can you control a cursor or mouse
 

657
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,990
can you control a cursor or mouse
with your brain yeah absolutely you know

658
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
with your brain yeah absolutely you know
 

659
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,630
with your brain yeah absolutely you know
and then

660
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
and then
 

661
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,389
and then
i can imagine business models based on

662
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
i can imagine business models based on
 

663
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,829
i can imagine business models based on
that and even

664
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
that and even
 

665
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,910
that and even
you know medical applications of that

666
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
you know medical applications of that
 

667
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,670
you know medical applications of that
but from there to understanding

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,509
but from there to understanding
algorithms that allow us to

670
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
algorithms that allow us to
 

671
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,910
algorithms that allow us to
really tie in deeply to from the brain

672
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:19,920
really tie in deeply to from the brain

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,590
really tie in deeply to from the brain
to computer you know i just no i don't

674
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
to computer you know i just no i don't
 

675
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,790
to computer you know i just no i don't
agree with elon musk i don't think

676
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:22,800
agree with elon musk i don't think
 

677
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,150
agree with elon musk i don't think
that's even that's not for our

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
that's even that's not for our

so just uh in hopes of getting you to

682
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
so just uh in hopes of getting you to
 

683
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,630
so just uh in hopes of getting you to
dream

684

dream
 

685
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,389
dream
uh you've mentioned kolmogorov and

686
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
uh you've mentioned kolmogorov and
 

687
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,910
uh you've mentioned kolmogorov and
touring might pop

688
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
touring might pop
 

689
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,430
touring might pop
up do you think that there might be

690
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
up do you think that there might be
 

691
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,310
up do you think that there might be
breakthroughs

692
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
breakthroughs
 

693
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,870
breakthroughs
they'll get you to sit back in five ten

694
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
they'll get you to sit back in five ten
 

695
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,630
they'll get you to sit back in five ten
years and say

696
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
years and say
 

697
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,430
years and say
wow oh i'm sure there will be but i

698
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440
wow oh i'm sure there will be but i
 

699
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,069
wow oh i'm sure there will be but i
don't think

700
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
don't think
 

701
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,110
don't think
that there'll be demos that impress me

702
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
that there'll be demos that impress me
 

703
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,269
that there'll be demos that impress me
i don't think that having a computer

704
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
i don't think that having a computer
 

705
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,269
i don't think that having a computer

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
human
 

709
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,509
human
is a breakthrough and people you know

710
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
is a breakthrough and people you know
 

711
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,590
is a breakthrough and people you know
some people present it as such

712
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
some people present it as such
 

713
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,670
some people present it as such
it's imitating human intelligence it's

714
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
it's imitating human intelligence it's
 

715
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,069
it's imitating human intelligence it's
even putting coughs

716
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
even putting coughs
 

717
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,030
even putting coughs
in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt

718
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt
 

719
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,829
in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt
and so

720
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
and so
 

721
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,190
and so
fine the world runs on those things too

722
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
fine the world runs on those things too
 

723
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,110
fine the world runs on those things too
and i don't want to diminish all the

724
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120
and i don't want to diminish all the
 

725
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,470
and i don't want to diminish all the
hard work and engineering that goes

726
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:14,480
hard work and engineering that goes
 

727
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,590
hard work and engineering that goes
behind things like that and

728
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
behind things like that and
 

729
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,509
behind things like that and
and the ultimate value to the human race

730
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
and the ultimate value to the human race
 

731
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,990
and the ultimate value to the human race
but that's not scientific understanding

732
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
but that's not scientific understanding
 

733
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,590
but that's not scientific understanding
and and i know the people who work on

734
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:21,600
and and i know the people who work on
 

735
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,949
and and i know the people who work on
these things they are after a scientific

00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
these things they are after a scientific
 

737
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:23,509
these things they are after a scientific
understanding

738
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519
understanding
 

739
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,790
understanding
you know in the meantime they've got to

740
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
you know in the meantime they've got to
 

741
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,150
you know in the meantime they've got to
kind of you know the trains got to run

742
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
kind of you know the trains got to run
 

743
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,430
kind of you know the trains got to run
and they got miles to feed and they got

744
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
and they got miles to feed and they got
 

745
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,389
and they got miles to feed and they got
things to do

746
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
things to do
 

747
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,389
things to do
and there's nothing wrong with all that

748
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
and there's nothing wrong with all that
 

749
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,829
and there's nothing wrong with all that
i would call that though just

750
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
i would call that though just
 

751
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,430
i would call that though just
engineering and i want to distinguish

752
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
engineering and i want to distinguish
 

753
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,870
engineering and i want to distinguish
that between an engineering field like

754
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
that between an engineering field like
 

755
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,990
that between an engineering field like
electoral internet chemical injury that

756
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
electoral internet chemical injury that
 

757
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,350
electoral internet chemical injury that
originally that originally

758
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
originally that originally
 

759
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,030
originally that originally
emerged that had real principles and you

760
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,040
emerged that had real principles and you
 

761
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,990
emerged that had real principles and you
really knew what you're doing and you

762
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
really knew what you're doing and you
 

763
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,590
really knew what you're doing and you
had a little scientific understanding

764
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:41,600
had a little scientific understanding
 

765
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,990
had a little scientific understanding
maybe not even complete so it became

766
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
maybe not even complete so it became
 

767
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,430
maybe not even complete so it became
more predictable and it was

768
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
more predictable and it was
 

769
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,190
more predictable and it was
really gave value to human life because

770
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
really gave value to human life because
 

771
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,470
really gave value to human life because
it was understood

772
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
it was understood
 

773
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,949
it was understood
and and so we have to we don't want to

774
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
and and so we have to we don't want to
 

775
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,030
and and so we have to we don't want to
muddle too much these waters of

776
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
muddle too much these waters of
 

777
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,550
muddle too much these waters of
you know what we're able to do versus

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
you know what we're able to do versus
 

779
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,550
you know what we're able to do versus
what we really can do in a way that's

780
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
what we really can do in a way that's
 

781
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,829
what we really can do in a way that's
going to impress the next

782
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
going to impress the next
 

783
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,430
going to impress the next
so i don't i don't need to be wowed but

784
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
so i don't i don't need to be wowed but
 

785
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,110
so i don't i don't need to be wowed but
i i think that someone comes along in 20

786
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,120
i i think that someone comes along in 20
 

787
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,069
i i think that someone comes along in 20
years

788
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,350
a younger person who's absorbed all the
uh

792
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
uh
 

793
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,750
uh
the technology and for them to be wowed

794
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
the technology and for them to be wowed
 

795
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,949
the technology and for them to be wowed
i think they have to be more deeply

796
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
i think they have to be more deeply
 

797
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,550
i think they have to be more deeply
impressed a young kulmogorov would not

799
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,150
impressed a young kulmogorov would not
be wowed by some of the stunts that you

800
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
be wowed by some of the stunts that you
 

801
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,350
be wowed by some of the stunts that you
see right now coming from the big

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
see right now coming from the big
 

803
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,190

00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
companies the demos but do you think the
 

805
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,509
companies the demos but do you think the
breakthroughs from kolmogorov

806
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
breakthroughs from kolmogorov
 

807
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,430
breakthroughs from kolmogorov
would be and give this question a chance

808
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:19,440
would be and give this question a chance

breakthroughs in engineering
 

819
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,629
breakthroughs in engineering
meaning you know i would say some of the

820
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
meaning you know i would say some of the

and then others sort of trying to
 

827
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,269
and then others sort of trying to
revolutionize the fundamentals of

revolutionize the fundamentals of
 

829
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,670
revolutionize the fundamentals of
engineering of manufacturing of

830
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
engineering of manufacturing of
 

831
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,430
engineering of manufacturing of
of saying here's a problem we know how

832
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
of saying here's a problem we know how
 

833
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,590
of saying here's a problem we know how
to do a demo of and actually taking it

834
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
to do a demo of and actually taking it
 

835
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,470
to do a demo of and actually taking it
to scale

836
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
to scale
 

837
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,310
to scale
yeah so so there's going to be all kinds

838
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:46,320
yeah so so there's going to be all kinds
 

839
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,590
yeah so so there's going to be all kinds
of breakthroughs i just don't like that

840
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
of breakthroughs i just don't like that
 

841
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,590
of breakthroughs i just don't like that
terminology i'm a scientist and i work

842
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
terminology i'm a scientist and i work
 

843
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,949
terminology i'm a scientist and i work
on things day in and day out and things

844
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
on things day in and day out and things
 

845
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,990
on things day in and day out and things
move along and eventually

846
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
move along and eventually
 

847
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,750
move along and eventually
say wow something happened but it's i

848
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
say wow something happened but it's i
 

849
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,069
say wow something happened but it's i
don't like that language very much

850
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
don't like that language very much
 

851
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,870
don't like that language very much
also i don't like to prize theoretical

852
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
also i don't like to prize theoretical
 

853
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,470
also i don't like to prize theoretical
breakthroughs over practical ones

854
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
breakthroughs over practical ones
 

855
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,470
breakthroughs over practical ones
um i tend to be more of a theoretician

856
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
um i tend to be more of a theoretician
 

857
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,470
um i tend to be more of a theoretician
and i think there's lots to do in that

858
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
and i think there's lots to do in that
 

859
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,110
and i think there's lots to do in that
arena right now um and so i wouldn't

860
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
arena right now um and so i wouldn't
 

861
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,629
arena right now um and so i wouldn't
point to the komo gurus i might point to

862
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639
point to the komo gurus i might point to
 

863
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,389
point to the komo gurus i might point to
the edisons of the era and maybe musk is

864
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
the edisons of the era and maybe musk is
 

865
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,590
the edisons of the era and maybe musk is
a bit more like that

866
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
a bit more like that
 

867
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,949
a bit more like that
but um you know musk god bless him also

868
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
but um you know musk god bless him also
 

869
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,110
but um you know musk god bless him also
we'll say things about ai that he knows

870
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
we'll say things about ai that he knows
 

871
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,150
we'll say things about ai that he knows
very little about

872
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
very little about
 

873
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,829
very little about
and and he doesn't know what he's he he

874
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:19,839
and and he doesn't know what he's he he
 

875
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,430
and and he doesn't know what he's he he
is you know leads people astray when he

876
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
is you know leads people astray when he
 

877
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,470
is you know leads people astray when he
talks about things he doesn't know

878
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
talks about things he doesn't know
 

879
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,509
talks about things he doesn't know
anything about

880
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
anything about
 

881
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,949
anything about
trying to program a computer to

882
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:24,959
trying to program a computer to
 

883
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,389
trying to program a computer to
understand natural language to be

884
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
understand natural language to be
 

885
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,590
understand natural language to be
involved in a dialogue

886
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
involved in a dialogue
 

887
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,110
involved in a dialogue
we're having right now that can happen

888
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
we're having right now that can happen
 

889
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,190
we're having right now that can happen
in our lifetime you could fake it

890
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
in our lifetime you could fake it
 

891
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,910
in our lifetime you could fake it
you can mimic sort of take old sentences

892
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
you can mimic sort of take old sentences
 

893
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,829
you can mimic sort of take old sentences
that humans use and retread them

894
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
that humans use and retread them
 

895
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,509
that humans use and retread them
with the deep understanding of language

896
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
with the deep understanding of language
 

897
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,949
with the deep understanding of language
now it's not going to happen and so from

898
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
now it's not going to happen and so from
 

899
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,350
now it's not going to happen and so from
that

900
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
that
 

901
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,790
that
you know i hope you can perceive that

902
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
you know i hope you can perceive that
 

903
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,870
you know i hope you can perceive that
the deeper yet deeper kind of aspects

904
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880
the deeper yet deeper kind of aspects
 

905
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,230
the deeper yet deeper kind of aspects
and intelligence are not going to happen

906
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
and intelligence are not going to happen
 

907
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,590
and intelligence are not going to happen
now will there be breakthroughs you know

908
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
now will there be breakthroughs you know
 

909
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,350
now will there be breakthroughs you know
i think that google

910
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
i think that google
 

911
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,710
i think that google
was a breakthrough i think amazon's a

912
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
was a breakthrough i think amazon's a
 

913
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,230
was a breakthrough i think amazon's a
breakthrough you know i think uber is a

914
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,240
breakthrough you know i think uber is a
 

915
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,189
breakthrough you know i think uber is a
breakthrough you know that

916
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:51,199
breakthrough you know that
 

917
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,430
breakthrough you know that
bring value to human beings at scale in

918
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
bring value to human beings at scale in
 

919
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,750
bring value to human beings at scale in
new brand new ways based on data flows

920
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
new brand new ways based on data flows
 

921
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,790
new brand new ways based on data flows
and and so on

922
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
and and so on
 

923
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,069
and and so on
a lot of these things are slightly

924
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
a lot of these things are slightly
 

925
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,710
a lot of these things are slightly
broken because there's not a kind of a

926
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
broken because there's not a kind of a
 

927
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,550
broken because there's not a kind of a
engineering field that takes economic

928
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,560
engineering field that takes economic
 

929
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,150
engineering field that takes economic
value in context of data

930
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
value in context of data
 

931
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,389
value in context of data
and and at you know planetary scale and

932
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
and and at you know planetary scale and
 

933
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,350
and and at you know planetary scale and
and worries about

934
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
and worries about
 

935
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,509
and worries about
all the externalities the privacy you

936
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:09,519
all the externalities the privacy you
 

937
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,110
all the externalities the privacy you
know we don't have that field so we

938
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
know we don't have that field so we
 

939
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,230
know we don't have that field so we
don't think these things through very

940
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
don't think these things through very
 

941
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,949
don't think these things through very
well

942
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
well
 

943
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,790
well
but i see that is emerging and that will

944
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:14,800
but i see that is emerging and that will
 

945
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,550
but i see that is emerging and that will
be cons that will you know looking back

946
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
be cons that will you know looking back
 

947
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,150
be cons that will you know looking back
from 100 years that will be constituted

948
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,160
from 100 years that will be constituted
 

949
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,910
from 100 years that will be constituted
a breakthrough in this era just like

950
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
a breakthrough in this era just like
 

951
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,790
a breakthrough in this era just like
electrical engineering was a

952
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
electrical engineering was a
 

953
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,910
electrical engineering was a
breakthrough in the early part of the

954
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
breakthrough in the early part of the
 

955
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,670
breakthrough in the early part of the
last century and chemical injury was a

956
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
last century and chemical injury was a
 

957
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,389
last century and chemical injury was a
breakthrough

958
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
breakthrough
 

959
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,150
breakthrough
so the scale the markets that you talk

960
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
so the scale the markets that you talk
 

961
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,389
so the scale the markets that you talk
about and we'll get to

962
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
about and we'll get to
 

963
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,470
about and we'll get to
will be seen as sort of breakthrough and

964
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,480
will be seen as sort of breakthrough and
 

965
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,069
will be seen as sort of breakthrough and
we're in the very early days of really

966
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,079
we're in the very early days of really
 

967
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,389
we're in the very early days of really
doing

968
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
doing
 

969
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,470
doing
interesting stuff there and we'll get to

970
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
interesting stuff there and we'll get to
 

971
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,470
interesting stuff there and we'll get to
that but it's just taking a quick step

972
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
that but it's just taking a quick step
 

973
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,189
that but it's just taking a quick step
back

974
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
back
 

975
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,389
back
can you give uh we kind of threw off the

976
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
can you give uh we kind of threw off the
 

977
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,069
can you give uh we kind of threw off the
historian hat

978
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
historian hat
 

979
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,430
historian hat
i mean you briefly said that uh in

980
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
i mean you briefly said that uh in
 

981
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,949
i mean you briefly said that uh in
the history of ai kind of mimics the

982
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
the history of ai kind of mimics the
 

983
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,710
the history of ai kind of mimics the
history of chemical engineering

984
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
history of chemical engineering
 

985
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,310
history of chemical engineering
but i keep saying machine learning you

986
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
but i keep saying machine learning you
 

987
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,910
but i keep saying machine learning you
keep want to say ai just to let you know

988
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:51,920
keep want to say ai just to let you know
 

989
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,949
keep want to say ai just to let you know
i don't you know i

990
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
i don't you know i
 

991
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,949
i don't you know i
i'd resist that i don't think this is

as almost a philosopher saying wouldn't

as almost a philosopher saying wouldn't
 

997
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,550
as almost a philosopher saying wouldn't
it be cool if we could put thought in a

that's an interesting philosophical

1010
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:11,279
that's an interesting philosophical
 

1011
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,949
that's an interesting philosophical
question and he wanted to make it more

1012
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
question and he wanted to make it more
 

1013
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,990
question and he wanted to make it more
than philosophy he wanted to actually

1014
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,000
than philosophy he wanted to actually
 

1015
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,350
than philosophy he wanted to actually
write down logical formula and

1016
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:15,360
write down logical formula and
 

1017
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,110
write down logical formula and
algorithms that would do that

1018
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,120
algorithms that would do that
 

1019
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,110
algorithms that would do that
and that is a perfectly valid reasonable

1020
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,120
and that is a perfectly valid reasonable
 

1021
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,870
and that is a perfectly valid reasonable
thing to do that's not what's happening

1022
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
thing to do that's not what's happening
 

1023
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,230
thing to do that's not what's happening
in this era

right so so the reason i keep saying ai

1026
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
right so so the reason i keep saying ai
 

1027
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,350
right so so the reason i keep saying ai
actually

1028
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
actually
 

1029
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,870
actually
and i'd love to hear what you think

1030
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
and i'd love to hear what you think
 

1031
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,910
and i'd love to hear what you think
about it machine learning has uh

1032
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
about it machine learning has uh
 

1033
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,310
about it machine learning has uh
has a very particular set of methods and

maybe your version of it is that mine

and make decisions so what is pattern

1052
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
and make decisions so what is pattern
 

1053
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,829
and make decisions so what is pattern
recognition and from you know

so i don't even like the word but you

1076
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:05,920
so i don't even like the word but you
 

1077

so i don't even like the word but you
know i think that with the field you're

that at that scale
 

1091
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,189
that at that scale
you don't have to say the principles are

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,549
kind of network around me
that feeds me and and some of them agree

1326

all kinds of personalities are needed um
 

1331
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,909
all kinds of personalities are needed um
right now i think the personality that's

1332
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
right now i think the personality that's
 

1333
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,430
right now i think the personality that's
a little too exuberant a little bit too

1334
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
a little too exuberant a little bit too
 

1335
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,710
a little too exuberant a little bit too
ready to promise the moon

1336
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:32,720
ready to promise the moon
 

1337
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,029
ready to promise the moon
is a little bit too much in ascendance

1338
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
is a little bit too much in ascendance
 

1339
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,230
is a little bit too much in ascendance
um and i do

1340
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
um and i do
 

1341
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,669
um and i do
i do think that that's there's some good

1342
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
i do think that that's there's some good
 

1343
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,110
i do think that that's there's some good
to that it certainly attracts lots of

1344
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
to that it certainly attracts lots of
 

1345
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,390
to that it certainly attracts lots of
young people to our field

1346
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
young people to our field
 

1347
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,990
young people to our field
but a lot of those people come in with

1348
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
but a lot of those people come in with
 

1349
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,909
but a lot of those people come in with
strong misconceptions and they have to

1350
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:43,919
strong misconceptions and they have to
 

1351
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,230
strong misconceptions and they have to
then

1352
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
then
 

1353
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,310
then
unlearn those and then find something

1354
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
unlearn those and then find something
 

1355
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,270
unlearn those and then find something
you know

1356
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:47,280
you know
 

1357
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,750
you know
to do um and so i think there's just got

1358
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:49,760
to do um and so i think there's just got
 

1359
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,470
to do um and so i think there's just got
to be some

1360
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
to be some
 

1361
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,150
to be some
multiple voices and there's i didn't i

1362
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
multiple voices and there's i didn't i
 

1363

1368
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
so uh as a continuation of a fun tangent
 

1369
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,750
so uh as a continuation of a fun tangent
and speaking of vibrant personalities

1370
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
and speaking of vibrant personalities
 

1371
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,750
and speaking of vibrant personalities
what would you say is the most

1372
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
what would you say is the most
 

1373
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,430
what would you say is the most
interesting disagreement you have with

1374
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
interesting disagreement you have with
 

1375
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,190
interesting disagreement you have with
yon lacoon

1376
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
yon lacoon
 

1377
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,830
yon lacoon
so john's an old friend and i just say

1378
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
so john's an old friend and i just say
 

1379
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,390
so john's an old friend and i just say
that

1380
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
that
 

1381
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,070
that
i i don't think we disagree about very

1382
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,080
i i don't think we disagree about very
 

1383
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,510
i i don't think we disagree about very
much really

1384
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
much really
 

1385
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,750
much really
he and i both kind of have a let's build

1386
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
he and i both kind of have a let's build
 

1387
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,270
he and i both kind of have a let's build
that kind of mentality

1388
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
that kind of mentality
 

1389
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,669
that kind of mentality
and does it work kind of mentality and

1390
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
and does it work kind of mentality and
 

1391
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,950
and does it work kind of mentality and
uh kind of concrete

1392
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
uh kind of concrete
 

1393
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,390
uh kind of concrete
um we both speak french and we speak

1394
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
um we both speak french and we speak
 

1395
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,230
um we both speak french and we speak
french more together and we have we have

1396
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
french more together and we have we have
 

1397
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,909
french more together and we have we have
a lot a lot in common

1398
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
a lot a lot in common
 

1399
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,230
a lot a lot in common
um and so you know if one wanted to

1400
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,240
um and so you know if one wanted to
 

1401
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,190
um and so you know if one wanted to
highlight a

1402
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,200
highlight a
 

1403
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,789
highlight a
a disagreement it's not really a

1404
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:30,799
a disagreement it's not really a
 

1405
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,470
a disagreement it's not really a
fundamental one i think it's just kind

1406
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
fundamental one i think it's just kind
 

1407
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:32,789
fundamental one i think it's just kind
of

1408
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:32,799
of
 

1409
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,830
of
where we're emphasizing um jan has

1410
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:35,840
where we're emphasizing um jan has
 

1411
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,110
where we're emphasizing um jan has
uh emphasized pattern recognition and

1412
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
uh emphasized pattern recognition and
 

1413
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,750
uh emphasized pattern recognition and
uh has emphasized prediction all right

1414
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
uh has emphasized prediction all right
 

1415
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,149
uh has emphasized prediction all right
so

1416
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
so
 

1417
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,310
so
you know um and it's interesting to try

1418
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
you know um and it's interesting to try
 

1419
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,430
you know um and it's interesting to try
to take that as far as you can if you

1420
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
to take that as far as you can if you
 

1421
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,710
to take that as far as you can if you
could do perfect prediction what would

1422
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:46,720
could do perfect prediction what would
 

1423
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,070
could do perfect prediction what would
that give you kind of as a thought

1424
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,080
that give you kind of as a thought
 

1425
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,110
that give you kind of as a thought
experiment

1426
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120
experiment
 

1427
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,950
experiment
um and um i think that's

1428
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
um and um i think that's
 

1429
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,990
um and um i think that's
way too limited um we cannot do perfect

1430
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,000
way too limited um we cannot do perfect
 

1431
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,510
way too limited um we cannot do perfect
prediction we will never have the data

1432
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
prediction we will never have the data
 

1433
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,789
prediction we will never have the data
sets allow me to figure out what you're

1434
00:20:58,789 --> 00:20:58,799
sets allow me to figure out what you're
 

1435
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,070
sets allow me to figure out what you're
about ready to do what question you're

1436
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
about ready to do what question you're
 

1437
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,590
about ready to do what question you're
going to ask next i have no clue i will

1438

going to ask next i have no clue i will
 

1439
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,149
going to ask next i have no clue i will
never know

1440
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
never know
 

1441
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,710
never know
such things moreover most of us find

1442
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
such things moreover most of us find
 

1443
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,270
such things moreover most of us find
ourselves

1444
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
ourselves
 

1445
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,630
ourselves
during the day in all kinds of

1446
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:06,640
during the day in all kinds of
 

1447
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,029
during the day in all kinds of
situations we had no anticipation of

1448
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
situations we had no anticipation of
 

1449
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,149
situations we had no anticipation of
that are kind of very

1450
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
that are kind of very
 

1451
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,510
that are kind of very
very novel in various ways and

1452
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,520
very novel in various ways and
 

1453
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,350
very novel in various ways and
in that moment we want to think through

1454
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,360
in that moment we want to think through
 

1455
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,870
in that moment we want to think through
what we want and also there's going to

1456
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
what we want and also there's going to
 

1457
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,029
what we want and also there's going to
be market forces acting on us

1458
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
be market forces acting on us
 

1459
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,390
be market forces acting on us
i'd like to go down that street but now

think about what i might really want
 

1469
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,270
think about what i might really want
here and i gotta sort of think about how

here and i gotta sort of think about how
 

1471
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,950
here and i gotta sort of think about how
much it cost me to do this action versus

1472
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960
much it cost me to do this action versus
 

1473
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,990
much it cost me to do this action versus
this action

1474
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
this action
 

1475
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,549
this action
i got to think about the risks involved

1476
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
i got to think about the risks involved
 

1477
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,909
i got to think about the risks involved
you know a lot of our current pattern

1478
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:33,919
you know a lot of our current pattern
 

1479
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,430
you know a lot of our current pattern
recognition and prediction systems don't

1480
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
recognition and prediction systems don't
 

1481
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,310
recognition and prediction systems don't
do any risk

1482
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
do any risk
 

1483
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,230
do any risk
evaluations they have no error bars

1484
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,240
evaluations they have no error bars
 

1485
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,750
evaluations they have no error bars
right i got to think about other

1486
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
right i got to think about other
 

1487
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,190
right i got to think about other
people's decisions around me i got to

1488
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,200
people's decisions around me i got to
 

1489
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,430
people's decisions around me i got to
think about a collection of my decisions

1490
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
think about a collection of my decisions
 

1491
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,870
think about a collection of my decisions
even just thinking about like a medical

1492
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
even just thinking about like a medical
 

1493
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,549
even just thinking about like a medical
treatment you know i'm not going to take

i'm going to want to ask what if
questions around that i'm going to want

questions around that i'm going to want
 

1521
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,070
questions around that i'm going to want
to look at some us or other possible

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
to look at some us or other possible
 

1523
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,430
to look at some us or other possible
data i didn't have

1524
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
data i didn't have
 

1525
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,870
data i didn't have
causal things i'm going to have a

1526
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:10,880
causal things i'm going to have a
 

1527
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,870
causal things i'm going to have a
dialogue with a doctor about things we

1528
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
dialogue with a doctor about things we
 

1529
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,270
dialogue with a doctor about things we
didn't think about we gathered the data

1530
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:15,280
didn't think about we gathered the data
 

1531
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,789
didn't think about we gathered the data
you know it i could go on and on i hope

1532
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
you know it i could go on and on i hope
 

1533
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,870
you know it i could go on and on i hope
you can see and i don't i think that if

1534
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:18,880
you can see and i don't i think that if
 

1535
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,149
you can see and i don't i think that if
you say predictions everything

1536
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
you say predictions everything
 

1537
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,070
you say predictions everything
that that you're missing all of this

1538
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
that that you're missing all of this
 

1539
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,350
that that you're missing all of this
stuff

1540
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
stuff
 

1541
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,669
stuff
and so prediction plus decision making

1542
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
and so prediction plus decision making
 

1543
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,870
and so prediction plus decision making
is everything but both of them are

1544
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:26,880
is everything but both of them are
 

1545
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,990
is everything but both of them are
equally important

1546
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,000
equally important
 

1547
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,270
equally important
and so the field has emphasized

1548
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
and so the field has emphasized
 

1549
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,909
and so the field has emphasized
prediction yan rightly so has seen how

1550
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
prediction yan rightly so has seen how
 

1551
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,350
prediction yan rightly so has seen how
powerful that is

1552
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,360
powerful that is
 

1553
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,350
powerful that is
but at the cost of people not being

1554
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
but at the cost of people not being
 

1555
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,789
but at the cost of people not being
aware that decision making is where the

1556
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
aware that decision making is where the
 

1557
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,470
aware that decision making is where the
rubber really hits the road where human

1558
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,480
rubber really hits the road where human
 

1559
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,310
rubber really hits the road where human
lives are at stake where risks are being

00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
lives are at stake where risks are being
 

1561
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,230
lives are at stake where risks are being
taken where you got to gather more data

1562
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,240
taken where you got to gather more data
 

1563
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,590
taken where you got to gather more data
you got to think about the arab bars you

1564
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:43,600
you got to think about the arab bars you
 

1565
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,950
you got to think about the arab bars you
got to think about the consequences of

1566
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:44,960
got to think about the consequences of
 

1567
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,230
got to think about the consequences of
your decisions on others you about the

i'm not the only one working on those

i'm not the only one working on those
 

1575
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,390
i'm not the only one working on those
but we're a smaller tribe and right now

the the one that people talk about the
 

1581
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,149
the the one that people talk about the
most um

1582
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:56,159
most um
 

1583
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,350
most um
but you know if you go out in the real

1584
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
but you know if you go out in the real
 

1585
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,510
but you know if you go out in the real
world in industry um you know

1586
00:22:59,510 --> 00:22:59,520
world in industry um you know
 

1587
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,190
world in industry um you know
at amazon i'd say half the people there

1588
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
at amazon i'd say half the people there
 

1589
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,470
at amazon i'd say half the people there
are working on decision making and the

1590
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:02,480
are working on decision making and the
 

1591
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,669
are working on decision making and the
other half are doing you know the

1592
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:03,679
other half are doing you know the
 

1593
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,630
other half are doing you know the
pattern recognition

1594
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
pattern recognition
 

1595
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,310
pattern recognition
it's important and the words of pattern

1596
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:06,320
it's important and the words of pattern
 

1597
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,990
it's important and the words of pattern
recognition and prediction i think the

1598
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,000
recognition and prediction i think the
 

1599
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,510
recognition and prediction i think the
distinction there

1600
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
distinction there
 

1601
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,510
distinction there
not to linger on words but the

1602
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
not to linger on words but the
 

1603
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,669
not to linger on words but the
distinction there is more a constrained

1604
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:13,679
distinction there is more a constrained
 

1605
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:14,070
distinction there is more a constrained
sort of

1606
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
sort of
 

1607
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,789
sort of
in the lab data set versus decision

1608
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
in the lab data set versus decision
 

1609
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,710
in the lab data set versus decision
making is talking about consequential

1610
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:18,720
making is talking about consequential
 

1611
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,350
making is talking about consequential
decisions

1612
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
decisions
 

1613
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,110
decisions
in the real world under the messiness

1614
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
in the real world under the messiness
 

1615
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,350
in the real world under the messiness
and the uncertainty of the real world

1616
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
and the uncertainty of the real world
 

1617
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,669
and the uncertainty of the real world
and just the whole of it the whole mess

1618
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
and just the whole of it the whole mess
 

1619
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,110
and just the whole of it the whole mess
of it that actually touches human beings

1620
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,120
of it that actually touches human beings
 

1621
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,029
of it that actually touches human beings
and scale like you said market forces

1622
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
and scale like you said market forces
 

1623
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,789
and scale like you said market forces
that's the that's the distinction yeah

1624
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:30,799
that's the that's the distinction yeah
 

1625
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,710
that's the that's the distinction yeah
it helps add those that perspective that

1626
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720
it helps add those that perspective that
 

1627
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,669
it helps add those that perspective that
broader perspective

1628
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
broader perspective
 

1629
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,750
broader perspective
you're right i totally agree uh on the

1630
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
you're right i totally agree uh on the
 

1631
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,950
you're right i totally agree uh on the
other hand if you're a real prediction

1632
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:36,960
other hand if you're a real prediction
 

1633
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,990
other hand if you're a real prediction
person of course you want it to be in

1634
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000
person of course you want it to be in
 

1635
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,110
person of course you want it to be in
the real world you want to predict real

1636
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
the real world you want to predict real
 

1637
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,470
the real world you want to predict real
world events i'm just saying that's not

1638
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
world events i'm just saying that's not
 

1639
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,269
world events i'm just saying that's not
possible

1640
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
possible
 

1641
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,590
possible
with just data sets uh that it has to be

1642
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:43,600
with just data sets uh that it has to be
 

1643
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,029
with just data sets uh that it has to be
in the context of you know

1644
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
in the context of you know
 

1645
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,190
in the context of you know
uh strategic things that someone's doing

1646
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
uh strategic things that someone's doing
 

1647
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,149
uh strategic things that someone's doing
data they might gather

1648
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
data they might gather
 

1649
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,110
data they might gather
things they could have gathered the

1650
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
things they could have gathered the
 

1651
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,029
things they could have gathered the
reasoning process around data it's not

1652
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:51,039
reasoning process around data it's not
 

1653
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,390
reasoning process around data it's not
just taking data and making predictions

1654
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:52,400
just taking data and making predictions
 

1655
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,430
just taking data and making predictions
based on the data

1656
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
based on the data
 

1657
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,269
based on the data
so one of the the things that you're

1658
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279
so one of the the things that you're
 

1659
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,710
so one of the the things that you're
working on

1660
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:56,720
working on
 

1661
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,990
working on
i'm sure there's others working on it

1662
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:58,000
i'm sure there's others working on it
 

1663
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,269
i'm sure there's others working on it
but i don't hear often

1664
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:01,279

 

1665
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,789

it talked about especially in the

1666
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
it talked about especially in the
 

1667
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,710
it talked about especially in the
clarity that you talk about it

1668
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
clarity that you talk about it
 

1669
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,310
clarity that you talk about it
and i think it's both the most exciting

1670
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
and i think it's both the most exciting
 

1671
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,750
and i think it's both the most exciting
and the most concerning

1672
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
and the most concerning
 

1673
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,269
and the most concerning
area of ai in terms of decision making

1674
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:11,279
area of ai in terms of decision making
 

1675
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,789
area of ai in terms of decision making
so you've talked about ai systems that

1676
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
so you've talked about ai systems that
 

1677
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,470
so you've talked about ai systems that
help make decisions that scale

1678
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
help make decisions that scale
 

1679
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,470
help make decisions that scale
in a distributed way millions billions

1680
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:16,480
in a distributed way millions billions
 

1681
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,669
in a distributed way millions billions
decisions

1682
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
decisions
 

1683
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,669
decisions
it's sort of markets of decisions can

1684
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
it's sort of markets of decisions can
 

1685
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,990
it's sort of markets of decisions can
you as a starting point sort of give an

1686
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
you as a starting point sort of give an
 

1687
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,630
you as a starting point sort of give an
example of a system that you think about

1688
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
example of a system that you think about
 

1689
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,149
example of a system that you think about
when you're thinking about these kinds

1690
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
when you're thinking about these kinds
 

1691
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,190
when you're thinking about these kinds
of systems

1692
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
of systems
 

1693
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,789
of systems
uh yeah so first of all you're

1694
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
uh yeah so first of all you're
 

1695
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,070
uh yeah so first of all you're
absolutely getting into some territory

1696
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
absolutely getting into some territory
 

1697
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,470
absolutely getting into some territory
which

1698
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:30,480
which
 

1699
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,549
which
i will be beyond my expertise and and

1700
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
i will be beyond my expertise and and
 

1701
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,830
i will be beyond my expertise and and
there are lots of things that are going

1702
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
there are lots of things that are going
 

1703
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,510
there are lots of things that are going
to be very non-obvious to think about

1704
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
to be very non-obvious to think about
 

1705
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,310
to be very non-obvious to think about
just like

1706
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
just like
 

1707
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,470
just like
just again i like to think about history

1708
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,480
just again i like to think about history
 

1709
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,510
just again i like to think about history
a little bit but think about put

1710
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:39,520
a little bit but think about put
 

1711
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,029
a little bit but think about put
yourself back in the 60s there was kind

1712
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
yourself back in the 60s there was kind
 

1713
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,230
yourself back in the 60s there was kind
of a banking system that wasn't

1714
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
of a banking system that wasn't
 

1715
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,990
of a banking system that wasn't
computerized really there was there was

1716
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
computerized really there was there was
 

1717
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,549
computerized really there was there was
database theory emerging and database

1718
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
database theory emerging and database
 

1719
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,830
database theory emerging and database
people had to think about how do i

1720
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:47,840
people had to think about how do i
 

1721
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,110
people had to think about how do i
actually not just move data around but

1722
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
actually not just move data around but
 

1723
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,990
actually not just move data around but
actual money

1724
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000
actual money
 

1725
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,950
actual money
and have it be you know valid and have

1726
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
and have it be you know valid and have
 

1727
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,789
and have it be you know valid and have
transactions that atms happen that are

1728
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:54,799
transactions that atms happen that are
 

1729
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,029
transactions that atms happen that are
actually you know all valid and

1730
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
actually you know all valid and
 

1731
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,110
actually you know all valid and
so on so forth so that's the kind of

1732
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,120
so on so forth so that's the kind of
 

1733
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,470
so on so forth so that's the kind of
issues you get into when you start to

1734
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
issues you get into when you start to
 

1735
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,909
issues you get into when you start to
get serious about sort of things like

1736
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:01,919
get serious about sort of things like
 

1737
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:02,870
get serious about sort of things like
this

1738
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:02,880
this
 

1739
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,789
this
i like to think about as kind of almost

1740
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
i like to think about as kind of almost
 

1741
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,549
i like to think about as kind of almost
a thought experiment to help me think

1742
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:06,559
a thought experiment to help me think
 

1743
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,590
a thought experiment to help me think
uh something simpler which is a music

1744
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:09,600
uh something simpler which is a music
 

1745
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,710
uh something simpler which is a music
market

1746
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
market
 

1747
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,269
market
and uh because there is the first door

1748
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
and uh because there is the first door
 

1749
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,110
and uh because there is the first door
there is no music market

1750
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
there is no music market
 

1751
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,950

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
our country for sure
 

1755
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,149
our country for sure
uh there are uh something called things

1756
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
uh there are uh something called things
 

1757
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,590
uh there are uh something called things
called record companies

1758
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:21,600
called record companies
 

1759
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,909
called record companies
and they make money uh and they prop up

1760
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
and they make money uh and they prop up
 

1761
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,110
and they make money uh and they prop up
a few um

1762
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
a few um
 

1763
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,029

superstars and they
 

1767
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,870
superstars and they
all make huge amounts of money but

1768
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:30,880
all make huge amounts of money but
 

1769
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,390
all make huge amounts of money but
there's a long tale of huge numbers of

1770
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:32,400
there's a long tale of huge numbers of
 

1771

good music that is actually listened to
 

1775
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,350
good music that is actually listened to
by more people than the famous people

1776
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:37,360
by more people than the famous people
 

1777
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,390
by more people than the famous people
um

1778
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
of a role do you think the algorithm
 

2213
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,470
of a role do you think the algorithm
machine learning has in connecting the

sort of uh the recommender system aspect
 

2219
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,789
sort of uh the recommender system aspect
of this yeah it's a great question i

2220
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:00,799
of this yeah it's a great question i
 

2221
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,149
of this yeah it's a great question i
think pretty high recommend

2222

2225
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,389
you know um there's no magic in the
algorithms but a good recommender system

2226
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:06,399
algorithms but a good recommender system
 

2227
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,070
algorithms but a good recommender system
is way better than a bad recommender

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,070
being recommended to me that i never
would have thought of

2284
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,080
would have thought of
 

2285
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,430
would have thought of
and i bought a bunch of them so they

2286
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,440
and i bought a bunch of them so they
 

2287
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,269
and i bought a bunch of them so they
obviously had a good business model but

2288
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279
obviously had a good business model but
 

2289
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:55,990
obviously had a good business model but
i learned things

2290
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,000
i learned things
 

2291
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,149
i learned things
and i still to this day kind of browse

2292
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
and i still to this day kind of browse
 

2293
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,830
and i still to this day kind of browse
using that service

2294

uh it doesn't work so well for other
 

2317
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,110
uh it doesn't work so well for other
kind of entities but that's just the

whatever term want to use do you think

2376
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:13,760
whatever term want to use do you think
 

2377
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,829
whatever term want to use do you think
it's a solvable problem for machines or

2378
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:15,839
it's a solvable problem for machines or
 

2379
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,430
it's a solvable problem for machines or
is it a deeply human problem that's

2380
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:17,440
is it a deeply human problem that's
 

2381
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,310
is it a deeply human problem that's
unsolvable

2382
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,320
unsolvable
 

2383
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,829
unsolvable
uh so i don't even think about it that

2384
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:19,839
uh so i don't even think about it that
 

2385
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:21,510
uh so i don't even think about it that
level i think that what's broken with

and so they all

2402
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:35,359
and so they all
 

2403
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,629
and so they all
you know starting with google and

facebook they went back to the playbook
 

2407
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,109
facebook they went back to the playbook
of you know the

at least back in the day and so
 

2419
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,869
at least back in the day and so
advertising kind of filled that gap but

2420
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:48,879
advertising kind of filled that gap but
 

2421
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,310
advertising kind of filled that gap but
advertising was new and interesting and

they're in that business model and then

2712
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,400
they're in that business model and then
 

2713
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,829
they're in that business model and then
i'd say google sort of hover somewhere

2714
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:37,839
i'd say google sort of hover somewhere
 

2715
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:38,390
i'd say google sort of hover somewhere
in between

2716
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
in between
 

2717
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,750
in between
i don't i don't think for a long long

2718
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:39,760
i don't i don't think for a long long
 

2719
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,589
i don't i don't think for a long long
time they they got it

2720
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:41,599
time they they got it
 

2721
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,349
time they they got it
i think they probably see that youtube

2722
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:43,359
i think they probably see that youtube
 

2723
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,030
i think they probably see that youtube
is more pregnant with possibility than

2724
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
is more pregnant with possibility than
 

2725
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,150
is more pregnant with possibility than
than than

2726
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,160
than than
 

2727
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,510
than than
they might have thought and that they're

2728
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:47,520
they might have thought and that they're
 

2729
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,670
they might have thought and that they're
probably heading that direction um

2730
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
probably heading that direction um
 

2731
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,750
probably heading that direction um
but uh you know silicon valley's been

2732
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:51,760
but uh you know silicon valley's been
 

2733
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,430
but uh you know silicon valley's been
dominated by the google facebook kind of

2734
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,440
dominated by the google facebook kind of
 

2735
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,030
dominated by the google facebook kind of
mentality and the subscription and

2736
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,040
mentality and the subscription and
 

2737
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,870
mentality and the subscription and
advertising and that is that's the core

2738
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:56,880
advertising and that is that's the core
 

2739
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,990
advertising and that is that's the core
problem

2740
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
problem
 

2741
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,310
problem
right the fake news actually rides on

2742
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,320
right the fake news actually rides on
 

2743
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,510
right the fake news actually rides on
top of that

2744
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:01,520
top of that
 

2745
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,430
top of that
because it means that you're monetizing

2746
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:03,440
because it means that you're monetizing
 

2747
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,870
because it means that you're monetizing
with click-through rate and that is the

2748
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:04,880
with click-through rate and that is the
 

2749
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,630
with click-through rate and that is the
core problem you got to remove that

2750
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
core problem you got to remove that
 

2751
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,630
core problem you got to remove that
so advertisement if you're going to

2752
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:08,640
so advertisement if you're going to
 

2753
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,150
so advertisement if you're going to
linger on that i mean that's an

2754
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,160
linger on that i mean that's an
 

2755
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,829
linger on that i mean that's an
interesting thesis i don't know if

2756
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:11,839
interesting thesis i don't know if
 

2757
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,870
interesting thesis i don't know if
everyone really deeply thinks about that

2758
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
everyone really deeply thinks about that
 

2759
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,069
everyone really deeply thinks about that
so you're right the thought is

2760
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:18,079
so you're right the thought is
 

2761
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,670
so you're right the thought is
the advertising model is the only thing

2765
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,230
we have the only thing we'll ever have
so we have to fix we have to build

2766
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,240
so we have to fix we have to build
 

2767
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,030
so we have to fix we have to build
algorithms

2768

but you think we can slowly you think

2778
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:37,280
but you think we can slowly you think
 

2779
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,470
but you think we can slowly you think
first of all

2780
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,480
first of all
 

2781
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,829
first of all
there's a difference between should and

2782
00:39:40,829 --> 00:39:40,839
there's a difference between should and
 

2783
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,870
there's a difference between should and
could so you're saying we

2784
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:42,880
could so you're saying we
 

2785
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,870
could so you're saying we
should slowly move away from the

2786
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:44,880
should slowly move away from the
 

2787
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,550
should slowly move away from the
advertising model and have a direct

2788
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:46,560
advertising model and have a direct
 

2789
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,230
advertising model and have a direct
connection between the consumer and the

on his vacuum cleaner
 

2961
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,309
on his vacuum cleaner
or maybe there's something good there so

2962
00:42:02,309 --> 00:42:02,319
or maybe there's something good there so
 

2963
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,990
or maybe there's something good there so
i will look at it and and so that's part

2964
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
i will look at it and and so that's part
 

2965
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,430
i will look at it and and so that's part
of the overall information flow in a

2966
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:05,440
of the overall information flow in a
 

2967
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,150
of the overall information flow in a
good market

2968
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:06,160
good market
 

2969
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,190
good market
uh so advertising has a role um

2970
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:09,200
uh so advertising has a role um
 

2971
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,870
uh so advertising has a role um
but the problem is of course that that

2972
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:10,880
but the problem is of course that that
 

2973
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,230
but the problem is of course that that
signal is now completely gone

2974
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,240
signal is now completely gone
 

2975
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,069
signal is now completely gone
because it just you know dominar by

2976
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079
because it just you know dominar by
 

2977
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,589
because it just you know dominar by
these tiny little things that add up to

2978
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:15,599
these tiny little things that add up to
 

2979
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:15,990
these tiny little things that add up to
big money

2980
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,000
big money
 

2981
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,710
big money
for the company you know so i i think it

2982
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
for the company you know so i i think it
 

2983
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,270
for the company you know so i i think it
will just

2984
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:19,280
will just
 

2985
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,790
will just
i think it will change because the

2986
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:20,800
i think it will change because the
 

2987
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,710
i think it will change because the
societies just don't you know stick with

2988
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:22,720
societies just don't you know stick with
 

2989
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,270
societies just don't you know stick with
things that

2990
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:23,280
things that
 

2991
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,270
things that
annoy a lot of people and advertising

2992
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
annoy a lot of people and advertising
 

2993
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,710
annoy a lot of people and advertising
currently annoys people more than it

2994
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
currently annoys people more than it
 

2995
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,230
currently annoys people more than it
provides information

2996
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:28,240
provides information
 

2997
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,990
provides information
and i think that at google probably is

2998
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,000
and i think that at google probably is
 

2999
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,670
and i think that at google probably is
smart enough to figure out that this is

3000
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
smart enough to figure out that this is
 

3001
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,430
smart enough to figure out that this is
a dead this is a bad model

3002
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
a dead this is a bad model
 

3003
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,630
a dead this is a bad model
even though it's a hard huge amount of

3004
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:34,640
even though it's a hard huge amount of
 

3005
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,990
even though it's a hard huge amount of
money and they'll have to figure out how

3006
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
money and they'll have to figure out how
 

3007
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,829
money and they'll have to figure out how
to pull it away from it and slowly

3008
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:37,839
to pull it away from it and slowly
 

3009
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,430
to pull it away from it and slowly
and i'm sure the ceo there will figure

3010
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:39,440
and i'm sure the ceo there will figure
 

3011
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,950
and i'm sure the ceo there will figure
it out but um

3012
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:40,960
it out but um
 

3013
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,990
it out but um
they need to do it and uh they need to

3014
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,000
they need to do it and uh they need to
 

3015
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,990
they need to do it and uh they need to
so if you reduce advertising not to zero

3016
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:46,000
so if you reduce advertising not to zero
 

3017
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,430
so if you reduce advertising not to zero
but you reduce it at the same time you

3018
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,440
but you reduce it at the same time you
 

3019
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,630
but you reduce it at the same time you
bring up

3020
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640
bring up
 

3021
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,950

being delivered so real money is being
 

3025
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,470
being delivered so real money is being
paid and they take a five percent cut

3026
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:54,480
paid and they take a five percent cut
 

3027
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,990
paid and they take a five percent cut
that five percent could start to get big

3028
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:56,000
that five percent could start to get big
 

3029
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,910
that five percent could start to get big
enough to cancel out the lost revenue

3030
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:57,920
enough to cancel out the lost revenue
 

3031
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,349
enough to cancel out the lost revenue
from the the kind of the poor kind of

3607
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,670
musicians who are making all this music
i don't think the right model is that

3608
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,680
i don't think the right model is that
 

3609
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,349
i don't think the right model is that
you pay a little subscription fee

3610
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:31,359
you pay a little subscription fee
 

3611
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,030
you pay a little subscription fee
to them all right because because people

3612
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:33,040
to them all right because because people
 

3613
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,710
to them all right because because people
can copy the bits too easily and it's

3614
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:34,720
can copy the bits too easily and it's
 

3615
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,069
can copy the bits too easily and it's
just not that somewhere the value is the

3616
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,079
just not that somewhere the value is the
 

3617
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,670
just not that somewhere the value is the
value is that a connection was made

3618
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:37,680
value is that a connection was made
 

3619
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,349
value is that a connection was made
between real human beings then you can

3620
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:39,359
between real human beings then you can
 

3621
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:40,870
between real human beings then you can
follow up on that

3622
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:40,880
follow up on that
 

3623
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,430
follow up on that
right and create yet more value so no i

3624
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:43,440
right and create yet more value so no i
 

3625
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,030
right and create yet more value so no i
think um

3626
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
think um
 

3627
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,630
think um

some people don't want privacy they want
 

4027
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,710
some people don't want privacy they want

00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,230
people's want it um
privacy is not a zero one it's not a

4032
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:16,240
privacy is not a zero one it's not a
 

4033
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,430
privacy is not a zero one it's not a
legal thing it's not just about which

4034
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:17,440
legal thing it's not just about which
 

4035
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,349
legal thing it's not just about which
data is available which is not

4036
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:19,359
data is available which is not
 

4037
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,470

um i like to recall to people that you

4038
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:22,480
um i like to recall to people that you
 

4039
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:22,789
um i like to recall to people that you
know

4040
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:22,799
know
 

4041
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,630
know
a couple hundred years ago everyone

4042
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:24,640
a couple hundred years ago everyone
 

4043
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,069
a couple hundred years ago everyone
there was not really big cities everyone

4044
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
there was not really big cities everyone
 

4045
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,150
there was not really big cities everyone
lived down the countryside and villages

4046
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,160
lived down the countryside and villages
 

4047
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,750
lived down the countryside and villages
um and in villages everybody knew

4048
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:29,760
um and in villages everybody knew
 

4049
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,430
um and in villages everybody knew
everything about you very you

4050
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,440
everything about you very you
 

4051
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,430
everything about you very you
didn't have any privacy is that bad are

4052
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:33,440
didn't have any privacy is that bad are
 

4053
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,789
didn't have any privacy is that bad are
we better off now

4054
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:34,799
we better off now
 

4055
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,630
we better off now
well you know arguably no because what

4056
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:36,640
well you know arguably no because what
 

4057
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,309
well you know arguably no because what
did you get for that loss of

4058
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:38,319
did you get for that loss of
 

4059
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,470
did you get for that loss of
at least certain kinds of privacy um

4060
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
at least certain kinds of privacy um
 

4061
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,430
at least certain kinds of privacy um
well uh

4062
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
well uh
 

4063
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,190
well uh
people helped each other if they because

4064
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
people helped each other if they because
 

4065
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,309
people helped each other if they because
they know everything about you they know

4066
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:44,319
they know everything about you they know
 

4067
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,589
they know everything about you they know
something's bad's happening they will

4068
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:45,599
something's bad's happening they will
 

4069
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:46,309
something's bad's happening they will
help you with that

4070
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:46,319
help you with that
 

4071
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,670
help you with that
right and now you live in a big city no

4072
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:47,680
right and now you live in a big city no
 

4073
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,589
right and now you live in a big city no
one knows their mouth you get no help

4074
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:49,599
one knows their mouth you get no help
 

4075
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,710
one knows their mouth you get no help
um so uh it kind of depends the answer i

4076
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:52,720
um so uh it kind of depends the answer i
 

4077
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,430
um so uh it kind of depends the answer i
want certain

4078
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:53,440
want certain
 

4079
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,750
want certain
people who i trust and there should be

4080
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:55,760
people who i trust and there should be
 

4081
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,109
people who i trust and there should be
relationships i should kind of manage

4082
00:57:57,109 --> 00:57:57,119
relationships i should kind of manage
 

4083
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:57,990
relationships i should kind of manage
all those but

4084
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:58,000
all those but
 

4085
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,349
all those but
who knows what about me i should have

4086
00:57:59,349 --> 00:57:59,359
who knows what about me i should have
 

4087
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,190
who knows what about me i should have
some agency there it shouldn't i

4088
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:01,200
some agency there it shouldn't i
 

4089
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:01,510
some agency there it shouldn't i
shouldn't

4090
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:01,520
shouldn't
 

4091
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,750
shouldn't
be a drift in a sea of technology where

4092
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:03,760
be a drift in a sea of technology where
 

4093
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,710
be a drift in a sea of technology where
i have no idea

4094
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:04,720
i have no idea
 

4095
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,390
i have no idea
i don't want to go reading things and

4096
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:06,400
i don't want to go reading things and
 

4097
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,390
i don't want to go reading things and
checking boxes

4098
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
checking boxes
 

4099
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,990
checking boxes
so i don't know how to do this and i'm

4100
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:10,000
so i don't know how to do this and i'm
 

4101
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,069
so i don't know how to do this and i'm
not a privacy researcher per se i just i

4102
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:12,079
not a privacy researcher per se i just i
 

4103
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,150
not a privacy researcher per se i just i
recognize the vast complexity of this

4104
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
recognize the vast complexity of this
 

4105
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,910
recognize the vast complexity of this
it's not just technology it's not just

4106
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920
it's not just technology it's not just
 

4107
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,630
it's not just technology it's not just
legal scholars meeting technologists

4108
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:18,640
legal scholars meeting technologists
 

4109
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,670
legal scholars meeting technologists
there's got to be kind of

4110
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:19,680
there's got to be kind of
 

4111
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,589
there's got to be kind of
whole layers around it and so i when i

4112
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:21,599
whole layers around it and so i when i
 

4113
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,270
whole layers around it and so i when i
allude to this emerging engineering

4114
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:23,280
allude to this emerging engineering
 

4115
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:23,990
allude to this emerging engineering
field

4116
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:24,000
field
 

4117
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,789
field
this is a big part of it um like when

4118
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:26,799
this is a big part of it um like when
 

4119
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:27,990
this is a big part of it um like when
electrical engineering come

4120
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,000
electrical engineering come
 

4121
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,510
electrical engineering come
came i'm not wasn't around in the time

4122
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
came i'm not wasn't around in the time
 

4123
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,190
came i'm not wasn't around in the time
but you just didn't

4124
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:31,200
but you just didn't
 

4125
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,270
but you just didn't
plug electricity you know into walls and

4126
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:33,280
plug electricity you know into walls and
 

4127
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,309
plug electricity you know into walls and
it all kind of worked you don't have to

4128
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:34,319
it all kind of worked you don't have to
 

4129
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:34,950
it all kind of worked you don't have to
have like

4130
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:34,960
have like
 

4131
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,710
have like
underwriter's laboratory that reassured

4132
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
underwriter's laboratory that reassured
 

4133
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,150
underwriter's laboratory that reassured
you that that plug's not going to burn

4134
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
you that that plug's not going to burn
 

4135
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,430
you that that plug's not going to burn
up your house

4136
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,440
up your house
 

4137
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,789
up your house
and that that machine will do this and

4138
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
and that that machine will do this and
 

4139
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,470
and that that machine will do this and
that and everything there'll be whole

00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:42,480
that and everything there'll be whole
 

4141
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,470

00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:44,480
people who can install things there'll
 

4143
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,150
people who can install things there'll
be people who can watch the installers

4144
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,160
be people who can watch the installers
 

4145
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,030
be people who can watch the installers
there'll be a whole

4146
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:47,040
there'll be a whole
 

4147
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,630
there'll be a whole
layers you know an onion of these kind

4148
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,640
layers you know an onion of these kind
 

4149
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,750
layers you know an onion of these kind
of things and for things as deeply

4150
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
of things and for things as deeply
 

4151
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,349
of things and for things as deeply
interesting as privacy which is his

4152
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:53,359
interesting as privacy which is his
 

4153
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,190
interesting as privacy which is his
least essential electricity

4154
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:55,200
least essential electricity
 

4155
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,950
least essential electricity
um that that's gonna take decades to

4156
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:56,960
um that that's gonna take decades to
 

4157
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,309
um that that's gonna take decades to
kind of work out but it's gonna require

4158
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
kind of work out but it's gonna require
 

4159
00:58:58,319 --> 00:58:59,589
kind of work out but it's gonna require
a lot of new structures that we don't

4160
00:58:59,589 --> 00:58:59,599
a lot of new structures that we don't
 

4161
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:00,870
a lot of new structures that we don't
have right now so it's kind of hard to

4162
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:00,880
have right now so it's kind of hard to
 

4163
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,069
have right now so it's kind of hard to
talk about it

4164
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:02,079
talk about it
 

4165
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,349
talk about it
and you're saying there's a lot of money

4166
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
and you're saying there's a lot of money
 

4167
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,950
and you're saying there's a lot of money
to be made if you get it right so

4168
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:04,960
to be made if you get it right so
 

4169
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,910
to be made if you get it right so
absolutely

4170
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:05,920
absolutely
 

4171
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,270
absolutely
a lot of money to be made and all these

4172
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280
a lot of money to be made and all these
 

4173

of what i would look for maybe i could
 

4207
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,109
of what i would look for maybe i could
go and i could read a comment section of

4208
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:41,119
go and i could read a comment section of
 

4209
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,470

00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:42,480
something and it would actually be
 

4211
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,230
something and it would actually be
this kind of dialogue going back and

and on my good days i think that
 

4359
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,030
and on my good days i think that
technology could open us up to you know

technology could open us up to you know
 

4361

01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:03,599
wasn't doing this and we have huge
 

4375
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,710
wasn't doing this and we have huge
amounts of that

01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:04,720
amounts of that
 

4377
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,630
amounts of that
um but in my lifetime i've not seen

4378
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,640
um but in my lifetime i've not seen
 

4379
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,230
um but in my lifetime i've not seen
technology really help in that way

4380
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240
technology really help in that way
 

4381
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,029
technology really help in that way
yet and i do i do i do believe in that

01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:11,039
yet and i do i do i do believe in that
 

4383

yet and i do i do i do believe in that
but

4384
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:11,839
but
 

4385
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,589
but
you know no i think fundamentally humans

4386
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:13,599
you know no i think fundamentally humans
 

4387
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,870
you know no i think fundamentally humans
are good the people suffer

4388
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:14,880
are good the people suffer
 

4389
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,549
are good the people suffer
people have grievances because you have

4390
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:16,559
people have grievances because you have
 

4391
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:17,990
people have grievances because you have
grudges and those things cause them to

4392
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,000
grudges and those things cause them to
 

4393
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,829
grudges and those things cause them to
do things they probably wouldn't want

4394
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
do things they probably wouldn't want
 

4395
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:23,349
do things they probably wouldn't want
they regret it often um so no i

4396
01:02:23,349 --> 01:02:23,359
they regret it often um so no i
 

4397
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,069
they regret it often um so no i
i i think it's a you know part of the

4398
01:02:26,069 --> 01:02:26,079
i i think it's a you know part of the
 

4399
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,910
i i think it's a you know part of the
progress of technology is to indeed

4400
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:27,920
progress of technology is to indeed
 

4401
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,390
progress of technology is to indeed
allow it

4402
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:28,400
allow it
 

4403
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,670
allow it
to be a little easier to be the real

4404
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
to be a little easier to be the real
 

4405
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,589
to be a little easier to be the real
good person you actually are

4406
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:31,599
good person you actually are
 

4407
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:34,870
good person you actually are
well but do you think individual human

4408
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:34,880
well but do you think individual human
 

4409
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,670
well but do you think individual human
life

4410
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:35,680

4411
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,710
life
or society could be modeled as an

01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
or society could be modeled as an
 

4413
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,109
or society could be modeled as an

optimization problem
 

4415
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,510
optimization problem
um not the way i think typically i mean

4416
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:43,520
um not the way i think typically i mean
 

4417
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,150
um not the way i think typically i mean
that's your time

4418
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:44,160
that's your time
 

4419
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,670
that's your time
one of the most complex phenomena in the

4420
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:45,680
one of the most complex phenomena in the
 

4421
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,430
one of the most complex phenomena in the
whole you know in all

4422
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
whole you know in all
 

4423
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,589
whole you know in all
ways individual human life for society

4424
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:49,599
ways individual human life for society
 

4425
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,789
ways individual human life for society
as a whole both

4426
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:50,799
as a whole both
 

4427
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:53,109
as a whole both
both i mean individual human life is

4428
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
both i mean individual human life is
 

4429
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,190
both i mean individual human life is
amazingly complex and um

4430
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:55,200
amazingly complex and um
 

4431
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,109
amazingly complex and um
so uh you know optimization is kind of

4432
01:02:57,109 --> 01:02:57,119
so uh you know optimization is kind of
 

4433
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,549
so uh you know optimization is kind of
just one branch of mathematics that

4434
01:02:58,549 --> 01:02:58,559
just one branch of mathematics that
 

4435
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,990
just one branch of mathematics that
talks about certain kind of things and

4436
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:00,000
talks about certain kind of things and
 

4437
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,870
talks about certain kind of things and
uh it just

4438
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:00,880
uh it just
 

4439
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,789
uh it just
feels way too limited for the complexity

4440
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:02,799
feels way too limited for the complexity
 

4441
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,309
feels way too limited for the complexity
of such things

4442
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
of such things
 

4443
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,630
of such things
what properties of optimization problems

4444
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:06,640
what properties of optimization problems
 

4445
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,309
what properties of optimization problems
do you think so do you think most

4446
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:08,319
do you think so do you think most
 

4447
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,230
do you think so do you think most
interesting problems that could be

4448
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
interesting problems that could be
 

4449
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,069
interesting problems that could be
solved through optimization

4450
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
solved through optimization
 

4451
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,510
solved through optimization
uh what kind of properties does that

4452
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:13,520
uh what kind of properties does that
 

4453
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,630
uh what kind of properties does that
surface have non-convexity convexity

4454
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640
surface have non-convexity convexity
 

4455
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,510
surface have non-convexity convexity
linearity

4456
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:17,520
linearity
 

4457
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,829
linearity
all those kinds of things saddle points

4458
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:19,839
all those kinds of things saddle points
 

4459
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,430
all those kinds of things saddle points
well so optimization's just one piece of

4460
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:21,440
well so optimization's just one piece of
 

4461
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,190
well so optimization's just one piece of
mathematics you know there's like you

treat that as a distribution or density

4502
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
treat that as a distribution or density
 

4503
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,870
treat that as a distribution or density
and find prop

4504
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:54,880
and find prop
 

4505
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,990
and find prop
points that have high density so um

i i want the entire distribution and the

4508
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400
i i want the entire distribution and the
 

4509
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,230
i i want the entire distribution and the
sampling paradigm and i want the um

4510
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,240
sampling paradigm and i want the um
 

4511
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,670
sampling paradigm and i want the um
you know the the single point that's the

4512
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,680
you know the the single point that's the
 

4513
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,510
you know the the single point that's the
best point in the par in the sample

4514
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
best point in the par in the sample
 

4515
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,750
best point in the par in the sample
in the uh optimization paradigm now if

4516
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:07,760
in the uh optimization paradigm now if
 

4517
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,430
in the uh optimization paradigm now if
you were optimizing in the space of

4518
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:09,440
you were optimizing in the space of
 

4519
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,950
you were optimizing in the space of
probability measures

4520
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:10,960
probability measures
 

4521
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,150
probability measures
the output of that could be a whole

4522
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,160
the output of that could be a whole
 

4523
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,510
the output of that could be a whole
probability distribution so you can

4524
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:13,520
probability distribution so you can
 

4525
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,950
probability distribution so you can
start to make these things

4526
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:14,960
start to make these things
 

4527
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,470
start to make these things
the same but in mathematics if you go

4528
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:16,480
the same but in mathematics if you go
 

4529
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,069
the same but in mathematics if you go
too high up that kind of abstraction arc

4530
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:18,079
too high up that kind of abstraction arc
 

4531
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,430
too high up that kind of abstraction arc
you start to lose

4532
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
you start to lose
 

4533
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,829
you start to lose
the uh you know the ability to do the

4534
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:21,839
the uh you know the ability to do the
 

4535
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:23,109
the uh you know the ability to do the
interesting theorems so you kind of

4536
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:23,119
interesting theorems so you kind of
 

4537
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,870
interesting theorems so you kind of
don't try to you don't try to overly

4538
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:24,880
don't try to you don't try to overly
 

4539
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,630
don't try to you don't try to overly
over abstract so as a small tangent

4540
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:28,640
over abstract so as a small tangent
 

4541
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,789
over abstract so as a small tangent
what kind of world view do you find more

4542
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:30,799
what kind of world view do you find more
 

4543
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:32,549
what kind of world view do you find more
appealing one that is

4544
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:32,559
appealing one that is
 

4545
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,230
appealing one that is
deterministic or stochastic

4546
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:36,240
deterministic or stochastic
 

4547
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,270
deterministic or stochastic
well that's easy i mean i'm a

4548
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:37,280
well that's easy i mean i'm a
 

4549
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,270
well that's easy i mean i'm a
statistician you know the world is

4550
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:39,280
statistician you know the world is
 

4551
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,630
statistician you know the world is
highly stochastic wait i don't know

4552
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
highly stochastic wait i don't know
 

4553
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,589
highly stochastic wait i don't know
what's going to happen in the next five

4554
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:41,599
what's going to happen in the next five
 

4555
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,069
what's going to happen in the next five
minutes

4556
01:04:42,069 --> 01:04:42,079
minutes
 

4557
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:43,270
minutes
right because you're going to ask what

4558
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:43,280
right because you're going to ask what
 

4559
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,750
right because you're going to ask what
we're going to do

4560
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:45,760
we're going to do
 

4561
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,589
we're going to do
massive uncertainty yeah you know

4562
01:04:47,589 --> 01:04:47,599
massive uncertainty yeah you know
 

4563
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,510
massive uncertainty yeah you know
massive uncertainty and so the best i

4564
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:49,520
massive uncertainty and so the best i
 

4565
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,630
massive uncertainty and so the best i
can do is have come

4566
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:50,640
can do is have come
 

4567
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,390
can do is have come
rough sense or probability distribution

4568
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:52,400
rough sense or probability distribution
 

4569
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,950
rough sense or probability distribution
on things and somehow use that in my

4570
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:54,960
on things and somehow use that in my
 

4571
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,069
on things and somehow use that in my
reasoning about what to do

4572
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:56,079
reasoning about what to do
 

4573
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,910
reasoning about what to do
now so

4574
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
now so
 

4575
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,710
now so
how does the distributed at scale when

4576
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:02,720
how does the distributed at scale when
 

4577
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,390
how does the distributed at scale when
you have multi-agent systems

4578
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:06,400

 

4579
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,670

look like so optimization can optimize

4580
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:09,680
look like so optimization can optimize
 

4581
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:10,390
look like so optimization can optimize
sort of

4582
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:10,400
sort of
 

4583
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,270
sort of
it makes a lot more sense sort of uh at

4584
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:13,280
it makes a lot more sense sort of uh at
 

4585
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:13,750
it makes a lot more sense sort of uh at
least from

4586
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:13,760
least from
 

4587
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,670
least from
from a robotics perspective for a single

4588
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:15,680
from a robotics perspective for a single
 

4589
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,349
from a robotics perspective for a single
robot for a single agent trying to

4590
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:17,359
robot for a single agent trying to
 

4591
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:20,789
robot for a single agent trying to
optimize some objective function

4592
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:20,799
optimize some objective function
 

4593
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,549
optimize some objective function
when you start to enter the real world

4594
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
when you start to enter the real world
 

4595
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,390
when you start to enter the real world
this game theoretic concept starts

4596
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:24,400
this game theoretic concept starts
 

4597
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,910
this game theoretic concept starts
popping up

4598
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920
popping up
 

4599
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,069
popping up
and that how do you see optimization in

4600
01:05:30,069 --> 01:05:30,079
and that how do you see optimization in
 

4601
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:30,390
and that how do you see optimization in
this

4602
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:30,400
this
 

4603
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,829
this
because you've talked about markets in a

4604
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:31,839
because you've talked about markets in a
 

4605
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,670
because you've talked about markets in a
scale what does that look like

4606
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
scale what does that look like
 

4607
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,190
scale what does that look like
do you see this optimization do you see

4608
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:35,200
do you see this optimization do you see
 

4609
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,710
do you see this optimization do you see
it as sampling do you see

4610
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
it as sampling do you see
 

4611
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,390
it as sampling do you see
like how how should you modify these all

4612
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:38,400
like how how should you modify these all
 

4613
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,630
like how how should you modify these all
blend together um and a system designer

4614
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:40,640
blend together um and a system designer
 

4615
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,670
blend together um and a system designer
thinking about how to

4616
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:41,680
thinking about how to
 

4617
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,829
thinking about how to
build an incentivized system will have a

4618
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:43,839
build an incentivized system will have a
 

4619
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,349
build an incentivized system will have a
blend of all these things so

4620
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:45,359
blend of all these things so
 

4621
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,589
blend of all these things so
you know a particle in a potential well

4622
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:47,599
you know a particle in a potential well
 

4623
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:48,950
you know a particle in a potential well
is optimizing a function called

4624
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:48,960
is optimizing a function called
 

4625
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,150
is optimizing a function called
lagrangian

4626
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:50,160
lagrangian
 

4627
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,750
lagrangian
right the particle doesn't know that

4628
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:51,760
right the particle doesn't know that
 

4629
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,750
right the particle doesn't know that
there's no algorithm running

4630
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
there's no algorithm running
 

4631
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,670
there's no algorithm running
that does that it just happens it's so

4632
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
that does that it just happens it's so
 

4633
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,029
that does that it just happens it's so
it's a description mathematically of

4634
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:57,039
it's a description mathematically of
 

4635
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:57,990
it's a description mathematically of
something that helps us

4636
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
something that helps us
 

4637
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,390
something that helps us
understand as analysts what's happening

4638
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:00,400
understand as analysts what's happening
 

4639
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,750
understand as analysts what's happening
right and so the same will happen when

4640
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,760
right and so the same will happen when
 

4641
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,109
right and so the same will happen when
we talk about you know mixtures of

4642
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:03,119
we talk about you know mixtures of
 

4643
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:03,990
we talk about you know mixtures of
humans and computers

4644
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,000
humans and computers
 

4645
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,910
humans and computers
and markets and so on so forth there'll

4646
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:05,920
and markets and so on so forth there'll
 

4647
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,270
and markets and so on so forth there'll
be certain principles that allow us to

4648
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,280
be certain principles that allow us to
 

4649
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,390
be certain principles that allow us to
understand what's happening and whether

4650
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,400
understand what's happening and whether
 

4651
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,990
understand what's happening and whether
or not the actual algorithms are being

01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:15,839
have set up a
 

4659
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,870
have set up a
multi-agent or market kind of system

4660
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:18,880
multi-agent or market kind of system
 

4661
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,630
multi-agent or market kind of system
and i'm now thinking about an individual

4662
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
and i'm now thinking about an individual
 

4663
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,150
and i'm now thinking about an individual
agent in that system

4664
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160
agent in that system
 

4665
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,750
agent in that system
and they're asked to do some tasks and

4666
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:23,760
and they're asked to do some tasks and
 

4667
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,789
and they're asked to do some tasks and
they're incentivized in some way they

4668
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
they're incentivized in some way they
 

4669
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,150
they're incentivized in some way they
get certain signals and they

4670
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,160
get certain signals and they
 

4671
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,390
get certain signals and they
they have some utility maybe what they

4672
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:28,400
they have some utility maybe what they
 

4673
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,150
they have some utility maybe what they
will do at that point is they just won't

4674
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:30,160
will do at that point is they just won't
 

4675
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,109
will do at that point is they just won't
know the answer they may have to

4676
01:06:31,109 --> 01:06:31,119
know the answer they may have to
 

4677
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:32,710
know the answer they may have to
optimize to find an answer

4678
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
optimize to find an answer

you know and game theory is is very very

4684
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:38,720
you know and game theory is is very very
 

4685
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,710
you know and game theory is is very very
broad it is often

4686
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:40,720
broad it is often
 

4687
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,390

studied very narrowly for certain kinds

4688
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:42,400

4689
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,750
studied very narrowly for certain kinds
of problems

4690
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:43,760
of problems
 

4691
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,430
of problems
but it's roughly speaking this is just

4692
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:45,440
but it's roughly speaking this is just
 

4693
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,670
but it's roughly speaking this is just
the i don't know what you're going to do

4694
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:47,680
the i don't know what you're going to do
 

4695
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,190
the i don't know what you're going to do
so i kind of anticipate that a little

4696
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
so i kind of anticipate that a little
 

4697
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:49,510
so i kind of anticipate that a little
bit

bit
 

4699
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,430

what saddle points are but
i've heard you kind of mentioned that

i've heard you kind of mentioned that
 

4721
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,870
i've heard you kind of mentioned that
there's a there's a branch of

optimization
 

4725
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,710

you could try to explicitly look for

that's a good thing oh not optimization

4730
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:15,680
that's a good thing oh not optimization
 

4731
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,270
that's a good thing oh not optimization
that's just game theory that that's so

4732
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:17,280
that's just game theory that that's so
 

4733
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:17,750
that's just game theory that that's so
uh

4734
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:17,760
uh
 

4735
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,710
uh
there's all kinds of different

4736
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:18,720
there's all kinds of different
 

4737
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,710
there's all kinds of different
equilibria in game theory and some of

4738
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:20,720
equilibria in game theory and some of
 

4739
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,029
equilibria in game theory and some of
them are highly explanatory behavior

4740
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:23,039
them are highly explanatory behavior
 

4741
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,549
them are highly explanatory behavior
they're not attempting to be algorithmic

4742
01:07:24,549 --> 01:07:24,559
they're not attempting to be algorithmic
 

4743
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,630
they're not attempting to be algorithmic
they're just trying to say if you happen

4744
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:26,640
they're just trying to say if you happen
 

4745
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,309
they're just trying to say if you happen
to be at this equilibrium

4746
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
to be at this equilibrium
 

4747
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,670
to be at this equilibrium
you would see certain kind of behavior

4748
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,680
you would see certain kind of behavior
 

4749
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,029
you would see certain kind of behavior
and we see that in real life that's what

4750
01:07:31,029 --> 01:07:31,039
and we see that in real life that's what
 

4751
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,710
and we see that in real life that's what
an economist wants to do especially

01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:38,000
um uh in in continuous
 

4757
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,549
um uh in in continuous
uh differential game theory you're in

4758
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:40,559
uh differential game theory you're in
 

4759
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:41,670
uh differential game theory you're in
continuous spaces

4760
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,680
continuous spaces
 

4761
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,750
continuous spaces
a um some of the simplest equilibria are

4762
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:43,760
a um some of the simplest equilibria are
 

4763
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,349
a um some of the simplest equilibria are
saddle points a nash equilibrium is a

4764
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
saddle points a nash equilibrium is a
 

4765
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,150
saddle points a nash equilibrium is a
saddle point

4766
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:46,160
saddle point
 

4767
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,430
saddle point
it's a special kind of salon point so

4768
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
it's a special kind of salon point so
 

4769
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,870
it's a special kind of salon point so
classically in game theory you were

4770
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:50,880
classically in game theory you were
 

4771
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,549
classically in game theory you were
trying to find nash equilibria

4772
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:52,559
trying to find nash equilibria
 

4773
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,069
trying to find nash equilibria
and algorithmic games here you're trying

4774
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:54,079
and algorithmic games here you're trying
 

4775
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:56,150
and algorithmic games here you're trying
to find algorithms that would find them

4776
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:56,160
to find algorithms that would find them
 

4777
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,349
to find algorithms that would find them
and so you're trying to find saddle

4778
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:57,359
and so you're trying to find saddle
 

4779
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:58,789
and so you're trying to find saddle
points i mean so that's literally what

4780
01:07:58,789 --> 01:07:58,799
points i mean so that's literally what
 

4781
01:07:58,799 --> 01:07:59,910
points i mean so that's literally what
you're trying to do

4782
01:07:59,910 --> 01:07:59,920
you're trying to do
 

4783
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,829
you're trying to do
um but you know any economist knows that

4784
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:01,839
um but you know any economist knows that
 

4785
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,990
um but you know any economist knows that
nash equilibria have their limitations

4786
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:04,000
nash equilibria have their limitations
 

4787
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,390
nash equilibria have their limitations
they are definitely not that explanatory

4788
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:06,400
they are definitely not that explanatory
 

4789
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,910
they are definitely not that explanatory
in many situations

4790
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:07,920
in many situations
 

4791
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,069
in many situations
they're not what you really want um

4792
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,079
they're not what you really want um
 

4793
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,910
they're not what you really want um
there's other kind of equilibria

4794
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:11,920
there's other kind of equilibria
 

4795
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,510
there's other kind of equilibria
and there's names associated with these

4796
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:13,520
and there's names associated with these
 

4797
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,870
and there's names associated with these
because they came from history with

4798
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:14,880
because they came from history with
 

4799
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,070
because they came from history with
certain people working on them but there

4800
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
certain people working on them but there
 

4801
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,829
certain people working on them but there
will be new ones emerging

4802
01:08:17,829 --> 01:08:17,839
will be new ones emerging
 

4803
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,149
will be new ones emerging
so you know one example is a stackelberg

4804
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
so you know one example is a stackelberg
 

4805
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:21,030
so you know one example is a stackelberg
equilibrium

4806
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:21,040
equilibrium
 

4807
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,269
equilibrium
so you know nash you and i are both

4808
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:23,279
so you know nash you and i are both
 

4809
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,950
so you know nash you and i are both
playing this game against each other or

4810
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:24,960
playing this game against each other or
 

4811
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,950
playing this game against each other or
for each other maybe it's cooperative

4812
01:08:26,950 --> 01:08:26,960
for each other maybe it's cooperative
 

4813
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,390
for each other maybe it's cooperative
and we're both going to think it through

4814
01:08:28,390 --> 01:08:28,400
and we're both going to think it through
 

4815
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,430
and we're both going to think it through
and then we're going to decide and we're

4816
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:29,440
and then we're going to decide and we're
 

4817
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,789
and then we're going to decide and we're
going to off you know do our thing

4818
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:30,799
going to off you know do our thing
 

4819
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,430
going to off you know do our thing
simultaneously you know in a stackelberg

4820
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:33,440
simultaneously you know in a stackelberg
 

4821
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,630
simultaneously you know in a stackelberg
no i'm going to be the first mover i'm

4822
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:34,640
no i'm going to be the first mover i'm
 

4823
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,669
no i'm going to be the first mover i'm
going to make a move

4824
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:35,679
going to make a move
 

4825
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,030
going to make a move
you're going to look at my move and then

4826
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,040
you're going to look at my move and then
 

4827
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,709
you're going to look at my move and then
you're going to make yours now since i

4828
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:38,719
you're going to make yours now since i
 

4829
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:40,470
you're going to make yours now since i
know you're going to look at my move

4830
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:40,480
know you're going to look at my move
 

4831
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,070
know you're going to look at my move
i anticipate what you're going to do and

4832
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,080
i anticipate what you're going to do and
 

4833
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,590
i anticipate what you're going to do and
so i don't do something stupid

4834
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:43,600
so i don't do something stupid
 

4835
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,430
so i don't do something stupid
but and but then i know that you were

4836
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,440
but and but then i know that you were
 

4837
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,349
but and but then i know that you were
also anticipating me so we're kind of

4838
01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:47,359
also anticipating me so we're kind of
 

4839
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:48,709
also anticipating me so we're kind of
going back and so far am i but there is

4840
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:48,719
going back and so far am i but there is
 

4841
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:50,470
going back and so far am i but there is
then a first mover

4842
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:50,480
then a first mover
 

4843
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,789
then a first mover
thing and so there's a those are

4844
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:52,799
thing and so there's a those are
 

4845
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,070
thing and so there's a those are
different equilibria

4846
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:54,080
different equilibria
 

4847
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,789
different equilibria
all right and uh so just mathematically

4848
01:08:56,789 --> 01:08:56,799
all right and uh so just mathematically
 

4849
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:57,910
all right and uh so just mathematically
yeah these things have certain

4850
01:08:57,910 --> 01:08:57,920
yeah these things have certain
 

4851
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,430
yeah these things have certain
topologies certain shapes they're like

4852
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,440
topologies certain shapes they're like
 

4853
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,950
topologies certain shapes they're like
southwest and algorithmically or

4854
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:00,960
southwest and algorithmically or
 

4855
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,630
southwest and algorithmically or
dynamically how do you move towards them

4856
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:02,640
dynamically how do you move towards them
 

4857
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,870
dynamically how do you move towards them
how do you move away from things

4858
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:04,880
how do you move away from things
 

4859
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,709
how do you move away from things
um you know so some of these questions

4860
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
um you know so some of these questions
 

4861
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,390
um you know so some of these questions
have answers they've been studied

4862
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:08,400
have answers they've been studied
 

4863
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:09,990
have answers they've been studied
others do not and especially if it

4864
01:09:09,990 --> 01:09:10,000
others do not and especially if it
 

4865
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,829
others do not and especially if it
becomes stochastic

4866
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:11,839
becomes stochastic
 

4867
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,189
becomes stochastic
especially if there's large numbers of

know young people getting in this field

4872
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:16,719
know young people getting in this field
 

4873
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:17,910

who kind of think it's all done because

4874
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:17,920
who kind of think it's all done because
 

4875
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,590
who kind of think it's all done because
we have you know tensorflow

4876
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:19,600
we have you know tensorflow
 

4877
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,910
we have you know tensorflow
well no these are all open problems and

4878
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:21,920
well no these are all open problems and
 

4879
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,430
well no these are all open problems and
they're really important and interesting

4880
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:23,440
they're really important and interesting
 

4881
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:23,990
they're really important and interesting
and it's about

4882
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,000
and it's about
 

4883
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,229
and it's about
strategic settings how do i collect data

4884
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:26,239
strategic settings how do i collect data
 

4885
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:27,590
strategic settings how do i collect data
suppose i don't know what you're going

4886
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:27,600
suppose i don't know what you're going
 

4887
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,269
suppose i don't know what you're going
to do because i don't know you very well

4888
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:29,279
to do because i don't know you very well
 

4889
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,709
to do because i don't know you very well
right well i got to kind of date about

4890
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
right well i got to kind of date about
 

4891
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,309
right well i got to kind of date about
you so maybe i want to push you in a

4892
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:32,319
you so maybe i want to push you in a
 

4893
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:33,669
you so maybe i want to push you in a
part of the space where i don't know

4894
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:33,679
part of the space where i don't know
 

4895
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,430
part of the space where i don't know
much about you so i can get data because

4896
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:35,440
much about you so i can get data because
 

4897
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,189
much about you so i can get data because
and then later i'll realize that you'll

4898
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
and then later i'll realize that you'll
 

4899
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:38,709
and then later i'll realize that you'll
never you'll never go there because of

4900
01:09:38,709 --> 01:09:38,719
never you'll never go there because of
 

4901
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:39,990
never you'll never go there because of
the way the game is set up but you know

4902
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:40,000
the way the game is set up but you know
 

4903
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,430
the way the game is set up but you know
that's part of the overall

4904
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:41,440
that's part of the overall
 

4905
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,590
that's part of the overall
you know data analysis context is that

4906
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:43,600
you know data analysis context is that
 

4907
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,950
you know data analysis context is that
yeah even the game of poker is

4908
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:44,960
yeah even the game of poker is
 

4909
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,229
yeah even the game of poker is
fascinating space

4910
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:46,239
fascinating space
 

4911
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:47,510
fascinating space
whenever there's any uncertainty your

4912
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:47,520
whenever there's any uncertainty your
 

4913
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,590
whenever there's any uncertainty your
lack of information is it's a

4914
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:49,600
lack of information is it's a
 

4915
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,709
lack of information is it's a
super exciting space yeah uh just

4916
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:52,719
super exciting space yeah uh just
 

4917
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:55,430
super exciting space yeah uh just
uh lingard optimization for a second so

4918
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
uh lingard optimization for a second so
 

4919
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,950
uh lingard optimization for a second so
if we look at deep learning it's

4920
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
if we look at deep learning it's
 

4921
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:57,669
if we look at deep learning it's
essentially

4922
01:09:57,669 --> 01:09:57,679
essentially
 

4923
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,870
essentially
minimization of a complicated loss

4927
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,510
function
so is there something insightful or

4928
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:03,520
so is there something insightful or
 

4929
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,350
so is there something insightful or
hopeful that you see

4930
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:05,360
hopeful that you see
 

4931
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,669
hopeful that you see
in the kinds of function surface that

4932
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
in the kinds of function surface that
 

4933
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:08,709
in the kinds of function surface that
loss functions

4934
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:08,719

that deep learning in in the real world

4936
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:12,080
that deep learning in in the real world
 

4937
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,910
that deep learning in in the real world
is trying to optimize over is there

4938
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:13,920
is trying to optimize over is there
 

4939
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,189
is trying to optimize over is there
something interesting

4940
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:15,199
something interesting
 

4941
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:17,669
something interesting
this is just the usual kind of problems

4942
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:17,679
this is just the usual kind of problems
 

4943
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,910
this is just the usual kind of problems
of optimization

4944
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:19,920
of optimization
 

4945
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,669
of optimization
i think from an optimization point of

4946
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:21,679
i think from an optimization point of
 

4947
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,030
i think from an optimization point of
view that surface first of all it's

4948
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:23,040
view that surface first of all it's
 

4949
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,390
view that surface first of all it's
pretty smooth

4950
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:24,400
pretty smooth
 

4951
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,189
pretty smooth
um and secondly if there's over if it's

4952
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:27,199
um and secondly if there's over if it's
 

4953
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:28,550
um and secondly if there's over if it's
over parameterized there's kind of lots

4954
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:28,560
over parameterized there's kind of lots
 

4955
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,270
over parameterized there's kind of lots
of paths down to reasonable optima

4956
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,280
of paths down to reasonable optima
 

4957
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,950
of paths down to reasonable optima
and so kind of the getting downhill to

4958
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:32,960
and so kind of the getting downhill to
 

4959
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,350
and so kind of the getting downhill to
the to an optimum is viewed as not as

4960
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,360
the to an optimum is viewed as not as
 

4961
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,110
the to an optimum is viewed as not as
hard as you might have expected

4962
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,120
hard as you might have expected
 

4963
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,470
hard as you might have expected
in high dimensions the fact that some

4964
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:40,480
in high dimensions the fact that some
 

4965
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,310
in high dimensions the fact that some
optima tend to be really good ones and

4966
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:42,320
optima tend to be really good ones and
 

4967
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,990
optima tend to be really good ones and
others not so good and you tend to it's

4968
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,000
others not so good and you tend to it's
 

4969
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,310
others not so good and you tend to it's
not

4970
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:44,320
not
 

4971
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,310
not
sometimes you find the good ones is sort

4972
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:46,320
sometimes you find the good ones is sort
 

4973
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,430
sometimes you find the good ones is sort
of still needs explanation

4974
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
of still needs explanation
 

4975
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,510
of still needs explanation
yes but but the particular surface is

01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:51,520
yes but but the particular surface is
 

4977
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:52,950
yes but but the particular surface is
coming from the particular generation of

01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:52,960
coming from the particular generation of
 

4979
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,550
coming from the particular generation of
neural nets i kind of suspect those will

4980
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,560
neural nets i kind of suspect those will
 

4981
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:54,870
neural nets i kind of suspect those will
this

4982
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:54,880
this
 

4983
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,950
this
those will change in 10 years it will

4984
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:56,960
those will change in 10 years it will
 

4985
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,470
those will change in 10 years it will
not be exactly those surfaces there'll

4986
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:58,480
not be exactly those surfaces there'll
 

4987
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,669
not be exactly those surfaces there'll
be some others that are

01:10:59,669 --> 01:10:59,679
be some others that are
 

4989
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:00,870
be some others that are
and optimization theory will help

4990
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:00,880
and optimization theory will help
 

4991
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,870
and optimization theory will help
contribute to why other surfaces are why

4992
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:02,880
contribute to why other surfaces are why

01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,080
that's not that didn't come from
 

5001
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,430
that's not that didn't come from
neuroscience per se i mean maybe in the

5002
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:11,440
neuroscience per se i mean maybe in the
 

5003
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,550
neuroscience per se i mean maybe in the
minds of some of the people working on

01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:12,560
minds of some of the people working on
 

5005
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,669
minds of some of the people working on
it they were thinking

5006
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:13,679
it they were thinking
 

5007
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,149
it they were thinking
about brains but uh they were arithmetic

5008
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:16,159
about brains but uh they were arithmetic
 

5009
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:17,830
about brains but uh they were arithmetic
circuits in all kinds of fields you know

01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:17,840
circuits in all kinds of fields you know
 

5011
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,430

so on
 

5015
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,310
so on
and that layers of these could transform

5016
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:22,320
and that layers of these could transform
 

5017
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,750
and that layers of these could transform
things in certain ways and that

5018

if it's smooth maybe you could uh you

5020
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080
if it's smooth maybe you could uh you
 

5021
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,910
if it's smooth maybe you could uh you
know find parameter values

5022
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
know find parameter values
 

5023
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,950
know find parameter values
um you know it's a big is a is

5024
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:30,960
um you know it's a big is a is
 

5025
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,630
um you know it's a big is a is
a sort of big discovery that it's it's

5026
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:32,640
a sort of big discovery that it's it's
 

5027
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,790
a sort of big discovery that it's it's
working it's able to work at this scale

5028
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:34,800
working it's able to work at this scale
 

5029
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,149
working it's able to work at this scale
but um

5030
01:11:36,149 --> 01:11:36,159
but um
 

5031
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:38,229
but um
um i don't think that we're stuck with

5032
01:11:38,229 --> 01:11:38,239
um i don't think that we're stuck with
 

5033
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,750
um i don't think that we're stuck with
that and we're certainly not stuck with

5034
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:39,760
that and we're certainly not stuck with
 

5035
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,790
that and we're certainly not stuck with
that because we're understanding the

5036
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:40,800
that because we're understanding the
 

5037
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,910
that because we're understanding the
brain

5038
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:41,920
brain
 

5039
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,990
brain
so in terms of uh on the algorithm size

5040
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:44,000
so in terms of uh on the algorithm size
 

5041
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,350
so in terms of uh on the algorithm size
of gradient descent

5042
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:45,360
of gradient descent
 

5043
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,870
of gradient descent
do you think we're stuck with gradient

5044
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:46,880
do you think we're stuck with gradient
 

5045
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,350
do you think we're stuck with gradient
descent this is uh variants of it what

5046
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
descent this is uh variants of it what
 

5047
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,030
descent this is uh variants of it what
variants do you find interesting or do

5048
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,040
variants do you find interesting or do
 

5049
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,310
variants do you find interesting or do
you think there'll be something else

5050
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
you think there'll be something else
 

5051
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,590
you think there'll be something else
invented

5052
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:53,600
invented
 

5053
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,110
invented
that uh is able to walk all over these

5054
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:57,120
that uh is able to walk all over these
 

5055
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,110
that uh is able to walk all over these
optimization spaces in more interesting

5056
01:11:59,110 --> 01:11:59,120
optimization spaces in more interesting
 

5057
01:11:59,120 --> 01:11:59,590
optimization spaces in more interesting
ways

5058
01:11:59,590 --> 01:11:59,600
ways
 

5059
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,750
ways
so there's a co-design of the surface

5060
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:01,760
so there's a co-design of the surface
 

5061
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,189
so there's a co-design of the surface
and or the architecture and the

5062
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:03,199
and or the architecture and the
 

5063
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,470
and or the architecture and the
algorithm

5064
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:04,480
algorithm
 

5065
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,550
algorithm
so if you just ask if we stay with the

5066
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:06,560
so if you just ask if we stay with the
 

5067
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,830
so if you just ask if we stay with the
kind of architectures we have now and

5068
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:07,840
kind of architectures we have now and
 

5069
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,990
kind of architectures we have now and
not just neural nets but you know

5070
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:10,000
not just neural nets but you know
 

5071
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,590
not just neural nets but you know
phase retrieval architectures or

5072
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:11,600
phase retrieval architectures or
 

5073
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,110
phase retrieval architectures or
materials completion architectures and

5074
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:13,120
materials completion architectures and
 

5075
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:13,910
materials completion architectures and
so on

5076
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:13,920
so on
 

5077
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,990
so on
um you know i think we've kind of come

5078
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,000
um you know i think we've kind of come
 

5079
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,189
um you know i think we've kind of come
to a place where yeah

5080
01:12:17,189 --> 01:12:17,199
to a place where yeah
 

5081
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:20,070
to a place where yeah
a stochastic gradient algorithms are

5082
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,080
a stochastic gradient algorithms are
 

5083
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:20,709
a stochastic gradient algorithms are
dominant

5084
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:20,719
dominant
 

5085
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,070
dominant
and um there are versions uh they're

5086
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,080
and um there are versions uh they're
 

5087
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,270
and um there are versions uh they're
you know that are a little better than

5088
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:25,280
you know that are a little better than
 

5089
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,110
you know that are a little better than
others they you know have more

5090
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:27,120
others they you know have more
 

5091
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,709
others they you know have more
guarantees they're more robust and and

5092
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:28,719
guarantees they're more robust and and
 

5093
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,310
guarantees they're more robust and and
so on and there's ongoing research to

5094
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:30,320
so on and there's ongoing research to
 

5095
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,430
so on and there's ongoing research to
kind of figure out which is the best

5096
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:31,440
kind of figure out which is the best
 

5097
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,270
kind of figure out which is the best
downforce situation

5098
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:33,280
downforce situation
 

5099
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,030
downforce situation
um but i think that that'll start to

5100
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:35,040
um but i think that that'll start to
 

5101
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,550
um but i think that that'll start to
co-evolve that that'll put pressure on

5102
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:36,560
co-evolve that that'll put pressure on
 

5103
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,070
co-evolve that that'll put pressure on
the actual architecture and so we

5104
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:38,080
the actual architecture and so we
 

5105
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,430
the actual architecture and so we
shouldn't do it in this particular way

5106
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
shouldn't do it in this particular way
 

5107
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,550
shouldn't do it in this particular way
we should do it in a different way

5108
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:40,560
we should do it in a different way
 

5109
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,590
we should do it in a different way
because this other algorithm is now

5110
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:41,600
because this other algorithm is now
 

5111
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,870
because this other algorithm is now
available if you do it in a different

5112
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:42,880
available if you do it in a different
 

5113
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,830
available if you do it in a different
way

5114
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:43,840
way
 

5115
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,870
way
um so uh

5116
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
um so uh
 

5117
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,709
um so uh
that that i can't really anticipate that

5118
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:48,719
that that i can't really anticipate that
 

5119
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,790
that that i can't really anticipate that
co-evolution process but

5120
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
co-evolution process but
 

5121
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,550
co-evolution process but
you know gradients are amazing uh

5122
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
you know gradients are amazing uh
 

5123
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,830
you know gradients are amazing uh
mathematical objects

5124
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:53,840
mathematical objects
 

5125
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,110
mathematical objects
um they uh have a lot of people who

5126
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:57,120
um they uh have a lot of people who
 

5127
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,189
um they uh have a lot of people who
uh start to study them more deeply

5128
01:12:59,189 --> 01:12:59,199
uh start to study them more deeply
 

5129
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,470
uh start to study them more deeply
mathematically

5130
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480
mathematically
 

5131
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,310
mathematically
are kind of shocked about what what they

5132
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,320
are kind of shocked about what what they
 

5133
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,630
are kind of shocked about what what they
are and what they can do um

5134
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:04,640
are and what they can do um
 

5135
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,149
are and what they can do um
i mean to think about this way if uh

5136
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:06,159
i mean to think about this way if uh
 

5137
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,430
i mean to think about this way if uh
suppose that i tell you if you move

5138
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440
suppose that i tell you if you move
 

5139
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,590
suppose that i tell you if you move
along the x-axis you get uh

5140
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:09,600
along the x-axis you get uh
 

5141
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,430
along the x-axis you get uh
uh uh you know you go uphill in some

5142
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:11,440
uh uh you know you go uphill in some
 

5143
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,189
uh uh you know you go uphill in some
objective by you know three units

5144
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:13,199
objective by you know three units
 

5145
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:15,590
objective by you know three units
whereas if you move on the y-axis you go

5146
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:15,600
whereas if you move on the y-axis you go
 

5147
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,550
whereas if you move on the y-axis you go
uphill by

5148
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:16,560
uphill by
 

5149
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,630
uphill by
seven units right now i'm gonna only

5150
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:18,640
seven units right now i'm gonna only
 

5151
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,070
seven units right now i'm gonna only
allow you to move a certain you know

5152
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,080
allow you to move a certain you know
 

5153
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,350
allow you to move a certain you know
unit distance

5154
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:21,360
unit distance
 

5155
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,830
unit distance
all right what are you gonna do well the

5156
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
all right what are you gonna do well the
 

5157
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:25,430
all right what are you gonna do well the
most not people will say

5158
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:25,440
most not people will say
 

5159
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,630
most not people will say
i'm gonna go along the y-axis i'm

5160
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:26,640
i'm gonna go along the y-axis i'm
 

5161
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,470
i'm gonna go along the y-axis i'm
getting the biggest bang for my buck

5162
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:28,480
getting the biggest bang for my buck
 

5163
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,310
getting the biggest bang for my buck
you know and my buck is only one unit so

5164
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,320
you know and my buck is only one unit so
 

5165
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,310
you know and my buck is only one unit so
i'm gonna put all of it in the y-axis

5166
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:32,320
i'm gonna put all of it in the y-axis
 

5167
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,350
i'm gonna put all of it in the y-axis
right

5168
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:33,360
right
 

5169
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,550
right
and uh why should i even take any of my

5170
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,560
and uh why should i even take any of my
 

5171
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,630
and uh why should i even take any of my
strength my step size and put any of it

5172
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:38,640
strength my step size and put any of it
 

5173
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,990
strength my step size and put any of it
in the x-axis because i'm getting less

5174
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,000
in the x-axis because i'm getting less
 

5175
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,189
in the x-axis because i'm getting less
bang for my buck

5176
01:13:41,189 --> 01:13:41,199
bang for my buck
 

5177
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,350
bang for my buck
that seems like a completely you know

5178
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:43,360
that seems like a completely you know
 

5179
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,630
that seems like a completely you know
clear cl

5180
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:44,640
clear cl
 

5181
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,470
clear cl
argument and it's wrong because the

5182
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:46,480
argument and it's wrong because the
 

5183
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,390
argument and it's wrong because the
gradient direction is not to go along

5184
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:48,400
gradient direction is not to go along
 

5185
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,110
gradient direction is not to go along
the y-axis

5186
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,120
the y-axis
 

5187
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,270
the y-axis
it's to take a little bit of the x-axis

5188
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
it's to take a little bit of the x-axis
 

5189
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,390
it's to take a little bit of the x-axis
uh and that

5190
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:52,400
uh and that
 

5191
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,070
uh and that
to understand that you have to you have

5192
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,080
to understand that you have to you have
 

5193
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,430
to understand that you have to you have
to know some math and

5194
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:55,440
to know some math and
 

5195
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,470
to know some math and
um so even a you know trivial so

5196
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:58,480
um so even a you know trivial so
 

5197
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,830
um so even a you know trivial so
so-called operator like grading is not

5198
01:13:59,830 --> 01:13:59,840
so-called operator like grading is not
 

5199
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,870
so-called operator like grading is not
trivial and so

5200
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:00,880
trivial and so
 

5201
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,229
trivial and so
you know exploiting its properties is

5202
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:02,239
you know exploiting its properties is
 

5203
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,229
you know exploiting its properties is
still very very important um now we know

5204
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:04,239
still very very important um now we know
 

5205
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,590
still very very important um now we know
that just providing descent has got all

5206
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:05,600
that just providing descent has got all
 

5207
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,030
that just providing descent has got all
kinds of problems it gets stuck in many

5208
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:07,040
kinds of problems it gets stuck in many
 

5209
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,310
kinds of problems it gets stuck in many
ways and it hadn't have

5210
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:08,320
ways and it hadn't have
 

5211
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,910
ways and it hadn't have
you know good dimension dependence and

5212
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:09,920
you know good dimension dependence and
 

5213
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,750
you know good dimension dependence and
so on so um

5214
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:11,760
so on so um
 

5215
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,350
so on so um
my own line of work recently has been

5216
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,360
my own line of work recently has been
 

5217
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,350
my own line of work recently has been
about what kinds of stochasticity

5218
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:15,360
about what kinds of stochasticity
 

5219
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,709
about what kinds of stochasticity
how can we get dimension dependence how

5220
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:16,719
how can we get dimension dependence how
 

5221
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,550
how can we get dimension dependence how
can we do the theory of that

5222
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:18,560
can we do the theory of that
 

5223
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,149
can we do the theory of that
um and we've come up pretty favorable

5224
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:20,159
um and we've come up pretty favorable
 

5225
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,189
um and we've come up pretty favorable
results with certain kinds of

5226
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:21,199
results with certain kinds of
 

5227
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,550
results with certain kinds of
stochasticity

5228
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:22,560
stochasticity
 

5229
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,790
stochasticity
we have sufficient conditions generally

5230
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:24,800
we have sufficient conditions generally
 

5231
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,709
we have sufficient conditions generally
we know if you if you do this we will

5232
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:26,719
we know if you if you do this we will
 

5233
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,550
we know if you if you do this we will
give you a good guarantee

5234
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:28,560
give you a good guarantee
 

5235
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,990
give you a good guarantee
we don't have necessary conditions that

5236
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
we don't have necessary conditions that
 

5237
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,070
we don't have necessary conditions that
it must be done a certain way in general

5238
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:32,080
it must be done a certain way in general
 

5239
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,470
it must be done a certain way in general
so stochasticity how much randomness to

5240
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
so stochasticity how much randomness to
 

5241
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,310
so stochasticity how much randomness to
inject into the

5242
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,320
inject into the
 

5243
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,149
inject into the
into the walking along the gradient and

5244
01:14:38,149 --> 01:14:38,159
into the walking along the gradient and
 

5245
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:39,750
into the walking along the gradient and
what kind of randomness

5246
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,760
what kind of randomness
 

5247
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,990
what kind of randomness
why is randomness good in this process

5248
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,000
why is randomness good in this process
 

5249
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,229
why is randomness good in this process
why is stochasticity good

5250
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:44,239
why is stochasticity good
 

5251
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,790
why is stochasticity good
yeah so um i give you simple answers but

5252
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:46,800
yeah so um i give you simple answers but
 

5253
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,550
yeah so um i give you simple answers but
in some sense again it's kind of amazing

5254
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:48,560
in some sense again it's kind of amazing
 

5255
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,750
in some sense again it's kind of amazing
stochasticity just

5256
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:49,760
stochasticity just
 

5257
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,910
stochasticity just
uh um you know particular features of a

5258
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:53,920
uh um you know particular features of a
 

5259
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,510
uh um you know particular features of a
surface that could have hurt you if you

5260
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:55,520
surface that could have hurt you if you
 

5261
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,630
surface that could have hurt you if you
were doing one thing

5262
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
were doing one thing
 

5263
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,470
were doing one thing
um deterministically it won't hurt you

5264
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,480
um deterministically it won't hurt you
 

5265
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,830
um deterministically it won't hurt you
because uh

5266
01:14:59,830 --> 01:14:59,840
because uh
 

5267
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,070
because uh
you know by chance there's very little

5268
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,080
you know by chance there's very little
 

5269
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,270
you know by chance there's very little
chance that you would get hurt

5270
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
chance that you would get hurt
 

5271
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,630
chance that you would get hurt
and um you know so here stochasticity

5272
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:06,640
and um you know so here stochasticity
 

5273
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,149
and um you know so here stochasticity
um you know is just kind of

5274
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:10,159
um you know is just kind of
 

5275
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,990
um you know is just kind of
saves you from some of the particular

5276
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:12,000
saves you from some of the particular
 

5277
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,350
saves you from some of the particular
features of surfaces that

5278
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:13,360
features of surfaces that
 

5279
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,430
features of surfaces that
um you know and in fact if you think

5280
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:15,440
um you know and in fact if you think
 

5281
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,550
um you know and in fact if you think
about

5282
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
about
 

5283
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,390
about
you know surfaces that are discontinuous

5284
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
you know surfaces that are discontinuous
 

5285
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,590
you know surfaces that are discontinuous
in a first derivative like you know

5286
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:19,600
in a first derivative like you know
 

5287
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,189
in a first derivative like you know
absolute value function

5288
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:21,199
absolute value function
 

5289
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,350
absolute value function
um you will go down and hit that point

5290
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,360
um you will go down and hit that point
 

5291
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,790
um you will go down and hit that point
where there's non-differentiability

5292
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:24,800
where there's non-differentiability
 

5293
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,229
where there's non-differentiability
right and if you're running a

5294
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:26,239
right and if you're running a
 

5295
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:27,750
right and if you're running a

but
 

5343
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,110
but
i don't see that we're getting clearly

i don't see that we're getting clearly

i don't see that we're getting clearly
out of that uh

most
 

5355
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:18,709
most
but let me just say that uh you know

5356
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:18,719
but let me just say that uh you know
 

5357
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,470
but let me just say that uh you know

01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,590
pretty deep
um can you elaborate well install

01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:27,600
um can you elaborate well install
 

5367
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,669
um can you elaborate well install
acceleration is just that um

5368
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:29,679
acceleration is just that um
 

5369
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,750

i suppose that we are going to use

5370
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:31,760
i suppose that we are going to use
 

5371
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,189
i suppose that we are going to use
gradients to move around into space for

01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
gradients to move around into space for
 

5373
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,870
gradients to move around into space for
the reasons i've alluded to there there

5374
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:34,880
the reasons i've alluded to there there
 

5375
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:37,669
the reasons i've alluded to there there
are nice directions to move and suppose

5376
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
are nice directions to move and suppose
 

5377
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,189
are nice directions to move and suppose
that i tell you that you're only allowed

5378
01:16:39,189 --> 01:16:39,199
that i tell you that you're only allowed
 

5379
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:40,070
that i tell you that you're only allowed
to use gradients

5380
01:16:40,070 --> 01:16:40,080
to use gradients
 

5381
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,830
to use gradients
you're not going to be allowed to you'll

5382
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:41,840
you're not going to be allowed to you'll
 

5383
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,750
you're not going to be allowed to you'll
see this local person it can only sense

5384
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:43,760

5385
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:46,709
see this local person it can only sense
kind of a change in the surface

5386
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:46,719
kind of a change in the surface
 

5387
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,470
kind of a change in the surface
um but i'm going to give you kind of a

5388
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
um but i'm going to give you kind of a
 

5389
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,830
um but i'm going to give you kind of a
computer that's able to store all your

5390
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:49,840
computer that's able to store all your
 

5391
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,430
computer that's able to store all your
previous gradients and so you start to

5392
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,440
previous gradients and so you start to
 

5393
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:51,830
previous gradients and so you start to
learn

5394
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:51,840
learn
 

5395
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,709
learn
some something about the the surface um

5396
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:54,719
some something about the the surface um
 

5397
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,229
some something about the the surface um
and i'm going to restrict you to maybe

5398
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:56,239
and i'm going to restrict you to maybe
 

5399
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,350
and i'm going to restrict you to maybe
move in the direction of

5400
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:57,360
move in the direction of
 

5401
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,189
move in the direction of
like a linear span of all the gradients

5402
01:16:59,189 --> 01:16:59,199
like a linear span of all the gradients
 

5403
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:00,470
like a linear span of all the gradients
so you can't kind of just move in some

5404
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
so you can't kind of just move in some
 

5405
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,630
so you can't kind of just move in some
arbitrary direction right

5406
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:02,640
arbitrary direction right
 

5407
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:03,910
arbitrary direction right
so now we have a well-defined

5408
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:03,920
so now we have a well-defined
 

5409
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,750
so now we have a well-defined
mathematical complexity model there's a

5410
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:05,760
mathematical complexity model there's a
 

5411
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,510
mathematical complexity model there's a
certain classes of algorithms that can

5412
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:07,520
certain classes of algorithms that can
 

5413
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,030
certain classes of algorithms that can
do that and others that can't

5414
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,040
do that and others that can't
 

5415
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,630
do that and others that can't
and we can ask for certain kinds of

5416
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:10,640
and we can ask for certain kinds of
 

5417
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,390
and we can ask for certain kinds of
surfaces how fast can you get down to

5418
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
surfaces how fast can you get down to
 

5419
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,590
surfaces how fast can you get down to
the optimum

5420
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:13,600
the optimum
 

5421
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,669
the optimum
so there's an answers to these so for a

5422
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
so there's an answers to these so for a
 

5423
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:17,350
so there's an answers to these so for a
you know a smooth

5424
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:17,360
you know a smooth
 

5425
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,590
you know a smooth
convex function there's an answer which

5426
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:19,600
convex function there's an answer which
 

5427
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,229
convex function there's an answer which
is one over the number of steps squared

5428
01:17:22,229 --> 01:17:22,239
is one over the number of steps squared
 

5429
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:25,350
is one over the number of steps squared
you will be within a ball of that size

5430
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:25,360
you will be within a ball of that size
 

5431
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,630
you will be within a ball of that size
after after k steps um

5432
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:28,640
after after k steps um
 

5433
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,630
after after k steps um
gradient descent in particular has a

5434
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:30,640
gradient descent in particular has a
 

5435
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,030
gradient descent in particular has a
slower rate it's one over k

5436
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
slower rate it's one over k
 

5437
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,709
slower rate it's one over k
okay um so you could ask is gradient is

5438
01:17:36,709 --> 01:17:36,719
okay um so you could ask is gradient is
 

5439
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,070
okay um so you could ask is gradient is
said actually even though we know it's a

good algorithm is it the best algorithm

5442
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,080
good algorithm is it the best algorithm
 

5443
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,669
good algorithm is it the best algorithm
in the sense of the answer is no

5444
01:17:41,669 --> 01:17:41,679
in the sense of the answer is no
 

5445
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,110
in the sense of the answer is no
well well not clear yet because what

5446
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
well well not clear yet because what
 

5447
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,790
well well not clear yet because what
one of our case score is a lower bound

5448

one of our case score is a lower bound
 

5449
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:48,630
one of our case score is a lower bound
that's that's probably the best you can

01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,470
what gradient is one over k but is there
something better

5456
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:52,480
something better
 

5457
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:55,270
something better
and so i think as a surprise to most

5458
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:55,280
and so i think as a surprise to most
 

5459
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,830
and so i think as a surprise to most
though nest drove discovered a new

5460
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:56,840
though nest drove discovered a new
 

5461
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,149
though nest drove discovered a new
algorithm

5462
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:58,159
algorithm
 

5463
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,470
algorithm
that is got two pieces to it it uses two

5464
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:00,480
that is got two pieces to it it uses two
 

5465
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,669
that is got two pieces to it it uses two
gradients

5466
01:18:01,669 --> 01:18:01,679
gradients
 

5467
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,709
gradients
um and uh puts those together in a

5468
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:04,719
um and uh puts those together in a
 

5469
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,229
um and uh puts those together in a
certain kind of obscure way

5470
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:06,239
certain kind of obscure way
 

5471
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,310
certain kind of obscure way
and uh the thing doesn't even move

5472
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:08,320
and uh the thing doesn't even move
 

5473
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,750
and uh the thing doesn't even move
downhill all the time it sometimes goes

5474
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
downhill all the time it sometimes goes
 

5475
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,270
downhill all the time it sometimes goes
back uphill

5476
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:11,280
back uphill
 

5477
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,470
back uphill
and if you're a physicist that kind of

5478
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:12,480
and if you're a physicist that kind of
 

5479
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,590
and if you're a physicist that kind of
makes some sense you're building up some

5480
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:13,600
makes some sense you're building up some
 

5481
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:14,470
makes some sense you're building up some
momentum

5482
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
momentum
 

5483
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,390
momentum
and that is kind of the right intuition

5484
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:16,400
and that is kind of the right intuition
 

5485
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,390
and that is kind of the right intuition
but that that intuition is not enough to

5486
01:18:18,390 --> 01:18:18,400
but that that intuition is not enough to
 

5487
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,149
but that that intuition is not enough to
understand kind of how to do it and why

5488
01:18:20,149 --> 01:18:20,159
understand kind of how to do it and why
 

5489
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,430
understand kind of how to do it and why
it works

5490
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:21,440
it works
 

5491
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:23,990
it works
um but it does it achieves one over k

5492
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,000
um but it does it achieves one over k
 

5493
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,550
um but it does it achieves one over k
squared

5494
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:24,560
squared
 

5495
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,790
squared
and uh it has a mathematical structure

5496
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:26,800
and uh it has a mathematical structure
 

5497
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,830
and uh it has a mathematical structure
and it's still kind of

5498
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:27,840
and it's still kind of
 

5499
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,270
and it's still kind of
to this day a lot of us are writing

5500
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:29,280
to this day a lot of us are writing
 

5501
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,709
to this day a lot of us are writing
papers and trying to explore that and

5502
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:30,719
papers and trying to explore that and
 

5503
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:31,990
papers and trying to explore that and
understand it

5504
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,000
understand it
 

5505
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,390
understand it
um so there are lots of cool ideas in

5506
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:34,400
um so there are lots of cool ideas in
 

5507
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,830
um so there are lots of cool ideas in
optimization but just kind of using

5508
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:35,840
optimization but just kind of using
 

5509
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,430
optimization but just kind of using
gradients i think is number one that

5510
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,440
gradients i think is number one that
 

5511
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,709
gradients i think is number one that
goes back you know

5512
01:18:38,709 --> 01:18:38,719
goes back you know
 

5513
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:41,430
goes back you know
150 years um and then nest drive i think

5514
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:41,440
150 years um and then nest drive i think
 

5515
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,030
150 years um and then nest drive i think
has made a major contribution with this

5516
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,040
has made a major contribution with this
 

5517
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,550
has made a major contribution with this
idea so like you said gradients

5518
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:44,560
idea so like you said gradients
 

5519
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,430
idea so like you said gradients
themselves are

5520
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:45,440
themselves are
 

5521
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,830
themselves are
in some sense mysterious yeah they're

5522
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:47,840
in some sense mysterious yeah they're
 

5523
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,709
in some sense mysterious yeah they're
not uh

5524
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:48,719
not uh
 

5525
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,470
not uh
they're not as trivial as they're not as

5526
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,480
they're not as trivial as they're not as
 

5527
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,630
they're not as trivial as they're not as
trivial coordinate descent

5528
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:52,640
trivial coordinate descent
 

5529
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,390
trivial coordinate descent
is more of a trivial one you just pick

5530
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:54,400
is more of a trivial one you just pick
 

5531
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,590
is more of a trivial one you just pick
one of the coordinates that's how we

5532
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:55,600
one of the coordinates that's how we
 

5533
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:55,910
one of the coordinates that's how we
think

5534
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:55,920
think
 

5535
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,350
think
that's our human mind that's our human

5536
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:57,360
that's our human mind that's our human
 

5537
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,270
that's our human mind that's our human
minds think and gradients are not

5538
01:18:59,270 --> 01:18:59,280
minds think and gradients are not
 

5539
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,270
minds think and gradients are not
that easy for our human mind to grapple

5540
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,280
that easy for our human mind to grapple
 

5541
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,110
that easy for our human mind to grapple
with

5542
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
with
 

5543
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,830
with
an absurd question but uh what is

5544
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:06,840
an absurd question but uh what is
 

5545
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,390
an absurd question but uh what is
statistics

5546
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
statistics
 

5547
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,750
statistics
so the here it's a little bit it's

5548
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:09,760
so the here it's a little bit it's
 

5549
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,430
so the here it's a little bit it's
somewhere between math and science and

5550
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:11,440
somewhere between math and science and
 

5551
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,030
somewhere between math and science and
technology it's somewhere in that convex

5552
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:13,040
technology it's somewhere in that convex
 

5553
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,550
technology it's somewhere in that convex
hole so it's a

5554
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
hole so it's a
 

5555
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,070
hole so it's a
set of principles that allow you to make

5556
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,080
set of principles that allow you to make
 

5557
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,750
set of principles that allow you to make
inferences that have got some reason to

5558
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:17,760
inferences that have got some reason to
 

5559
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,790
inferences that have got some reason to
be believed

5560
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:18,800
be believed
 

5561
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,470
be believed
and also principles allow you make

5562
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:20,480
and also principles allow you make
 

5563
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,229
and also principles allow you make
decisions where you can

5564
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:22,239
decisions where you can
 

5565
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,430
decisions where you can
have some reason to believe you're not

5566
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:23,440
have some reason to believe you're not
 

5567
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,510
have some reason to believe you're not
going to make errors so all of that

5568
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:25,520
going to make errors so all of that
 

5569
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,630
going to make errors so all of that
requires some assumptions about what do

5570
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:26,640
requires some assumptions about what do
 

5571
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,470
requires some assumptions about what do
you mean by an error what do you mean by

5572
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:28,480
you mean by an error what do you mean by
 

5573
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,830
you mean by an error what do you mean by
you know the probabilities and um but

5574
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:31,840
you know the probabilities and um but
 

5575
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,110
you know the probabilities and um but
you know you start after you start

5576
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120
you know you start after you start
 

5577
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,390
you know you start after you start
making some of those assumptions you're

5578
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:34,400
making some of those assumptions you're
 

5579
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,510
making some of those assumptions you're
led to

5580
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:35,520
led to
 

5581
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,550
led to
uh conclusions that yes i can guarantee

5582
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
uh conclusions that yes i can guarantee
 

5583
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:39,270
uh conclusions that yes i can guarantee
that you know

5584
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:39,280
that you know
 

5585
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,790
that you know
you know if you do this in this way your

5586
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:40,800
you know if you do this in this way your
 

5587
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:41,910
you know if you do this in this way your
probability of making error will be

5588
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:41,920
probability of making error will be
 

5589
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,350
probability of making error will be
small

5590
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
small
 

5591
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,510
small
your probability of continuing to not

5592
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:45,520
your probability of continuing to not
 

5593
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,590
your probability of continuing to not
make errors over time will be small

5594
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:47,600
make errors over time will be small
 

5595
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,750
make errors over time will be small
and probability you found something

5596
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:49,760
and probability you found something
 

5597
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,870
and probability you found something
that's real will be

01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:50,880
that's real will be
 

5599
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,510
that's real will be
small uh will be high so decision making

5600
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:53,520
small uh will be high so decision making
 

5601
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,470
small uh will be high so decision making
is a big part

5602
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:54,480
is a big part
 

5603
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,790
is a big part
of the big part yeah so uh the original

5604
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:56,800
of the big part yeah so uh the original
 

5605
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,950
of the big part yeah so uh the original
so statistics uh you know short history

5606
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:58,960
so statistics uh you know short history
 

5607
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,750
so statistics uh you know short history
was that you know it's kind of goes back

5608
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:01,760
was that you know it's kind of goes back
 

5609
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,350
was that you know it's kind of goes back
as a formal discipline you know 250

5610
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
as a formal discipline you know 250
 

5611
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,590
as a formal discipline you know 250
years or so it was called inverse

5612
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:05,600
years or so it was called inverse
 

5613
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,229
years or so it was called inverse
probability because around that era

5614
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:08,239
probability because around that era
 

5615
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,669
probability because around that era
probability was developed sort of

5616
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:09,679
probability was developed sort of
 

5617
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,229
probability was developed sort of
especially to explain gambling

5618
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:12,239
especially to explain gambling
 

5619
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:15,350
especially to explain gambling
situations of course and um interesting

5620
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:15,360
situations of course and um interesting
 

5621
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,430
situations of course and um interesting
so you would say well given the state of

5622
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,440
so you would say well given the state of
 

5623
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,470
so you would say well given the state of
nature is this there's a certain

5624
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
nature is this there's a certain
 

5625
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,510
nature is this there's a certain
roulette board that has a certain

5629
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,149
mechanism in it
uh what kind of outcomes do i expect to

5630
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:22,159
uh what kind of outcomes do i expect to
 

5631
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:23,910
uh what kind of outcomes do i expect to
see uh and

5632
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:23,920
see uh and
 

5633
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,070
see uh and
um especially if i do things long long

5634
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,080
um especially if i do things long long
 

5635
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,510
um especially if i do things long long
amounts of time what outcomes i see and

5636
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,520
amounts of time what outcomes i see and
 

5637
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:28,790

the physicists start to pay attention to

5638
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:28,800
the physicists start to pay attention to
 

5639
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,590
the physicists start to pay attention to
this

5640
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:29,600
this
 

5641
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,229
this
um and then people say well given let's

5642
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:32,239
um and then people say well given let's
 

5643
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,149
um and then people say well given let's
turn the problem around what if i

5644
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:34,159
turn the problem around what if i
 

5645
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:35,750
turn the problem around what if i
saw certain outcomes could i infer what

5646
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:35,760
saw certain outcomes could i infer what
 

5647
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,189
saw certain outcomes could i infer what
the underlying mechanism was

5648
01:20:37,189 --> 01:20:37,199
the underlying mechanism was
 

5649
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,790
the underlying mechanism was
that's an inverse problem and in fact

5650
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:38,800
that's an inverse problem and in fact
 

5651
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,629
that's an inverse problem and in fact
for quite a while statistics was called

5652
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639
for quite a while statistics was called
 

5653
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:41,750
for quite a while statistics was called
inverse probability

5654
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:41,760

he went and gathered data

5668
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:55,840
he went and gathered data
 

5669
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,830
he went and gathered data
and he analyzed that data to determine

5670
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:58,840
and he analyzed that data to determine
 

5671
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,629

um the the word state is in there in

5678
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:07,360
um the the word state is in there in
 

5679
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,470
um the the word state is in there in
french that's eta

5680
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:08,480
french that's eta
 

5681
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,110
french that's eta
but you know it's the study of data for

5682
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:11,120
but you know it's the study of data for
 

5683
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,350
but you know it's the study of data for
the state

5684
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
the state
 

5685
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,350
the state
so anyway that caught on and um it's

5686
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:15,360
so anyway that caught on and um it's
 

5687
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,229
so anyway that caught on and um it's
been called statistics ever since but um

5688
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:18,239
been called statistics ever since but um
 

5689
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,470
been called statistics ever since but um
uh but by the time it got formalized it

5690
01:21:20,470 --> 01:21:20,480
uh but by the time it got formalized it
 

5691
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:21,830
uh but by the time it got formalized it
was sort of in the 30s

5692
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:21,840
was sort of in the 30s
 

5693
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,470
was sort of in the 30s
um and uh around that time there was

5694
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:24,480
um and uh around that time there was
 

5695
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,750
um and uh around that time there was
game theory and decision theory

5696
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:25,760
game theory and decision theory
 

5697
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,390
game theory and decision theory
developed

5698
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:26,400
developed
 

5699
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,189
developed
nearby people in that era didn't think

5700
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:29,199
nearby people in that era didn't think
 

5701
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,790
nearby people in that era didn't think
of themselves as either computer science

5702
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:30,800
of themselves as either computer science
 

5703
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,629
of themselves as either computer science
or statistics or controlled or econ they

5704
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:32,639
or statistics or controlled or econ they
 

5705
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:33,110
or statistics or controlled or econ they
were all

5706
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:33,120
were all
 

5707
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,950
were all
they were all the above and so you know

5708
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:34,960
they were all the above and so you know
 

5709
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,470
they were all the above and so you know
von neumann is developing game theory

5710
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:36,480
von neumann is developing game theory
 

5711
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,270
von neumann is developing game theory
but also

5712
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:37,280
but also
 

5713
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,510
but also
thinking of that as decision theory wall

5714
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
thinking of that as decision theory wall
 

5715
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,950
thinking of that as decision theory wall
is an econometrician

5716
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
is an econometrician
 

5717
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,870
is an econometrician
developing decision theory and then you

5718
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:42,880
developing decision theory and then you
 

5719
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,870
developing decision theory and then you
know turning that into statistics

5720
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:44,880
know turning that into statistics
 

5721
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,189
know turning that into statistics
and so it's all about here's a here's

5722
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:47,199
and so it's all about here's a here's
 

5723
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,030
and so it's all about here's a here's
not just data and you analyze it here's

5724
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:49,040
not just data and you analyze it here's
 

5725
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,550
not just data and you analyze it here's
a loss function here's what you care

5726
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:50,560
a loss function here's what you care
 

5727
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,590
a loss function here's what you care
about here's the question you're trying

01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:55,120
here is a probability model and here's
 

5733
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,229
here is a probability model and here's
the risk you will face

5734
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:56,239
the risk you will face
 

5735
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:59,590
the risk you will face
if you make certain decisions um and

5736
01:21:59,590 --> 01:21:59,600
if you make certain decisions um and
 

5737
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,310
if you make certain decisions um and
to this day in most advanced statistical

5738
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:02,320
to this day in most advanced statistical
 

5739
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,990
to this day in most advanced statistical
curricula you teach decision theory is

5740
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:04,000
curricula you teach decision theory is
 

5741
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,189
curricula you teach decision theory is
the starting point

5742
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:05,199
the starting point
 

5743
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:06,870
the starting point
and then it branches out into the two

5744
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:06,880
and then it branches out into the two
 

5745
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,870
and then it branches out into the two
branches of bazin or frequentist but um

5746
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:08,880
branches of bazin or frequentist but um
 

5747
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,830
branches of bazin or frequentist but um
that's it's all about decisions in

5748
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:11,840
that's it's all about decisions in
 

5749
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,870
that's it's all about decisions in

01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:25,199
uh yeah good question um
 

5759
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:27,110
uh yeah good question um
i mean there's a bunch of surprising

5760
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:27,120
i mean there's a bunch of surprising
 

5761
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,550
i mean there's a bunch of surprising
ones there's something that's way too

01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:46,239
paper on james stein estimation which
 

5783
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,790
paper on james stein estimation which
helps to its views of paradox it kind of

5784
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:48,800
helps to its views of paradox it kind of

defeats the mind's attempts to

5786
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:50,000
defeats the mind's attempts to
 

5787
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,030
defeats the mind's attempts to
understand it but

5788
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:51,040
understand it but
 

5789
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,030
understand it but
you can and steve has a nice perspective

5790
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
you can and steve has a nice perspective
 

5791
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,149
you can and steve has a nice perspective
on that

5792
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
on that
 

5793
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:57,750
on that
um there uh so one of the troubles with

5794
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:57,760
um there uh so one of the troubles with
 

5795
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,510
um there uh so one of the troubles with
statistics is that it's like in physics

5796
01:22:59,510 --> 01:22:59,520
statistics is that it's like in physics
 

5797
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,189
statistics is that it's like in physics
that are in quantum physics you have

5798
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
that are in quantum physics you have
 

5799
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:02,950
that are in quantum physics you have
multiple interpretations there's a wave

5800
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:02,960
multiple interpretations there's a wave
 

5801
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,510
multiple interpretations there's a wave
and particle duality in physics and

5802
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520
and particle duality in physics and
 

5803
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,510
and particle duality in physics and
you get used to that over time but it

5804
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
you get used to that over time but it
 

5805
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,030
you get used to that over time but it
still kind of haunts you that you don't

5806
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
still kind of haunts you that you don't
 

5807
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:09,750
still kind of haunts you that you don't
really

5808
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:09,760
really
 

5809
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,950
really
you know quite understand the

5810
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:10,960
you know quite understand the
 

5811
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,550
you know quite understand the
relationship the electrons away when

5812
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:12,560
relationship the electrons away when
 

5813
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,870
relationship the electrons away when
electrons a particle well

5814
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
electrons a particle well
 

5815
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,550
electrons a particle well
um well the same thing happens here

5816
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:16,560
um well the same thing happens here
 

5817
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,310
um well the same thing happens here
there's bayesian ways of thinking and

5818
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:18,320
there's bayesian ways of thinking and
 

5819
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,310
there's bayesian ways of thinking and
frequentist and they are different

5820
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
frequentist and they are different
 

5821
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,310
frequentist and they are different
they they all they sometimes become sort

5822
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320
they they all they sometimes become sort
 

5823
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,669
they they all they sometimes become sort
of the same in practice

5824
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:23,679
of the same in practice
 

5825
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:24,950
of the same in practice
but they are physically different and

5826
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:24,960
but they are physically different and
 

5827
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,030
but they are physically different and
then in some practice they are not the

5828
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:27,040
then in some practice they are not the
 

5829
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,229
then in some practice they are not the
same at all they give you rather

5830
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:28,239
same at all they give you rather
 

5831
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:29,750
same at all they give you rather
different answers

5832
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
different answers
 

5833
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,590
different answers
um and so it is very much like wave and

5834
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:31,600
um and so it is very much like wave and
 

5835
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,590
um and so it is very much like wave and
particle duality and that is something

5836
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
particle duality and that is something
 

5837
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,030
particle duality and that is something
you have to kind of get used to in the

5838
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:35,040
you have to kind of get used to in the
 

5839
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,590
you have to kind of get used to in the
field

5840
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:35,600
field
 

5841
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,510
field
can you define beijing and frequencies

5842
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:37,520
can you define beijing and frequencies
 

5843
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,870
can you define beijing and frequencies
yeah in decision theory you can make

5844
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:38,880
yeah in decision theory you can make
 

5845
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,709
yeah in decision theory you can make
i have a like i have a video that people

5846
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:40,719
i have a like i have a video that people
 

5847
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,310
i have a like i have a video that people
could see it's called are you a bayesian

5848
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:42,320
could see it's called are you a bayesian
 

5849
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,750
could see it's called are you a bayesian
or a frequentist and kind of help

5850
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:43,760
or a frequentist and kind of help
 

5851
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,149
or a frequentist and kind of help
try to to make it really clear it comes

5852
01:23:46,149 --> 01:23:46,159
try to to make it really clear it comes
 

5853
01:23:46,159 --> 01:23:48,149
try to to make it really clear it comes
from decision theory so you know

5854
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:48,159
from decision theory so you know
 

5855
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:49,590
from decision theory so you know
decision theory

5856
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:49,600
decision theory
 

5857
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,189
decision theory
uh you're talking about loss functions

5858
01:23:51,189 --> 01:23:51,199
uh you're talking about loss functions
 

5859
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:52,790
uh you're talking about loss functions
which are a function of

5860
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:52,800
which are a function of
 

5861
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,270
which are a function of
data x and parameter theta it's a

5862
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:55,280
data x and parameter theta it's a
 

5863
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,110
data x and parameter theta it's a
function of two arguments

5864
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,120
function of two arguments
 

5865
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,430
function of two arguments
okay neither one of those arguments is

5866
01:23:59,430 --> 01:23:59,440
okay neither one of those arguments is
 

5867
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,430
okay neither one of those arguments is
known you don't know the data a priori

5868
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:01,440
known you don't know the data a priori
 

5869
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,990
known you don't know the data a priori
it's random and the parameter is unknown

5870
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,000
it's random and the parameter is unknown
 

5871
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,030
it's random and the parameter is unknown
all right so you have this function of

5872
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,040
all right so you have this function of
 

5873
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,310
all right so you have this function of
two things you don't know and you're

5874
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:06,320
two things you don't know and you're
 

5875
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,750
two things you don't know and you're
trying to say i want that function to be

5876
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:07,760
trying to say i want that function to be
 

5877
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:09,590
trying to say i want that function to be
small i want small loss

5878
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:09,600
small i want small loss
 

5879
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,430
small i want small loss
right well um what are you gonna do so

5880
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:13,440
right well um what are you gonna do so
 

5881
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,030
right well um what are you gonna do so
you sort of say well i'm gonna average

5882
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:15,040
you sort of say well i'm gonna average
 

5883
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:15,990
you sort of say well i'm gonna average
over these quantities

5884
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
over these quantities
 

5885
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,990
over these quantities
or maximize over them or something so

5886
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:18,000
or maximize over them or something so
 

5887
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,590
or maximize over them or something so
that you know

5888
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:19,600
that you know
 

5889
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,350
that you know
i turn that uncertainty into something

5890
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:21,360
i turn that uncertainty into something
 

5891
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,870
i turn that uncertainty into something
certain

5892
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,880
certain
 

5893
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,550
certain
so you could look at the first argument

5894
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:24,560
so you could look at the first argument
 

5895
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,750
so you could look at the first argument
an average over it or you could look at

5896
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:25,760
an average over it or you could look at
 

5897
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:26,870
an average over it or you could look at
the second argument average over it

5898
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:26,880
the second argument average over it
 

5899
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,470
the second argument average over it
that's bayesian frequencies so

5900
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:28,480
that's bayesian frequencies so
 

5901
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,910
that's bayesian frequencies so
the frequencies says i'm going to look

5902
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:29,920
the frequencies says i'm going to look
 

5903
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,070
the frequencies says i'm going to look
at the x the data

5904
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:32,080
at the x the data
 

5905
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,669
at the x the data
and i'm going to take that as random and

5906
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:33,679
and i'm going to take that as random and
 

5907
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:34,550
and i'm going to take that as random and
i'm going to average over the

5908
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:34,560
i'm going to average over the
 

5909
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,470
i'm going to average over the
distribution so i take the expectation

5910
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:36,480
distribution so i take the expectation
 

5911
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:36,950
distribution so i take the expectation
loss

5912
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:36,960
loss
 

5913
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,149
loss
under x theta is held fixed

5914
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:40,159
under x theta is held fixed
 

5915
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,149
under x theta is held fixed
all right that's called the risk and so

5916
01:24:42,149 --> 01:24:42,159
all right that's called the risk and so
 

5917
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:43,910
all right that's called the risk and so
it's looking at other all the data sets

5918
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:43,920
it's looking at other all the data sets
 

5919
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,669
it's looking at other all the data sets
you could get

5920
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:45,679
you could get
 

5921
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,189
you could get
all right and say how well will a

5922
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:47,199
all right and say how well will a
 

5923
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,629
all right and say how well will a
certain procedure do under all those

5924
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
certain procedure do under all those
 

5925
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,830
certain procedure do under all those
data sets

5926
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:49,840
data sets
 

5927
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,229
data sets
that's called a frequency guarantee all

5928
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:52,239
that's called a frequency guarantee all
 

5929
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:53,910
that's called a frequency guarantee all
right so i think it is very appropriate

5930
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
right so i think it is very appropriate
 

5931
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,110
right so i think it is very appropriate
when like you're building a piece of

5932
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,120
when like you're building a piece of
 

5933
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:56,629
when like you're building a piece of
software and you're shipping it out

5934
01:24:56,629 --> 01:24:56,639
software and you're shipping it out
 

5935
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,070
software and you're shipping it out
there and people are using all kinds of

01:24:58,070 --> 01:24:58,080
there and people are using all kinds of
 

5937
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,030
there and people are using all kinds of
data sets

5938
01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,040
data sets
 

5939
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,629
data sets
you want to have a stamp a guarantee on

5940
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:00,639
you want to have a stamp a guarantee on
 

5941
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:02,149
you want to have a stamp a guarantee on
it that as people run it on many many

5942
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:02,159
it that as people run it on many many
 

5943
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:03,270
it that as people run it on many many
data sets that you never even thought

5944
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:03,280
data sets that you never even thought
 

5945
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,229
data sets that you never even thought
about that

5946
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:04,239
about that
 

5947
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:05,750
about that
95 of the time it will do the right

5948
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:05,760
95 of the time it will do the right
 

5949
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:09,590
95 of the time it will do the right
thing um perfectly reasonable

5950
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:09,600
thing um perfectly reasonable
 

5951
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,590
thing um perfectly reasonable
the bayesian perspective says well no

5952
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:11,600
the bayesian perspective says well no
 

5953
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,950
the bayesian perspective says well no
i'm going to look at the other argument

5954
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:12,960
i'm going to look at the other argument
 

5955
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,550
i'm going to look at the other argument
of the loss function the theta part

5956
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
of the loss function the theta part
 

5957
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,550
of the loss function the theta part
okay that's unknown and i'm uncertain

5958
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:16,560
okay that's unknown and i'm uncertain
 

5959
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:18,390
okay that's unknown and i'm uncertain
about it so i could have

5960
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:18,400
about it so i could have
 

5961
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,070
about it so i could have
my own personal probability for what it

5962
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:20,080
my own personal probability for what it
 

5963
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,669
my own personal probability for what it
is you know how many tall people are

5964
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
is you know how many tall people are
 

5965
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:22,870
is you know how many tall people are
there out there i'm trying to infer the

5966
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:22,880
there out there i'm trying to infer the
 

5967
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,149
there out there i'm trying to infer the
average height of the population well i

5968
01:25:24,149 --> 01:25:24,159
average height of the population well i
 

5969
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:27,270
average height of the population well i
have an idea roughly what the height is

5970
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:27,280
have an idea roughly what the height is
 

5971
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:30,629
have an idea roughly what the height is
so i'm going to average over the um

5972
01:25:30,629 --> 01:25:30,639
so i'm going to average over the um
 

5973
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:33,990
so i'm going to average over the um
the theta so now that loss function

5974
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:34,000
the theta so now that loss function
 

5975
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,030
the theta so now that loss function
has only now again one argument's gone

5976
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:37,040
has only now again one argument's gone
 

5977
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,110
has only now again one argument's gone
now it's a function of x and that's what

5978
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:39,120
now it's a function of x and that's what
 

5979
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,550
now it's a function of x and that's what
a bayesian does is they say well

5980
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
a bayesian does is they say well
 

5981
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,070
a bayesian does is they say well
let's just focus on the particular x we

5982
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:42,080
let's just focus on the particular x we
 

5983
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,990
let's just focus on the particular x we
got the data set we got we condition on

5984
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,000
got the data set we got we condition on
 

5985
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:44,790
got the data set we got we condition on
that

5986
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:44,800
that
 

5987
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,790
that
conditional on the x i say something

5988
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:46,800
conditional on the x i say something
 

5989
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,910
conditional on the x i say something
about my loss

5990
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:47,920
about my loss
 

5991
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,310
about my loss
that's a bayesian approach to things and

5992
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:50,320
that's a bayesian approach to things and
 

5993
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,350
that's a bayesian approach to things and
the bayesian

5994
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
the bayesian
 

5995
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,189
the bayesian
will argue that it's not relevant to

5996
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:53,199
will argue that it's not relevant to
 

5997
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,470
will argue that it's not relevant to
look at all the other data sets you

5998
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,480
look at all the other data sets you
 

5999
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,669
look at all the other data sets you
could have gotten

6000
01:25:55,669 --> 01:25:55,679
could have gotten
 

6001
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:57,590
could have gotten
and average over them the frequentest

6002
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:57,600
and average over them the frequentest
 

6003
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,350
and average over them the frequentest
approach it's really

6004
01:25:59,350 --> 01:25:59,360
approach it's really
 

6005
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:02,070
approach it's really
only the data set you got all right and

6006
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:02,080
only the data set you got all right and
 

6007
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,350
only the data set you got all right and
i do agree with that

6008
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:03,360
i do agree with that
 

6009
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,790
i do agree with that
especially in situations where you're

6010
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:04,800
especially in situations where you're
 

6011
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,310
especially in situations where you're
working with a scientist you can learn a

6012
01:26:06,310 --> 01:26:06,320
working with a scientist you can learn a
 

6013
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,430
working with a scientist you can learn a
lot about the domain

6014
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:07,440
lot about the domain
 

6015
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,790
lot about the domain
and you really only focus on certain

6016
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:08,800
and you really only focus on certain
 

6017
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,390
and you really only focus on certain
kinds of data and you've gathered your

6018
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:10,400
kinds of data and you've gathered your
 

6019
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,189
kinds of data and you've gathered your
data and you make inferences

6020
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:13,199
data and you make inferences
 

6021
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:14,870
data and you make inferences
i don't agree with it though that it you

6022
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:14,880
i don't agree with it though that it you
 

6023
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,629
i don't agree with it though that it you
know in the sense that there are

6024
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:16,639
know in the sense that there are
 

6025
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:18,149
know in the sense that there are
needs for frequency guarantees you're

6026
01:26:18,149 --> 01:26:18,159
needs for frequency guarantees you're
 

6027
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:19,669
needs for frequency guarantees you're
writing software people are using it out

6028
01:26:19,669 --> 01:26:19,679
writing software people are using it out
 

6029
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,110
writing software people are using it out
there you want to say something so these

6030
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,120
there you want to say something so these
 

6031
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,629
there you want to say something so these
two things have to go out to fight each

6032
01:26:22,629 --> 01:26:22,639
two things have to go out to fight each
 

6033
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,510
two things have to go out to fight each
other a little bit but they have to

6034
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:23,520
other a little bit but they have to
 

6035
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,629
other a little bit but they have to
blend

6036
01:26:24,629 --> 01:26:24,639
blend
 

6037
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:26,310
blend
so long story short there's a set of

6038
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,320
so long story short there's a set of
 

6039
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,430
so long story short there's a set of
ideas that are right in the middle

6040
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:27,440
ideas that are right in the middle
 

6041
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,510
ideas that are right in the middle
they're called empirical bays

6042
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:29,520
they're called empirical bays
 

6043
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,510
they're called empirical bays
and empirical base sort of starts with

6044
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,520
and empirical base sort of starts with
 

6045
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,510
and empirical base sort of starts with
the bayesian framework

6046
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:33,520
the bayesian framework
 

6047
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,910
the bayesian framework
it's it's kind of arguably

6048
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:35,920
it's it's kind of arguably
 

6049
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,669
it's it's kind of arguably
philosophically more

6050
01:26:37,669 --> 01:26:37,679
philosophically more
 

6051
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,629
philosophically more
you know reasonable and kosher write

6052
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:40,639
you know reasonable and kosher write
 

6053
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:42,310
you know reasonable and kosher write
down a bunch of the math that kind of

6054
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:42,320
down a bunch of the math that kind of
 

6055
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,270
down a bunch of the math that kind of
flows from that

6056
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:43,280
flows from that
 

6057
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:44,310
flows from that
and then realize there's a bunch of

6058
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:44,320
and then realize there's a bunch of
 

6059
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:45,990
and then realize there's a bunch of
things you don't know because it's the

6060
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:46,000
things you don't know because it's the
 

6061
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,189
things you don't know because it's the
real world then you don't

6062
01:26:47,189 --> 01:26:47,199
real world then you don't
 

6063
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:48,470
real world then you don't
know everything so you're uncertain

6064
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:48,480
know everything so you're uncertain
 

6065
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,709
know everything so you're uncertain
about certain quantities at that point

6066
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:50,719
about certain quantities at that point
 

6067
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:52,470
about certain quantities at that point
ask is there a reasonable way to plug in

6068
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:52,480
ask is there a reasonable way to plug in
 

6069
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,629
ask is there a reasonable way to plug in
an estimate for those things

6070
01:26:54,629 --> 01:26:54,639
an estimate for those things
 

6071
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:57,270
an estimate for those things
okay and in some cases there's quite a

6072
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
okay and in some cases there's quite a
 

6073
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,950
okay and in some cases there's quite a
reasonable thing to do

6074
01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:58,960
reasonable thing to do
 

6075
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,709
reasonable thing to do
to plug in there's a natural thing you

6076
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:00,719
to plug in there's a natural thing you
 

6077
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:01,990
to plug in there's a natural thing you
can observe in the world that you can

6078
01:27:01,990 --> 01:27:02,000
can observe in the world that you can
 

6079
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,030
can observe in the world that you can
plug in

6080
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:03,040
plug in
 

6081
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:03,990
plug in
and then do a little bit more

6082
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:04,000
and then do a little bit more
 

6083
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,430
and then do a little bit more
mathematics and assure yourself it's

6084
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:05,440
mathematics and assure yourself it's
 

6085
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,149
mathematics and assure yourself it's
really good

6086
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:06,159
really good
 

6087
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,629
really good
so my math are based on human expertise

01:27:08,629 --> 01:27:08,639
so my math are based on human expertise

6093
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:12,070
what are good they're both going in the
bayesian framework allows you to put a

6094
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,080
bayesian framework allows you to put a
 

6095
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:15,270
bayesian framework allows you to put a
lot of human expertise in

6096
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:15,280
lot of human expertise in
 

6097
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,110
lot of human expertise in
but the math kind of guides you along

6098
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:17,120
but the math kind of guides you along
 

6099
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:18,629
but the math kind of guides you along
that path and then kind of reassures you

6100
01:27:18,629 --> 01:27:18,639
that path and then kind of reassures you
 

6101
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:19,910
that path and then kind of reassures you
at the end you could put that stamp of

6102
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:19,920
at the end you could put that stamp of
 

6103
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,430
at the end you could put that stamp of
approval under certain assumptions

6104
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:21,440
approval under certain assumptions
 

6105
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,189
approval under certain assumptions
this thing will work so perhaps you

6106
01:27:23,189 --> 01:27:23,199
this thing will work so perhaps you
 

6107
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:24,390
this thing will work so perhaps you
asked question what's my favorite you

6108
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:24,400
asked question what's my favorite you
 

6109
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,669
asked question what's my favorite you
know or what's the most surprising nice

6110
01:27:25,669 --> 01:27:25,679
know or what's the most surprising nice
 

6111
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:26,310
know or what's the most surprising nice
idea so

6112
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,320
idea so
 

6113
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,830
idea so
one that is more accessible is something

6114
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:27,840
one that is more accessible is something
 

6115
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,510
one that is more accessible is something
called false discovery rate

6116
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,520
called false discovery rate
 

6117
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,870
called false discovery rate
which is um you know you're making not

6118
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:32,880
which is um you know you're making not
 

6119
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,870
which is um you know you're making not
just one hypothesis test or making one

6120
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:34,880
just one hypothesis test or making one
 

6121
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,070
just one hypothesis test or making one
decision you're making a whole bag of

6122
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:36,080
decision you're making a whole bag of
 

6123
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:36,950
decision you're making a whole bag of
them

6124
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:36,960
them
 

6125
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,590
them
and in that bag of decisions you look at

6126
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:39,600
and in that bag of decisions you look at
 

6127
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,270
and in that bag of decisions you look at
the ones where you made a discovery you

6128
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:41,280
the ones where you made a discovery you
 

6129
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,790
the ones where you made a discovery you
announced that something interesting it

6130
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:42,800
announced that something interesting it
 

6131
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,590
announced that something interesting it
happened

6132
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:43,600
happened
 

6133
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,110
happened
all right that's gonna be some subset of

6134
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:45,120
all right that's gonna be some subset of
 

6135
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,950
all right that's gonna be some subset of
your big bag

6136
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:46,960
your big bag
 

6137
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,629
your big bag
in the ones you made a discovery which

6138
01:27:48,629 --> 01:27:48,639
in the ones you made a discovery which
 

6139
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,629
in the ones you made a discovery which
subset of those are bad

6140
01:27:50,629 --> 01:27:50,639
subset of those are bad
 

6141
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:53,270
subset of those are bad
there are false false discoveries you

6142
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:53,280
there are false false discoveries you
 

6143
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,550
there are false false discoveries you
like the fraction of your false

6144
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:54,560
like the fraction of your false
 

6145
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,229
like the fraction of your false
discoveries among your discoveries to be

6146
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:56,239
discoveries among your discoveries to be
 

6147
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:57,350
discoveries among your discoveries to be
small

6148
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:57,360
small
 

6149
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,030
small
that's a different criterion than

6150
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,040
that's a different criterion than
 

6151
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,350
that's a different criterion than
accuracy or precision or recall or

6152
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:01,360
accuracy or precision or recall or
 

6153
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,270
accuracy or precision or recall or
sensitivity and specificity it's it's a

6154
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:03,280
sensitivity and specificity it's it's a
 

6155
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,629
sensitivity and specificity it's it's a
different quantity

6156
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:04,639
different quantity
 

6157
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:06,629
different quantity
those latter ones are almost all of them

6158
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
those latter ones are almost all of them
 

6159
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,310
those latter ones are almost all of them
um

6160
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:08,320
um
 

6161
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,070
um
have more of a frequencies flavor they

6162
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:10,080
have more of a frequencies flavor they
 

6163
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,910
have more of a frequencies flavor they
say given the truth

6164
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:11,920
say given the truth
 

6165
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:13,590
say given the truth
is that the null hypothesis is true

6166
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:13,600
is that the null hypothesis is true
 

6167
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,510
is that the null hypothesis is true
here's what accuracy i would get

6168
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:15,520
here's what accuracy i would get
 

6169
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,030
here's what accuracy i would get
or given that the alternative is true

6170
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:17,040
or given that the alternative is true
 

6171
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,790
or given that the alternative is true
here's what i would get so it's kind of

6172
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800
here's what i would get so it's kind of
 

6173
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,870
here's what i would get so it's kind of
going forward from the state of nature

6174
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:20,880
going forward from the state of nature
 

6175
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,270
going forward from the state of nature
to the data the bayesian goes the other

6176
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,280
to the data the bayesian goes the other
 

6177
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,790
to the data the bayesian goes the other
direction from the data back to the

6178
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:24,800
direction from the data back to the
 

6179
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,669
direction from the data back to the
state of nature

6180
01:28:25,669 --> 01:28:25,679
state of nature
 

6181
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,030
state of nature
and that's actually what false discovery

6182
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,040
and that's actually what false discovery
 

6183
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:28,870
and that's actually what false discovery
rate is it says given you made a

6184
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:28,880
rate is it says given you made a
 

6185
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,390
rate is it says given you made a
discovery

6186
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:30,400
discovery
 

6187
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,390
discovery
okay that's condition on your data

6188
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:32,400
okay that's condition on your data
 

6189
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,709
okay that's condition on your data
what's the probability of the hypothesis

6190
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:34,719
what's the probability of the hypothesis
 

6191
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:37,990
what's the probability of the hypothesis
it's going the other direction and so um

6192
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:38,000
it's going the other direction and so um
 

6193
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,590
it's going the other direction and so um
the classical frequency look at that so

6194
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:39,600
the classical frequency look at that so
 

6195
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,950
the classical frequency look at that so
i can't know that there's some priors

6196
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:40,960
i can't know that there's some priors
 

6197
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,310
i can't know that there's some priors
needed in that

6198
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:42,320
needed in that
 

6199
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,149
needed in that
and the empirical bayesian goes ahead

6200
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:44,159
and the empirical bayesian goes ahead
 

6201
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,390
and the empirical bayesian goes ahead
and plows forward and starts writing

6202
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:46,400
and plows forward and starts writing
 

6203
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:46,790
and plows forward and starts writing
down

6204
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:46,800
down
 

6205
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,550
down
these formulas and realizes at some

6206
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:48,560
these formulas and realizes at some
 

6207
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,149
these formulas and realizes at some
point some of those things can actually

6208
01:28:50,149 --> 01:28:50,159
point some of those things can actually
 

6209
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,310
point some of those things can actually
be estimated in a reasonable way oh

6210
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:52,320
be estimated in a reasonable way oh
 

6211
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,669
be estimated in a reasonable way oh
and so it's kind of it's a beautiful set

6212
01:28:53,669 --> 01:28:53,679
and so it's kind of it's a beautiful set
 

6213
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:55,590
and so it's kind of it's a beautiful set
of ideas so i i this kind of line of

6214
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:55,600
of ideas so i i this kind of line of
 

6215
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,629
of ideas so i i this kind of line of
argument has come out

6216
01:28:56,629 --> 01:28:56,639
argument has come out
 

6217
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:58,550
argument has come out
it's not certainly mine but it it sort

6218
01:28:58,550 --> 01:28:58,560
it's not certainly mine but it it sort
 

6219
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,750
it's not certainly mine but it it sort
of came out from

6220
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760

6221
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:03,590

6223
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,950

written beautifully about this in

6224
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:04,960
written beautifully about this in
 

6225
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,110
written beautifully about this in
various papers and books and uh

6226
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,120
various papers and books and uh
 

6227
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,390
various papers and books and uh
and the fdr is you know ben yamini

in israel um john storey did this

6230
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:12,960
in israel um john storey did this
 

6231
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,149
in israel um john storey did this
bayesian interpretation

6232
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:14,159
bayesian interpretation
 

6233
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:16,070
bayesian interpretation
and so on so i've just absorbed these

6234
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:16,080
and so on so i've just absorbed these
 

6235
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,590
and so on so i've just absorbed these
things over the years and find it a very

6236
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:17,600
things over the years and find it a very
 

6237
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:18,870
things over the years and find it a very
healthy way to think about

6238
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:18,880
healthy way to think about
 

6239
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,310
healthy way to think about
statistics let me ask you about

6240
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:22,320
statistics let me ask you about
 

6241
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,750
statistics let me ask you about
intelligence to jump slightly back out

6242
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:25,760
intelligence to jump slightly back out
 

6243
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,790
intelligence to jump slightly back out
into philosophy perhaps you said that

6244
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:28,800
into philosophy perhaps you said that
 

6245
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,750
into philosophy perhaps you said that
uh maybe you can elaborate but uh you

6246
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:31,760
uh maybe you can elaborate but uh you
 

6247
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,510
uh maybe you can elaborate but uh you
said that defining just even the

6248
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:33,520
said that defining just even the
 

6249
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,229
said that defining just even the
question of what is intelligence is a

6250
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
question of what is intelligence is a
 

6251
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,790
question of what is intelligence is a
word is as a very difficult question is

6252
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:38,800
word is as a very difficult question is
 

6253
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:39,910
word is as a very difficult question is

do you think we'll one day understand
the fundamentals of human intelligence

6258
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:43,600
the fundamentals of human intelligence
 

6259
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,830
the fundamentals of human intelligence
and what it means

6260
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:45,840
and what it means
 

6261
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,590
and what it means
you know have good uh benchmarks for

6262
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:49,600
you know have good uh benchmarks for
 

6263
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,750

you're really asking a question
 

6271
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,030
you're really asking a question
for a psychologist really and i just

6272
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,040
for a psychologist really and i just
 

6273
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,590
for a psychologist really and i just
studied some but i don't consider myself

at least an expert at this point you

6276
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:04,400
at least an expert at this point you
 

6277
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:05,990
at least an expert at this point you
know a psychologist aims to understand

6278
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:06,000
know a psychologist aims to understand
 

6279
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,629
know a psychologist aims to understand
human intelligence right and i think

6280
01:30:08,629 --> 01:30:08,639
human intelligence right and i think
 

6281
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:09,830
human intelligence right and i think
many psychologists i know are fairly

6282

01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,790
right
but we are not ourselves a market per se

that if you were to study humans and

that if you were to study humans and
 

6473
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,430
that if you were to study humans and
really be

01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,470
the world's best psychologist study for
thousands of years and come up with the

01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:56,480
thousands of years and come up with the
 

6479
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:57,590
thousands of years and come up with the
theory of human intelligence you might

6480
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:57,600
theory of human intelligence you might
 

6481
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,790
theory of human intelligence you might
have never discovered

6482
01:32:58,790 --> 01:32:58,800
have never discovered

principles of markets you know spy

6484
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,120

principles of markets you know spy
demand curves and

6486
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:02,320
demand curves and
 

6487
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:03,669
demand curves and
you know matching and auctions and all

6488
01:33:03,669 --> 01:33:03,679
you know matching and auctions and all
 

6489
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:05,830
you know matching and auctions and all
that uh those are real principles and

6490
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:05,840
that uh those are real principles and
 

6491
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,510
that uh those are real principles and
they lead to a form of intelligence

6492
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:07,520
they lead to a form of intelligence
 

6493
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,070
they lead to a form of intelligence
that's not

6494
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,080
that's not
 

6495
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,750
that's not
maybe human intelligence it's arguably

6496
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:09,760
maybe human intelligence it's arguably
 

6497
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,189
maybe human intelligence it's arguably
another kind of intelligence

6498
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:11,199
another kind of intelligence
 

6499
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:12,790
another kind of intelligence
there probably are third kinds of

6500
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:12,800
there probably are third kinds of
 

6501
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,310
there probably are third kinds of
intelligence or fourth that none of us

6502
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:14,320
intelligence or fourth that none of us
 

6503
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,510
intelligence or fourth that none of us
are really thinking too much about right

6504
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:15,520
are really thinking too much about right
 

6505
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:16,310
are really thinking too much about right
now

6506
01:33:16,310 --> 01:33:16,320
now
 

6507
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,990
now
so if you really and then all those are

6508
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:18,000
so if you really and then all those are
 

6509
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,510
so if you really and then all those are
relevant to computer systems

6510
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:19,520
relevant to computer systems
 

6511
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,510
relevant to computer systems
in the future certainly the market one

6512
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:21,520
in the future certainly the market one
 

6513
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,590
in the future certainly the market one
is relevant right now

6514
01:33:23,590 --> 01:33:23,600
is relevant right now
 

6515
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,350
is relevant right now
whereas understand human intelligence is

6516
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:25,360
whereas understand human intelligence is
 

6517
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,870
whereas understand human intelligence is
not so clear that it's relevant right

6518
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:26,880
not so clear that it's relevant right
 

6519
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,310
not so clear that it's relevant right
now probably not

6520
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:28,320
now probably not
 

6521
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,790
now probably not
um so if you want general intelligence

6522
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:30,800
um so if you want general intelligence
 

6523
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,550
um so if you want general intelligence
whatever one means by that or you know

01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:32,560
whatever one means by that or you know
 

6525
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:33,910
whatever one means by that or you know
understand the intelligence in a deep

6526
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:33,920
understand the intelligence in a deep
 

6527
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:35,750
understand the intelligence in a deep
sense and all that it is definitely

6528
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:35,760
sense and all that it is definitely
 

6529
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,430
sense and all that it is definitely
has to be not just human intelligence

6530
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:37,440
has to be not just human intelligence
 

6531
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,030
has to be not just human intelligence
it's got to be this broader thing

6532
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,040
it's got to be this broader thing
 

6533
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,629
it's got to be this broader thing
and that's not a mystery markets are

6534
01:33:40,629 --> 01:33:40,639
and that's not a mystery markets are
 

6535
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,790
and that's not a mystery markets are
intelligent so you know

6536
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:42,800
intelligent so you know
 

6537
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,990
intelligent so you know
it's definitely not just a philosophical

6538
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:44,000
it's definitely not just a philosophical
 

6539
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,030
it's definitely not just a philosophical
stance to say we gotta move beyond and

6540
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:45,040
stance to say we gotta move beyond and
 

6541
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,149

tell who intelligence that sounds

6542
01:33:46,149 --> 01:33:46,159
tell who intelligence that sounds
 

6543
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:46,950
tell who intelligence that sounds
ridiculous

yeah but it's not and in that blog post

01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:17,360
intelligence i don't know i don't tend
 

6579
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:17,990
intelligence i don't know i don't tend
to think i don't

6580
01:34:17,990 --> 01:34:18,000
to think i don't
 

6581
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,590
to think i don't
tend to answer questions like that

6582
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:19,600
tend to answer questions like that
 

6583
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,270
tend to answer questions like that
because you know that's science fiction

6584
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:21,280
because you know that's science fiction
 

6585
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,950
because you know that's science fiction
hoping to catch you off guard

6586
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:24,960

 

6587
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,350

well again because you said it's so far

6588
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
well again because you said it's so far
 

6589
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,070
well again because you said it's so far
in the future

6590
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:28,080
in the future
 

6591
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,110
in the future
it's fun to ask and you'll probably

6592
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:31,120
it's fun to ask and you'll probably
 

6593
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,510
it's fun to ask and you'll probably
you know like you said predicting the

6594
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:33,520
you know like you said predicting the
 

6595
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:34,790
you know like you said predicting the
future is really

6596
01:34:34,790 --> 01:34:34,800
future is really
 

6597
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:37,830
future is really
nearly impossible but say

6598
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:37,840
nearly impossible but say
 

6599
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,870
nearly impossible but say
as an axiom one day we create

6600
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:40,880
as an axiom one day we create
 

6601
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,709
as an axiom one day we create
a human level superhuman level

01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:49,119
individual what do you think is
 

6609
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:51,270
individual what do you think is
is what do you think it would take to do

6610
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:51,280
is what do you think it would take to do
 

6611
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,669
is what do you think it would take to do
that or maybe to ask another question

6612
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:53,679
that or maybe to ask another question
 

6613
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,709
that or maybe to ask another question
is how would that system be different

6614
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:56,719
is how would that system be different
 

6615
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,830
is how would that system be different
than the biological human beings that we

6616
01:34:59,830 --> 01:34:59,840
than the biological human beings that we
 

6617
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:00,070
than the biological human beings that we
see

6618
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080
see
 

6619
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,550
see
around us today is it possible to say

6620
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:02,560
around us today is it possible to say
 

6621
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,229
around us today is it possible to say
anything interesting to that question or

6622
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
anything interesting to that question or
 

6623
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:05,910
anything interesting to that question or
is it just a stupid question

6624
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:05,920
is it just a stupid question
 

6625
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:07,189
is it just a stupid question
it's not stupid question but it's

6626
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:07,199
it's not stupid question but it's
 

6627
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,270
it's not stupid question but it's
science fiction science fiction and so

6628
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:09,280
science fiction science fiction and so
 

6629
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,950
science fiction science fiction and so
i'm totally happy to read science

6630
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:10,960
i'm totally happy to read science
 

6631
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,229
i'm totally happy to read science
fiction and think about it from time my

6632
01:35:12,229 --> 01:35:12,239
fiction and think about it from time my
 

6633
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:13,350
fiction and think about it from time my
own life

6634
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:13,360
own life
 

6635
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:15,510
own life
i loved there was this like brain in a

6636
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:15,520
i loved there was this like brain in a
 

6637
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:17,030
i loved there was this like brain in a
vat kind of you know little thing that

6638
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,040
vat kind of you know little thing that
 

6639
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,470
vat kind of you know little thing that
people were talking about when i was a

6640
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:18,480
people were talking about when i was a
 

6641
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,669
people were talking about when i was a
student i remember

6642
01:35:19,669 --> 01:35:19,679
student i remember
 

6643
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:22,550

you know imagine that uh um you know

6644
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:22,560
you know imagine that uh um you know
 

6645
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:23,030
you know imagine that uh um you know
between

6646
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,040
between
 

6647
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,629
between
your brain and your body there's you

6648
01:35:24,629 --> 01:35:24,639
your brain and your body there's you
 

6649
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:26,629
your brain and your body there's you
know there's a bunch of wires right

6650
01:35:26,629 --> 01:35:26,639
know there's a bunch of wires right
 

6651
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,070
know there's a bunch of wires right
and suppose that every one of them was

6652
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,080
and suppose that every one of them was
 

6653
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,830
and suppose that every one of them was
replaced with a uh

6654
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:29,840
replaced with a uh
 

6655
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,990
replaced with a uh
uh literal wire and then suppose that

6656
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:32,000
uh literal wire and then suppose that
 

6657
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,030
uh literal wire and then suppose that
wire was turning actually a little

6658
01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:33,040
wire was turning actually a little
 

6659
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:33,669
wire was turning actually a little
wireless

6660
01:35:33,669 --> 01:35:33,679
wireless
 

6661
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:35,750
wireless
you know there's a receiver and sender

6662
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:35,760
you know there's a receiver and sender
 

6663
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:36,950
you know there's a receiver and sender
so the brain has got all the

6664
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:36,960
so the brain has got all the
 

6665
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,270
so the brain has got all the
senders and receiver you know on all of

6666
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:39,280
senders and receiver you know on all of
 

6667
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,030
senders and receiver you know on all of
its exiting uh

6668
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:41,040
its exiting uh
 

6669
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,109
its exiting uh
you know axons and all the dendrites

6670
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:43,119
you know axons and all the dendrites
 

6671
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,070
you know axons and all the dendrites
down the body have

6672
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:44,080
down the body have
 

6673
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,990
down the body have
replaced with syndrome receivers now you

6674
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:46,000
replaced with syndrome receivers now you
 

6675
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,510
replaced with syndrome receivers now you
could move the body off somewhere and

6676
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:47,520
could move the body off somewhere and
 

6677
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,109
could move the body off somewhere and
put the brain in a vat

6678
01:35:49,109 --> 01:35:49,119
put the brain in a vat
 

6679
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,669
put the brain in a vat
right and then you could do things like

6680
01:35:51,669 --> 01:35:51,679
right and then you could do things like
 

6681
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:52,790
right and then you could do things like
start killing off those centers of

6682
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:52,800
start killing off those centers of
 

6683
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,310
start killing off those centers of
receivers one by one

6684
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:54,320
receivers one by one
 

6685
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:55,590
receivers one by one
and after you've killed off all of them

6686
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:55,600
and after you've killed off all of them
 

6687
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,189
and after you've killed off all of them
where is that person you know they

6688
01:35:57,189 --> 01:35:57,199
where is that person you know they
 

6689
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:58,149
where is that person you know they
thought they were out in the body

6690
01:35:58,149 --> 01:35:58,159
thought they were out in the body
 

6691
01:35:58,159 --> 01:35:59,590
thought they were out in the body
walking around the world and they moved

6692
01:35:59,590 --> 01:35:59,600
walking around the world and they moved
 

6693
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,790
walking around the world and they moved
on so those are science fiction things

6694
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:00,800
on so those are science fiction things
 

6695
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,310
on so those are science fiction things
those are fun to think about it's just

6696
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:02,320
those are fun to think about it's just
 

6697
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:03,830
those are fun to think about it's just
intriguing about where's what is thought

6698
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:03,840
intriguing about where's what is thought
 

6699
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,350
intriguing about where's what is thought
where is it and all that

6700
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:05,360
where is it and all that
 

6701
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:08,229
where is it and all that
and i think every 18 year old it's to

6702
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:08,239
and i think every 18 year old it's to
 

6703
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:09,590
and i think every 18 year old it's to
take philosophy classes and think about

6704
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:09,600
take philosophy classes and think about
 

6705
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,390
take philosophy classes and think about
these things

6706
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:10,400
these things
 

6707
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:11,430
these things
and i think that everyone should think

6708
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:11,440
and i think that everyone should think
 

6709
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,950
and i think that everyone should think
about what could happen in society

6710
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:12,960
about what could happen in society
 

6711
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,310
about what could happen in society
that's kind of bad and all that but i

6712
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:14,320
that's kind of bad and all that but i
 

6713
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,510
that's kind of bad and all that but i
really don't think that's the right

6714
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:15,520
really don't think that's the right
 

6715
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,350
really don't think that's the right
thing for most of us that are my age

6716
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,360
thing for most of us that are my age
 

6717
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,350
thing for most of us that are my age
group to be doing and thinking about

6718
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:19,360
group to be doing and thinking about
 

6719
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:22,149
group to be doing and thinking about
i really think that we have so many more

6720
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:22,159
i really think that we have so many more

01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:22,950
i really think that we have so many more

01:36:26,629 --> 01:36:26,639
and
 

6727
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,350
and
real things to build and all that um

6728
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:29,360
real things to build and all that um
 

6729
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,390
real things to build and all that um
such that uh

6730
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:30,400
such that uh
 

6731
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,990
such that uh
you know uh spending too much time on

01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,000
you know uh spending too much time on
 

6733
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,430
you know uh spending too much time on
science fiction at least in public fora

6734
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:33,440
science fiction at least in public fora
 

6735
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:34,709
science fiction at least in public fora
like this i think is is

6736
01:36:34,709 --> 01:36:34,719
like this i think is is
 

6737
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:36,310
like this i think is is
not what we should be doing maybe over

the seminal figures in the field
 

6767
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:11,430
the seminal figures in the field
can you uh give advice

6768

can you uh give advice
 

6769
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,990
can you uh give advice
to people who undergraduates today what

01:37:16,709 --> 01:37:16,719
you know advice on their journey if
 

6775
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:18,390
you know advice on their journey if
they're interested in machine learning

6776
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:18,400
they're interested in machine learning
 

6777
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,030
they're interested in machine learning
and ai in in

6778
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,040
and ai in in
 

6779
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:23,030
and ai in in
the ideas of markets from economics and

6780
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:23,040
the ideas of markets from economics and
 

6781
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,390
the ideas of markets from economics and
psychology and all the kinds of things

psychology and all the kinds of things
 

6783
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:25,430

01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:25,440
that you're exploring
 

6785
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,350
that you're exploring
what what what steps should they take on

6786
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:27,360
what what what steps should they take on
 

6787
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,709
what what what steps should they take on
that journey well yeah first of all the

6788
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:28,719
that journey well yeah first of all the
 

6789

door is open and second it's a journey i
like your language there

6792
01:37:33,270 --> 01:37:33,280
like your language there
 

6793
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,430
like your language there
uh it is not that you're so brilliant

6794
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:35,440
uh it is not that you're so brilliant
 

6795
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:36,709
uh it is not that you're so brilliant
and you have great brilliant ideas and

6796
01:37:36,709 --> 01:37:36,719
and you have great brilliant ideas and
 

6797
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:38,149
and you have great brilliant ideas and
therefore that's that's just

6798
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:38,159
therefore that's that's just
 

6799
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:39,910
therefore that's that's just
you know that's how you have success or

6800
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:39,920
you know that's how you have success or
 

6801
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,910
you know that's how you have success or
that's how you enter into the field

6802
01:37:41,910 --> 01:37:41,920
that's how you enter into the field
 

6803
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,310
that's how you enter into the field
uh it's that you apprentice yourself you

6804
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:44,320
uh it's that you apprentice yourself you
 

6805
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,310
uh it's that you apprentice yourself you
you spend a lot of time you work on hard

6806
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
you spend a lot of time you work on hard
 

6807
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,229
you spend a lot of time you work on hard
things you

6808
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:48,239
things you
 

6809
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:51,109
things you
try and pull back and you be as broad as

6810
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:51,119
try and pull back and you be as broad as
 

6811
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,550
try and pull back and you be as broad as
you can you talk lots of people

6812
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:52,560
you can you talk lots of people
 

6813
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,750
you can you talk lots of people
um and it's like entering any kind of a

6814
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:55,760
um and it's like entering any kind of a
 

6815
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,470
um and it's like entering any kind of a
creative community there's um years that

6816
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:58,480
creative community there's um years that
 

6817
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:59,109
creative community there's um years that
are needed

6818
01:37:59,109 --> 01:37:59,119
are needed
 

6819
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:01,270
are needed
and uh human connections are critical to

6820
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:01,280
and uh human connections are critical to
 

6821
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,790
and uh human connections are critical to
it so you know i think about

6822
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:02,800
it so you know i think about
 

6823
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,109
it so you know i think about
you know being a musician or being an

6824
01:38:05,109 --> 01:38:05,119
you know being a musician or being an
 

6825
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:06,709
you know being a musician or being an
artist or something you don't just

6826
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:06,719
artist or something you don't just
 

6827
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,550
artist or something you don't just
you know immediately from day one you

6828
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:08,560
you know immediately from day one you
 

6829
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,629
you know immediately from day one you
know you you're a genius and therefore

6830
01:38:10,629 --> 01:38:10,639
know you you're a genius and therefore
 

6831
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:11,990
know you you're a genius and therefore
you do it no you

6832
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:12,000
you do it no you
 

6833
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,189
you do it no you
um you know practice really really hard

6834
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:15,199
um you know practice really really hard
 

6835
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,149
um you know practice really really hard
on basics

6836
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:16,159
on basics
 

6837
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:19,430
on basics
and you uh be humble about where you are

6838
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:19,440
and you uh be humble about where you are
 

6839
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,109
and you uh be humble about where you are
and then and you realize you'll never be

6840
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:21,119
and then and you realize you'll never be
 

6841
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,790
and then and you realize you'll never be
an expert on everything so you kind of

6842
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:22,800
an expert on everything so you kind of
 

6843
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,550
an expert on everything so you kind of
pick and there's a lot of randomness and

6844
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:24,560
pick and there's a lot of randomness and
 

6845
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,870
pick and there's a lot of randomness and
a lot of kind of

6846
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:26,880
a lot of kind of
 

6847
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,750
a lot of kind of
luck but luck just kind of picks out

6848
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:29,760
luck but luck just kind of picks out
 

6849
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:29,990
luck but luck just kind of picks out
which

6850
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
which
 

6851
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,430
which
branch of the tree go down but you'll go

6852
01:38:31,430 --> 01:38:31,440
branch of the tree go down but you'll go
 

6853
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,750
branch of the tree go down but you'll go
down some branch um

6854
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:33,760
down some branch um
 

6855
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,750
down some branch um
so yeah it's it's a community so the

6856
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:35,760
so yeah it's it's a community so the
 

6857
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,870
so yeah it's it's a community so the
graduate school is

6858
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:36,880
graduate school is
 

6859
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,070
graduate school is
i still think is one of the wonderful

6860
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,080
i still think is one of the wonderful
 

6861
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,070
i still think is one of the wonderful
phenomena that we have in our in our

6862
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
phenomena that we have in our in our
 

6863
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,590
phenomena that we have in our in our
world it's it's very much about

6864
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:41,600
world it's it's very much about
 

6865
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,270
world it's it's very much about
apprenticeship with an advisor it's very

6866
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:43,280
apprenticeship with an advisor it's very
 

6867
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,790
apprenticeship with an advisor it's very
much about a group of people you belong

6868
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:44,800
much about a group of people you belong
 

6869
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:45,510
much about a group of people you belong
to

6870
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:45,520
to
 

6871
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:47,109
to
it's a four or five year process so it's

6872
01:38:47,109 --> 01:38:47,119
it's a four or five year process so it's
 

6873
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,590
it's a four or five year process so it's
plenty of time to start from kind of

6874
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:49,600
plenty of time to start from kind of
 

6875
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,590
plenty of time to start from kind of
nothing to come up to something you know

6876
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:51,600
nothing to come up to something you know
 

6877
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:52,950
nothing to come up to something you know
more expertise and then start to have

6878
01:38:52,950 --> 01:38:52,960
more expertise and then start to have
 

6879
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:54,790
more expertise and then start to have
your own creativity start to flower even

6880
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:54,800
your own creativity start to flower even
 

6881
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,229
your own creativity start to flower even
surprise into your own self um and it's

6882
01:38:58,229 --> 01:38:58,239
surprise into your own self um and it's
 

6883
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,149
surprise into your own self um and it's
a very cooperative endeavor it's i think

6884
01:39:00,149 --> 01:39:00,159
a very cooperative endeavor it's i think
 

6885
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:03,350
a very cooperative endeavor it's i think
a lot of people uh think of

6886
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:03,360
a lot of people uh think of
 

6887
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:04,950
a lot of people uh think of
science as highly competitive and i

6888
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:04,960
science as highly competitive and i
 

6889
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:06,390
science as highly competitive and i
think in some other fields it might be

6890
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:06,400
think in some other fields it might be
 

6891
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,830
think in some other fields it might be
more so

6892
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:07,840
more so
 

6893
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,189
more so
here it's way more cooperative than you

6894
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:09,199
here it's way more cooperative than you
 

6895
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:11,430
here it's way more cooperative than you

do ai and for me that is natural
 

7169
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:05,430

um that's to me an amazingly interesting
 

7177
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,550
um that's to me an amazingly interesting
scientific challenge

7178
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:12,560
scientific challenge
 

7179
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,189
scientific challenge
and uh when we're very far away one

7180
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:15,199
and uh when we're very far away one
 

7181
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:17,030
and uh when we're very far away one
we're very far away but good natural

7182
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:17,040
we're very far away but good natural
 

7183
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,470
we're very far away but good natural
language people are kind of really

7184
01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:18,480
language people are kind of really
 

7185
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:19,990
language people are kind of really
invested then i think a lot of them see

7186
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:20,000
invested then i think a lot of them see
 

7187
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,669
invested then i think a lot of them see
that's where the core of ai is that if

7188
01:43:21,669 --> 01:43:21,679
that's where the core of ai is that if
 

7189
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:22,870
that's where the core of ai is that if
you understand that you really help

7190
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:22,880
you understand that you really help
 

7191
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,310
you understand that you really help
human communication

7192

human communication
 

7193
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,750
human communication
you understand something about the human

7194
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:25,760
you understand something about the human
 

7195
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,109
you understand something about the human
mind the semantics that come out of the

7196
01:43:27,109 --> 01:43:27,119
mind the semantics that come out of the
 

7197
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:28,229

7198
01:43:28,229 --> 01:43:28,239
human mind
 

7199
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:30,390
human mind
and i agree i think that will be such a

7200
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:30,400
and i agree i think that will be such a
 

7201
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,910
and i agree i think that will be such a
long time so i didn't do that in my

7202
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:31,920
long time so i didn't do that in my
 

7203
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:33,189
long time so i didn't do that in my
career just because i kind of

7204
01:43:33,189 --> 01:43:33,199
career just because i kind of
 

7205
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:34,950
career just because i kind of
i was behind in the early days i didn't

7206
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:34,960
i was behind in the early days i didn't
 

7207
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:36,790
i was behind in the early days i didn't
kind of know enough of that stuff i was

7208
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:36,800
kind of know enough of that stuff i was
 

7209
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,390
kind of know enough of that stuff i was
at mit i didn't learn much

7210
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,400
at mit i didn't learn much
 

7211
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,629
at mit i didn't learn much
language and it was too late at some

7212
01:43:40,629 --> 01:43:40,639
language and it was too late at some
 

7213
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:41,910
language and it was too late at some
