is ultimately about examining that that
point of view closely enough so as to

00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280
point of view closely enough so as to
 

203
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,710
point of view closely enough so as to
unravel it and

204
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
unravel it and
 

205
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,390
unravel it and
feel the the freedom that's on the other

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
side of that identification but
 

209
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,670
side of that identification but
the um subjectively thoughts

210
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
the um subjectively thoughts
 

211
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,670
the um subjectively thoughts
simply emerge right and you don't think

212
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
simply emerge right and you don't think
 

213
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,430
simply emerge right and you don't think
them before you think them right there's

214
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
them before you think them right there's
 

215
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,670
them before you think them right there's
this first moment where

216
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
this first moment where
 

217
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,750
this first moment where
you know just anyone listening to us or

218
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
you know just anyone listening to us or
 

219
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,270
you know just anyone listening to us or
watching us now could

00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
watching us now could

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,869
watching us now could
perform this experiment for themselves i

222
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
perform this experiment for themselves i
 

223
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,550
perform this experiment for themselves i
mean just imagine

224
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
mean just imagine
 

225
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,710
mean just imagine
something or remember something and just

226
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
something or remember something and just
 

227
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,309
something or remember something and just
just pick a memory any memory

228
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
just pick a memory any memory
 

229
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,229
just pick a memory any memory
right you've got a storehouse of memory

230
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
right you've got a storehouse of memory
 

231
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,750
right you've got a storehouse of memory
just promote one

232
00:03:59,750 --> 00:03:59,760
just promote one
 

233
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,789
just promote one
to consciousness

234
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799

 

235
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,030

did you pick that memory i mean let's

236
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
did you pick that memory i mean let's
 

237
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,390
did you pick that memory i mean let's
say you remembered

238
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
say you remembered
 

239
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,070
say you remembered
breakfast yesterday or you remembered

240
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
breakfast yesterday or you remembered
 

241
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,910
breakfast yesterday or you remembered
what you said to your spouse

242
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
what you said to your spouse
 

243
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,190
what you said to your spouse
before leaving the house or you

244
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
before leaving the house or you
 

245
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,270
before leaving the house or you
remembered what you watched on netflix

246
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
remembered what you watched on netflix
 

247
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,110
remembered what you watched on netflix
last night or you remembered

248
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
last night or you remembered
 

249
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,069
last night or you remembered
something that happened to you when

250
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
something that happened to you when
 

251
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,229
something that happened to you when
you're four years old whatever it is

252
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
you're four years old whatever it is
 

253
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,310
you're four years old whatever it is
right it first it wasn't there

254
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
right it first it wasn't there
 

255
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,830
right it first it wasn't there
and then it appeared and

256
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
and then it appeared and
 

257
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,070
and then it appeared and
that is not a i'm sure we'll get to the

258
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
that is not a i'm sure we'll get to the
 

259
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,350
that is not a i'm sure we'll get to the
topic of free will

260
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
topic of free will
 

261
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,749
topic of free will
ultimately uh that's not evidence of

262
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
ultimately uh that's not evidence of
 

263
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,550
ultimately uh that's not evidence of
free will

264
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
free will
 

265
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,350
free will
right why are you so sure by the way

266
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
right why are you so sure by the way
 

267
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,629
right why are you so sure by the way
it's very interesting

268
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
it's very interesting
 

269
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,990
it's very interesting
after no no free will of my own yeah um

270
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
after no no free will of my own yeah um
 

271
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,230
after no no free will of my own yeah um
everything just appears right but what

272
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
everything just appears right but what
 

273
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,510
everything just appears right but what
else could it do

274
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
else could it do
 

275
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,189
else could it do
and so that's that's the subjective side

276
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
and so that's that's the subjective side
 

277
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,629
and so that's that's the subjective side
of it objectively

278
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
of it objectively
 

279
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,909
of it objectively
you know we have every reason to believe

280
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
you know we have every reason to believe
 

281
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,310
you know we have every reason to believe
that many of our thoughts all of our

282
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
that many of our thoughts all of our
 

283
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,060
that many of our thoughts all of our
thoughts are

284
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,070
thoughts are
 

285
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,310

uh at bottom what some part of our brain

288
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
uh at bottom what some part of our brain
 

289
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,030
uh at bottom what some part of our brain
is doing

290
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
is doing
 

291
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,550
is doing
neurophysiologically i mean that these

292
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
neurophysiologically i mean that these
 

293
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,430
neurophysiologically i mean that these
are the products of some kind of neural

294
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
are the products of some kind of neural
 

295
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,029
are the products of some kind of neural
computation and neural um representation

296
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
computation and neural um representation
 

297
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,029

when you're talking about memories is it

when you're talking about memories is it
 

299
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,990
when you're talking about memories is it
possible to pull the string

possible to pull the string
 

301
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,990
possible to pull the string
of thoughts to try to get to its root

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
of thoughts to try to get to its root
 

303
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,550
of thoughts to try to get to its root
to try to dig in past the the obvious

is it possible to somehow get closer to

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,749
is it possible to somehow get closer to
the roots of where they come out of

from the the firing of the cells or is
 

317
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,710
from the the firing of the cells or is
it a useless pursuit to dig that

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
it a useless pursuit to dig that
 

319

it a useless pursuit to dig that
to dig into that direction well you can

320

to dig into that direction well you can
 

321
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,990
to dig into that direction well you can
get

contents in consciousness right so you

326
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
contents in consciousness right so you
 

327
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,990
contents in consciousness right so you
can notice things more and more clearly

328
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
can notice things more and more clearly
 

329
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,390
can notice things more and more clearly
and have a landscape of mind open up and

00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
and have a landscape of mind open up and

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,590
and have a landscape of mind open up and
become more

become more
 

333
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,749
become more
differentiated and more interesting and

differentiated and more interesting and
 

335
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,950

if you take psychedelics

336
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:48,960
if you take psychedelics
 

337
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,670
if you take psychedelics
you know it opens up you know why

338
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
you know it opens up you know why
 

339
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,189
you know it opens up you know why
depending on what you've taken and

00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
depending on what you've taken and
 

341
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,189
depending on what you've taken and
the dose you know it opens in directions

the dose you know it opens in directions
 

343

and to an extent that
 

345
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,029
and to an extent that
you know very few people imagine would

00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
you know very few people imagine would

is what it's like to be identified with

some
part of the stream of thought that's

part of the stream of thought that's

going uninspected right like that
 

419
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,870
going uninspected right like that
it's a false point of view and when you

420
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
it's a false point of view and when you
 

421
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,110
it's a false point of view and when you
see that and cut through that then this

422
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
see that and cut through that then this
 

423
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,469
see that and cut through that then this
sense of

424
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
sense of
 

425
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,670
sense of
this this notion of going deeper kind of

426
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
this this notion of going deeper kind of
 

427
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,350
this this notion of going deeper kind of
breaks apart because really

428
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
breaks apart because really
 

429
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,230
breaks apart because really
there is no depth ultimately everything

430
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
there is no depth ultimately everything
 

431
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,510
there is no depth ultimately everything
is right on the surface everything

432
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
is right on the surface everything
 

433
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,870
is right on the surface everything
there's no center to consciousness

434
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:28,880
there's no center to consciousness
 

435
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,909
there's no center to consciousness
there's just consciousness and its

436
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
there's just consciousness and its
 

437
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,350
there's just consciousness and its
contents and that those those contents

438
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
contents and that those those contents
 

439
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,550
contents and that those those contents
can change

440
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
can change
 

441
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,110
can change
vastly again if you drop acid you know

442
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
vastly again if you drop acid you know
 

443
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,909
vastly again if you drop acid you know
the the contents change

444
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
the the contents change
 

445
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,589
the the contents change
but there's in some sense that doesn't

446
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
but there's in some sense that doesn't
 

447
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,749
but there's in some sense that doesn't
represent

448
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:43,759
represent
 

449
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,390
represent
a position of depth versus the continuum

450
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
a position of depth versus the continuum
 

451
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,070
a position of depth versus the continuum
of depth versus surface

452
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
of depth versus surface
 

453
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,790
of depth versus surface
has broken apart so you're taking as a

454
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
has broken apart so you're taking as a
 

455
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,950
has broken apart so you're taking as a
starting point that there is a horse

456
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
starting point that there is a horse
 

457
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,950
starting point that there is a horse
called consciousness and you're riding

458
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
called consciousness and you're riding
 

459
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,510
called consciousness and you're riding
it and the actual riding is very shallow

460
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
it and the actual riding is very shallow
 

461
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:57,990
it and the actual riding is very shallow
this is

462
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
this is
 

463
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,110
this is
all surface so let me ask about that

464
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
all surface so let me ask about that
 

465
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,390
all surface so let me ask about that
horse

466
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400
horse
 

467
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,189
horse
what's up with the horse what what is

468
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
what's up with the horse what what is
 

469
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,189
what's up with the horse what what is
consciousness

470
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
consciousness
 

471
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,150
consciousness
from where does it emerge how like

472
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
from where does it emerge how like
 

473
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,909
from where does it emerge how like
fundamental is it to the physics of

fundamental is it to the physics of

reality
 

477
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,029

how fundamental is it to what it means

478
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
how fundamental is it to what it means
 

479
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,469
how fundamental is it to what it means
to be human

480
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
to be human
 

481
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,869
to be human
and i'm just asking for a friend so that

482
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
and i'm just asking for a friend so that
 

483
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,510
and i'm just asking for a friend so that
we can

484
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:19,520
we can
 

485
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,990
we can
build it in our artificial intelligence

486
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
build it in our artificial intelligence
 

487
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,830
build it in our artificial intelligence
systems

488
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
systems
 

489
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,990
systems
yeah well it remains to be seen if we

490
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
yeah well it remains to be seen if we
 

491
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,950
yeah well it remains to be seen if we
can if

492
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
can if
 

493
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,189
can if
we will build it uh purposefully or just

494
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:29,199
we will build it uh purposefully or just
 

495
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,070
we will build it uh purposefully or just
by accident

496
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
by accident
 

497
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,430
by accident
this is a major ethical problem

498
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
this is a major ethical problem
 

499
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,469
this is a major ethical problem
potentially uh that i mean

500
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
potentially uh that i mean
 

501
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,829
potentially uh that i mean
my concern here is that we we may in

502
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
my concern here is that we we may in

my concern here is that we we may in

fact
build artificial intelligence that

506
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
build artificial intelligence that
 

507
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,909
build artificial intelligence that
passes the turing test

508
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
passes the turing test
 

509
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,150
passes the turing test
which we begin to treat not only as

510
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
which we begin to treat not only as
 

511
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,829
which we begin to treat not only as
super intelligent because it obviously

512
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
super intelligent because it obviously
 

513
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,470
super intelligent because it obviously
is and

514
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
is and
 

515
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,750
is and
and demonstrates that but we begin to

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
and demonstrates that but we begin to
 

517
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,110

treat it as conscious
 

519
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,110
treat it as conscious
because it will seem conscious we will

520
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
because it will seem conscious we will
 

521
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,750
because it will seem conscious we will
have built it to seem conscious and

522
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
have built it to seem conscious and
 

523
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,750
have built it to seem conscious and

consciousness emerges
 

527
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,790
consciousness emerges
from physics we won't actually know

from physics we won't actually know
 

529

that these systems are conscious right
 

531
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,750
that these systems are conscious right
we'll just you know they may say you

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:07,760
we'll just you know they may say you
 

533
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,949
we'll just you know they may say you
know listen you can't turn me off

00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
know listen you can't turn me off
 

535
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,269
know listen you can't turn me off
because

536
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
because
 

537
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,509
because
that's a murder right and we will be

00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
that's a murder right and we will be
 

539
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,710
that's a murder right and we will be
convinced

convinced
 

541
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,070
convinced
by that uh dialogue because

by that uh dialogue because
 

543
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,509
by that uh dialogue because
we will we will you know just in the

we will we will you know just in the

extreme case who knows when
 

547
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,829
extreme case who knows when
we'll get there but you know if we build

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
we'll get there but you know if we build
 

549
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,910
we'll get there but you know if we build
something like

550
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
something like
 

551
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,550
something like
perfectly humanoid robots that are more

552
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
perfectly humanoid robots that are more
 

553
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,750
perfectly humanoid robots that are more
intelligent than we are so we're

554
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
intelligent than we are so we're
 

555
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,430
intelligent than we are so we're
basically in you know a westworld-like

there's no way we're going to withhold

there's no way we're going to withhold
 

561
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,630
there's no way we're going to withhold
an attribution of consciousness from

an attribution of consciousness from

well you don't you know i don't know

well you don't you know i don't know

613
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,389

parsimonious for me to think that i

might be the only conscious person or
 

617

even the only conscious primate

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,910
even the only conscious primate
you know is i i would argue it's not

you know is i i would argue it's not

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,670
you know is i i would argue it's not
parsimonious to withhold consciousness

parsimonious to withhold consciousness

00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
processing because you you can disrupt
 

669
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,110
processing because you you can disrupt
that process in in ways that

670
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
that process in in ways that
 

671
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,550
that process in in ways that
is um it's just so clear

672
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
is um it's just so clear
 

673
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,150
is um it's just so clear
and um the problem that the confound

674
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
and um the problem that the confound
 

675
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,550
and um the problem that the confound
with consciousness is that

676
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
with consciousness is that
 

677
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,910
with consciousness is that
yes we can seem to interrupt

678
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
yes we can seem to interrupt
 

679
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,829
yes we can seem to interrupt
consciousness you can give someone

680
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
consciousness you can give someone
 

681
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,990
consciousness you can give someone
general anesthesia and then you

682
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
general anesthesia and then you
 

683
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,509
general anesthesia and then you
wake them up and you ask them what was

684
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:35,519
wake them up and you ask them what was
 

685
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,350
wake them up and you ask them what was
that like and they say nothing i don't

686
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
that like and they say nothing i don't
 

687
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,550
that like and they say nothing i don't
remember anything

688
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
remember anything
 

689
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,550
remember anything
but it's hard to

690
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:42,560
but it's hard to
 

691
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,150
but it's hard to
differentiate a mere failure of memory

692
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
differentiate a mere failure of memory
 

693
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,470
differentiate a mere failure of memory
from a genuine interruption in

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
from a genuine interruption in
 

695
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,069
from a genuine interruption in
consciousness whereas it's not with you

696
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
consciousness whereas it's not with you
 

697
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,590
consciousness whereas it's not with you
know interrupting speech

698
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
know interrupting speech
 

699
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,230
know interrupting speech
you know we know when we've done it and

700
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
you know we know when we've done it and
 

701
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,590
you know we know when we've done it and
it's

702
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
it's
 

703
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,670
it's
it's just obvious that you know you

704
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
it's just obvious that you know you
 

705
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,670
it's just obvious that you know you
disrupt the right neural circuits and

706
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
disrupt the right neural circuits and
 

707
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,990
disrupt the right neural circuits and
you know you've disrupted speech so if

708
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
you know you've disrupted speech so if
 

709
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,350
you know you've disrupted speech so if
you have to bet all your money

710
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
you have to bet all your money
 

711
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,829
you have to bet all your money
on one camp or the other would you say

712
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
on one camp or the other would you say
 

713
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,910
on one camp or the other would you say

do you earn a side of
 

715
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,629
do you earn a side of
pan psychism where consciousness is

716
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:10,639
pan psychism where consciousness is
 

717
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,710
pan psychism where consciousness is
really fundamental to our

on that spectrum where do you land when

730
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
on that spectrum where do you land when
 

731
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,750
on that spectrum where do you land when
you think about consciousness

732
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
you think about consciousness
 

733
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,949
you think about consciousness

00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
and pan psychism is not so
 

745
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,829

compelling to me again it just seems

00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
compelling to me again it just seems
 

747
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,590
compelling to me again it just seems
unfalsifiable i wouldn't know how the

748

unfalsifiable i wouldn't know how the
 

749
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,550
unfalsifiable i wouldn't know how the
universe would be

750
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
universe would be
 

751
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,110
universe would be
different if pan psychism were true just

752
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
different if pan psychism were true just
 

753
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,870
different if pan psychism were true just
to remind people pan psychism is this

754
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
to remind people pan psychism is this
 

755
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,829
to remind people pan psychism is this
idea that

756
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
idea that
 

757
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,949
idea that
consciousness may be pushed all the way

758
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
consciousness may be pushed all the way
 

759
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,470
consciousness may be pushed all the way
down into the most fundamental

760
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
down into the most fundamental
 

761
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,310
down into the most fundamental
constituents of matter so there might be

762
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
constituents of matter so there might be
 

763
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,829
constituents of matter so there might be
something that's like to be an electron

764
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
something that's like to be an electron
 

765
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,310
something that's like to be an electron
or

766
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
or
 

767
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,710
or
or you know a cork but

768
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
or you know a cork but
 

769
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,310
or you know a cork but
then you wouldn't expect anything to be

770
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
then you wouldn't expect anything to be
 

771
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,069
then you wouldn't expect anything to be
different at

772
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
different at
 

773
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,750
different at
you know the macro scale or at least i

774
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
you know the macro scale or at least i
 

775
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,629
you know the macro scale or at least i
wouldn't expect anything to be different

776
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
wouldn't expect anything to be different
 

777
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,269
wouldn't expect anything to be different
so it may be unfalsifiable it just might

778
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
so it may be unfalsifiable it just might
 

779
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,509
so it may be unfalsifiable it just might
be that reality is not

780
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
be that reality is not
 

781
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,190
be that reality is not
something we're

782
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
something we're
 

783
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,550
something we're
as in touch with as we think we are and

784
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
as in touch with as we think we are and

that if at its base layer
 

787
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,310
that if at its base layer
to kind of break it into mind and matter

788
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
to kind of break it into mind and matter
 

789
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,430
to kind of break it into mind and matter

as we've done
 

791
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,190

ontologically is to misconstrue it right

ontologically is to misconstrue it right
 

793
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,670
ontologically is to misconstrue it right
i mean

794
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
i mean
 

795
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,110
i mean
there's there could be some kind of

796
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
there's there could be some kind of
 

797
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,670
there's there could be some kind of
neutral monism at the bottom and this

798
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
neutral monism at the bottom and this
 

799
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,470
neutral monism at the bottom and this
you know this

800
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
you know this
 

801
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,310
you know this
idea doesn't originate with me this is

this goes all the way back to

this goes all the way back to

but i just feel like that the concepts
 

811
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,910
but i just feel like that the concepts
we're using

812
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
we're using
 

813
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,590
we're using
to divide consciousness and

814
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
to divide consciousness and
 

815
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,710
to divide consciousness and

right where the rubber hits the road

psychologically here
 

823
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,629
psychologically here
are things like well what is death right

824
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
are things like well what is death right
 

825
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,110
are things like well what is death right
like

826
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
like
 

827
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,150
like
do we any expectation that we survive

828
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
do we any expectation that we survive
 

829
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,389
do we any expectation that we survive
death or any part of us survives death

830
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
death or any part of us survives death
 

831
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,389
death or any part of us survives death

like i'm with ernest becker on this that

840
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
like i'm with ernest becker on this that
 

841
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,310
like i'm with ernest becker on this that
there's some

842
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
there's some
 

843
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,230
there's some
it's interesting to think about death

844
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
it's interesting to think about death
 

845
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,230
it's interesting to think about death
and consciousness which one

846
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
and consciousness which one
 

847
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,230
and consciousness which one
is the chicken which one is the egg

848
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
is the chicken which one is the egg
 

849
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,910
is the chicken which one is the egg
because it feels like death could be the

850
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
because it feels like death could be the
 

851
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,550
because it feels like death could be the
very thing

852
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
very thing
 

853
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,310
very thing
like our knowledge of mortality could be

854
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
like our knowledge of mortality could be
 

855
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,509
like our knowledge of mortality could be
the very thing that creates the

856
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:37,519
the very thing that creates the
 

857
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,590
the very thing that creates the
consciousness

858
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:39,600
consciousness
 

859
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,710
consciousness
yeah well then you're using

860
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
yeah well then you're using
 

861
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,269
yeah well then you're using
consciousness differently than than i

862
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
consciousness differently than than i
 

863
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,389
consciousness differently than than i
am so so for me consciousness is just

864
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:46,399
am so so for me consciousness is just
 

865
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,030
am so so for me consciousness is just
the fact

866
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
the fact
 

867
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,990
the fact
that the lights are on at all that

868
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
that the lights are on at all that
 

869
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,670
that the lights are on at all that
there's an experiential

870
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
there's an experiential
 

871
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,550
there's an experiential
quality to anything so so much of the

circumstance what you can't say
 

943
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,590
circumstance what you can't say
is that we're confused about

is that we're confused about
 

945
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,590
is that we're confused about
consciousness like you can't say that

946
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
consciousness like you can't say that
 

947
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,949
consciousness like you can't say that
consciousness itself might be an

consciousness itself might be an
 

949
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:15,509
consciousness itself might be an
illusion

950
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
illusion
 

951
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,790
illusion
because on this account

952
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
because on this account
 

953
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,749
because on this account
it just means that things seem anyway at

954
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
it just means that things seem anyway at
 

955
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:21,990
it just means that things seem anyway at
all

956
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
all
 

957
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,590
all
i mean even like if this you know it

958
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
i mean even like if this you know it
 

959
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,269
i mean even like if this you know it
seems to me that i'm seeing a cup

960
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
seems to me that i'm seeing a cup
 

961
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,189
seems to me that i'm seeing a cup
on the table now i could be wrong about

962
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
on the table now i could be wrong about
 

963
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,790
on the table now i could be wrong about
that it could be a hologram i could be

964
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
that it could be a hologram i could be
 

965
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,069
that it could be a hologram i could be
asleep and dreaming i could be

966
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
asleep and dreaming i could be
 

967
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,430
asleep and dreaming i could be
hallucinating

968
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
hallucinating
 

969
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,550
hallucinating
but the seaming part isn't really up for

970
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
but the seaming part isn't really up for
 

971
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,230
but the seaming part isn't really up for
grabs in terms of

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
grabs in terms of
 

973
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,269
grabs in terms of
being an illusion it's it's not

974
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
being an illusion it's it's not

uh something seems to be happening and

00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
uh something seems to be happening and
 

977
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,509
uh something seems to be happening and
that seeming

978
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:43,519
that seeming
 

979
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,150
that seeming
is the is the context in which every

980
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
is the is the context in which every
 

981
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,990
is the is the context in which every
other thing

982
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
other thing
 

983
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,230
other thing
we can notice about ourselves can be

984
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
we can notice about ourselves can be
 

985
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,110
we can notice about ourselves can be
noticed and then

986
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
noticed and then
 

987
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,550
noticed and then
it's it's also the context in which

988
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
it's it's also the context in which
 

989
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,230
it's it's also the context in which
certain illusions can be

990
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
certain illusions can be
 

991
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,829
certain illusions can be
cut through because we're not we can be

992
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:55,839
cut through because we're not we can be
 

993
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,829
cut through because we're not we can be
wrong about what it's like to be us and

994
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
wrong about what it's like to be us and
 

995
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,189
wrong about what it's like to be us and
we can

996
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
we can
 

997
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,829
we can
uh i'm not saying we're incorrigible

998
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
uh i'm not saying we're incorrigible
 

999
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,749
uh i'm not saying we're incorrigible
with respect to

1000
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:03,759
with respect to
 

1001
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,110
with respect to
our claims about the nature of our

1002
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
our claims about the nature of our
 

1003
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,870
our claims about the nature of our
experience but

1004
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
experience but
 

1005
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,789
experience but
for instance this you know many people

1006
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
for instance this you know many people
 

1007
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,390
for instance this you know many people
feel like they have a self and they feel

1008
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,400
feel like they have a self and they feel
 

1009
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,750
feel like they have a self and they feel
like it has free will

1010
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
like it has free will
 

1011
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,990
like it has free will
and you know i'm quite sure at this

1012
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
and you know i'm quite sure at this
 

1013
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,270
and you know i'm quite sure at this
point that they're wrong about that and

1014
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
point that they're wrong about that and
 

1015
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,390
point that they're wrong about that and
that you can

1016
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
that you can
 

1017
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,750
that you can
you can cut through those experiences

1018
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
you can cut through those experiences
 

1019
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,750
you can cut through those experiences
and then things seem a different way

1020
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
and then things seem a different way
 

1021
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,949
and then things seem a different way
right so it's not that

1022
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
right so it's not that
 

1023
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,110
right so it's not that
it's not that things don't there aren't

1024
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,120
it's not that things don't there aren't
 

1025
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,870
it's not that things don't there aren't
discoveries to be made there and

1026
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:26,880
discoveries to be made there and
 

1027
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,750
discoveries to be made there and
assumptions to be overturned but um

1028
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:31,760

 

1029
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,830

this kind of consciousness is something

1030
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
this kind of consciousness is something
 

1031
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,510
this kind of consciousness is something
that i would think

1032
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
that i would think
 

1033
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,549
that i would think
it doesn't just come online when we get

1034
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
it doesn't just come online when we get
 

1035
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,510
it doesn't just come online when we get
language

1036
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
language
 

1037
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,029
language
it doesn't just come online when we form

1038
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:41,039
it doesn't just come online when we form
 

1039
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,029
it doesn't just come online when we form
a concept of death or

1040
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
a concept of death or
 

1041
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,909
a concept of death or
the the finiteness of life it doesn't it

1042
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:45,919
the the finiteness of life it doesn't it
 

1043
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,830
the the finiteness of life it doesn't it
doesn't require a sense of self

1044
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:47,840
doesn't require a sense of self
 

1045
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,310
doesn't require a sense of self
right so it doesn't it it's it's prior

1046
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
right so it doesn't it it's it's prior
 

1047
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,110
right so it doesn't it it's it's prior
to a differentiating self and other

1048
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
to a differentiating self and other
 

1049
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,510
to a differentiating self and other
uh and i wouldn't even think it's

1050
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
uh and i wouldn't even think it's
 

1051
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,789
uh and i wouldn't even think it's
necessarily

1052
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
necessarily
 

1053
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,510
necessarily
uh limited to people i mean i do think

1054
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
uh limited to people i mean i do think
 

1055
00:17:59,520 --> 00:17:59,990
uh limited to people i mean i do think
probably

1056
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,000
probably
 

1057
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,990
probably
any uh mammal has this

1058
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
any uh mammal has this
 

1059
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,510
any uh mammal has this
but certainly if you're going to if

1060
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520
but certainly if you're going to if
 

1061
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,350
but certainly if you're going to if
you're going to presuppose

1062
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
you're going to presuppose
 

1063
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,470
you're going to presuppose
that something about our brains is

1064
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
that something about our brains is
 

1065
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,590
that something about our brains is
producing this

1066
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:11,600
producing this
 

1067
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,710
producing this
right and that's a very safe

1068
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
right and that's a very safe
 

1069
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,150
right and that's a very safe
assumption even though it we can't

1070
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
assumption even though it we can't
 

1071
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,390
assumption even though it we can't
even you can argue the jury is still out

1072
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
even you can argue the jury is still out
 

1073
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,230
even you can argue the jury is still out
to some degree

1074
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:22,240
to some degree
 

1075
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,310
to some degree
then it's very hard to draw a principled

1076
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
then it's very hard to draw a principled
 

1077
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,510
then it's very hard to draw a principled
line between us and

1078
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
line between us and
 

1079
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,150
line between us and
chimps you know or chimps and and you

1080
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,160
chimps you know or chimps and and you
 

1081

chimps you know or chimps and and you
know rats

1082
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880

1083
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,270

you know phylogenetically i don't know

you know phylogenetically i don't know
 

1091

you know phylogenetically i don't know
how far

how far

how far
back to push that you know it's there

people you think

1096
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240
people you think
 

1097
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,830
people you think
single cells might be conscious or that

1098
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
single cells might be conscious or that
 

1099
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,350
single cells might be conscious or that
you know flies are certainly conscious

1100
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:43,360
you know flies are certainly conscious
 

1101
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,470
you know flies are certainly conscious
they've got

1102
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
they've got
 

1103
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,950
they've got
something like uh a hundred thousand

1104
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
something like uh a hundred thousand
 

1105
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,549
something like uh a hundred thousand
neurons in their brains and it says

1106
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
neurons in their brains and it says
 

1107
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,789
neurons in their brains and it says
it's just that's a there's a lot going

1108
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
it's just that's a there's a lot going
 

1109
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,909
it's just that's a there's a lot going
on even in a fly

1110
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:51,919
on even in a fly
 

1111
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,950
on even in a fly
right uh but i i don't have intuitions

1112
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
right uh but i i don't have intuitions
 

1113
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,070
right uh but i i don't have intuitions
about that but it's not

1114
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
about that but it's not
 

1115
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,909
about that but it's not
in your sense an illusion you can cut

1116
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
in your sense an illusion you can cut
 

1117
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,990
in your sense an illusion you can cut
through i mean to push back

1118
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,000
through i mean to push back
 

1119
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,470
through i mean to push back
the alternative version could be it is

1120
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
the alternative version could be it is
 

1121
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,350
the alternative version could be it is
an illusion constructed by

1122
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:05,360
an illusion constructed by
 

1123
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,510
an illusion constructed by
just by humans i'm not sure i believe

1124
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
just by humans i'm not sure i believe
 

1125
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,630
just by humans i'm not sure i believe
this but it

1126
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
this but it
 

1127
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,310
this but it
in part of me hopes this is true because

1128
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
in part of me hopes this is true because
 

1129
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,470
in part of me hopes this is true because
it makes it easier to engineer

1130
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
it makes it easier to engineer
 

1131
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,350
it makes it easier to engineer
is that humans are able to contemplate

1132
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
is that humans are able to contemplate
 

1133
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,350
is that humans are able to contemplate
their mortality

1134
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
their mortality
 

1135
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,909
their mortality
and that contemplation in itself creates

1136
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:19,919
and that contemplation in itself creates
 

1137
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,430
and that contemplation in itself creates
consciousness

1138
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,440
consciousness
 

1139
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,510
consciousness
that like the the rich lights on

1140
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:23,520
that like the the rich lights on
 

1141
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,110
that like the the rich lights on
experience so the lights don't actually

1142
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
experience so the lights don't actually
 

1143
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,230
experience so the lights don't actually
even turn on

1144
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
even turn on
 

1145
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,870
even turn on
in the way that you're describing until

1146
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
in the way that you're describing until
 

1147
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,950
in the way that you're describing until
after birth

1148
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:30,960
after birth
 

1149
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,630
after birth
in that construction so it's do you

1150
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
in that construction so it's do you
 

1151
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,630
in that construction so it's do you
think it's possible that that is the

1152
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
think it's possible that that is the
 

1153
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,150
think it's possible that that is the
case that it is a

1154
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,160
case that it is a
 

1155
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,190
case that it is a
sort of construct of the way we deal

1156
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:39,200
sort of construct of the way we deal
 

1157
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,230
sort of construct of the way we deal
almost like a social tool to deal with

1158
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,240
almost like a social tool to deal with
 

1159
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,430
almost like a social tool to deal with
the reality of the world

1160
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
the reality of the world
 

1161
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,470
the reality of the world
the social interaction with other humans

1162
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:46,480
the social interaction with other humans
 

1163
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,070
the social interaction with other humans
or is yeah because you're saying the

1164
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,080
or is yeah because you're saying the
 

1165
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,590
or is yeah because you're saying the
complete opposite which is it's like

1166
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
complete opposite which is it's like
 

1167
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,870
complete opposite which is it's like
fundamental to to

1168
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
fundamental to to
 

1169
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,230
fundamental to to
signal cell organisms and trees and

1170
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,240
signal cell organisms and trees and
 

1171
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,230
signal cell organisms and trees and
and so on right well yes i i don't i

1172
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,240
and so on right well yes i i don't i
 

1173
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,830
and so on right well yes i i don't i
don't know how far down to push it i

1174
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
don't know how far down to push it i
 

1175
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,590
don't know how far down to push it i
don't have intuitions that

1176
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
don't have intuitions that
 

1177
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,590
don't have intuitions that
single cells are likely to be conscious

1178
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
single cells are likely to be conscious
 

1179
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,110
single cells are likely to be conscious
but

1180
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,120
but
 

1181
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,190
but
but they might be and i just again i

1182
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
but they might be and i just again i
 

1183
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,029
but they might be and i just again i
could be unfalsifiable

1184
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
could be unfalsifiable
 

1185
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,909
could be unfalsifiable
um but as far as babies not being

1186
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:09,919
um but as far as babies not being
 

1187
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:10,630
um but as far as babies not being
conscious or

1188
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
conscious or
 

1189
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,590
conscious or
like you're not you don't become

1190
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:11,600
like you're not you don't become
 

1191
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,510
like you're not you don't become
conscious until you can recognize

1192
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
conscious until you can recognize
 

1193
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,950
conscious until you can recognize
yourself in a mirror or

1194
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
yourself in a mirror or
 

1195
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,870
yourself in a mirror or
you have a conversation or treat other

1196
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
you have a conversation or treat other
 

1197
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,390
you have a conversation or treat other
people first of all babies treat other

1198
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
people first of all babies treat other
 

1199
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,950
people first of all babies treat other
people as

1200
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
people as
 

1201
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,190
people as
others far earlier than

1202
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
others far earlier than
 

1203
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,950
others far earlier than
we have uh traditionally given them

1204
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
we have uh traditionally given them
 

1205
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,470
we have uh traditionally given them
credit for and they certainly do it

1206
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
credit for and they certainly do it
 

1207
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,149
credit for and they certainly do it
before they they have

1208
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:28,159
before they they have
 

1209
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,390
before they they have
language right so it's it's like it's

1210
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
language right so it's it's like it's
 

1211
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,029
language right so it's it's like it's
got to perceive language

1212
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:33,039
got to perceive language
 

1213
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,510
got to perceive language
to some degree and you can interrogate

1214
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:35,520
to some degree and you can interrogate
 

1215
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,630
to some degree and you can interrogate
this for yourself

1216
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
this for yourself
 

1217
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,909
this for yourself
because you can put yourself in various

1218
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
because you can put yourself in various
 

1219
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,789
because you can put yourself in various
states that are

1220
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:42,799

 

1221
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,310

rather obviously not linguistic you know

1222
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
rather obviously not linguistic you know
 

1223
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,870
rather obviously not linguistic you know
meditation allows you to do this you can

1224
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
meditation allows you to do this you can
 

1225
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,549
meditation allows you to do this you can
certainly do it with psychedelics where

1226
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
certainly do it with psychedelics where
 

1227
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,270
certainly do it with psychedelics where
it's just

1228
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280
it's just
 

1229
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,310
it's just
your capacity for language has been

1230
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
your capacity for language has been
 

1231
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,750
your capacity for language has been
obliterated

1232
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
obliterated
 

1233
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,830
obliterated
and yet you're all too conscious in fact

1234
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840
and yet you're all too conscious in fact
 

1235
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,190
and yet you're all too conscious in fact
uh yeah

1236
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
uh yeah
 

1237
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,110
uh yeah
you i think you could make a stronger

1238
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
you i think you could make a stronger
 

1239
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,149
you i think you could make a stronger
argument for

1240
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:08,159

 

1241
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,590

things running the other way that

1242
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
things running the other way that
 

1243
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,990
things running the other way that
there's something about

1244
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
there's something about
 

1245
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,630
there's something about
language and and conceptual thought that

1246
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
language and and conceptual thought that
 

1247
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,110
language and and conceptual thought that
is

1248
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,120
is
 

1249
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,390
is
eliminative of conscious experience that

1250
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
eliminative of conscious experience that
 

1251
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,510
eliminative of conscious experience that
that we're we are potentially much more

1252
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:21,520
that we're we are potentially much more
 

1253
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,310
that we're we are potentially much more
conscious

1254
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
conscious
 

1255
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,590
conscious
of data sense data and everything else

1256
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
of data sense data and everything else
 

1257
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,950
of data sense data and everything else
than we tend to be

1258
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:26,960
than we tend to be
 

1259
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,390
than we tend to be
and we have trimmed it down based on

1260
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
and we have trimmed it down based on
 

1261
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,750
and we have trimmed it down based on
how how we have acquired concepts and so

1262
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:33,760
how how we have acquired concepts and so
 

1263
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,149
how how we have acquired concepts and so
like

1264
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
like
 

1265
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,029
like
when i walk into a room like this i know

1266
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,039
when i walk into a room like this i know
 

1267
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,630
when i walk into a room like this i know
i'm walking into a room

1268
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
i'm walking into a room
 

1269
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,950
i'm walking into a room
i have certain expectations of what is

1270
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:40,960
i have certain expectations of what is
 

1271
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,830
i have certain expectations of what is
in a room you know

1272
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:41,840
in a room you know
 

1273
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,070
in a room you know
i would be very surprised to see you

1274
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,080
i would be very surprised to see you
 

1275
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,470
i would be very surprised to see you
know wild animals in here or a waterfall

1276
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
know wild animals in here or a waterfall
 

1277
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,470
know wild animals in here or a waterfall
or you know

1278
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
or you know
 

1279
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,750
or you know
there are things i'm not expecting but

1280
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
there are things i'm not expecting but
 

1281
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,750
there are things i'm not expecting but
i can know i'm not expecting them or i'm

1282
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:53,760
i can know i'm not expecting them or i'm
 

1283
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,669
i can know i'm not expecting them or i'm
expecting their absence because

1284
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
expecting their absence because
 

1285
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,590
expecting their absence because
of my capacity to be surprised once i

1286
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
of my capacity to be surprised once i
 

1287
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,830
of my capacity to be surprised once i
walk into a room and i see a you know

1288
00:21:59,830 --> 00:21:59,840
walk into a room and i see a you know
 

1289
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,110
walk into a room and i see a you know
a live gorilla or whatever so

1290
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
a live gorilla or whatever so
 

1291
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,789
a live gorilla or whatever so
there's there's structure there that we

1292
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799
there's there's structure there that we
 

1293
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,789
there's there's structure there that we
have put in place based on all of our

1294
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
have put in place based on all of our
 

1295
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,070
have put in place based on all of our
conceptual learning and language and

1296
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,080
conceptual learning and language and
 

1297
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,350
conceptual learning and language and
language learning and

1298
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
language learning and
 

1299
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,669
language learning and
it causes us not to one of the things

1300
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:15,679
it causes us not to one of the things
 

1301
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,270
it causes us not to one of the things
that happens when you take psychedelics

1302
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
that happens when you take psychedelics
 

1303
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,710
that happens when you take psychedelics
and you just look as though for the

1304
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:18,720
and you just look as though for the
 

1305
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,990
and you just look as though for the
first time

1306
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,000
first time
 

1307
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,310
first time
at anything it becomes

1308
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
at anything it becomes
 

1309
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,190
at anything it becomes
incredibly overloaded with uh it can

1310
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,200
incredibly overloaded with uh it can
 

1311
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,549
incredibly overloaded with uh it can
become overloaded with meaning

1312
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:28,559
become overloaded with meaning
 

1313
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,390
become overloaded with meaning
and and um uh

1314
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
and and um uh
 

1315
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,390
and and um uh
just the the torrents of sense data that

1316
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:36,400
just the the torrents of sense data that
 

1317
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,110
just the the torrents of sense data that
are coming in

1318
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
are coming in
 

1319
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,029
are coming in
in even the most ordinary circumstances

1320
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
in even the most ordinary circumstances
 

1321
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,870
in even the most ordinary circumstances
can become overwhelming for people and

1322
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
can become overwhelming for people and
 

1323
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,029
can become overwhelming for people and
it that tends to just

1324
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:43,039
it that tends to just
 

1325
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,470
it that tends to just
obliterate one's capacity to capture any

1326
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:46,480
obliterate one's capacity to capture any
 

1327
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:46,870
obliterate one's capacity to capture any
of it

1328
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
of it
 

1329
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,110
of it
linguistically and as you're coming down

1330
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120
linguistically and as you're coming down
 

1331
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,549
linguistically and as you're coming down
right have you done psychedelics have

1332
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559

that there's some psychedelic properties
 

1343
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,789
that there's some psychedelic properties
to them but right but yeah

1344

mushrooms uh several times and always

1346
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
mushrooms uh several times and always
 

1347
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,789
mushrooms uh several times and always
had an incredible experience

1348
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
had an incredible experience
 

1349
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,870
had an incredible experience
it exactly the kind of experience you're

1350
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
it exactly the kind of experience you're
 

1351
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,870
it exactly the kind of experience you're
referring to which is

1352
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
referring to which is
 

1353
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,149
referring to which is
if it's true that language constrains

1354
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:14,159
if it's true that language constrains
 

1355
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,430
if it's true that language constrains
our experience it felt like i was

1356
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,440
our experience it felt like i was
 

1357
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,110
our experience it felt like i was
removing some of the constraints

1358
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
removing some of the constraints
 

1359
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,029
removing some of the constraints
right because even just the most basic

1360
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
right because even just the most basic
 

1361
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,350
right because even just the most basic
things were beautiful in the way that

1362
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,360
things were beautiful in the way that
 

1363
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,190
things were beautiful in the way that
i wasn't able to appreciate previously

1364
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
i wasn't able to appreciate previously
 

1365
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,350
i wasn't able to appreciate previously
like trees and nature and so on

1366
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:27,360
like trees and nature and so on
 

1367
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,830
like trees and nature and so on
yeah and the the experience of coming

1368
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:29,840
yeah and the the experience of coming
 

1369
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,510
yeah and the the experience of coming
down

1370
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
down
 

1371
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,830
down
is an exp is an experience of

1372
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:35,840

 

1373
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,549

encountering the futility of of

1374
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
encountering the futility of of
 

1375
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,830
encountering the futility of of
capturing

1376
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
capturing
 

1377
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,029
capturing
what you just saw a moment ago in words

1378
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
what you just saw a moment ago in words
 

1379
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,110
what you just saw a moment ago in words
right like especially if you have if any

right like especially if you have if any
 

1381

program is to be able to capture things

1386
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
program is to be able to capture things
 

1387
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,430
program is to be able to capture things
in words and if you're a writer or a

or a scientist or someone who wants to
just

1394
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
just
 

1395
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,310
just
encapsulate the profundity of what just

1396
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,320
encapsulate the profundity of what just
 

1397
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,909
encapsulate the profundity of what just
happened

1398
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
happened
 

1399
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,190
happened
the the the

1400
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
the the the
 

1401
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,710
the the the
total fatuousness of that enterprise

1402
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:08,720
total fatuousness of that enterprise
 

1403
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,070
total fatuousness of that enterprise
when you really have got when you have

1404
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,080
when you really have got when you have
 

1405
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,909
when you really have got when you have
taken a you know a whopping dose of

1406
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
taken a you know a whopping dose of
 

1407
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,470
taken a you know a whopping dose of
psychedelics and you begin to

1408
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:14,480
psychedelics and you begin to
 

1409
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,029
psychedelics and you begin to
even gesture at cat describing it to

1410
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
even gesture at cat describing it to
 

1411
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,149
even gesture at cat describing it to
yourself you know so that you could

1412
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
yourself you know so that you could
 

1413
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,830
yourself you know so that you could
describe it to others

1414
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840
describe it to others
 

1415
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,870
describe it to others
uh it's just it's like trying to you

1416
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
uh it's just it's like trying to you
 

1417
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,590
uh it's just it's like trying to you
know

1418
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
know
 

1419
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,590
know
thread a needle using your elbows i mean

1420
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
thread a needle using your elbows i mean
 

1421
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,350
thread a needle using your elbows i mean
it's like you're you're trying something

1422
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
it's like you're you're trying something
 

1423
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,669
it's like you're you're trying something
they

1424
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679
they
 

1425
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,789
they
can't it's like the beer gesture proves

1426
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
can't it's like the beer gesture proves
 

1427
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,230
can't it's like the beer gesture proves
its impossibility uh and it's um

1428
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240

 

1429
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,230

so yeah so that i mean that for me that

1430
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,240
so yeah so that i mean that for me that
 

1431
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,590
so yeah so that i mean that for me that
that suggests just

1432
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,600
that suggests just
 

1433
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,269
that suggests just
empirically on the first person side

1434
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279
empirically on the first person side
 

1435
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,269
empirically on the first person side
that it's possible to put yourself in

1436
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
that it's possible to put yourself in
 

1437
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,310
that it's possible to put yourself in
a condition where it's clearly not about

1438
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
a condition where it's clearly not about
 

1439
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,350
a condition where it's clearly not about
language uh structuring your

1440
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
language uh structuring your
 

1441
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,669
language uh structuring your
experience and you're having much more

1442
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:53,679
experience and you're having much more
 

1443
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,269
experience and you're having much more
experience than you

1444
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
experience than you
 

1445
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,549
experience than you
you tend to so the primacy of language

1446
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
you tend to so the primacy of language
 

1447
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,590
you tend to so the primacy of language
is primary for

1448
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,600
is primary for
 

1449
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,430
is primary for
some things but

1450
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440

 

1451
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,549

it's certainly primary for certain kinds

1452
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:06,559
it's certainly primary for certain kinds
 

1453
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,149
it's certainly primary for certain kinds
of concepts and certain kinds of

1454
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:08,159
of concepts and certain kinds of
 

1455
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,110
of concepts and certain kinds of
semantic understandings of of the world

1456
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,120
semantic understandings of of the world
 

1457
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,990
semantic understandings of of the world
but

1458
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:12,000
but
 

1459
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,190
but
it's uh it's clearly more to mind than

1460
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,200
it's uh it's clearly more to mind than
 

1461
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,909
it's uh it's clearly more to mind than
you know the conversation we're having

1462
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
you know the conversation we're having
 

1463
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,750
you know the conversation we're having
with ourselves or that we can have with

1464
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:19,760
with ourselves or that we can have with
 

1465
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,029
with ourselves or that we can have with
others can we go to that world of

1466
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:23,039
others can we go to that world of
 

1467
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,870
others can we go to that world of
psychedelics for

1468
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:24,880
psychedelics for
 

1469
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,110
psychedelics for
for a bit sure where do you think um

1470
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
for a bit sure where do you think um
 

1471
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,269
for a bit sure where do you think um
so joe rogan apparently and many others

1472
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
so joe rogan apparently and many others
 

1473
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,470
so joe rogan apparently and many others
uh meet

1474
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
uh meet
 

1475
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,230
uh meet
apparently elves when they on dmt

1476
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:38,240

 

1477
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,669

a lot of people report this kind of

1478
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:39,679
a lot of people report this kind of
 

1479
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,510
a lot of people report this kind of
creatures that they see

1480
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
creatures that they see
 

1481
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,110
creatures that they see
and again it's probably the failure of

1482
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
and again it's probably the failure of
 

1483
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,950
and again it's probably the failure of

another person right and uh that's
 

1895
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,990
another person right and uh that's
uh that just proves the mind that's

00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,000
uh that just proves the mind that's
 

1897

uh that just proves the mind that's
capable of doing it now it's it's uh

the the phenomenon of lucid dreaming

1900
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
the the phenomenon of lucid dreaming
 

1901
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,389
the the phenomenon of lucid dreaming
shows that the mind isn't capable of

1902
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:06,399
shows that the mind isn't capable of
 

1903
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,909
shows that the mind isn't capable of
doing everything you think it might be

1904
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
doing everything you think it might be
 

1905
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,509
doing everything you think it might be
capable of even in that

1906
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
capable of even in that
 

1907
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,630
capable of even in that
space so one of the things that

1908
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:12,640
space so one of the things that
 

1909
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,190
space so one of the things that
people have discovered in lucid dreams

1910

and i i haven't done
 

1913
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,950
and i i haven't done
a lot of lucid dreaming so i've i can't

1914
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
a lot of lucid dreaming so i've i can't
 

1915
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,549
a lot of lucid dreaming so i've i can't
confirm all of this so i can

1916
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
confirm all of this so i can
 

1917
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,389
confirm all of this so i can
confirm some of it um

1918
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
confirm some of it um
 

1919

at that text the text
 

1969
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,669
at that text the text

1983
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,310
someone can confirm that that's not true
for them but that's whenever i've

for them but that's whenever i've
 

1985
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,510
for them but that's whenever i've
checked that out that has been true for

00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
checked that out that has been true for

1997
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,510

for some reason what's interesting i

00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
for some reason what's interesting i
 

1999
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,829
for some reason what's interesting i
actually i don't know how i found myself

00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:47,839
actually i don't know how i found myself

but there's quite a lot of discussion
 

2007
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,869
but there's quite a lot of discussion
about what it's like to do

about what it's like to do
 

2009
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,950
about what it's like to do
math on lsd because apparently

2010
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:58,960
math on lsd because apparently
 

2011
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,390
math on lsd because apparently
one of the deepest thinking processes

2012
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
one of the deepest thinking processes
 

2013
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,710
one of the deepest thinking processes
needed is those of mathematicians or

2014
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720
needed is those of mathematicians or
 

2015
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,230
needed is those of mathematicians or
theoretical computer scientists

2016
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,240
theoretical computer scientists
 

2017
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,750
theoretical computer scientists
basically doing anything that involves

2018
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:07,760
basically doing anything that involves
 

2019
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,750
basically doing anything that involves
math is proofs

2020
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
math is proofs
 

2021
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,270
math is proofs
and you have to think creatively but

2022
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
and you have to think creatively but
 

2023
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,589
and you have to think creatively but
also deeply and you have to think for

2024
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:13,599
also deeply and you have to think for
 

2025
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,390
also deeply and you have to think for
many hours at a time and so they're

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
many hours at a time and so they're
 

2027
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,230
many hours at a time and so they're
always looking for ways to

like is there is there any sparks of
 

2031
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,950

creativity that could be injected and

2032
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
creativity that could be injected and
 

2033
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,510
creativity that could be injected and
apparently out of all the psychedelics

2034
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,520
apparently out of all the psychedelics
 

2035
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,550
apparently out of all the psychedelics
the the worst

2036
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:26,560
the the worst
 

2037
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,190
the the worst
is lsd because it completely destroys

00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
is lsd because it completely destroys
 

2039
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,990

your ability to do

your ability to do
 

2041
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,310
your ability to do
math well and i wonder whether that has

2042
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,320
math well and i wonder whether that has
 

2043
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,030
math well and i wonder whether that has
to do with

2044
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:33,040
to do with
 

2045
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,470
to do with
your ability to visualize geometric

2046
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480
your ability to visualize geometric
 

2047
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,430
your ability to visualize geometric
things

things
 

2049
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,270
things
in a stable way in your mind and hold

00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,280
in a stable way in your mind and hold
 

2051
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,510
in a stable way in your mind and hold
them there and stitch things together

them there and stitch things together
 

2053
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,829
them there and stitch things together
which is often what's required for

2054
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:42,839
which is often what's required for
 

2055
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,790
which is often what's required for
proofs but

2056
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:44,800
proofs but
 

2057
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,910
proofs but
again it's difficult to kind of research

2058
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:47,920
again it's difficult to kind of research
 

2059
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,430
again it's difficult to kind of research
these kinds of concepts but it does make

2060
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:49,440
these kinds of concepts but it does make
 

2061
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,950
these kinds of concepts but it does make
me wonder

2062
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960
me wonder
 

2063
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,470
me wonder
where what are the spaces

2064
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,480
where what are the spaces
 

2065
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,870
where what are the spaces
how's the space of things you're able to

2066
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:56,880
how's the space of things you're able to
 

2067
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,190
how's the space of things you're able to
think about and explore

there a waking state reality

there a waking state reality

there a waking state reality

very much
in a space-time four-dimensional there's

2092
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:24,400
in a space-time four-dimensional there's
 

2093
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,109
in a space-time four-dimensional there's
a three-dimensional world there's time

a three-dimensional world there's time
 

2095
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,510
a three-dimensional world there's time
and that's what we think about reality

2096
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:29,520
and that's what we think about reality
 

2097
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,670
and that's what we think about reality
and we think of traveling

2098
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:31,680
and we think of traveling
 

2099
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,710
and we think of traveling
as walking from point a to point b in

2100
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
as walking from point a to point b in
 

2101
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,710
as walking from point a to point b in
the three-dimensional world

the three-dimensional world
 

2103
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,349
the three-dimensional world
but that's a very kind of human

2104
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:39,359
but that's a very kind of human
 

2105
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:39,990
but that's a very kind of human
surviving

what if traveling is something like we

2112
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:45,680
what if traveling is something like we
 

2113
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,230
what if traveling is something like we
do with psychedelics and meet the elves

2114
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
do with psychedelics and meet the elves
 

2115
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,550
do with psychedelics and meet the elves
what if it's something what if thinking

2116
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:50,560
what if it's something what if thinking
 

2117
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,750
what if it's something what if thinking
or the space of ideas as we kind of grow

2118
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:53,760
or the space of ideas as we kind of grow
 

2119
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,670
or the space of ideas as we kind of grow
and think through ideas that's traveling

00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:57,680
and think through ideas that's traveling
 

2121
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,710
and think through ideas that's traveling
or what if memories is traveling i don't

2122
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
or what if memories is traveling i don't
 

2123

know if you have a

know if you have a
 

2125
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,910
know if you have a

is uh
 

2141
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,190
is uh
very far from actual like objective

very far from actual like objective
 

2143
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:21,990
very far from actual like objective
reality is very

2144
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,000
reality is very
 

2145
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,870
reality is very
far from the kind of reality we imagine

2146
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
far from the kind of reality we imagine
 

2147
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,710
far from the kind of reality we imagine
we perceive and we

we perceive and we
 

2149
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,990
we perceive and we
play with in our human minds well

2150
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
play with in our human minds well

the first thing to grant is that

2152
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:34,480
the first thing to grant is that
 

2153
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,990
the first thing to grant is that
there we are never in direct contact

2154
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,000
there we are never in direct contact
 

2155
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,190
there we are never in direct contact
with reality whatever it is unless that

2156
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:41,200
with reality whatever it is unless that
 

2157
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,950
with reality whatever it is unless that
reality is consciousness right so

2158
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:42,960
reality is consciousness right so
 

2159
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,550
reality is consciousness right so
we we're only ever experiencing

2160
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:46,560
we we're only ever experiencing
 

2161
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,390
we we're only ever experiencing
consciousness and its contents

2162
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,400
consciousness and its contents
 

2163
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,829
consciousness and its contents
and then the question is how does that

2164
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:51,839
and then the question is how does that
 

2165
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,870
and then the question is how does that
circumstance relate to quote reality at

2166
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:54,880
circumstance relate to quote reality at
 

2167
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,829
circumstance relate to quote reality at
large

2168
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:55,839

happy to speculate well maybe there

2172
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,040
happy to speculate well maybe there
 

2173
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,270
happy to speculate well maybe there
isn't a reality at large maybe it's all

2174
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,280
isn't a reality at large maybe it's all
 

2175
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,750
isn't a reality at large maybe it's all
just

2176
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:03,760
just
 

2177
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,470
just
consciousness on some level and that

2178
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:06,480
consciousness on some level and that
 

2179
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,230
consciousness on some level and that
that's interesting

2180
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,240
that's interesting
 

2181
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,510
that's interesting
that runs into to my eye

2182
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:11,520
that runs into to my eye
 

2183
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,190
that runs into to my eye
various philosophical problems

2184
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
various philosophical problems
 

2185
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,510
various philosophical problems
that um or at least you have to do a lot

2186
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:17,520
that um or at least you have to do a lot
 

2187
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,990
that um or at least you have to do a lot
you have to add to that

2188
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,000
you have to add to that
 

2189
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,270
you have to add to that
uh picture i mean that you know a

2190
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,280
uh picture i mean that you know a
 

2191
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,950
uh picture i mean that you know a
picture of idealism for i mean that's

2192
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:24,960
picture of idealism for i mean that's
 

2193
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,109
picture of idealism for i mean that's
usually all the all the whole family of

2194
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:27,119
usually all the all the whole family of
 

2195
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:27,990
usually all the all the whole family of
views that would just

2196
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
views that would just
 

2197
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,550
views that would just
say that the universe is just mind or

2198
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:30,560
say that the universe is just mind or
 

2199
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,790
say that the universe is just mind or
just consciousness at bottom you know

2200
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:32,800
just consciousness at bottom you know
 

2201
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,950
just consciousness at bottom you know
we'll go by the name of idealism in

2202
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:34,960
we'll go by the name of idealism in
 

2203
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,150
we'll go by the name of idealism in
western philosophy

2204
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160

 

2205
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,990

you have to add to that idealistic

2206
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
you have to add to that idealistic
 

2207
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,109
you have to add to that idealistic
picture all kinds of epic cycles and

2208
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:43,119
picture all kinds of epic cycles and
 

2209
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,589
picture all kinds of epic cycles and
kind of weird coincidences and to get

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,109
experience and the success of
of materialist science to make sense in

of materialist science to make sense in
 

2217
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,950
of materialist science to make sense in
that context right so the fact that we

2218
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:56,960
that context right so the fact that we
 

2219
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,390
that context right so the fact that we
can

00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:01,119
what does it mean to say that there's
 

2223
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,510
what does it mean to say that there's
only consciousness

2224
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:03,520
only consciousness
 

2225
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,470
only consciousness
at bottom right nothing outside of

00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
at bottom right nothing outside of
 

2227
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,589
at bottom right nothing outside of
consciousness because no one's ever

00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,160
bases you know whether it's they're
 

2241
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,349
bases you know whether it's they're
looking at the

looking at the

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,390
looking at the

they're still just experiencing
 

2251
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,790
they're still just experiencing
consciousness and its

00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:30,800
consciousness and its
 

2253
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,069
consciousness and its
various deliverances and

00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:34,079
various deliverances and

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,270
various deliverances and

00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:37,280
layering their concepts on top of that
 

2257
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,470
layering their concepts on top of that
so

2258
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,480

 

2259
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,030

that's always true and yet that somehow

00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,040
that's always true and yet that somehow
 

2261
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,750
that's always true and yet that somehow
doesn't seem to capture

2262
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:45,760
doesn't seem to capture
 

2263
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,069
doesn't seem to capture
the um the character of our

00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:52,079

 

2265
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,470

materialist assumptions
 

2269
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,670
materialist assumptions
are are confirmable right so you take

2270
00:39:59,670 --> 00:39:59,680
are are confirmable right so you take
 

2271
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,430
are are confirmable right so you take
take the fact that we

2272
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,440
take the fact that we
 

2273
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,349
take the fact that we
we unleash this fantastic amount of

2274
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:03,359
we unleash this fantastic amount of
 

2275
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,870
we unleash this fantastic amount of
energy from within

2276
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:04,880
energy from within
 

2277
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,030
energy from within
an atom right you know we first we have

2278
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,040
an atom right you know we first we have
 

2279
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,950
an atom right you know we first we have
the theoretical

2280
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:08,960
the theoretical
 

2281
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,550
the theoretical
suggestion that it's possible right we

2282
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
suggestion that it's possible right we
 

2283
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,309
suggestion that it's possible right we
need to come back to einstein there's a

2284
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:14,319
need to come back to einstein there's a
 

2285
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,990
need to come back to einstein there's a
lot of energy

2286
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
lot of energy
 

2287
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,109
lot of energy
in that matter right and what if we

2288
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
in that matter right and what if we
 

2289
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,069
in that matter right and what if we
could release it

2290
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:20,079
could release it
 

2291
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,430
could release it
right and then we perform an experiment

2292
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,440
right and then we perform an experiment
 

2293
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,710
right and then we perform an experiment
at in this case

2294
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:24,720
at in this case
 

2295
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,109
at in this case

and lo and behold
 

2331
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,589

there was that energy to be released

there was that energy to be released
 

2333
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,589
there was that energy to be released

that could so it's it's just
 

2337
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,270
that could so it's it's just

what what the picture one forms from

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,790
what what the picture one forms from
those kinds of experiments and just the

it seems like a bizarrely

you know analogous to you know the moon

isn't there if you're not if no one's

the moon as a moon isn't there if no

the moon as a moon isn't there if no
 

2389
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,349
the moon as a moon isn't there if no
one's looking at it i'll grant that

2390
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:09,359
one's looking at it i'll grant that
 

2391
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:09,910
one's looking at it i'll grant that
because

2392
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:09,920
because
 

2393
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,589
because
that's already a kind of fabrication

2394
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:13,599
that's already a kind of fabrication
 

2395
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,910
that's already a kind of fabrication
born of concepts but the idea that

that there's no nothing that corresponds

to what we experience as the moon

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,990
to what we experience as the moon
unless someone's looking at it that just

unless someone's looking at it that just
 

2405
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,309
unless someone's looking at it that just
seems

2406
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:26,319
seems
 

2407
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,670
seems
just a way too parochial way to set out

2408
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:29,680
just a way too parochial way to set out
 

2409
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,069
just a way too parochial way to set out
on this

00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:30,079
on this
 

2411
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,990
on this
journey of discovery there is something

2412
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
journey of discovery there is something
 

2413
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,430
journey of discovery there is something
there there's a computer waiting to

00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
there there's a computer waiting to
 

2415
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,990
there there's a computer waiting to
render the moon when you look at it

2416
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
render the moon when you look at it
 

2417
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,069
render the moon when you look at it
the capacity for the moon to exist is

00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
the capacity for the moon to exist is
 

2419
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,030
the capacity for the moon to exist is
there so

2420
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,040
there so
 

2421
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,190
there so
if if we're indeed living in a

experiment uh is it's possible that

there is a kind of

there is a kind of

there is a kind of

way that we think about in video games
 

2435
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,829

physics way
 

2439

physics way
and we have to account for the fact that

it can violate the expectations of

some lawful understanding of how why
 

2455
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,150
some lawful understanding of how why
that's so

2456
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,160
that's so
 

2457
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,510
that's so
it's like um i'm just to bring it back

it's like um i'm just to bring it back
 

2459
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,870
it's like um i'm just to bring it back
to mathematics something like certain

2460
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:18,880
to mathematics something like certain
 

2461
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,470
to mathematics something like certain
numbers are prime

2462
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:20,480
numbers are prime
 

2463
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,390
numbers are prime
whether we have discovered them or not

2464
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:22,400
whether we have discovered them or not
 

2465
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,510
whether we have discovered them or not
right like there's there's there's the

2466
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520
right like there's there's there's the
 

2467
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,790
right like there's there's there's the
highest prime number

2468
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:24,800
highest prime number
 

2469
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,829
highest prime number
that anyone can name now and then

2470
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
that anyone can name now and then
 

2471
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,349
that anyone can name now and then
there's the next prime number that no

2472
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
there's the next prime number that no
 

2473
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,150
there's the next prime number that no
one can name

2474
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:30,160
one can name
 

2475
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,470
one can name
and it's there right so it's like it's

2476
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
and it's there right so it's like it's
 

2477
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,550
and it's there right so it's like it's
it's to say that

2478
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,560
it's to say that
 

2479
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,790
it's to say that
our minds are putting it there that what

2480

our minds are putting it there that what
 

2481

sense putting it there
 

2487
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,069
sense putting it there
that like that that the base layer of

00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
that like that that the base layer of
 

2489
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,990
that like that that the base layer of
reality is consciousness

2490
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:46,000
reality is consciousness
 

2491
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,150
reality is consciousness
right you know that we're we're

2492

right you know that we're we're
 

2493
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,630
right you know that we're we're
identical to the thing that is rendering

it's okay if reality is bigger than what

2502
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,000
it's okay if reality is bigger than what
 

2503

we experience
 

2505
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,710
we experience
you know and and it has structure that

you know and and it has structure that
 

2507
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,550
you know and and it has structure that
we can't anticipate and that isn't just

2508
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:10,560
we can't anticipate and that isn't just
 

2509

conversation about you know what is a
 

2557
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,910
conversation about you know what is a
human mind and you know what is true uh

human mind and you know what is true uh
 

2559
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,230
human mind and you know what is true uh
and you can explore it with with

2560
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,240
and you can explore it with with
 

2561
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,910
and you can explore it with with
different degrees of rigor

different degrees of rigor
 

2563
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,430
different degrees of rigor
and there are things to be discovered

2564
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:13,440
and there are things to be discovered
 

2565
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,550
and there are things to be discovered
there whether you're using a technique

2566
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:14,560
there whether you're using a technique
 

2567
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,750
there whether you're using a technique
like meditation or

2568
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:15,760
like meditation or
 

2569
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,030
like meditation or
psychedelics and that these experiences

2570
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,040
psychedelics and that these experiences
 

2571
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,630
psychedelics and that these experiences
have to be put in conversation

2572
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
have to be put in conversation
 

2573
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,030
have to be put in conversation
with what we understand about ourselves

2574

with what we understand about ourselves
 

2575

with what we understand about ourselves
from a third person side

from a third person side
 

2577
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,349
from a third person side
neuroscientifically or in any other way

2578

neuroscientifically or in any other way
 

2579
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,950
neuroscientifically or in any other way
but to me the question is

2580
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:28,960
but to me the question is
 

2581
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,430
but to me the question is
what if reality the sense i have from

2582
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:31,440
what if reality the sense i have from
 

2583
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,030
what if reality the sense i have from
this kind of

2584
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,040
this kind of
 

2585
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,230
this kind of
you put you play shooters no there's a

you put you play shooters no there's a
 

2587
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,670
you put you play shooters no there's a
physics engine that generate that's

2588
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:37,680
physics engine that generate that's
 

2589
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:37,910
physics engine that generate that's
probably

2590
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:37,920
probably
 

2591
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,030

sorry uh not often but yes i mean
 

2595
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,270
sorry uh not often but yes i mean
there's a physics engine that generates

there's a physics engine that generates
 

2597
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,309
there's a physics engine that generates
consistent reality

it's not that the reality
 

2613
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,030
it's not that the reality

we can even just start with the

we can even just start with the

2659
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,710
scientists that i talked to but when you
just look at

2660
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:52,720
just look at
 

2661
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,309
just look at
you look at how close we are to

2662
00:46:56,309 --> 00:46:56,319
you look at how close we are to
 

2663
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,829
you look at how close we are to
chimps right and chimps don't know

and then you get us but then you it's
 

2671
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,230
and then you get us but then you it's
only a subset of human beings

and you know i i would i would
 

2693
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,990
and you know i i would i would
extend this to myself i mean there there

2694
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,000
extend this to myself i mean there there
 

2695
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,870
extend this to myself i mean there there
are areas of scientific specialization

2705
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,150
acquired the tools it would just be an
article of faith for me to think that i

2706
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,160
article of faith for me to think that i
 

2707
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,750
article of faith for me to think that i
could acquire the tools to actually make

00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:45,760
could acquire the tools to actually make
 

2709
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,430
could acquire the tools to actually make

a breakthrough in those areas
 

2711
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,150
a breakthrough in those areas
um and i mean you know your own area is

2712
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:50,160
um and i mean you know your own area is
 

2713
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:50,710
um and i mean you know your own area is
one i mean

2714
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
one i mean
 

2715
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,710
one i mean
like you know i i've never spent any

2716
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:52,720
like you know i i've never spent any
 

2717
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,630
like you know i i've never spent any

a programmer but
 

2723
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,069

it's pretty obvious i'm not alan turin
 

2725
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,910
it's pretty obvious i'm not alan turin
right it's like like if if that were if

2726
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
right it's like like if if that were if
 

2727
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,670
right it's like like if if that were if
that were my capacity

that were my capacity
 

2729
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,270
that were my capacity
i would have discovered that in in

2739
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,349
in learning i think it was c um
it was just you know i bounced off like

00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:17,359
it was just you know i bounced off like
 

2741
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,270
it was just you know i bounced off like
this was not fun i hate

00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:25,760
was just a [\h__\h] awful experience i
 

2751
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,190
was just a [\h__\h] awful experience i
hated it right i hated every minute a

like when do we get the internet again

2760
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,040
like when do we get the internet again
 

2761
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,990
like when do we get the internet again
right and we lose

if you if you just to take the
 

2809
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,230
if you if you just to take the
the truth of evolution seriously right

2810

the truth of evolution seriously right
and and

2812
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
and and
 

2813
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,670
and and
realize that there's nothing about us

2814
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:39,680
realize that there's nothing about us
 

2815
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,790
realize that there's nothing about us
that has evolved

2816
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:40,800
that has evolved
 

2817
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,790
that has evolved
to understand reality perfectly i mean

2818
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:42,800
to understand reality perfectly i mean
 

2819
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,990
to understand reality perfectly i mean
we just we're just not that

2820
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
we just we're just not that
 

2821
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,950
we just we're just not that
kind of ape right there's been no

2822
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
kind of ape right there's been no
 

2823
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,470
kind of ape right there's been no
evolutionary pressure along those lines

2824
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:48,480
evolutionary pressure along those lines
 

2825
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,790
evolutionary pressure along those lines
so what we are making do

2826
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:50,800
so what we are making do
 

2827
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,829
so what we are making do
with tools that were designed for

2828
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:53,839
with tools that were designed for
 

2829
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,670
with tools that were designed for
fights with sticks and rocks right

2830
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:57,680
fights with sticks and rocks right
 

2831
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,990
fights with sticks and rocks right
and it's amazing we can do as much as we

2832
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,000
and it's amazing we can do as much as we
 

2833
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,270
and it's amazing we can do as much as we
can i mean we just you know that you and

2834
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:01,280
can i mean we just you know that you and
 

2835
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,309
can i mean we just you know that you and
i are just sitting here on

2836
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:02,319
i are just sitting here on
 

2837
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:04,630
i are just sitting here on
on the back of having received an mrna

2838
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
on the back of having received an mrna
 

2839
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,670
on the back of having received an mrna
vaccine

2840
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:05,680
vaccine
 

2841
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,990
vaccine
you know that uh certainly changed our

2842
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,000
you know that uh certainly changed our
 

2843
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,150
you know that uh certainly changed our
life given what the last year was like

2844
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,160
life given what the last year was like
 

2845
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,069
life given what the last year was like
like and it's going to change the world

2846
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:12,079
like and it's going to change the world
 

2847
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,030
like and it's going to change the world
if rumors of coming miracles are

2848
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:15,040
if rumors of coming miracles are
 

2849
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,470
if rumors of coming miracles are
are borne out i mean if it's now um

2850
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:18,480
are borne out i mean if it's now um
 

2851
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,030
are borne out i mean if it's now um
seems likely we have a a vaccine coming

2852
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:21,040
seems likely we have a a vaccine coming
 

2853
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,750
seems likely we have a a vaccine coming
for malaria right which has been killing

2854
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:23,760
for malaria right which has been killing
 

2855
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,309
for malaria right which has been killing
millions of people a year for as long as

millions of people a year for as long as
 

2857
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,309
millions of people a year for as long as
we've been alive

00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:28,319
we've been alive
 

2859
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,150
we've been alive
i think it's down to like 800 000 people

2860
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:30,160
i think it's down to like 800 000 people
 

2861
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,150
i think it's down to like 800 000 people
a year now because

2862
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,160
a year now because
 

2863
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,230
a year now because
we've spread so many bed nets around but

2864
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,240
we've spread so many bed nets around but
 

2865
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,670
we've spread so many bed nets around but
it was like two and a half million

2866
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:35,680
it was like two and a half million
 

2867
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,549
it was like two and a half million
people

2868
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:36,559
people
 

2869
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,950
people
every year it's amazing what we can do

2870
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:40,960
every year it's amazing what we can do
 

2871
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,549
every year it's amazing what we can do
but yeah i have if in fact the you know

2872
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:44,559
but yeah i have if in fact the you know
 

2873
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,829
but yeah i have if in fact the you know

2931
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,230
you know 1915 or so turns out you were
right i'm going to ask you about free

2932
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:42,240
right i'm going to ask you about free
 

2933
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,950
right i'm going to ask you about free
will oh

2934
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:42,960
will oh
 

2935
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,990
will oh
okay uh you've recently released an

2936
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:46,000
okay uh you've recently released an
 

2937
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,270
okay uh you've recently released an
episode of your podcast making sense

2938
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:49,280
episode of your podcast making sense
 

2939
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,190
episode of your podcast making sense
for those with a shorter attention span

2940
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:51,200
for those with a shorter attention span
 

2941
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,109
for those with a shorter attention span
uh basically summarizing your position

2942
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:53,119
uh basically summarizing your position
 

2943
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:53,829
uh basically summarizing your position
on free will

2944
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839
on free will
 

2945
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,150
on free will
i think it was under an hour and a half

2946
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,160
i think it was under an hour and a half
 

2947
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,190
i think it was under an hour and a half
yeah yeah

2948
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:57,200
yeah yeah
 

2949
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,270
yeah yeah
that is as brief and clear

2950
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
that is as brief and clear
 

2951
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,829
that is as brief and clear
uh so allow me to summarize the summary

2952
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:03,839
uh so allow me to summarize the summary
 

2953
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,270
uh so allow me to summarize the summary
tlgr

2954
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
tlgr
 

2955
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,309
tlgr
and maybe you tell me where i'm wrong

2956
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:08,319
and maybe you tell me where i'm wrong
 

2957
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:11,670
and maybe you tell me where i'm wrong
so free will is an illusion and

2958
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:11,680
so free will is an illusion and
 

2959
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,190
so free will is an illusion and
even the experience of free will is an

2960
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,200
even the experience of free will is an
 

2961
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,870
even the experience of free will is an
illusion like we don't even

2962
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:14,880
illusion like we don't even
 

2963
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,910
illusion like we don't even
experience it what

2964
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:17,920
experience it what
 

2965
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,510
experience it what
am i am i good in my summary yeah

2966
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:21,520
am i am i good in my summary yeah
 

2967
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,109
am i am i good in my summary yeah
this is a this is a line that's a little

2968
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:25,119
this is a this is a line that's a little
 

2969
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,230
this is a this is a line that's a little
hard to

2970
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,240
hard to
 

2971
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,030
hard to
scan for people i i say that it's not

2972
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,040
scan for people i i say that it's not
 

2973
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,870
scan for people i i say that it's not
merely that free will

2974
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:30,880
merely that free will
 

2975
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,910
merely that free will
is an illusion the illusion of free will

2976
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:33,920
is an illusion the illusion of free will
 

2977
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,750
is an illusion the illusion of free will
is an illusion right like there is no

2978
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:35,760
is an illusion right like there is no
 

2979
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,349
is an illusion right like there is no
illusion of free will

2980
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:37,359
illusion of free will
 

2981
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,510
illusion of free will
and that is a unlike many other

2982
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:39,520
and that is a unlike many other
 

2983
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,870
and that is a unlike many other
illusions

2984
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:40,880
illusions
 

2985
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,230
illusions
uh that's a

2986
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:44,240
uh that's a
 

2987
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,430
uh that's a
a more fundamental claim it's like

2988
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:47,440
a more fundamental claim it's like
 

2989
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,870
a more fundamental claim it's like
it's not that it's wrong it's it's not

2990
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:48,880
it's not that it's wrong it's it's not
 

2991
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,549
it's not that it's wrong it's it's not
even wrong i mean that's i guess

2992
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:50,559
even wrong i mean that's i guess
 

2993
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,790
even wrong i mean that's i guess
that was uh i think wolfgang paulie who

2994
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:52,800
that was uh i think wolfgang paulie who
 

2995
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,950
that was uh i think wolfgang paulie who
derided one of his uh

2996
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:54,960
derided one of his uh
 

2997
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,829
derided one of his uh
colleagues or enemies with that uh

2998
00:52:58,829 --> 00:52:58,839
colleagues or enemies with that uh
 

2999
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,670
colleagues or enemies with that uh
um aspersion about his theory

3000
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:01,680
um aspersion about his theory
 

3001
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,230
um aspersion about his theory
in quantum mechanics um

3002
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:06,240

 

3003
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,230

it's so there are things that you there

3004
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:08,240
it's so there are things that you there
 

3005
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,910
it's so there are things that you there
there are genuine illusions there are

3006
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:09,920
there are genuine illusions there are
 

3007
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,630
there are genuine illusions there are
things that

3008
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:10,640
things that
 

3009
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,670
things that
you do experience and then you can

3010
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
you do experience and then you can
 

3011
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,190
you do experience and then you can
kind of punch through that experience or

3012
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:15,200
kind of punch through that experience or
 

3013
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,270
kind of punch through that experience or
you can't you can't actually experience

3014
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,280
you can't you can't actually experience
 

3015
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,950
you can't you can't actually experience
you can't you can't experience them any

3016
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
you can't you can't experience them any
 

3017
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,829
you can't you can't experience them any
other way it's just um

3018
00:53:21,829 --> 00:53:21,839
other way it's just um
 

3019
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,589
other way it's just um
it's we just know it's not a vertical

3020
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:23,599
it's we just know it's not a vertical
 

3021
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:24,870
it's we just know it's not a vertical
experience just take like a visual

3022
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:24,880
experience just take like a visual
 

3023
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,309
experience just take like a visual
illusion there are visual illusions that

3024
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:26,319
illusion there are visual illusions that
 

3025
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:26,790
illusion there are visual illusions that
you know

3026
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:26,800
you know
 

3027
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,230
you know
a lot of these come to me on twitter

3028
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:28,240
a lot of these come to me on twitter
 

3029
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,829
a lot of these come to me on twitter
these days there's these amazing

3030
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:29,839
these days there's these amazing
 

3031
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,510
these days there's these amazing
visual illusions where like you know

3032
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:31,520
visual illusions where like you know
 

3033
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,270
visual illusions where like you know
that every figure

3034
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:33,280
that every figure
 

3035
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,470
that every figure
in this gif seems to be moving but

3036
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
in this gif seems to be moving but
 

3037
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,910
in this gif seems to be moving but
nothing in fact is moving you can just

3038
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,920
nothing in fact is moving you can just
 

3039
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,109
nothing in fact is moving you can just
like put a ruler on your screen and

3040
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:39,119
like put a ruler on your screen and
 

3041
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,829
like put a ruler on your screen and
nothing's moving

3042
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:40,839
nothing's moving
 

3043
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,750
nothing's moving
um some of those illusions you can't see

3044
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:43,760
um some of those illusions you can't see
 

3045
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,950
um some of those illusions you can't see
any other way i mean they're just

3046
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:44,960
any other way i mean they're just
 

3047
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:45,670
any other way i mean they're just
they're

3048
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
they're
 

3049
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,750
they're
hacking aspects of the visual system

3050
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:47,760
hacking aspects of the visual system
 

3051
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,710
hacking aspects of the visual system
that are just

3052
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:48,720
that are just
 

3053
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,589
that are just
eminently hackable and you you know you

3054
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:51,599
eminently hackable and you you know you
 

3055
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,109
eminently hackable and you you know you
you have to use a ruler

3056
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:53,119
you have to use a ruler
 

3057
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,950
you have to use a ruler
to to convince yourself that the thing

3058
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960
to to convince yourself that the thing
 

3059
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,309
to to convince yourself that the thing
isn't actually moving

3060
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:56,319
isn't actually moving
 

3061
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,750
isn't actually moving
now there are other visual illusions

3062
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:57,760
now there are other visual illusions
 

3063
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,030
now there are other visual illusions
where you're taken in by it at first

3064
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:01,040
where you're taken in by it at first
 

3065
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,710
where you're taken in by it at first
but if you pay more attention you can

3066
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:02,720
but if you pay more attention you can
 

3067
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,109
but if you pay more attention you can
actually see that it's not there right

3068
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
actually see that it's not there right
 

3069
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,829
actually see that it's not there right
or it's not how it first seemed like the

3070
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
or it's not how it first seemed like the
 

3071
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,430
or it's not how it first seemed like the
uh like the necker cube is a good

3072
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:09,440
uh like the necker cube is a good
 

3073
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,950
uh like the necker cube is a good
example of that like the necker cube is

3074
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:10,960
example of that like the necker cube is
 

3075
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,670
example of that like the necker cube is
just that

3076
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
just that
 

3077
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,910
just that
schematic of a cube of a transparent

3078
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
schematic of a cube of a transparent
 

3079
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,750
schematic of a cube of a transparent
cube which pops out one way or the other

3080
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
cube which pops out one way or the other
 

3081
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,430
cube which pops out one way or the other
the one one face can pop out and the

3082
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440
the one one face can pop out and the
 

3083
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,710
the one one face can pop out and the
other face can pop out

3084
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:18,720
other face can pop out
 

3085
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,870
other face can pop out
but you can actually just see it as flat

3086
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:20,880
but you can actually just see it as flat
 

3087
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,990
but you can actually just see it as flat
with no pop out

3088
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,000
with no pop out

so it's not it is being generated it
didn't always exist

3412
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,040
didn't always exist
 

3413
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,630
didn't always exist
so there's something we don't understand

3414
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
so there's something we don't understand
 

3415
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,150
so there's something we don't understand
that's fundamental about the nature of

3416
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,160
that's fundamental about the nature of
 

3417
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,349
that's fundamental about the nature of
reality

3418
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359
reality
 

3419
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,670
reality
that generates both consciousness let's

3420
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
that generates both consciousness let's
 

3421
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,549
that generates both consciousness let's
call it maybe

3422
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:08,559
call it maybe
 

3423
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,390
call it maybe
the self i don't know if you want to

3424
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:10,400
the self i don't know if you want to
 

3425
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,829
the self i don't know if you want to
distinguish between those yeah i

3426
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:11,839
distinguish between those yeah i
 

3427
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,109
distinguish between those yeah i
definitely would yeah

3428
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:13,119
definitely would yeah
 

3429
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,109
definitely would yeah
you would because there's a bunch of

3430
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
you would because there's a bunch of
 

3431
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,630
you would because there's a bunch of
illusions we're referring to there's the

3432
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
illusions we're referring to there's the
 

3433
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,230
illusions we're referring to there's the
illusion of free will

3434
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:18,240
illusion of free will
 

3435
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,549
illusion of free will
there's the illusion of self and there's

3436
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:20,559
there's the illusion of self and there's
 

3437
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,390
there's the illusion of self and there's
the illusion of consciousness

3438
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:22,400
the illusion of consciousness
 

3439
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,870
the illusion of consciousness
you're saying i think you said there's

3440
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:24,880
you're saying i think you said there's
 

3441
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,750
you're saying i think you said there's
no

3442
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:25,760
no
 

3443
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,270
no
you're not as willing to say there's an

3444
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:27,280
you're not as willing to say there's an
 

3445
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,430
you're not as willing to say there's an
illusion of consciousness

3446
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:29,440
illusion of consciousness
 

3447
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,789
illusion of consciousness
in fact i would say it's impossible

3448
01:00:30,789 --> 01:00:30,799
in fact i would say it's impossible
 

3449
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,470
in fact i would say it's impossible
impossible you're a little bit more

3450
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:32,480
impossible you're a little bit more
 

3451
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,390
impossible you're a little bit more
willing to say that there's an illusion

3452
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:34,400
willing to say that there's an illusion
 

3453
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,430
willing to say that there's an illusion
of self

3454
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,440
of self
 

3455
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,190
of self
and you're definitely saying there's an

3456
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:37,200
and you're definitely saying there's an
 

3457
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,549
and you're definitely saying there's an
illusion of free will

3458
01:00:38,549 --> 01:00:38,559
illusion of free will
 

3459
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,549
illusion of free will
yes yes and i'm definitely saying

3460
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
yes yes and i'm definitely saying
 

3461
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,230
yes yes and i'm definitely saying
there's an illusion that

3462
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:42,240
there's an illusion that
 

3463
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,990
there's an illusion that
a certain kind of self is an illusion

3464
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,000
a certain kind of self is an illusion
 

3465
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,230
a certain kind of self is an illusion
not every we mean many different things

3466
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:46,240
not every we mean many different things
 

3467
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,829
not every we mean many different things
by this notion of self

3468
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:47,839
by this notion of self
 

3469
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,190
by this notion of self
so maybe i should just differentiate

3470
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:49,200
so maybe i should just differentiate
 

3471
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,109
so maybe i should just differentiate
these things so

3472
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:51,119
these things so
 

3473
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,950
these things so
consciousness can't be an illusion

3474
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:52,960
consciousness can't be an illusion
 

3475
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,390
consciousness can't be an illusion
because

3476
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
because
 

3477
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,309
because
any illusion proves its reality as much

3478
01:00:58,309 --> 01:00:58,319
any illusion proves its reality as much
 

3479
01:00:58,319 --> 01:00:59,670
any illusion proves its reality as much
as any other vertical

3480
01:00:59,670 --> 01:00:59,680
as any other vertical
 

3481
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,789
as any other vertical
perception i mean if you're

3482
01:01:00,789 --> 01:01:00,799
perception i mean if you're
 

3483
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,589
perception i mean if you're
hallucinating now that's just as much of

3484
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:03,599
hallucinating now that's just as much of
 

3485
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,549
hallucinating now that's just as much of
a demonstration of consciousness as

3486
01:01:06,549 --> 01:01:06,559
a demonstration of consciousness as
 

3487
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:07,829
a demonstration of consciousness as
really seeing what's

3488
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:07,839
really seeing what's
 

3489
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,390
really seeing what's
quote actually there if you're if you're

quote actually there if you're if you're
 

3491
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,549
quote actually there if you're if you're
dreaming and you don't know it

01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:12,559
dreaming and you don't know it
 

3493
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,109
dreaming and you don't know it
you that is consciousness right if

01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
you that is consciousness right if
 

3495
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,470
you that is consciousness right if
you're you can be confused about

3496
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:16,480
you're you can be confused about
 

3497
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,670
you're you can be confused about
literally everything

literally everything

01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,069
literally everything
you can't be confused about the

you can't be confused about the
 

3501
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,270
you can't be confused about the
the underlying claim you know whether

01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:25,280
the underlying claim you know whether
 

3503
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,430
the underlying claim you know whether
you make it linguistically or not

3504
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:27,440
you make it linguistically or not
 

3505
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,069
you make it linguistically or not

can i take a tiny tangent okay so what

can i take a tiny tangent okay so what
 

3517

if
 

3519
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,589
if
i am creating consciousness in my mind

01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:58,400
property of experience like
 

3529
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,029
property of experience like
of being a living thing what if it's

3530
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:01,039
of being a living thing what if it's
 

3531
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,630
of being a living thing what if it's
just like a social tool

just like a social tool

to to almost like a useful computational

3534
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
to to almost like a useful computational
 

3535
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,510
to to almost like a useful computational
trick

3536
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:07,520
trick
 

3537
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,870
trick
to place myself into reality as we

3538
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:10,880
to place myself into reality as we
 

3539
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,069
to place myself into reality as we
together communicate about this reality

3540
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:14,079
together communicate about this reality
 

3541
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,150
together communicate about this reality
and another way to ask that because you

3542
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:16,160
and another way to ask that because you
 

3543
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,470
and another way to ask that because you
said much earlier

3544
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
said much earlier
 

3545
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,549
said much earlier
you talked negatively about robots as

3546
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
you talked negatively about robots as
 

3547
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,990
you talked negatively about robots as
you often do so let me

3548
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,000
you often do so let me
 

3549
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,150
you often do so let me
because um you'll probably die first

3550
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,160
because um you'll probably die first
 

3551
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,150
because um you'll probably die first
when they take over yeah yeah um

3552
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,160
when they take over yeah yeah um
 

3553
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,990
when they take over yeah yeah um
no no i'm looking forward to certain

3554
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:28,000
no no i'm looking forward to certain
 

3555
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,990
no no i'm looking forward to certain
kind of robots i mean i'm not

3556
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:30,000
kind of robots i mean i'm not
 

3557
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,349
kind of robots i mean i'm not
if we can get this right this would be

3558
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
if we can get this right this would be
 

3559
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,109
if we can get this right this would be
amazing but you don't like the robots

3560
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
amazing but you don't like the robots
 

3561
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:35,270
amazing but you don't like the robots
that fake consciousness that's what you

3562
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:35,280
that fake consciousness that's what you
 

3563
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,789
that fake consciousness that's what you
you you don't like the idea of fake it

3564
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:36,799
you you don't like the idea of fake it
 

3565
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,789
you you don't like the idea of fake it
till you make it well no i

3566
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:38,799
till you make it well no i
 

3567
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,190
till you make it well no i
it's not that i don't like it it's that

3568
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,200
it's not that i don't like it it's that
 

3569
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,309
it's not that i don't like it it's that
i'm worried

3570
01:02:42,309 --> 01:02:42,319
i'm worried
 

3571
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,230
i'm worried
that we will lose sight of the problem

3572
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:44,240
that we will lose sight of the problem
 

3573
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,750
that we will lose sight of the problem
and the problem has massive

3574
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:45,760
and the problem has massive
 

3575
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,190
and the problem has massive
ethical consequences if we if we create

3576
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,200
ethical consequences if we if we create
 

3577
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,910
ethical consequences if we if we create
robots that really can suffer

3578
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:51,920
robots that really can suffer
 

3579
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,910
robots that really can suffer
that would be a bad thing right and if

3580
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
that would be a bad thing right and if
 

3581
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,390
that would be a bad thing right and if
if we really are committing a murder

3582
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
if we really are committing a murder
 

3583
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,950
if we really are committing a murder
when we recycle them that would be a bad

3584
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:58,960
when we recycle them that would be a bad
 

3585
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,829
when we recycle them that would be a bad
thing that's how i know you're not

3586
01:02:59,829 --> 01:02:59,839
thing that's how i know you're not
 

3587
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,510
thing that's how i know you're not
russian why is it a bad thing that would

3588
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:01,520
russian why is it a bad thing that would
 

3589
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,190
russian why is it a bad thing that would
create robots that can suffer

3590
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:03,200
create robots that can suffer
 

3591
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,430
create robots that can suffer
isn't suffering a fundamental thing from

which like beauty springs

3594
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:07,200
which like beauty springs
 

3595
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,950
which like beauty springs
like without suffering do you really

3596
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:08,960
like without suffering do you really
 

3597
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,309
like without suffering do you really
think we would have beautiful things in

3598
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
think we would have beautiful things in
 

3599
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,589
think we would have beautiful things in
this world

3600
01:03:11,589 --> 01:03:11,599
this world
 

3601
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:13,670
this world
okay well that's a that's a tangent on a

3602
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:13,680
okay well that's a that's a tangent on a
 

3603
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,510
okay well that's a that's a tangent on a
tangent okay we'll go there i would love

3604
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:15,520
tangent okay we'll go there i would love
 

3605
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,789
tangent okay we'll go there i would love
to go there but let's not go there just

3606
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:16,799
to go there but let's not go there just
 

3607
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:17,430
to go there but let's not go there just
yet all right

3608
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:17,440
yet all right
 

3609
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,870
yet all right
but you know i do think it would be if

3610
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:18,880
but you know i do think it would be if
 

3611
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,029
but you know i do think it would be if
anything is bad creating

01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
anything is bad creating
 

3613
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,230
anything is bad creating

hell and populating it with
 

3615
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,069

you know that's bad you know that's the
 

3621

the you are
 

3623
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,270

01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:34,559
murderer we can name
 

3627
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,549
murderer we can name
if you created i mean this could be in

3628
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:36,559
if you created i mean this could be in

01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:37,990
if you created i mean this could be in
robot former you know more likely it

3630
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:38,000
robot former you know more likely it
 

3631
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,029
robot former you know more likely it
would be in

3632
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,039
would be in
 

3633
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,349
would be in
in some similar simulation of a world

3634
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:41,359
in some similar simulation of a world
 

3635
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,870
in some similar simulation of a world
where we managed to populate it with

3636
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:42,880
where we managed to populate it with
 

3637
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,309
where we managed to populate it with
conscious minds so that we know whether

3638
01:03:44,309 --> 01:03:44,319
conscious minds so that we know whether
 

3639
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,150
conscious minds so that we know whether
we knew they were conscious or not

3640
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:46,160
we knew they were conscious or not
 

3641
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,309
we knew they were conscious or not
and that world is is a state of you know

3642
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
and that world is is a state of you know
 

3643
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,910
and that world is is a state of you know
that's it's unendurable

3644
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:49,920
that's it's unendurable
 

3645
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,150
that's it's unendurable
um that would just it just taking the

3646
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,160
um that would just it just taking the
 

3647
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,990
um that would just it just taking the
thesis seriously that

3648
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,000
thesis seriously that
 

3649
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,190
thesis seriously that
there's nothing that mind

3650
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
there's nothing that mind
 

3651
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,950
there's nothing that mind
intelligence and consciousness

3652
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:58,960
intelligence and consciousness
 

3653
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,630
intelligence and consciousness
ultimately are substrate independent

3654
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:00,640
ultimately are substrate independent
 

3655
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,750
ultimately are substrate independent
right it doesn't you don't need a

3656
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:01,760
right it doesn't you don't need a
 

3657
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,430
right it doesn't you don't need a
biological brain to be conscious you

3658
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:03,440
biological brain to be conscious you
 

3659
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,630
biological brain to be conscious you
certainly don't need a biological brain

3660
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
certainly don't need a biological brain
 

3661
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,589
certainly don't need a biological brain
to be intelligent

3662
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:05,599
to be intelligent
 

3663
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,750
to be intelligent
right so if we just imagine the

3664
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:07,760
right so if we just imagine the
 

3665
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,430
right so if we just imagine the
consciousness at some point comes along

3666
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:09,440
consciousness at some point comes along
 

3667
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,109
consciousness at some point comes along
for the ride as you scale up in

3668
01:04:11,109 --> 01:04:11,119
for the ride as you scale up in
 

3669
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:12,390
for the ride as you scale up in
intelligence

3670
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:12,400
intelligence
 

3671
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,589
intelligence
well then we could find ourselves

3672
01:04:13,589 --> 01:04:13,599
well then we could find ourselves
 

3673
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,829
well then we could find ourselves
creating conscious minds

3674
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:15,839
creating conscious minds
 

3675
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,430
creating conscious minds
that are miserable right and that's just

3676
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440
that are miserable right and that's just
 

3677
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,950
that are miserable right and that's just
like creating a person who's

3678
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960
like creating a person who's
 

3679
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,710
like creating a person who's
miserable right it could be worse than

3680
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:20,720
miserable right it could be worse than
 

3681
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:21,910
miserable right it could be worse than
creating a person who's miserable could

3682
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:21,920
creating a person who's miserable could
 

3683
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,230
creating a person who's miserable could
be

3684
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,240
be
 

3685
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,150
be
even more sensitive to suffering cloning

3686
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:24,160
even more sensitive to suffering cloning
 

3687
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,230

them and maybe for entertainment
 

3689
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,910

watching them suffer
 

3691
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,390
watching them suffer
just like watching a person for suffer

3692
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:30,400
just like watching a person for suffer
 

3693
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,510
just like watching a person for suffer

you know so but but back to your the

3696
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:35,039
you know so but but back to your the
 

3697
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,670
you know so but but back to your the
your primary question here which is

3698
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:37,680
your primary question here which is
 

3699
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,470
your primary question here which is
differentiating

3700
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:38,480
differentiating
 

3701
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,470
differentiating
differentiating consciousness and self

3702
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:40,480
differentiating consciousness and self
 

3703
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,549
differentiating consciousness and self
and free will as concepts and kind of

3704
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:42,559
and free will as concepts and kind of
 

3705
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,630
and free will as concepts and kind of
degrees of illusoriness

3706
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:46,640

 

3707
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,470

the problem with free will is that

3708
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:50,480
the problem with free will is that
 

3709
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,589
the problem with free will is that
what most people mean by it and that the

3710
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:53,599
what most people mean by it and that the

here right so like he he doesn't he's

3716
01:04:58,870 --> 01:04:58,880
here right so like he he doesn't he's
 

3717
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,549
here right so like he he doesn't he's
going to disagree with me that i

3718

01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:15,680
of it and seeing seeing in myself what
 

3733
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,829
of it and seeing seeing in myself what
it's like to have felt

3734
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:17,839
it's like to have felt
 

3735
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,990
it's like to have felt
that i was a self that had free will and

3736
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,000
that i was a self that had free will and
 

3737
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,829
that i was a self that had free will and
then to no longer feel that way right i

3738
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:21,839
then to no longer feel that way right i
 

3739
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,349
then to no longer feel that way right i
mean to know what it's like to actually

3740
01:05:23,349 --> 01:05:23,359
mean to know what it's like to actually
 

3741
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,670
mean to know what it's like to actually
disabuse myself of that

3742
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:25,680
disabuse myself of that
 

3743
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,829
disabuse myself of that
uh sense cognitively and emotionally

3744
01:05:29,829 --> 01:05:29,839
uh sense cognitively and emotionally
 

3745
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:32,230
uh sense cognitively and emotionally
and to recognize what's left what goes

3746
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:32,240
and to recognize what's left what goes
 

3747
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,309
and to recognize what's left what goes
away and what doesn't go away

3748
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:34,319
away and what doesn't go away
 

3749
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,430
away and what doesn't go away
on the basis of that epiphany i have a

3750
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:37,440
on the basis of that epiphany i have a
 

3751
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,630
on the basis of that epiphany i have a
sense that i know

3752
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:38,640
sense that i know
 

3753
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,190
sense that i know
what people think they have in hand when

3754
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,200
what people think they have in hand when
 

3755
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,109
what people think they have in hand when
they worry about whether free will

3756
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:43,119
they worry about whether free will
 

3757
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,390
they worry about whether free will
exists and it

3758
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:46,400
exists and it
 

3759
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,190
exists and it
is the it is the flip side of this

3760
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
is the it is the flip side of this
 

3761
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,109
is the it is the flip side of this
feeling of self it's the flip side of

3762
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:51,119
feeling of self it's the flip side of
 

3763
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,910
feeling of self it's the flip side of
feeling like you are not merely

3764
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:53,920
feeling like you are not merely
 

3765
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,029
feeling like you are not merely
identical

identical
 

3767
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,750
identical
to experience you feel like you're

3768
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
to experience you feel like you're
 

3769
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,950
to experience you feel like you're
having an experience

3770
01:05:58,950 --> 01:05:58,960
having an experience
 

3771
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,630
having an experience
you feel like you're an agent that is

3772
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:00,640
you feel like you're an agent that is
 

3773
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,829
you feel like you're an agent that is
appropriating an experience there is a

3774
01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:02,839
appropriating an experience there is a
 

3775
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:05,029
appropriating an experience there is a
protagonist in the movie of your life

3776
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
protagonist in the movie of your life
 

3777
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,109
protagonist in the movie of your life
and it is you

3778
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:07,119
and it is you
 

3779
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,829
and it is you
it's not just the movie right it's like

3780
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:09,839
it's not just the movie right it's like
 

3781
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:10,710
it's not just the movie right it's like
the the

3782
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:10,720
the the
 

3783
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,630
the the
every like their sights and sounds and

3784
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
every like their sights and sounds and
 

3785
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,029
every like their sights and sounds and
sensations and thoughts and emotions and

3786
01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:15,039
sensations and thoughts and emotions and
 

3787
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,910
sensations and thoughts and emotions and
this whole cacophony of experience a

3788
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:17,920
this whole cacophony of experience a
 

3789
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,670
this whole cacophony of experience a
felt experience a felt experience of

01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:19,680
felt experience a felt experience of
 

3791
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,190
felt experience a felt experience of
embodiment

3792
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:21,200
embodiment
 

3793
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,789
embodiment
but there seems to be a

3794
01:06:24,789 --> 01:06:24,799
but there seems to be a
 

3795
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,430
but there seems to be a
a rider on the horse or a passenger in

3796
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:27,440
a rider on the horse or a passenger in
 

3797
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,069
a rider on the horse or a passenger in
the body

3798
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:28,079
the body
 

3799
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,990
the body
right people don't feel truly identical

3800
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,000
right people don't feel truly identical
 

3801
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,710
right people don't feel truly identical
to their bodies down to their toes

3802
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:32,720
to their bodies down to their toes
 

3803
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,630
to their bodies down to their toes
they sort of feel like they have bodies

3804
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:34,640
they sort of feel like they have bodies
 

3805
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,069
they sort of feel like they have bodies
they feel like their minds

3806
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:36,079
they feel like their minds
 

3807
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,069
they feel like their minds
in bodies and that feels like

3808
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:40,079

 

3809
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,349

a self that feels like me and

3810
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:43,359
a self that feels like me and
 

3811
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,109
a self that feels like me and
again this gets very paradoxical when

3812
01:06:45,109 --> 01:06:45,119
again this gets very paradoxical when
 

3813
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,630
again this gets very paradoxical when
you talk about

3814
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:46,640
you talk about
 

3815
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,950
you talk about
the experience of of being in

3816
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:48,960
the experience of of being in
 

3817
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,549
the experience of of being in
relationship to yourself or talking to

3818
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:50,559
relationship to yourself or talking to
 

3819
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:52,069
relationship to yourself or talking to
yourself you know giving yourself a pep

3820
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:52,079
yourself you know giving yourself a pep
 

3821
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,390
yourself you know giving yourself a pep

01:06:57,829 --> 01:06:57,839
does it work
 

3829
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,270
does it work
if you're the one giving the pep talk

3830
01:06:59,270 --> 01:06:59,280
if you're the one giving the pep talk

for the keys right so that duality is
 

3849
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,349
for the keys right so that duality is
weird but

3850
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:15,359
weird but
 

3851
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,710
weird but
leave that aside there's

01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
and then you then you then you notice
 

3893
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,549
and then you then you then you notice
you're thinking and you're not paying

3894
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:54,559
you're thinking and you're not paying
 

3895
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:55,910
you're thinking and you're not paying
attention to the breath anymore and then

3896
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:55,920
attention to the breath anymore and then
 

3897
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:56,470
attention to the breath anymore and then
you

3898
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
you
 

3899
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,910
you
then you realize okay the practice is

3900
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
then you realize okay the practice is
 

3901
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,990
then you realize okay the practice is
okay i should notice thoughts and then i

3902
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:00,000
okay i should notice thoughts and then i
 

3903
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,910
okay i should notice thoughts and then i
should come back to the breath

3904
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
should come back to the breath
 

3905
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,589
should come back to the breath
but this starting point is the of the

3906
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,599
but this starting point is the of the
 

3907
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,029
but this starting point is the of the
conventional starting point of feeling

3908
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
conventional starting point of feeling
 

3909
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,150
conventional starting point of feeling
like you're an agent

3910
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:08,160
like you're an agent
 

3911
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,870
like you're an agent
very likely in your head a locus of

very likely in your head a locus of
 

3913
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,870
very likely in your head a locus of
consciousness a locus of attention

3914
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:12,880
consciousness a locus of attention
 

3915
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,910
consciousness a locus of attention
that can strategically pay attention to

3916
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:15,920
that can strategically pay attention to
 

3917
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,510
that can strategically pay attention to
certain parts of experience like i can

3918
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:17,520
certain parts of experience like i can
 

3919
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,709
certain parts of experience like i can
focus on the breath

3920
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:18,719
focus on the breath
 

3921
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,789
focus on the breath
and then i get lost in thought and now i

3922
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:20,799
and then i get lost in thought and now i
 

3923
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,229
and then i get lost in thought and now i
can come back to the breath

3924
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:22,239
can come back to the breath
 

3925
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:23,990
can come back to the breath
and i can open my eyes and i can i'm

3926
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:24,000
and i can open my eyes and i can i'm

object perception
 

3935
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,229
object perception
and that is the default starting point

3936
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:34,239
and that is the default starting point
 

3937
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:36,870
and that is the default starting point
of selfhood of subjectivity

3938
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:36,880
of selfhood of subjectivity
 

3939
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,229
of selfhood of subjectivity
and married to that

3940
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:40,239
and married to that
 

3941
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:44,470
and married to that
is the sense that i can decide

01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:44,480
is the sense that i can decide
 

3943
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:47,829
is the sense that i can decide
what to do next right i am i am an agent

that kind of free agent but
 

3985
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:28,309
that kind of free agent but
at least i can decide what i'm going to

at least i can decide what i'm going to

this water right
and there's a feeling of identification

3994
01:09:36,789 --> 01:09:36,799
and there's a feeling of identification
 

3995
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,749
and there's a feeling of identification
with the impulse with the intention with

with the feeling of speaking like you
 

4001

know what am i what am i going to say
 

4003
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,669
know what am i what am i going to say
next well i'm saying it so here goes

4004
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
next well i'm saying it so here goes
 

4005
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,070
next well i'm saying it so here goes
this is me i it feels like i'm the

4006
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:50,080
this is me i it feels like i'm the
 

4007
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,030
this is me i it feels like i'm the
thinker i'm the

4008
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:51,040
thinker i'm the
 

4009
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,630
thinker i'm the
i'm the one who's in control

4010
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:54,640
i'm the one who's in control
 

4011
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,910
i'm the one who's in control
but all of that is born of not really

4012
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:57,920
but all of that is born of not really
 

4013
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,910
but all of that is born of not really
paying close attention

4014
01:09:59,910 --> 01:09:59,920
paying close attention
 

4015
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,390
paying close attention
to what it's like to be you and and so

4016
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:02,400
to what it's like to be you and and so
 

4017
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,590
to what it's like to be you and and so
this is

4018
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:03,600
this is
 

4019
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,270
this is
this is where meditation comes in or

4020
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:05,280
this is where meditation comes in or
 

4021
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,709
this is where meditation comes in or
this is where um

4022
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
this is where um
 

4023
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,149
this is where um
again you can get you can get at this

4024
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:08,159
again you can get you can get at this
 

4025
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,830
again you can get you can get at this
conceptually

4026
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:09,840
conceptually
 

4027
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:11,669
conceptually
you can unravel the notion of free will

4028
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:11,679
you can unravel the notion of free will
 

4029
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,430
you can unravel the notion of free will
just by by

4030
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:13,440
just by by
 

4031
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,750
just by by
thinking certain certain thoughts but

4032
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:15,760
thinking certain certain thoughts but
 

4033
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,550
thinking certain certain thoughts but
you can't

4034
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:16,560
you can't
 

4035
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,189
you can't
feel that it doesn't exist unless you

4036
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:19,199
feel that it doesn't exist unless you
 

4037
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:19,750
feel that it doesn't exist unless you
can pay

4038
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:19,760
can pay
 

4039
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,669
can pay
close attention to how thoughts and

4040
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:21,679
close attention to how thoughts and
 

4041
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:22,790
close attention to how thoughts and
intentions arise

4042
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800
intentions arise
 

4043
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,550
intentions arise
so the way to unravel it conceptually is

4044
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:24,560
so the way to unravel it conceptually is
 

4045
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,149
so the way to unravel it conceptually is
just to realize okay

4046
01:10:26,149 --> 01:10:26,159
just to realize okay
 

4047
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,830
just to realize okay
i didn't make myself i didn't make my

4048
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:27,840
i didn't make myself i didn't make my
 

4049
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:29,430
i didn't make myself i didn't make my

going to add something magical to that

clockwork like an immortal soul
you can also notice that you didn't

01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:19,840
you can also notice that you didn't
 

4097
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,910
you can also notice that you didn't
produce your soul rightly you you can't

produce your soul rightly you you can't

produce your soul rightly you you can't
account for the fact that you don't have

know or

01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,910
know or
was a psychopath or was either you had

01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:33,920
was a psychopath or was either you had
 

4115
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,110
was a psychopath or was either you had
an iq of 40 or like there's nothing

4116
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,120
an iq of 40 or like there's nothing
 

4117
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,830
an iq of 40 or like there's nothing
nothing about that that the person who

4118
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:39,840
nothing about that that the person who
 

4119
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,709
nothing about that that the person who
believes in us

4120
01:11:40,709 --> 01:11:40,719
believes in us
 

4121
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,189
believes in us
in a soul can claim to have controlled

4122
01:11:43,189 --> 01:11:43,199
in a soul can claim to have controlled
 

4123
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:44,310
in a soul can claim to have controlled
and yet that is

4124
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:44,320
and yet that is
 

4125
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,030
and yet that is
also totally dispositive of whatever

4126
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,040
also totally dispositive of whatever
 

4127
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,070
also totally dispositive of whatever
happens next

01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:48,080
happens next
 

4129
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,030
happens next
and but everything you've described now

01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:51,040
and but everything you've described now
 

4131
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,470
and but everything you've described now
maybe you can correct me but it kind of

4132
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
maybe you can correct me but it kind of
 

4133
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,070
maybe you can correct me but it kind of
speaks to the materialistic

4134
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:54,080
speaks to the materialistic
 

4135
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,270
speaks to the materialistic
nature of the hardware

4136
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:57,280
nature of the hardware
 

4137
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,229
nature of the hardware
but even if you add magical ectoplasm

4138
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:00,239
but even if you add magical ectoplasm

you didn't you didn't produce that

you didn't you didn't produce that
either i i know but

either i i know but

either i i know but
if we can think about the actual

if we can think about the actual

computation
 

4149
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,229
computation
running on the hardware and running on

4150
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:10,239
running on the hardware and running on
 

4151
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,750
running on the hardware and running on
the software there's something you said

4152
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
the software there's something you said
 

4153
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,630
the software there's something you said
recently

4154
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:12,640
recently
 

4155
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,669
recently
which you think of um culture as an

4156
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:15,679
which you think of um culture as an
 

4157
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,110
which you think of um culture as an
operating system

4158
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:17,120
operating system
 

4159
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,470
operating system
so if we just remove ourselves a little

4160
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,480
so if we just remove ourselves a little
 

4161
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,030
so if we just remove ourselves a little
bit

4162
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
bit
 

4163
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,350
bit
from the conception of human

4164
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:23,360
from the conception of human
 

4165
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,030
from the conception of human
civilization being a collection of

civilization being a collection of

4169
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,189
humans
and rather us just being a distributed

01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
and rather us just being a distributed
 

4171
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,070
and rather us just being a distributed
uh computation system on which there's

4172
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,080
uh computation system on which there's
 

4173
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,990
uh computation system on which there's
some kind of operating system running

4174
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,000
some kind of operating system running
 

4175
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,390
some kind of operating system running
and then the computation that's running

4176
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:36,400
and then the computation that's running
 

4177
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,790
and then the computation that's running
is the actual thing that generates

4178
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
is the actual thing that generates
 

4179
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,630
is the actual thing that generates
the interactions the communications and

4180
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:40,640
the interactions the communications and
 

4181
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,870
the interactions the communications and
maybe even free will the experiences of

4182
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:42,880
maybe even free will the experiences of
 

4183
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,149
maybe even free will the experiences of
all those free will

4184
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:44,159
all those free will
 

4185
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:46,149
all those free will
do you ever think of do you ever try to

4186
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:46,159
do you ever think of do you ever try to
 

4187
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,149
do you ever think of do you ever try to
reframe the world in that way where it's

4188
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
reframe the world in that way where it's
 

4189
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:48,950
reframe the world in that way where it's
like

4190
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:48,960
like
 

4191
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,470
like
ideas are just using us thoughts

4192
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:52,480
ideas are just using us thoughts
 

4193
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,390
ideas are just using us thoughts
are using individual nodes in the system

4194
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
are using individual nodes in the system
 

4195
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,310
are using individual nodes in the system
and they're just jumping around and they

4196
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:58,320
and they're just jumping around and they
 

4197
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,149
and they're just jumping around and they
also have ability to generate like

4198
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:00,159
also have ability to generate like
 

4199
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,350
also have ability to generate like
experiences

4200
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:01,360
experiences
 

4201
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,430
experiences
so that we can push those ideas along

4202
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
so that we can push those ideas along
 

4203
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,390
so that we can push those ideas along
and basically

4204
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
and basically
 

4205
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,870
and basically
the main organisms here are the thoughts

4206
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:06,880
the main organisms here are the thoughts
 

4207
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,030
the main organisms here are the thoughts
not the humans

4208
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
not the humans
 

4209
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,750
not the humans
yeah but then that erodes the boundary

4210
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:11,760
yeah but then that erodes the boundary
 

4211
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,709
yeah but then that erodes the boundary
between

4212
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
between
 

4213

yeah and i mean like we're all kind of
 

4231
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,189
yeah and i mean like we're all kind of
like like currents like eddies in in

4232
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:33,199
like like currents like eddies in in
 

4233
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:36,229
like like currents like eddies in in
in this river of of ideas right so

4234
01:13:36,229 --> 01:13:36,239
in this river of of ideas right so
 

4235
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,669
in this river of of ideas right so
it's like um and it seems to have

4236
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:39,679
it's like um and it seems to have
 

4237
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:40,630
it's like um and it seems to have
structure

4238
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:40,640
structure
 

4239
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,709
structure
but there's no real boundary between

4240
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
but there's no real boundary between
 

4241

and the rest i mean if our and i would

4244
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:46,640
and the rest i mean if our and i would
 

4245
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,470
and the rest i mean if our and i would
say that much of our mind answers to

01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,070
say that much of our mind answers to
this kind of description i mean

01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:50,080
this kind of description i mean
 

4249
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,120
this kind of description i mean
so much of our mind has been

4250

4374
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
would be
 

4375
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,830
would be
horrified to be served dog

4376
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:03,840

 

4377
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,110

those are not norms that we're

4378
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:07,120
those are not norms that we're
 

4379
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,910
those are not norms that we're
they are outside of us in some way and

4380
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:09,920
they are outside of us in some way and
 

4381
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:10,550
they are outside of us in some way and
they're

4382
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:10,560
they're
 

4383
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,350
they're
yet they're they're felt very viscerally

4384
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:13,360
yet they're they're felt very viscerally
 

4385
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:13,990
yet they're they're felt very viscerally
i mean they're

4386
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,000
i mean they're
 

4387
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,070
i mean they're
certainly felt in their violation you

4388
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
certainly felt in their violation you
 

4389
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,030
certainly felt in their violation you
know if you're if you

4390
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
know if you're if you
 

4391
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,070
know if you're if you
are just imagine you're you're in

4392
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:20,080
are just imagine you're you're in
 

4393
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,149
are just imagine you're you're in
somebody's home you're eating something

4394
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
somebody's home you're eating something
 

4395
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:23,750
somebody's home you're eating something
that tastes great to you

4396
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:23,760
that tastes great to you
 

4397
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,350
that tastes great to you
and you happen to be in vietnam or

4398
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:25,360
and you happen to be in vietnam or
 

4399
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,950
and you happen to be in vietnam or
wherever you know you you

4400
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:26,960
wherever you know you you
 

4401
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,630
wherever you know you you
didn't realize dog was potentially on

4402
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:28,640
didn't realize dog was potentially on
 

4403
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,229
didn't realize dog was potentially on
the menu and

4404
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:30,239
the menu and
 

4405
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:33,030
the menu and
you find out that you've just eaten 10

4406
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:33,040
you find out that you've just eaten 10
 

4407
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,390
you find out that you've just eaten 10
bites of what

4408
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
bites of what
 

4409
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,270
bites of what
is uh you know really a cocker spaniel

4410
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:37,280
is uh you know really a cocker spaniel
 

4411
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,030
is uh you know really a cocker spaniel
and

4412
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:39,040
and
 

4413
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,750
and
you feel this instantaneous urge to

4414
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:41,760
you feel this instantaneous urge to
 

4415
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,470
you feel this instantaneous urge to
vomit

4416
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
vomit
 

4417
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,430
vomit
right based on an idea right like so

4418
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:45,440
right based on an idea right like so
 

4419
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,030
right based on an idea right like so
like you did not

4420
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:47,040
like you did not
 

4421
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:51,030
like you did not
you're not the author of that norm

4422
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,040
you're not the author of that norm
 

4423
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,310
you're not the author of that norm
that gave you such a powerful experience

4424
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:54,320
that gave you such a powerful experience
 

4425
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:55,590
that gave you such a powerful experience
of its violation

4426
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:55,600
of its violation
 

4427
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,630
of its violation
and i'm sure we can trace the moment in

4428
01:16:58,630 --> 01:16:58,640
and i'm sure we can trace the moment in
 

4429
01:16:58,640 --> 01:16:59,510
and i'm sure we can trace the moment in
your history

4430
01:16:59,510 --> 01:16:59,520
your history
 

4431
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,189
your history
you know vaguely where it sort of got in

4432
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:01,199
you know vaguely where it sort of got in
 

4433
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,510
you know vaguely where it sort of got in
i mean very early on as kids you you

4434
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:03,520
i mean very early on as kids you you
 

4435
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,390
i mean very early on as kids you you
realize you're

4436
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:04,400
realize you're
 

4437
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,310
realize you're
you're treating dogs as pets and not as

4438
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:06,320
you're treating dogs as pets and not as
 

4439
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,390
you're treating dogs as pets and not as
food or as potential food

4440
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:10,400

 

4441
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,430

but yeah no it's but

4442
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
but yeah no it's but
 

4443
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,470
but yeah no it's but
the point you just made opens us

4444
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:16,480
the point you just made opens us
 

4445
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:19,510
the point you just made opens us
to like we are totally permeable to a

4446
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:19,520
to like we are totally permeable to a
 

4447
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,709
to like we are totally permeable to a
sea of mind yeah but

4448
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
sea of mind yeah but
 

4449
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,630
sea of mind yeah but
if we uh take the metaphor of the

4450
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:24,640
if we uh take the metaphor of the
 

4451
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,149
if we uh take the metaphor of the
distributed computing systems

4452
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:26,159
distributed computing systems
 

4453
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:29,750
distributed computing systems
each individual node is

4454
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:29,760
each individual node is
 

4455
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,430
each individual node is
is part of performing a much larger

4456
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:31,440
is part of performing a much larger
 

4457
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,790
is part of performing a much larger
computation

4458
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
computation
 

4459
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,430
computation
but nevertheless is in charge of doing

4460
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:35,440
but nevertheless is in charge of doing
 

4461
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,390
but nevertheless is in charge of doing
the scheduling

4462
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:36,400
the scheduling
 

4463
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:39,510
the scheduling
of uh so assuming it's linux is doing

4464
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:39,520
of uh so assuming it's linux is doing
 

4465
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,430
of uh so assuming it's linux is doing
the scheduling of processes and it's

4466
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
the scheduling of processes and it's
 

4467
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,270
the scheduling of processes and it's
constantly alternating them that node is

4468
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:43,280
constantly alternating them that node is
 

4469
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,189
constantly alternating them that node is
making those uh

4470
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:45,199
making those uh
 

4471
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,510
making those uh
choices that node sure as hell believes

4472
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
choices that node sure as hell believes
 

4473
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,189
choices that node sure as hell believes
it has free will

4474
01:17:49,189 --> 01:17:49,199
it has free will
 

4475
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,350
it has free will
and actually has free will because it's

4476
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:51,360
and actually has free will because it's
 

4477
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,030
and actually has free will because it's
making those hard choices

4478
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:53,040
making those hard choices
 

4479
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,950
making those hard choices
but the choices ultimately are part of

4480
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:54,960
but the choices ultimately are part of
 

4481
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,630
but the choices ultimately are part of
much larger computation that it can't

4482
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
much larger computation that it can't
 

4483
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,270
much larger computation that it can't
control

4484
01:17:57,270 --> 01:17:57,280
control
 

4485
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,270
control
isn't it possible for that node to still

4486
01:17:59,270 --> 01:17:59,280
isn't it possible for that node to still
 

4487
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,510
isn't it possible for that node to still
be that human node

4488
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:01,520
be that human node
 

4489
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,550
be that human node
uh is still making the choice well

4490
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
uh is still making the choice well
 

4491
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,790
uh is still making the choice well
it is so i'm not saying that your body

4492
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
it is so i'm not saying that your body
 

4493
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,669
it is so i'm not saying that your body
isn't doing really doing things right

4494
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:11,679
isn't doing really doing things right
 

4495
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:12,550
isn't doing really doing things right
and

4496
01:18:12,550 --> 01:18:12,560
and
 

4497
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,990
and
some of those things can be

4498
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,000
some of those things can be
 

4499
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,070
some of those things can be
conventionally thought of as choices

4500
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,080
conventionally thought of as choices
 

4501
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,790
conventionally thought of as choices
right so it's like i can i can choose to

4502
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:18,800
right so it's like i can i can choose to
 

4503
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,430
right so it's like i can i can choose to
reach and

4504
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,440
reach and
 

4505
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,510
reach and
it's like it's not being imposed on me

4506
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:21,520
it's like it's not being imposed on me
 

4507
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,630
it's like it's not being imposed on me
that would be a different experience

4508
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:22,640
that would be a different experience
 

4509
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,149
that would be a different experience
like so there's a

4510
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
like so there's a
 

4511
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,790
like so there's a
there's an experience of of all you know

4512
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:26,800
there's an experience of of all you know
 

4513
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,830
there's an experience of of all you know
there's there's definitely a difference

4514
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:27,840
there's there's definitely a difference
 

4515
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,790
there's there's definitely a difference
between voluntary and involuntary action

4516
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:30,800
between voluntary and involuntary action
 

4517
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:33,350
between voluntary and involuntary action
there's uh so we that has to get

4518
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:33,360
there's uh so we that has to get
 

4519
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,110
there's uh so we that has to get
conserved by any account of the mind

4520
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:35,120
conserved by any account of the mind
 

4521
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,790
conserved by any account of the mind
that that jettison's free will you still

4522
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:36,800
that that jettison's free will you still
 

4523
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,470
that that jettison's free will you still
have to admit that that

4524
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:38,480
have to admit that that
 

4525
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,950
have to admit that that
there's a difference between a tremor

4526
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:40,960
there's a difference between a tremor
 

4527
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,870
there's a difference between a tremor
that i can't control

4528
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:42,880
that i can't control
 

4529
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,790
that i can't control
and a a purposeful motor action that i

4530
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:46,800
and a a purposeful motor action that i
 

4531
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,030
and a a purposeful motor action that i
can control and i can initiate on demand

4532
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,040
can control and i can initiate on demand
 

4533
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,189
can control and i can initiate on demand
and it's associated with intentions

4534
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:51,199

let me ask you
it this way if you're wrong about your

if you're gonna believe in ghosts right
 

4803
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,750
if you're gonna believe in ghosts right
i understand what that claim could be

4804
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:37,760
i understand what that claim could be
 

4805
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,430
i understand what that claim could be
or like i you know i don't happen to

4806
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:39,440
or like i you know i don't happen to
 

4807
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,189
or like i you know i don't happen to
believe in ghosts but

4808
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:41,199
believe in ghosts but
 

4809
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:44,229
believe in ghosts but
if it's it's not hard for me to specify

4810
01:23:44,229 --> 01:23:44,239
if it's it's not hard for me to specify
 

4811
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:46,070
if it's it's not hard for me to specify
what would have to be true for ghosts to

4812
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:46,080
what would have to be true for ghosts to
 

4813
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,189
what would have to be true for ghosts to
be real

4814

be real

and so it is with a thousand other
 

4817
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,870
and so it is with a thousand other
things like ghosts right so like

01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:50,880
things like ghosts right so like

01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,149
things like ghosts right so like
okay so you're telling me that when

okay so you're telling me that when

01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,669
consciousness
are actually able to be authors of our

5018
01:27:23,669 --> 01:27:23,679
are actually able to be authors of our
 

5019
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,510
are actually able to be authors of our
actions

5020
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:25,520
actions
 

5021
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,669
actions
it is a it's a non-starter for me

5022
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:27,679
it is a it's a non-starter for me
 

5023
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:29,350
it is a it's a non-starter for me
conceptually

5024
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:29,360
conceptually
 

5025
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,950
conceptually
it's a little bit like saying

5026
01:27:32,950 --> 01:27:32,960
it's a little bit like saying
 

5027
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:34,550
it's a little bit like saying
could there be some breakthrough that

5028
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
could there be some breakthrough that
 

5029
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,669
could there be some breakthrough that
will cause us to realize that

5030
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:37,679
will cause us to realize that
 

5031
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:40,709
will cause us to realize that
circles are really square or the circles

5032
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:40,719
circles are really square or the circles
 

5033
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,470
circles are really square or the circles
are not really round

5034
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:42,480
are not really round
 

5035
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,669
are not really round
right no a circle is what we mean

5036
01:27:45,669 --> 01:27:45,679
right no a circle is what we mean
 

5037
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:47,990
right no a circle is what we mean
by a perfectly round form right like

5038
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:48,000
by a perfectly round form right like
 

5039
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:48,870
by a perfectly round form right like
it's it's it's

5040
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:48,880
it's it's it's
 

5041
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,669
it's it's it's
it it's not it's not on the table to be

5042
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:51,679
it it's not it's not on the table to be
 

5043
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,189
it it's not it's not on the table to be
revised and

5044
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:53,199
revised and
 

5045
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:54,070
revised and
so i would say the same thing about

5046
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:54,080
so i would say the same thing about
 

5047
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,550
so i would say the same thing about
consciousness so it's just like saying

5048
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:56,560
consciousness so it's just like saying
 

5049
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:59,270
consciousness so it's just like saying
is there some breakthrough that would

5050
01:27:59,270 --> 01:27:59,280
is there some breakthrough that would
 

5051
01:27:59,280 --> 01:27:59,990
is there some breakthrough that would
get us to realize

5052
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:00,000
get us to realize
 

5053
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,470
get us to realize
that consciousness is really an illusion

5054
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:02,480
that consciousness is really an illusion
 

5055
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,110
that consciousness is really an illusion
i'm saying

5056
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,120
i'm saying
 

5057
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,750
i'm saying
no because what the experience of an

5058
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:05,760
no because what the experience of an
 

5059
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,470
no because what the experience of an
illusion

5060
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:06,480
illusion
 

5061
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,149
illusion
is as much a demonstration of what i'm

5062
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,159
is as much a demonstration of what i'm
 

5063
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,590
is as much a demonstration of what i'm
calling consciousness as anything else

5064
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:09,600
calling consciousness as anything else
 

5065
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,750
calling consciousness as anything else
right like that that is consciousness

5066
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,760
right like that that is consciousness
 

5067
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,270
right like that that is consciousness
um with free will it's a similar problem

5068
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:15,280
um with free will it's a similar problem
 

5069
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,830
um with free will it's a similar problem
it's like um

5070
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:19,840

 

5071
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,750

again it comes down to a picture of

5072
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:21,760
again it comes down to a picture of
 

5073
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,229
again it comes down to a picture of
causality and there's just there's no

5074
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:24,239
causality and there's just there's no
 

5075
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:27,110
causality and there's just there's no
there's no other picture on offer and

5076
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:27,120
there's no other picture on offer and
 

5077
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,990
there's no other picture on offer and
what's more

5078
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:30,000

 

5079
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,910

i know i know what it's like on the

5080
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:31,920
i know i know what it's like on the
 

5081
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,149
i know i know what it's like on the
experiential side

5082
01:28:34,149 --> 01:28:34,159
experiential side
 

5083
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:37,910
experiential side
to lose the thing to which it is clearly

5084
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:37,920
to lose the thing to which it is clearly
 

5085
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:38,709
to lose the thing to which it is clearly
anchored

5086
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:38,719
anchored
 

5087
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:41,510
anchored
right like the feel like it doesn't feel

5088
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:41,520
right like the feel like it doesn't feel
 

5089
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:42,550
right like the feel like it doesn't feel
and this is and this is the question

5090
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:42,560
and this is and this is the question
 

5091
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,669
and this is and this is the question
that almost nobody asked

5092
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:43,679
that almost nobody asked
 

5093
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,430
that almost nobody asked
people who are debating me on on the

5094
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:45,440
people who are debating me on on the
 

5095
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,750
people who are debating me on on the
topic of free will

5096
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:47,760

that i don't feel this thing and they
 

5103
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,070
that i don't feel this thing and they
are never become interested in

meditation are you
 

5143
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,070
meditation are you
literally able to load that into your

5144
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:40,080
literally able to load that into your
 

5145

it's not it's not absolutely continuous
 

5153
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,669
it's not it's not absolutely continuous
but it's whenever i pay attention it's

5154

but it's whenever i pay attention it's
 

5155
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:51,990
but it's whenever i pay attention it's
like

5156
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:52,000
like
 

5157
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,510
like
it's the same and i would say the same

01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:55,920
thing for the the illusoriness of the
 

5161
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,350
thing for the the illusoriness of the
self in the sen and again we

5162
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:57,360
self in the sen and again we
 

5163
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,110
self in the sen and again we
we haven't talked about this so can you

5164
01:29:59,110 --> 01:29:59,120
we haven't talked about this so can you

01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:01,920
free will never mind
 

5169
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:03,510
free will never mind

i'll be thinking about like that was the
 

5659
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:22,950
i'll be thinking about like that was the
dumbest thing

5660
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:22,960

so like that but that somehow creates a

5666
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:29,280
so like that but that somehow creates a
 

5667
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,189
so like that but that somehow creates a
richer experience for me like i've

mr psychologically and ethically all of
 

5689
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:55,109
mr psychologically and ethically all of
this is very interesting

5690
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:55,119
this is very interesting
 

5691
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,270
this is very interesting
so i don't think we ever we should ever

5692
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:57,280
so i don't think we ever we should ever

in the sense that hatred is this
 

5701
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:06,790
in the sense that hatred is this
enduring state

5702
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:06,800

01:39:16,149 --> 01:39:16,159
and ultimately useless right like it
 

5711
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:18,470
and ultimately useless right like it
becomes it becomes self

5712

again there's this sort of dark star of

01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:44,560
again there's this sort of dark star of
 

6307
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:46,310
again there's this sort of dark star of
self-absorption

6308
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:46,320
self-absorption
 

6309
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:49,350
self-absorption
that pulls everything into it right and

6310
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:49,360
that pulls everything into it right and
 

6311
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,149
that pulls everything into it right and
it's like if if that that's the that's

6312
01:49:52,149 --> 01:49:52,159
it's like if if that that's the that's
 

6313
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:52,870
it's like if if that that's the that's
the algorithm

6314
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:52,880
the algorithm
 

6315
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,550
the algorithm
that's the algorithm you don't want to

6316
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:54,560
that's the algorithm you don't want to
 

6317
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,390
that's the algorithm you don't want to
run so it's like you just want

6318
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:56,400
run so it's like you just want
 

6319

failed dress rehearsal for something far

7094
02:03:36,390 --> 02:03:36,400
failed dress rehearsal for something far
 

7095
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:36,870
failed dress rehearsal for something far
worse

7096
02:03:36,870 --> 02:03:36,880
worse
 

7097
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:39,910
worse
right covet is just about as benign as

7098
02:03:39,910 --> 02:03:39,920
right covet is just about as benign as
 

7099
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,430
right covet is just about as benign as
it could have been

7100
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:41,440
it could have been
 

7101
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:44,550
it could have been
and still have been worse than the flu

7102
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:44,560
and still have been worse than the flu
 

7103
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,589
and still have been worse than the flu
when you're talking about a global

7104
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
when you're talking about a global
 

7105
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:48,069
when you're talking about a global
pandemic right it's just it's

7106
02:03:48,069 --> 02:03:48,079
pandemic right it's just it's
 

7107
02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:50,550
pandemic right it's just it's
you know it's going to kill a few

7108
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:50,560
you know it's going to kill a few
 

7109
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:51,430
you know it's going to kill a few
million people

7110
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:51,440
million people
 

7111
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:52,790
million people
or it looks like it's killed about three

7112
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:52,800
or it looks like it's killed about three
 

7113
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:54,950
or it looks like it's killed about three
million people maybe it'll kill

7114
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:54,960
million people maybe it'll kill
 

7115
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:57,510
million people maybe it'll kill
a few million more unless something gets

7116
02:03:57,510 --> 02:03:57,520
a few million more unless something gets
 

7117
02:03:57,520 --> 02:03:58,629
a few million more unless something gets
away from us with a

02:03:58,629 --> 02:03:58,639
away from us with a
 

7119
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:01,109
away from us with a
variant that's that's much worse or we

7120
02:04:01,109 --> 02:04:01,119
variant that's that's much worse or we
 

7121
02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:02,790
variant that's that's much worse or we
really don't play our cards right but

7122
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:02,800
really don't play our cards right but
 

7123
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:07,189
really don't play our cards right but
um i mean the general shape of it is

7124
02:04:07,189 --> 02:04:07,199
um i mean the general shape of it is
 

7125
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:10,069
um i mean the general shape of it is
it's got you know somewhere around well

7126
02:04:10,069 --> 02:04:10,079
it's got you know somewhere around well

it's not uh what

it's not uh what

02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:28,950
people
uh and it's stranger still there are

02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:28,960
uh and it's stranger still there are
 

7201
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:30,229
uh and it's stranger still there are
people who

people who
 

7203
02:05:30,239 --> 02:05:33,270
people who
will acknowledge that covet is real and

7204
02:05:33,270 --> 02:05:33,280
will acknowledge that covet is real and
 

7205
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:35,109
will acknowledge that covet is real and
they'll look the they don't think the

7206
02:05:35,109 --> 02:05:35,119
they'll look the they don't think the
 

7207
02:05:35,119 --> 02:05:37,589
they'll look the they don't think the
deaths have been faked or mis

7208
02:05:37,589 --> 02:05:37,599
deaths have been faked or mis
 

7209

02:05:42,639 --> 02:05:46,149

but they think that it

02:05:46,149 --> 02:05:46,159
but they think that it
 

7213
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:48,069
but they think that it
that they're far happier the prospect of

7214
02:05:48,069 --> 02:05:48,079
that they're far happier the prospect of
 

7215
02:05:48,079 --> 02:05:49,430
that they're far happier the prospect of
catching covid

catching covid
 

7217
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:52,629
catching covid
than they are of getting vaccinated

7218
02:05:52,629 --> 02:05:52,639
than they are of getting vaccinated
 

7219
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:53,910
than they are of getting vaccinated
for covet right they're not worried

7220
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:53,920
for covet right they're not worried
 

7221
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:55,109
for covet right they're not worried
about covert they're worried about

02:05:55,109 --> 02:05:55,119
about covert they're worried about
 

7223
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:56,950
about covert they're worried about
vaccines for covet right

7224
02:05:56,950 --> 02:05:56,960
vaccines for covet right
 

7225
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:59,350
vaccines for covet right
and the fact that we just can't converge

7226
02:05:59,350 --> 02:05:59,360
and the fact that we just can't converge
 

7227

for
much of our society does not bode well

much of our society does not bode well
 

7257
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:30,870
much of our society does not bode well
when you're talking about solving any

7258
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:30,880
when you're talking about solving any
 

7259
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:32,870
when you're talking about solving any
other problem that may yet kill us but

7260
02:06:32,870 --> 02:06:32,880
other problem that may yet kill us but
 

7261
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:34,470
other problem that may yet kill us but
do you think convergence grows when the

7262
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:34,480
do you think convergence grows when the
 

7263
02:06:34,480 --> 02:06:36,149
do you think convergence grows when the
magnitude is a threat

7264
02:06:36,149 --> 02:06:36,159
magnitude is a threat
 

7265
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:39,350
magnitude is a threat
so it's possible except i feel like we

7266
02:06:39,350 --> 02:06:39,360
so it's possible except i feel like we
 

7267
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:39,669
so it's possible except i feel like we
have

7268
02:06:39,669 --> 02:06:39,679
have
 

7269
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:42,709
have
tipped into because when when the threat

7270
02:06:42,709 --> 02:06:42,719
tipped into because when when the threat
 

7271
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:43,589
tipped into because when when the threat
of covet

7272
02:06:43,589 --> 02:06:43,599
of covet
 

7273
02:06:43,599 --> 02:06:46,390
of covet
looked the most dire right when we had

7274
02:06:46,390 --> 02:06:46,400
looked the most dire right when we had
 

7275
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,709
looked the most dire right when we had
when we were seeing reports from italy

7276
02:06:48,709 --> 02:06:48,719
when we were seeing reports from italy
 

7277
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:50,229
when we were seeing reports from italy
that looked like you know the beginning

7278
02:06:50,229 --> 02:06:50,239
that looked like you know the beginning
 

7279
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:51,669
that looked like you know the beginning
of a zombie movie right because it could

7280
02:06:51,669 --> 02:06:51,679
of a zombie movie right because it could
 

7281
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:52,709
of a zombie movie right because it could
have been much much worse

7282
02:06:52,709 --> 02:06:52,719
have been much much worse
 

7283
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:55,030
have been much much worse
yeah like this is like this is lethal

7284

what's going to go on in new york
 

7311
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,830
what's going to go on in new york
in a mere six days right and now it

kicks off in new york
 

7315
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,550
kicks off in new york
and you got people in the middle of the

7316
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:26,560
and you got people in the middle of the
 

7317
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:29,430
and you got people in the middle of the
country thinking

7318
02:07:29,430 --> 02:07:29,440
country thinking
 

7319
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:31,990
country thinking
it's no factor it's not it's that's just

7320
02:07:31,990 --> 02:07:32,000
it's no factor it's not it's that's just
 

7321
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:32,629
it's no factor it's not it's that's just
big city

7322
02:07:32,629 --> 02:07:32,639
big city
 

7323
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:34,550
big city
those are big city problems or they're

7324
02:07:34,550 --> 02:07:34,560
those are big city problems or they're
 

7325
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:35,910
those are big city problems or they're
faking it or

7326
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:35,920
faking it or
 

7327
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:39,990
faking it or
i mean it just the layer of politics

7328
02:07:39,990 --> 02:07:40,000
i mean it just the layer of politics
 

7329
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,350
i mean it just the layer of politics
has become so dysfunctional for us that

7330
02:07:43,350 --> 02:07:43,360
has become so dysfunctional for us that
 

7331
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:47,510
has become so dysfunctional for us that
even in even in what in the presence of

7332
02:07:47,510 --> 02:07:47,520
even in even in what in the presence of
 

7333
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:49,589
even in even in what in the presence of
a pandemic that looked legitimately

7334
02:07:49,589 --> 02:07:49,599
a pandemic that looked legitimately
 

7335
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:51,109
a pandemic that looked legitimately
scary there in the beginning i mean

7336
02:07:51,109 --> 02:07:51,119
scary there in the beginning i mean
 

7337
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:52,229
scary there in the beginning i mean
it's not to say that it hasn't been

7338
02:07:52,229 --> 02:07:52,239
it's not to say that it hasn't been
 

7339
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:53,589
it's not to say that it hasn't been
devastating for everyone who's been

7340
02:07:53,589 --> 02:07:53,599
devastating for everyone who's been
 

7341
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:55,109
devastating for everyone who's been
directly affected by it and

7342
02:07:55,109 --> 02:07:55,119
directly affected by it and
 

7343
02:07:55,119 --> 02:07:56,709
directly affected by it and
it's not said to say it can't get worse

7344
02:07:56,709 --> 02:07:56,719
it's not said to say it can't get worse
 

7345
02:07:56,719 --> 02:07:58,790
it's not said to say it can't get worse
but here you know for a very long time

7346
02:07:58,790 --> 02:07:58,800
but here you know for a very long time
 

7347
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:00,310
but here you know for a very long time
we have known

7348
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:00,320
we have known
 

7349
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:02,069
we have known
that we were we're in a situation that

7350
02:08:02,069 --> 02:08:02,079
that we were we're in a situation that
 

7351
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:03,589
that we were we're in a situation that
is more benign

7352
02:08:03,589 --> 02:08:03,599
is more benign
 

7353
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:05,990
is more benign
than the what's what seemed like the

7354
02:08:05,990 --> 02:08:06,000
than the what's what seemed like the
 

7355
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,189
than the what's what seemed like the
worst case scenario

7356
02:08:07,189 --> 02:08:07,199
worst case scenario
 

7357
02:08:07,199 --> 02:08:09,270
worst case scenario
as it was kicking off especially in

7358
02:08:09,270 --> 02:08:09,280
as it was kicking off especially in
 

7359
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,229
as it was kicking off especially in
italy

7360
02:08:10,229 --> 02:08:10,239
italy
 

7361
02:08:10,239 --> 02:08:13,350
italy
um and

7362
02:08:13,350 --> 02:08:13,360
um and
 

7363
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:15,830
um and
so still yeah it's quite possible that

7364
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:15,840
so still yeah it's quite possible that
 

7365
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:17,589
so still yeah it's quite possible that
if we saw the asteroid

7366
02:08:17,589 --> 02:08:17,599
if we saw the asteroid
 

7367
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:19,510
if we saw the asteroid
hurtling toward earth and you know

7368
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:19,520
hurtling toward earth and you know
 

7369
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:20,950
hurtling toward earth and you know
everyone agreed that

7370
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:20,960
everyone agreed that
 

7371
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:23,030
everyone agreed that
it's going to it's going to make impact

7372
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:23,040
it's going to it's going to make impact
 

7373
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,030
it's going to it's going to make impact
and we're all going to die

7374
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:25,040
and we're all going to die
 

7375
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:27,750
and we're all going to die
then we could get off twitter and

7376
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:27,760
then we could get off twitter and
 

7377
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:28,390
then we could get off twitter and
actually

7378
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:28,400
actually
 

7379
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:30,310
actually
you know build the the rockets that are

7380
02:08:30,310 --> 02:08:30,320
you know build the the rockets that are
 

7381
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:32,310
you know build the the rockets that are
going to divert the you know divert the

7382
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:32,320
going to divert the you know divert the
 

7383
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:33,910
going to divert the you know divert the
asteroid from its

7384
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:33,920
asteroid from its
 

7385
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:36,550
asteroid from its
earth crossing path and we could do

7386
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:36,560
earth crossing path and we could do
 

7387
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:38,790
earth crossing path and we could do
something pretty heroic but

7388
02:08:38,790 --> 02:08:38,800
something pretty heroic but
 

7389
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:41,750
something pretty heroic but
when you talk about anything else that

7390
02:08:41,750 --> 02:08:41,760
when you talk about anything else that
 

7391
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:43,589
when you talk about anything else that
isn't

7392
02:08:43,589 --> 02:08:43,599
isn't
 

7393
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:47,030
isn't
um that's slower moving than that i mean

7394
02:08:47,030 --> 02:08:47,040
um that's slower moving than that i mean
 

7395
02:08:47,040 --> 02:08:47,830
um that's slower moving than that i mean
something like

7396
02:08:47,830 --> 02:08:47,840
something like
 

7397
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:49,430
something like
climate change i think there's i think

7398
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:49,440
climate change i think there's i think
 

7399
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:51,189
climate change i think there's i think
the prospect of

7400
02:08:51,189 --> 02:08:51,199
the prospect of
 

7401
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:54,310
the prospect of
of our converging

7402
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:54,320
of our converging
 

7403
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:56,390
of our converging
on a solution to climate change purely

7404
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:56,400
on a solution to climate change purely
 

7405
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,790
on a solution to climate change purely
based on political persuasion

7406
02:08:58,790 --> 02:08:58,800
based on political persuasion
 

7407
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,709
based on political persuasion
is non-existent at this point i just

7408
02:09:00,709 --> 02:09:00,719
is non-existent at this point i just
 

7409
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:01,990
is non-existent at this point i just
think that

7410
02:09:01,990 --> 02:09:02,000
think that
 

7411
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,149
think that
i mean you know to bring elon back into

7412
02:09:04,149 --> 02:09:04,159
i mean you know to bring elon back into
 

7413
02:09:04,159 --> 02:09:05,910
i mean you know to bring elon back into
this the way to deal with climate change

7414
02:09:05,910 --> 02:09:05,920
this the way to deal with climate change
 

7415
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:07,030
this the way to deal with climate change

02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:11,360
that we care to prioritize it's not to
 

7581
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:12,310
that we care to prioritize it's not to
say that we

7582
02:12:12,310 --> 02:12:12,320
say that we
 

7583
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:13,750
say that we
will create everything that a human

7584
02:12:13,750 --> 02:12:13,760
will create everything that a human
 

7585
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:15,350
will create everything that a human
could do maybe we'll leave certain

7586
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:15,360
could do maybe we'll leave certain
 

7587
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:16,310
could do maybe we'll leave certain
things out

7588
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:16,320
things out
 

7589
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,870
things out
but anything that we care about and we

7590
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:18,880
but anything that we care about and we
 

7591
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:20,149
but anything that we care about and we
care about a lot

7592
02:12:20,149 --> 02:12:20,159
care about a lot
 

7593
02:12:20,159 --> 02:12:21,510
care about a lot
uh and we certainly care about anything

7594
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:21,520
uh and we certainly care about anything
 

7595
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:23,510
uh and we certainly care about anything
that that produces a lot of

7596
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:23,520
that that produces a lot of
 

7597
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:25,750
that that produces a lot of
power you know that we care about

7598
02:12:25,750 --> 02:12:25,760
power you know that we care about
 

7599
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:27,270
power you know that we care about
scientific insights and

7600
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:27,280
scientific insights and
 

7601
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,910
scientific insights and
and inability to produce new technology

7602
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:29,920
and inability to produce new technology
 

7603
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:31,270
and inability to produce new technology
and all of that

7604
02:12:31,270 --> 02:12:31,280
and all of that
 

7605
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:32,830
and all of that
um we'll have something that's

7606
02:12:32,830 --> 02:12:32,840
um we'll have something that's
 

7607
02:12:32,840 --> 02:12:35,910
um we'll have something that's
superhuman and then that

7608
02:12:35,910 --> 02:12:35,920
superhuman and then that
 

7609
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:39,270
superhuman and then that
the final assumption is just that

7610
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:39,280
the final assumption is just that
 

7611
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:42,629
the final assumption is just that
there have to be ways to do that

7612
02:12:42,629 --> 02:12:42,639
there have to be ways to do that
 

7613
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:45,430
there have to be ways to do that
that are not aligned with a happy

7614
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:45,440
that are not aligned with a happy
 

7615
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:46,470
that are not aligned with a happy
coexistence

7616
02:12:46,470 --> 02:12:46,480
coexistence
 

7617
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:49,510
coexistence
with these now more powerful

7618
02:12:49,510 --> 02:12:49,520
with these now more powerful
 

7619
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:52,069
with these now more powerful
entities than ourselves so and and i

7620
02:12:52,069 --> 02:12:52,079
entities than ourselves so and and i
 

7621
02:12:52,079 --> 02:12:53,350
entities than ourselves so and and i
would

02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:53,360
would
 

7623
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:55,109
would
i would guess and this is a you know

02:12:55,109 --> 02:12:55,119
i would guess and this is a you know
 

7625
02:12:55,119 --> 02:12:57,030
i would guess and this is a you know
kind of a rider to that assumption

7626
02:12:57,030 --> 02:12:57,040
kind of a rider to that assumption
 

7627
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,950
kind of a rider to that assumption
there are probably more ways to do it

7628
02:12:58,950 --> 02:12:58,960
there are probably more ways to do it
 

7629
02:12:58,960 --> 02:13:00,550
there are probably more ways to do it
badly than to do it

7630
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:00,560
badly than to do it
 

7631
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:03,910
badly than to do it
perfectly that is perfectly aligned

7632
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:03,920
perfectly that is perfectly aligned
 

7633
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:07,109
perfectly that is perfectly aligned
with our well-being and

when you think about the consequences of

when you think about you're now
 

7641
02:13:14,239 --> 02:13:16,069
when you think about you're now
in the presence of something that is

02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:16,079
in the presence of something that is
 

7643
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:18,149
in the presence of something that is
more intelligent than you are

7644

more intelligent than you are
 

7645
02:13:18,159 --> 02:13:19,830
more intelligent than you are
right which is to say more competent

7646
02:13:19,830 --> 02:13:19,840
right which is to say more competent

02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:21,990
right which is to say more competent

obviously there are cartoon pictures of

02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:26,069
obviously there are cartoon pictures of

this where we could just you know
 

7653
02:13:26,079 --> 02:13:27,510
this where we could just you know
this is just an off switch we can just

02:13:27,510 --> 02:13:27,520
this is just an off switch we can just
 

7655
02:13:27,520 --> 02:13:28,709
this is just an off switch we can just
turn off the off switch or they're

7656
02:13:28,709 --> 02:13:28,719
turn off the off switch or they're
 

7657
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:30,149
turn off the off switch or they're
tethered to something that that

7658
02:13:30,149 --> 02:13:30,159
tethered to something that that
 

7659
02:13:30,159 --> 02:13:32,950
tethered to something that that
makes them you know are slaves in

makes them you know are slaves in
 

7661
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:34,229
makes them you know are slaves in
perpetuity even though they're more

02:13:34,229 --> 02:13:34,239
perpetuity even though they're more
 

7663
02:13:34,239 --> 02:13:36,069
perpetuity even though they're more
intelligent but

7664
02:13:36,069 --> 02:13:36,079
intelligent but
 

7665
02:13:36,079 --> 02:13:38,149
intelligent but
that that strike those scenarios strike

7666
02:13:38,149 --> 02:13:38,159
that that strike those scenarios strike
 

7667
02:13:38,159 --> 02:13:39,750
that that strike those scenarios strike
me as a failure to imagine

7668
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:39,760
me as a failure to imagine
 

7669
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:41,510
me as a failure to imagine
what is actually entailed by greater

what is actually entailed by greater
 

7671
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:43,109
what is actually entailed by greater
intelligence right so if you imagine

7672
02:13:43,109 --> 02:13:43,119
intelligence right so if you imagine
 

7673
02:13:43,119 --> 02:13:44,310
intelligence right so if you imagine
something that's

7674
02:13:44,310 --> 02:13:44,320
something that's
 

7675
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:46,069
something that's
legitimately more intelligent than you

7676
02:13:46,069 --> 02:13:46,079
legitimately more intelligent than you
 

7677
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:47,669
legitimately more intelligent than you
are

7678
02:13:47,669 --> 02:13:47,679
are
 

7679
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:50,390
are
and you're now in relationship to it

7680
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:50,400
and you're now in relationship to it
 

7681
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:51,189
and you're now in relationship to it
right

7682
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:51,199
right
 

7683
02:13:51,199 --> 02:13:52,709
right
you're in the presence of this thing and

7684
02:13:52,709 --> 02:13:52,719
you're in the presence of this thing and
 

7685
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:54,709
you're in the presence of this thing and
it is autonomous in all kinds of ways

7686
02:13:54,709 --> 02:13:54,719
it is autonomous in all kinds of ways
 

7687
02:13:54,719 --> 02:13:56,149
it is autonomous in all kinds of ways
because it had to be to be more

7688
02:13:56,149 --> 02:13:56,159
because it had to be to be more
 

7689
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:57,270
because it had to be to be more
intelligent than you are i mean you

7690
02:13:57,270 --> 02:13:57,280
intelligent than you are i mean you
 

7691
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:58,229
intelligent than you are i mean you
built it to be

7692
02:13:58,229 --> 02:13:58,239
built it to be
 

7693
02:13:58,239 --> 02:14:01,830
built it to be
to be all of those things

7694
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:01,840
to be all of those things
 

7695
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:03,790
to be all of those things
we just can't find ourselves in a

02:14:03,790 --> 02:14:03,800
we just can't find ourselves in a
 

7697
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,510
we just can't find ourselves in a

02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:08,550
with something more intelligent than we

7731
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:40,390

plan is to figure out how to to tether
them to a utility function that

7744
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:54,320
them to a utility function that
 

7745
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:57,750
them to a utility function that
that has our own estimation

7746
02:14:57,750 --> 02:14:57,760
that has our own estimation
 

7747
02:14:57,760 --> 02:14:59,669
that has our own estimation
of what's going to improve our

7748
02:14:59,669 --> 02:14:59,679
of what's going to improve our
 

7749
02:14:59,679 --> 02:15:01,830
of what's going to improve our
well-being as its

7750
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:01,840
well-being as its
 

7751
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:05,109
well-being as its
master you know reward

7752
02:15:05,109 --> 02:15:05,119
master you know reward
 

7753
02:15:05,119 --> 02:15:06,870
master you know reward
right so it's like that all that this

7754
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:06,880
right so it's like that all that this
 

7755
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:08,629
right so it's like that all that this
this thing can get as intelligent as it

7756
02:15:08,629 --> 02:15:08,639
this thing can get as intelligent as it
 

7757
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:09,910
this thing can get as intelligent as it
can get

7758
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:09,920
can get
 

7759
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:12,390
can get
but it it only ever really wants to

7760
02:15:12,390 --> 02:15:12,400
but it it only ever really wants to
 

7761
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:14,149
but it it only ever really wants to
figure out how to make our lives better

7762
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:14,159
figure out how to make our lives better
 

7763
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:15,910
figure out how to make our lives better
by our own view of better

02:15:15,910 --> 02:15:15,920
by our own view of better
 

7765
02:15:15,920 --> 02:15:17,350
by our own view of better
now not to say there wouldn't be a

now not to say there wouldn't be a

now not to say there wouldn't be a

you know i mean because of all kinds of

things we're not seeing clearly about
 

7773
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:23,430
things we're not seeing clearly about
what

7774
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:23,440
what
 

7775
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:25,430
what
what is better and if we were in the

7776
02:15:25,430 --> 02:15:25,440
what is better and if we were in the
 

7777
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,430
what is better and if we were in the
presence of a genie or an oracle

7778
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:27,440
presence of a genie or an oracle
 

7779
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:29,109
presence of a genie or an oracle
that could really tell us what is better

7780
02:15:29,109 --> 02:15:29,119
that could really tell us what is better
 

7781
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:31,270
that could really tell us what is better
well then we should we presumably would

02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:31,280
well then we should we presumably would
 

7783
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:32,709
well then we should we presumably would
want to hear that and we would modify

want to hear that and we would modify

exponentiation right we noticed this
during covet and we have some very smart

8070
02:20:38,710 --> 02:20:38,720
during covet and we have some very smart
 

8071
02:20:38,720 --> 02:20:39,830
during covet and we have some very smart
people who

8072
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:39,840
people who
 

8073
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:41,910
people who
still couldn't get their minds around

8074
02:20:41,910 --> 02:20:41,920
still couldn't get their minds around
 

8075
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:43,030
still couldn't get their minds around
the fact that

8076
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:43,040
the fact that
 

8077
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:46,150
the fact that
you know an exponential is is really

8078
02:20:46,150 --> 02:20:46,160
you know an exponential is is really
 

8079
02:20:46,160 --> 02:20:47,429
you know an exponential is is really
surprising i mean things double and

8080
02:20:47,429 --> 02:20:47,439
surprising i mean things double and
 

8081
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:49,190
surprising i mean things double and
double and double and double again

8082
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:49,200
double and double and double again
 

8083
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:50,550
double and double and double again
and you don't notice much of anything

8084
02:20:50,550 --> 02:20:50,560
and you don't notice much of anything
 

8085
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,469
and you don't notice much of anything
changes and then the last

8086
02:20:52,469 --> 02:20:52,479
changes and then the last
 

8087
02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:55,429
changes and then the last
you know two stages of doubling swamp

8088
02:20:55,429 --> 02:20:55,439
you know two stages of doubling swamp
 

8089
02:20:55,439 --> 02:20:57,110
you know two stages of doubling swamp
everything right and

8090
02:20:57,110 --> 02:20:57,120
everything right and
 

8091
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:00,870
everything right and
um it just seems like that to assume

8092
02:21:00,870 --> 02:21:00,880
um it just seems like that to assume
 

8093
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:05,670
um it just seems like that to assume
that there isn't a deep analogy between

8094
02:21:05,670 --> 02:21:05,680
that there isn't a deep analogy between
 

8095
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:08,469
that there isn't a deep analogy between
what we're seeing for the more practical

8096
02:21:08,469 --> 02:21:08,479
what we're seeing for the more practical
 

8097
02:21:08,479 --> 02:21:11,270
what we're seeing for the more practical
the tractable problems like chess

8098
02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:11,280
the tractable problems like chess
 

8099
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:13,349
the tractable problems like chess
to other modes of cognition it's like

8100
02:21:13,349 --> 02:21:13,359
to other modes of cognition it's like
 

8101
02:21:13,359 --> 02:21:14,389
to other modes of cognition it's like
once you

8102
02:21:14,389 --> 02:21:14,399
once you
 

8103
02:21:14,399 --> 02:21:16,230
once you
once you crack that problem it seems

8104
02:21:16,230 --> 02:21:16,240
once you crack that problem it seems
 

8105
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:19,590
once you crack that problem it seems
because for the longest time

8106
02:21:19,590 --> 02:21:19,600

 

8107
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:21,030

it was impossible to think we were going

8108
02:21:21,030 --> 02:21:21,040
it was impossible to think we were going
 

8109
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:23,510
it was impossible to think we were going
to make headway on

8110
02:21:23,510 --> 02:21:23,520
to make headway on
 

8111
02:21:23,520 --> 02:21:25,750
to make headway on
in ai you know it's like chest and go

8112
02:21:25,750 --> 02:21:25,760
in ai you know it's like chest and go
 

8113
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:27,429
in ai you know it's like chest and go
was the goal was seen as yeah

8114
02:21:27,429 --> 02:21:27,439
was the goal was seen as yeah
 

8115
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:29,590
was the goal was seen as yeah
goes seemed unattainable even even when

8116
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:29,600
goes seemed unattainable even even when
 

8117
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,510
goes seemed unattainable even even when
chess had been cracked

8118
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:31,520
chess had been cracked
 

8119
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:34,870
chess had been cracked
go seemed unattainable yeah

8120
02:21:34,870 --> 02:21:34,880
go seemed unattainable yeah
 

8121
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:36,469
go seemed unattainable yeah
and actually still russell was behind

8122
02:21:36,469 --> 02:21:36,479
and actually still russell was behind
 

8123
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:37,590
and actually still russell was behind
the people that were saying it's

8124
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:37,600
the people that were saying it's
 

8125
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:38,630
the people that were saying it's
unattainable

8126
02:21:38,630 --> 02:21:38,640
unattainable
 

8127
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:40,950
unattainable
right does it seem like uh you know it's

8128
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:40,960
right does it seem like uh you know it's
 

8129
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:42,469
right does it seem like uh you know it's
uh intractable problem

8130
02:21:42,469 --> 02:21:42,479
uh intractable problem
 

8131
02:21:42,479 --> 02:21:44,389
uh intractable problem
right but there's something different

8132
02:21:44,389 --> 02:21:44,399
right but there's something different
 

8133
02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:45,910
right but there's something different
about the space of

8134
02:21:45,910 --> 02:21:45,920
about the space of
 

8135
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:47,510
about the space of
cognition that's detached from human

8136
02:21:47,510 --> 02:21:47,520
cognition that's detached from human
 

8137
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:49,590
cognition that's detached from human
society which is what chess is

8138
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:49,600
society which is what chess is
 

8139
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:52,630
society which is what chess is
meaning like just thinking having

8140
02:21:52,630 --> 02:21:52,640
meaning like just thinking having
 

8141
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:54,389
meaning like just thinking having
actual exponential impact on the

8142
02:21:54,389 --> 02:21:54,399
actual exponential impact on the
 

8143
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:55,750
actual exponential impact on the
physical world is

02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:55,760
physical world is
 

8145
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:57,670
physical world is
is different i i tend to believe that

8146
02:21:57,670 --> 02:21:57,680
is different i i tend to believe that
 

8147
02:21:57,680 --> 02:22:00,150
is different i i tend to believe that
there's

8148
02:22:00,150 --> 02:22:00,160

 

8149
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:02,550

for ai to get to the point where it's

8150
02:22:02,550 --> 02:22:02,560
for ai to get to the point where it's
 

8151
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:03,590
for ai to get to the point where it's
super intelligent

8152
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:03,600
super intelligent
 

8153
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:05,190
super intelligent
it's going to have to go through the

8154
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:05,200
it's going to have to go through the
 

8155
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:06,630
it's going to have to go through the
funnel of

8156
02:22:06,630 --> 02:22:06,640
funnel of
 

8157
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:08,870
funnel of
society and for that it has to be deeply

8158
02:22:08,870 --> 02:22:08,880
society and for that it has to be deeply
 

8159
02:22:08,880 --> 02:22:11,030
society and for that it has to be deeply
integrated with human beings

8160

integrated with human beings
 

8161
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:13,030
integrated with human beings
and for that it has to be aligned but

8162
02:22:13,030 --> 02:22:13,040
and for that it has to be aligned but
 

8163
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:14,710
and for that it has to be aligned but
you're talking about like actually

8164
02:22:14,710 --> 02:22:14,720
you're talking about like actually
 

8165
02:22:14,720 --> 02:22:16,469
you're talking about like actually
hooking us up to like the neural link

8166
02:22:16,469 --> 02:22:16,479
hooking us up to like the neural link
 

8167
02:22:16,479 --> 02:22:17,830
hooking us up to like the neural link
you know we're going to be

8168
02:22:17,830 --> 02:22:17,840
you know we're going to be
 

8169
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:21,190
you know we're going to be
the brain stem to the

8170
02:22:21,190 --> 02:22:21,200
the brain stem to the
 

8171
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:23,030
the brain stem to the
robot overlords that's a possibility as

8172
02:22:23,030 --> 02:22:23,040
robot overlords that's a possibility as
 

8173
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:25,030
robot overlords that's a possibility as
well but what i mean is

8174
02:22:25,030 --> 02:22:25,040
well but what i mean is
 

8175
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:26,950
well but what i mean is
in order to develop autonomous weapons

8176
02:22:26,950 --> 02:22:26,960
in order to develop autonomous weapons
 

8177
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:28,790
in order to develop autonomous weapons
systems for example

8178
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:28,800
systems for example
 

8179
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:31,429
systems for example
which are highly concerning to me that

8180
02:22:31,429 --> 02:22:31,439
which are highly concerning to me that
 

8181
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:31,990
which are highly concerning to me that
both

8182
02:22:31,990 --> 02:22:32,000
both
 

8183
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,710
both
us and china are participating in now

8184
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:34,720
us and china are participating in now
 

8185
02:22:34,720 --> 02:22:35,030
us and china are participating in now
that

8186
02:22:35,030 --> 02:22:35,040
that
 

8187
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:37,270
that
in order to develop them and for them to

8188
02:22:37,270 --> 02:22:37,280
in order to develop them and for them to
 

8189
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:38,230
in order to develop them and for them to
become

8190
02:22:38,230 --> 02:22:38,240
become
 

8191
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:40,309
become
to have more and more responsibility to

8192
02:22:40,309 --> 02:22:40,319
to have more and more responsibility to
 

8193
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:41,590
to have more and more responsibility to
actually do

8194
02:22:41,590 --> 02:22:41,600
actually do
 

8195
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:44,389
actually do
military military strategic actions

8196
02:22:44,389 --> 02:22:44,399
military military strategic actions
 

8197
02:22:44,399 --> 02:22:47,110
military military strategic actions
they're going to have to be

8198
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:47,120
they're going to have to be
 

8199
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:50,469
they're going to have to be
integrated into human beings

8200
02:22:50,469 --> 02:22:50,479
integrated into human beings
 

8201
02:22:50,479 --> 02:22:51,990
integrated into human beings
doing the strategic action they're going

8202
02:22:51,990 --> 02:22:52,000
doing the strategic action they're going
 

8203
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,670
doing the strategic action they're going
to have to work alongside with each

8204
02:22:53,670 --> 02:22:53,680
to have to work alongside with each
 

8205
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:54,150
to have to work alongside with each
other

8206
02:22:54,150 --> 02:22:54,160
other
 

8207
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:55,429
other
and the way those systems will be

8208
02:22:55,429 --> 02:22:55,439
and the way those systems will be
 

8209
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:57,750
and the way those systems will be
developed will have the natural

8210
02:22:57,750 --> 02:22:57,760
developed will have the natural
 

8211
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:00,790
developed will have the natural
safety like switches that are placed on

8212
02:23:00,790 --> 02:23:00,800
safety like switches that are placed on
 

8213
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:01,190
safety like switches that are placed on
them

8214
02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:01,200
them
 

8215
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:03,349
them
as they develop over time because

8216
02:23:03,349 --> 02:23:03,359
as they develop over time because
 

8217
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:05,270
as they develop over time because
they're going to have to convince humans

8218
02:23:05,270 --> 02:23:05,280
they're going to have to convince humans
 

8219
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:06,389
they're going to have to convince humans
ultimately they're going to have to

8220
02:23:06,389 --> 02:23:06,399
ultimately they're going to have to
 

8221
02:23:06,399 --> 02:23:09,190
ultimately they're going to have to
convince humans that this is safer

8222
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:09,200
convince humans that this is safer
 

8223
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:11,429
convince humans that this is safer
than humans they're going to you know

8224
02:23:11,429 --> 02:23:11,439
than humans they're going to you know
 

8225
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:14,550
than humans they're going to you know
eat well self-driving cars is a good

8226
02:23:14,550 --> 02:23:14,560
eat well self-driving cars is a good
 

8227
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:16,550
eat well self-driving cars is a good
test case right here because like we're

8228
02:23:16,550 --> 02:23:16,560
test case right here because like we're
 

8229
02:23:16,560 --> 02:23:17,990
test case right here because like we're
obviously we're we've made a lot of

8230
02:23:17,990 --> 02:23:18,000
obviously we're we've made a lot of
 

8231
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,510
obviously we're we've made a lot of

8235
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:24,790

what total progress would look like i

8236
02:23:24,790 --> 02:23:24,800
what total progress would look like i
 

8237
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,389
what total progress would look like i
mean it would be amazing and it's

8238
02:23:26,389 --> 02:23:26,399
mean it would be amazing and it's
 

8239
02:23:26,399 --> 02:23:26,950
mean it would be amazing and it's

it's cancelling if in the us 40 000

8242
02:23:29,590 --> 02:23:29,600
it's cancelling if in the us 40 000
 

8243
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:30,070
it's cancelling if in the us 40 000

8244
02:23:30,070 --> 02:23:30,080
deaths
 

8245
02:23:30,080 --> 02:23:32,790
deaths
every year based on ape-driven cars

8246
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:32,800
every year based on ape-driven cars
 

8247
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:33,750
every year based on ape-driven cars
right so we it's

8248
02:23:33,750 --> 02:23:33,760
right so we it's
 

8249
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:35,830
right so we it's
a excruciating problem that we've all

8250
02:23:35,830 --> 02:23:35,840
a excruciating problem that we've all
 

8251
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:37,270
a excruciating problem that we've all
gotten used to because it was no

8252
02:23:37,270 --> 02:23:37,280
gotten used to because it was no
 

8253
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:39,910
gotten used to because it was no
alternative but now that we can dimly

8254
02:23:39,910 --> 02:23:39,920
alternative but now that we can dimly
 

8255
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:42,550
alternative but now that we can dimly
see the prospect of an alternative which

8256
02:23:42,550 --> 02:23:42,560
see the prospect of an alternative which
 

8257
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,950
see the prospect of an alternative which
if it works in a super intelligent

8258
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:44,960
if it works in a super intelligent
 

8259
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:45,750
if it works in a super intelligent
fashion

8260
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:45,760
fashion
 

8261
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:48,309
fashion
maybe we would go down to zero highway

8262
02:23:48,309 --> 02:23:48,319
maybe we would go down to zero highway
 

8263
02:23:48,319 --> 02:23:49,830
maybe we would go down to zero highway
deaths right or you know

8264
02:23:49,830 --> 02:23:49,840
deaths right or you know
 

8265
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:51,110
deaths right or you know
certainly we go down by orders of

8266
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:51,120
certainly we go down by orders of
 

8267
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:53,510
certainly we go down by orders of
magnitude right so maybe we have

8268
02:23:53,510 --> 02:23:53,520
magnitude right so maybe we have
 

8269
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:56,550
magnitude right so maybe we have
you know 400 rather than than 40 000

8270
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:56,560
you know 400 rather than than 40 000
 

8271
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:59,590
you know 400 rather than than 40 000
a year

8272
02:23:59,590 --> 02:23:59,600

 

8273
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:04,150

and it's easy to see that there's not

8274
02:24:04,150 --> 02:24:04,160
and it's easy to see that there's not
 

8275
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:06,550
and it's easy to see that there's not
and a missile so obviously this is not

8276
02:24:06,550 --> 02:24:06,560
and a missile so obviously this is not
 

8277
02:24:06,560 --> 02:24:08,230
and a missile so obviously this is not
an example of super intelligence this is

8278
02:24:08,230 --> 02:24:08,240
an example of super intelligence this is
 

8279
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:09,830
an example of super intelligence this is
narrow intelligence but

8280
02:24:09,830 --> 02:24:09,840
narrow intelligence but
 

8281
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:13,429
narrow intelligence but
um the the alignment problem isn't

8282
02:24:13,429 --> 02:24:13,439
um the the alignment problem isn't
 

8283
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:15,590
um the the alignment problem isn't
so obvious there but there's there are

8284
02:24:15,590 --> 02:24:15,600
so obvious there but there's there are
 

8285
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:17,190
so obvious there but there's there are
potential alignment problems

8286
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:17,200
potential alignment problems
 

8287
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:19,990
potential alignment problems
there like so like just just imagine if

8288
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:20,000
there like so like just just imagine if
 

8289
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:20,870
there like so like just just imagine if
some woke

8290
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:20,880
some woke

02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:24,469
some woke
team of engineers decided that

8292
02:24:24,469 --> 02:24:24,479
team of engineers decided that
 

8293
02:24:24,479 --> 02:24:26,550
team of engineers decided that
we have to tune the algorithm some way i

8294
02:24:26,550 --> 02:24:26,560
we have to tune the algorithm some way i
 

8295
02:24:26,560 --> 02:24:28,469
we have to tune the algorithm some way i
mean there are situations where the car

8296
02:24:28,469 --> 02:24:28,479
mean there are situations where the car
 

8297
02:24:28,479 --> 02:24:29,830
mean there are situations where the car
has to decide who to hit

8298
02:24:29,830 --> 02:24:29,840
has to decide who to hit
 

8299
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:31,910
has to decide who to hit
i mean there's just bad outcomes where

8300
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:31,920
i mean there's just bad outcomes where
 

8301
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:33,190
i mean there's just bad outcomes where
you're going to hit somebody

8302
02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:33,200
you're going to hit somebody
 

8303
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:35,270
you're going to hit somebody
right now we have a car that can tell

8304
02:24:35,270 --> 02:24:35,280
right now we have a car that can tell
 

8305
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:36,469
right now we have a car that can tell
what race you are

8306
02:24:36,469 --> 02:24:36,479
what race you are
 

8307
02:24:36,479 --> 02:24:38,230
what race you are
right so we're going to build the car to

8308
02:24:38,230 --> 02:24:38,240
right so we're going to build the car to
 

8309
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:40,309
right so we're going to build the car to
preferentially hit white people

8310
02:24:40,309 --> 02:24:40,319
preferentially hit white people
 

8311
02:24:40,319 --> 02:24:41,590
preferentially hit white people
because white people have had so much

8312
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:41,600
because white people have had so much
 

8313
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:43,429
because white people have had so much
privilege over the years this

8314
02:24:43,429 --> 02:24:43,439
privilege over the years this
 

8315
02:24:43,439 --> 02:24:45,110
privilege over the years this
seems like the only ethical way to kind

8316
02:24:45,110 --> 02:24:45,120
seems like the only ethical way to kind
 

8317
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:47,110
seems like the only ethical way to kind
of redress those wrongs of the past

8318
02:24:47,110 --> 02:24:47,120
of redress those wrongs of the past
 

8319
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:49,510
of redress those wrongs of the past
that's something that could get one that

8320
02:24:49,510 --> 02:24:49,520
that's something that could get one that
 

8321
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:50,630
that's something that could get one that
could that could

8322
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:50,640
could that could
 

8323
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:53,030
could that could
get produced as an artifact presumably

8324
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:53,040
get produced as an artifact presumably
 

8325
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:54,389
get produced as an artifact presumably
of just how you built it and you didn't

8326
02:24:54,389 --> 02:24:54,399
of just how you built it and you didn't
 

8327
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:55,990
of just how you built it and you didn't
even know you engineered it that way

8328
02:24:55,990 --> 02:24:56,000
even know you engineered it that way
 

8329
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,550
even know you engineered it that way
right you you you cause machine learning

8330
02:24:58,550 --> 02:24:58,560
right you you you cause machine learning
 

8331
02:24:58,560 --> 02:24:59,830
right you you you cause machine learning
yeah you you put some kind of

8332
02:24:59,830 --> 02:24:59,840
yeah you you put some kind of
 

8333
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:01,270
yeah you you put some kind of
constraints on it to where it creates

8334
02:25:01,270 --> 02:25:01,280
constraints on it to where it creates
 

8335
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:02,389
constraints on it to where it creates
those kinds of options you

8336
02:25:02,389 --> 02:25:02,399
those kinds of options you
 

8337
02:25:02,399 --> 02:25:05,030
those kinds of options you
basically built a racist algorithm and

8338
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:05,040
basically built a racist algorithm and
 

8339
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:06,230
basically built a racist algorithm and
you didn't even intend to

8340
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:06,240
you didn't even intend to
 

8341
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:07,990
you didn't even intend to
or you could intend to right and it

8342
02:25:07,990 --> 02:25:08,000
or you could intend to right and it
 

8343
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,190
or you could intend to right and it
would be aligned with some people's

8344
02:25:09,190 --> 02:25:09,200
would be aligned with some people's
 

8345
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,790
would be aligned with some people's
values but misaligned with other

8346
02:25:10,790 --> 02:25:10,800
values but misaligned with other
 

8347
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:13,349
values but misaligned with other
people's values

8348
02:25:13,349 --> 02:25:13,359
people's values
 

8349
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:15,990
people's values
but it's like they're interesting

8350
02:25:15,990 --> 02:25:16,000
but it's like they're interesting
 

8351
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:16,469
but it's like they're interesting
problems

8352
02:25:16,469 --> 02:25:16,479
problems
 

8353
02:25:16,479 --> 02:25:18,070
problems
even with something as simple and

8354
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:18,080
even with something as simple and
 

8355
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:20,550
even with something as simple and
obviously good as self-driving cars but

8356
02:25:20,550 --> 02:25:20,560
obviously good as self-driving cars but
 

8357
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:21,349
obviously good as self-driving cars but
there's a leap

8358
02:25:21,349 --> 02:25:21,359
there's a leap
 

8359
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:23,590
there's a leap
that i just think could be exact but

8360
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:23,600
that i just think could be exact but
 

8361
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:25,190
that i just think could be exact but
those are human problems

8362
02:25:25,190 --> 02:25:25,200
those are human problems
 

8363
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:26,790
those are human problems
i just don't think there'll be a leap

8364
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:26,800
i just don't think there'll be a leap
 

8365
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:29,590
i just don't think there'll be a leap
with autonomous vehicles

8366
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:29,600
with autonomous vehicles
 

8367
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:32,790
with autonomous vehicles
first of all sorry there are

8368
02:25:32,790 --> 02:25:32,800
first of all sorry there are
 

8369
02:25:32,800 --> 02:25:34,630
first of all sorry there are
a lot of trajectories which will destroy

8370
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:34,640
a lot of trajectories which will destroy
 

8371
02:25:34,640 --> 02:25:36,389
a lot of trajectories which will destroy
human civilization the argument i'm

8372
02:25:36,389 --> 02:25:36,399
human civilization the argument i'm
 

8373
02:25:36,399 --> 02:25:37,990
human civilization the argument i'm
making it's more likely

8374
02:25:37,990 --> 02:25:38,000
making it's more likely
 

8375
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,910
making it's more likely
that we'll take trajectories that don't

8376
02:25:39,910 --> 02:25:39,920
that we'll take trajectories that don't
 

8377
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:41,429
that we'll take trajectories that don't
so there i don't think there will be a

8378
02:25:41,429 --> 02:25:41,439
so there i don't think there will be a
 

8379
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:43,349
so there i don't think there will be a
leap with autonomous vehicles will all

8380
02:25:43,349 --> 02:25:43,359
leap with autonomous vehicles will all
 

8381
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:45,990
leap with autonomous vehicles will all
of a sudden start murdering pedestrians

8382
02:25:45,990 --> 02:25:46,000
of a sudden start murdering pedestrians
 

8383
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,389
of a sudden start murdering pedestrians
because once every human on earth is

8384
02:25:48,389 --> 02:25:48,399
because once every human on earth is
 

8385
02:25:48,399 --> 02:25:49,190
because once every human on earth is
dead

8386
02:25:49,190 --> 02:25:49,200
dead
 

8387
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:50,950
dead
there will be no more fatalities sort of

8388
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:50,960
there will be no more fatalities sort of
 

8389
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,790
there will be no more fatalities sort of
unintended consequences of

unintended consequences of
is difficult to take that leap i most

8392
02:25:55,910 --> 02:25:55,920

and this is something that martin reeves
 

8489
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:28,469
and this is something that martin reeves
was

8490

was
 

8491
02:27:28,479 --> 02:27:32,070
was
whinging about before the large hadron

got booted up i think we know there are
 

8497
02:27:36,399 --> 02:27:37,429
got booted up i think we know there are
people who are

8498
02:27:37,429 --> 02:27:37,439
people who are
 

8499
02:27:37,439 --> 02:27:38,870
people who are
entertaining experiments or even

8500
02:27:38,870 --> 02:27:38,880
entertaining experiments or even
 

8501
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,550
entertaining experiments or even
performing experiments where there's

uh that they're going to create a black

8508
02:27:47,910 --> 02:27:47,920
uh that they're going to create a black
 

8509
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:49,590
uh that they're going to create a black
hole in the lab and suck every you know

8510
02:27:49,590 --> 02:27:49,600
hole in the lab and suck every you know
 

8511
02:27:49,600 --> 02:27:51,030
hole in the lab and suck every you know
the whole world into it right like that

8512
02:27:51,030 --> 02:27:51,040
the whole world into it right like that
 

8513
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:52,469
the whole world into it right like that
that's not that's not

02:27:52,469 --> 02:27:52,479
that's not that's not
 

8515
02:27:52,479 --> 02:27:55,110
that's not that's not
you're not a crazy person to worry that

8516
02:27:55,110 --> 02:27:55,120
you're not a crazy person to worry that
 

8517
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:56,309
you're not a crazy person to worry that
i worry about that based on

8518
02:27:56,309 --> 02:27:56,319
i worry about that based on
 

8519
02:27:56,319 --> 02:27:59,030
i worry about that based on
on the physics and so it was with with

8520
02:27:59,030 --> 02:27:59,040
on the physics and so it was with with
 

8521
02:27:59,040 --> 02:27:59,510
on the physics and so it was with with
uh

8522
02:27:59,510 --> 02:27:59,520
uh
 

8523
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:01,750
uh
you know the trinity test there were

8524
02:28:01,750 --> 02:28:01,760
you know the trinity test there were
 

8525
02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:03,990
you know the trinity test there were
some people who were still

8526
02:28:03,990 --> 02:28:04,000
some people who were still
 

8527
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,150
some people who were still
checking their calculations and they

8528
02:28:06,150 --> 02:28:06,160
checking their calculations and they
 

8529
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:08,070
checking their calculations and they
were off we've we did nuclear tests

8530
02:28:08,070 --> 02:28:08,080
were off we've we did nuclear tests
 

8531
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:08,790
were off we've we did nuclear tests
where we

8532
02:28:08,790 --> 02:28:08,800
where we
 

8533
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:11,349
where we
were off significantly in terms of the

8534
02:28:11,349 --> 02:28:11,359
were off significantly in terms of the
 

8535
02:28:11,359 --> 02:28:12,469
were off significantly in terms of the
yield right so it was like

8536
02:28:12,469 --> 02:28:12,479
yield right so it was like
 

8537
02:28:12,479 --> 02:28:13,990
yield right so it was like
and they still flip the switch yeah they

8538
02:28:13,990 --> 02:28:14,000
and they still flip the switch yeah they
 

8539
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,830
and they still flip the switch yeah they
still flip the switch and and sometimes

8540
02:28:15,830 --> 02:28:15,840
still flip the switch and and sometimes
 

8541
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:17,830
still flip the switch and and sometimes
they flip the switch not

8542
02:28:17,830 --> 02:28:17,840
they flip the switch not
 

8543
02:28:17,840 --> 02:28:21,349
they flip the switch not
to win a world war or to or to

8544
02:28:21,349 --> 02:28:21,359
to win a world war or to or to
 

8545
02:28:21,359 --> 02:28:23,910
to win a world war or to or to
save 40 000 lives a year they just just

8546
02:28:23,910 --> 02:28:23,920
save 40 000 lives a year they just just
 

8547
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:24,550
save 40 000 lives a year they just just
just to see

8548
02:28:24,550 --> 02:28:24,560
just to see
 

8549
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:26,309
just to see
intellectual curiosity like this is what

8550
02:28:26,309 --> 02:28:26,319
intellectual curiosity like this is what
 

8551
02:28:26,319 --> 02:28:27,590
intellectual curiosity like this is what
i got my grant for

8552
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:27,600
i got my grant for
 

8553
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:29,510
i got my grant for
this is this is where i'll get my nobel

8554
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:29,520
this is this is where i'll get my nobel
 

8555
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:32,870
this is this is where i'll get my nobel

what's actually
 

9321
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:41,190
what's actually
going on in the world yes it is a little

9322
02:42:41,190 --> 02:42:41,200
going on in the world yes it is a little
 

9323
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:44,150
going on in the world yes it is a little
bit sad to imagine that

bit sad to imagine that
 

9325
02:42:44,160 --> 02:42:47,190
bit sad to imagine that
if aliens on mass showed up to earth

9326
02:42:47,190 --> 02:42:47,200
if aliens on mass showed up to earth
 

9327
02:42:47,200 --> 02:42:48,790
if aliens on mass showed up to earth
they would be too preoccupied with

9328
02:42:48,790 --> 02:42:48,800
they would be too preoccupied with
 

9329
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:50,389
they would be too preoccupied with
political bickering

9330
02:42:50,389 --> 02:42:50,399
political bickering
 

9331
02:42:50,399 --> 02:42:53,269
political bickering
or to like these like fake news and all

9332
02:42:53,269 --> 02:42:53,279
or to like these like fake news and all
 

9333
02:42:53,279 --> 02:42:54,790
or to like these like fake news and all
that kind of stuff

9334
02:42:54,790 --> 02:42:54,800
that kind of stuff
 

9335
02:42:54,800 --> 02:42:57,670
that kind of stuff
to notice yeah the very basic uh

9336
02:42:57,670 --> 02:42:57,680
to notice yeah the very basic uh
 

9337
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:59,429
to notice yeah the very basic uh
evidence of reality

9338
02:42:59,429 --> 02:42:59,439
evidence of reality
 

9339
02:42:59,439 --> 02:43:02,790
evidence of reality
i do have a glimmer of hope that

9340
02:43:02,790 --> 02:43:02,800
i do have a glimmer of hope that
 

9341
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:04,469
i do have a glimmer of hope that
there seems to be more and more hunger

9342
02:43:04,469 --> 02:43:04,479
there seems to be more and more hunger
 

9343
02:43:04,479 --> 02:43:06,309
there seems to be more and more hunger
for authenticity

9344
02:43:06,309 --> 02:43:06,319
for authenticity
 

9345
02:43:06,319 --> 02:43:09,590
for authenticity
and i feel like that opens the door

9346
02:43:09,590 --> 02:43:09,600
and i feel like that opens the door
 

9347
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:12,710
and i feel like that opens the door
for a hunger for what is

9348
02:43:12,710 --> 02:43:12,720
for a hunger for what is
 

9349
02:43:12,720 --> 02:43:15,510
for a hunger for what is
real like that people don't want story

9350
02:43:15,510 --> 02:43:15,520
real like that people don't want story
 

9351
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:17,110
real like that people don't want story
they don't want like layers and layers

9352
02:43:17,110 --> 02:43:17,120
they don't want like layers and layers
 

9353
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:17,590
they don't want like layers and layers
of

9354
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:17,600
of
 

9355
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:20,790
of
of uh like fakeness uh

9356
02:43:20,790 --> 02:43:20,800
of uh like fakeness uh
 

9357
02:43:20,800 --> 02:43:23,910
of uh like fakeness uh
and i'm hoping that means that will

9358
02:43:23,910 --> 02:43:23,920
and i'm hoping that means that will
 

9359
02:43:23,920 --> 02:43:25,030
and i'm hoping that means that will
directly lead to

9360
02:43:25,030 --> 02:43:25,040
directly lead to
 

9361
02:43:25,040 --> 02:43:27,349
directly lead to
a greater hunger for reality and reason

9362
02:43:27,349 --> 02:43:27,359
a greater hunger for reality and reason
 

9363
02:43:27,359 --> 02:43:28,150
a greater hunger for reality and reason
and truth

9364
02:43:28,150 --> 02:43:28,160
and truth
 

9365
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:31,349
and truth
you know truth isn't dogmatism

9366
02:43:31,349 --> 02:43:31,359
you know truth isn't dogmatism
 

9367
02:43:31,359 --> 02:43:34,550
you know truth isn't dogmatism
like truth isn't uh authority i have a

9368
02:43:34,550 --> 02:43:34,560
like truth isn't uh authority i have a
 

9369
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:35,269
like truth isn't uh authority i have a
phd

9370
02:43:35,269 --> 02:43:35,279
phd
 

9371
02:43:35,279 --> 02:43:38,389
phd
and therefore i'm right uh

9372
02:43:38,389 --> 02:43:38,399
and therefore i'm right uh
 

9373
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:41,510
and therefore i'm right uh
truth is almost the like

9374
02:43:41,510 --> 02:43:41,520
truth is almost the like
 

9375
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:43,110
truth is almost the like
the the reality is there's so many

9376
02:43:43,110 --> 02:43:43,120
the the reality is there's so many
 

9377
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:44,309
the the reality is there's so many
questions there's so many mysteries

9378
02:43:44,309 --> 02:43:44,319
questions there's so many mysteries
 

9379
02:43:44,319 --> 02:43:45,990
questions there's so many mysteries
there's so much uncertainty this is our

9380
02:43:45,990 --> 02:43:46,000
there's so much uncertainty this is our
 

9381
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:46,950
there's so much uncertainty this is our
best

9382
02:43:46,950 --> 02:43:46,960
best
 

9383
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:49,670
best
available like a best guess and we have

9384
02:43:49,670 --> 02:43:49,680
available like a best guess and we have
 

9385
02:43:49,680 --> 02:43:51,429
available like a best guess and we have
a lot of evidence that supports that

9386
02:43:51,429 --> 02:43:51,439
a lot of evidence that supports that
 

9387
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:51,910
a lot of evidence that supports that
guest

9388
02:43:51,910 --> 02:43:51,920
guest
 

9389
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:53,910
guest
but it could be so many other things and

9390
02:43:53,910 --> 02:43:53,920
but it could be so many other things and
 

9391
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:56,309
but it could be so many other things and
like just even conveying that

9392
02:43:56,309 --> 02:43:56,319
like just even conveying that
 

9393
02:43:56,319 --> 02:43:58,309
like just even conveying that
i think there's a hunger for that in the

9394
02:43:58,309 --> 02:43:58,319
i think there's a hunger for that in the
 

9395
02:43:58,319 --> 02:43:59,990
i think there's a hunger for that in the
world to hear that from scientists

9396
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:00,000
world to hear that from scientists
 

9397
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:03,349
world to hear that from scientists
less dogmatism and more just like

9398
02:44:03,349 --> 02:44:03,359
less dogmatism and more just like
 

9399
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:05,349
less dogmatism and more just like
this is this is what we know we're doing

9400
02:44:05,349 --> 02:44:05,359
this is this is what we know we're doing
 

9401
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:07,750
this is this is what we know we're doing
our best given the uncertainty given

9402
02:44:07,750 --> 02:44:07,760
our best given the uncertainty given
 

9403
02:44:07,760 --> 02:44:09,429
our best given the uncertainty given
i mean this is true with the obviously

9404
02:44:09,429 --> 02:44:09,439
i mean this is true with the obviously
 

9405
02:44:09,439 --> 02:44:11,190
i mean this is true with the obviously
with the virology and all those kinds of

9406
02:44:11,190 --> 02:44:11,200
with the virology and all those kinds of
 

9407
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:11,670
with the virology and all those kinds of
things

9408
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:11,680
things
 

9409
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:13,269
things
because everything is happening so fast

9410
02:44:13,269 --> 02:44:13,279
because everything is happening so fast
 

9411
02:44:13,279 --> 02:44:14,790
because everything is happening so fast
there's a lot of

02:44:14,790 --> 02:44:14,800
there's a lot of
 

9413
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:16,950
there's a lot of
and biology is super messy so it's very

9414
02:44:16,950 --> 02:44:16,960
and biology is super messy so it's very
 

9415
02:44:16,960 --> 02:44:17,990
and biology is super messy so it's very
hard to know stuff for

9416
02:44:17,990 --> 02:44:18,000
hard to know stuff for
 

9417
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,710
hard to know stuff for
sure so just being open and real about

9418
02:44:20,710 --> 02:44:20,720
sure so just being open and real about
 

9419
02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:21,590
sure so just being open and real about
that i think

9420
02:44:21,590 --> 02:44:21,600
that i think
 

9421
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:25,030
that i think
i'm hoping will change people's

9422
02:44:25,030 --> 02:44:25,040
i'm hoping will change people's
 

9423
02:44:25,040 --> 02:44:28,309
i'm hoping will change people's
hunger and openness and trust of uh

9424
02:44:28,309 --> 02:44:28,319
hunger and openness and trust of uh
 

9425
02:44:28,319 --> 02:44:30,870
hunger and openness and trust of uh
what's real yeah well so much of this is

9426
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:30,880
what's real yeah well so much of this is
 

9427
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:32,150
what's real yeah well so much of this is
probabilistic it's

9428
02:44:32,150 --> 02:44:32,160
probabilistic it's
 

9429
02:44:32,160 --> 02:44:34,309
probabilistic it's
so much of what can seem dogmatic

9430
02:44:34,309 --> 02:44:34,319
so much of what can seem dogmatic
 

9431
02:44:34,319 --> 02:44:36,070
so much of what can seem dogmatic
scientifically it's just

9432
02:44:36,070 --> 02:44:36,080
scientifically it's just
 

9433
02:44:36,080 --> 02:44:40,150
scientifically it's just
you're just you're placing a bet on

9434
02:44:40,150 --> 02:44:40,160
you're just you're placing a bet on
 

9435
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:43,750
you're just you're placing a bet on
whether it's worth reading that paper or

9436
02:44:43,750 --> 02:44:43,760
whether it's worth reading that paper or
 

9437
02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:45,990
whether it's worth reading that paper or
rethinking your presuppositions on that

9438
02:44:45,990 --> 02:44:46,000
rethinking your presuppositions on that
 

9439
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,150
rethinking your presuppositions on that
point you know it's like it's not it's

9440
02:44:48,150 --> 02:44:48,160
point you know it's like it's not it's
 

9441
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:49,990
point you know it's like it's not it's
not fundamental closure to data it's

9442
02:44:49,990 --> 02:44:50,000
not fundamental closure to data it's
 

9443
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:50,630
not fundamental closure to data it's
just that

9444
02:44:50,630 --> 02:44:50,640
just that
 

9445
02:44:50,640 --> 02:44:53,030
just that
there's so much data on one side or so

9446
02:44:53,030 --> 02:44:53,040
there's so much data on one side or so
 

9447
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:53,670
there's so much data on one side or so
or so much

9448
02:44:53,670 --> 02:44:53,680
or so much
 

9449
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:55,910
or so much
so much would have to change in terms of

9450
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:55,920
so much would have to change in terms of
 

9451
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:57,190
so much would have to change in terms of
your understanding of

what you think you understand about the

were so

were so
that you can

9460
02:45:05,269 --> 02:45:05,279
that you can
 

9461
02:45:05,279 --> 02:45:07,190
that you can
pretty quickly say all right that's

02:45:07,190 --> 02:45:07,200
pretty quickly say all right that's
 

9463
02:45:07,200 --> 02:45:08,469
pretty quickly say all right that's

it's just like like okay you're telling

it's just like like okay you're telling
 

9479

it's just like like okay you're telling
me that uh

9480

me that uh

your best friend can actually read minds

your best friend can actually read minds
 

9483
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:29,030
your best friend can actually read minds
okay well

9484
02:45:29,030 --> 02:45:29,040
okay well
 

9485
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:31,750
okay well
that's interesting let me know when that

9486
02:45:31,750 --> 02:45:31,760
that's interesting let me know when that
 

9487
02:45:31,760 --> 02:45:33,349
that's interesting let me know when that
person has gone into a lab and actually

9488
02:45:33,349 --> 02:45:33,359
person has gone into a lab and actually
 

9489
02:45:33,359 --> 02:45:34,950
person has gone into a lab and actually
proven it right like i don't need

9490
02:45:34,950 --> 02:45:34,960
proven it right like i don't need
 

9491
02:45:34,960 --> 02:45:36,870
proven it right like i don't need
like this this is not the place where i

02:45:36,870 --> 02:45:36,880
like this this is not the place where i
 

9493
02:45:36,880 --> 02:45:38,469
like this this is not the place where i
need to spend the rest of my day

9494
02:45:38,469 --> 02:45:38,479
need to spend the rest of my day

my mind right
 

9499
02:45:42,479 --> 02:45:44,790
my mind right
but there's a way to communicate that i

9500
02:45:44,790 --> 02:45:44,800
but there's a way to communicate that i
 

9501
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:46,790
but there's a way to communicate that i
think i think it does too often sound

9502
02:45:46,790 --> 02:45:46,800
think i think it does too often sound
 

9503

like you're completely closed off to

as opposed to saying like this is you

know
 

9511
02:45:52,560 --> 02:45:54,790
know
as opposed to saying that there's

02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:54,800
as opposed to saying that there's
 

9513

as opposed to saying that there's
there's a lot of evidence

there's a lot of evidence
 

9515
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:59,269
there's a lot of evidence
in support of this but you're still

9516
02:45:59,269 --> 02:45:59,279
in support of this but you're still
 

9517
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:01,190
in support of this but you're still
open-minded to other ideas like there's

9518
02:46:01,190 --> 02:46:01,200
open-minded to other ideas like there's
 

9519
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:02,550
open-minded to other ideas like there's
a way to communicate that it's not

a way to communicate that it's not

necessarily even with words
 

9523
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:07,510
necessarily even with words
it's like it's even that joe rogan

for people who don't know what we're

9686
02:48:48,469 --> 02:48:48,479
for people who don't know what we're
 

9687
02:48:48,479 --> 02:48:49,590
for people who don't know what we're
talking about it's just like this the

9688
02:48:49,590 --> 02:48:49,600
talking about it's just like this the
 

9689
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:50,550
talking about it's just like this the
simple

9690
02:48:50,550 --> 02:48:50,560
simple
 

9691
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:52,070
simple
circumstance of like someone's got you

9692
02:48:52,070 --> 02:48:52,080
circumstance of like someone's got you
 

9693
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:54,469
circumstance of like someone's got you
in a headlock how do you get out of that

9694
02:48:54,469 --> 02:48:54,479
in a headlock how do you get out of that
 

9695
02:48:54,479 --> 02:48:56,710
in a headlock how do you get out of that
right someone's sitting on your chest

9696
02:48:56,710 --> 02:48:56,720
right someone's sitting on your chest
 

9697
02:48:56,720 --> 02:48:58,070
right someone's sitting on your chest
and you know they're in the mount

9698
02:48:58,070 --> 02:48:58,080
and you know they're in the mount
 

9699
02:48:58,080 --> 02:48:58,950
and you know they're in the mount
position

9700
02:48:58,950 --> 02:48:58,960
position
 

9701
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:00,790
position
and you're on the bottom and you want to

9702
02:49:00,790 --> 02:49:00,800
and you're on the bottom and you want to
 

9703
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:02,790
and you're on the bottom and you want to
get away how do you get them off you

9704
02:49:02,790 --> 02:49:02,800
get away how do you get them off you
 

9705
02:49:02,800 --> 02:49:04,870
get away how do you get them off you
they're sitting on you

9706
02:49:04,870 --> 02:49:04,880
they're sitting on you
 

9707
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:07,510
they're sitting on you
your intuitions about how to do this are

9708
02:49:07,510 --> 02:49:07,520
your intuitions about how to do this are
 

9709
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:08,230
your intuitions about how to do this are
terrible

9710
02:49:08,230 --> 02:49:08,240
terrible
 

9711
02:49:08,240 --> 02:49:09,750
terrible
even if you've done some other martial

9712
02:49:09,750 --> 02:49:09,760
even if you've done some other martial
 

9713
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:11,510
even if you've done some other martial
art right and

9714
02:49:11,510 --> 02:49:11,520
art right and
 

9715
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:14,550
art right and
once you learn how to do it

9716
02:49:14,550 --> 02:49:14,560
once you learn how to do it
 

9717
02:49:14,560 --> 02:49:16,150
once you learn how to do it
the the difference is night and day it's

9718
02:49:16,150 --> 02:49:16,160
the the difference is night and day it's
 

9719
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:17,750
the the difference is night and day it's
like you have access to a completely

9720
02:49:17,750 --> 02:49:17,760
like you have access to a completely
 

9721
02:49:17,760 --> 02:49:21,110
like you have access to a completely
different physics

9722
02:49:21,110 --> 02:49:21,120

 

9723
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:24,389

but i think our

9724
02:49:24,389 --> 02:49:24,399
but i think our
 

9725
02:49:24,399 --> 02:49:26,950
but i think our
understanding of the world can be much

9726
02:49:26,950 --> 02:49:26,960
understanding of the world can be much
 

9727
02:49:26,960 --> 02:49:27,830
understanding of the world can be much
more like

9728
02:49:27,830 --> 02:49:27,840
more like
 

9729
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:30,630
more like
jiu-jitsu than it tends to be right and

9730
02:49:30,630 --> 02:49:30,640
jiu-jitsu than it tends to be right and
 

9731
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:33,830
jiu-jitsu than it tends to be right and
i think we should all

9732
02:49:33,830 --> 02:49:33,840
i think we should all
 

9733
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:38,830
i think we should all
we should all have a much better sense

9734
02:49:38,830 --> 02:49:38,840

 

9735
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:40,309

of

9736
02:49:40,309 --> 02:49:40,319
of
 

9737
02:49:40,319 --> 02:49:42,630
of
when we should tap out and when we

9738
02:49:42,630 --> 02:49:42,640
when we should tap out and when we
 

9739
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:44,230
when we should tap out and when we
should recognize that our

9740
02:49:44,230 --> 02:49:44,240
should recognize that our
 

9741
02:49:44,240 --> 02:49:47,349
should recognize that our
our you know our epistemological arm

9742
02:49:47,349 --> 02:49:47,359
our you know our epistemological arm
 

9743
02:49:47,359 --> 02:49:50,230
our you know our epistemological arm
is barred and now being broken right now

9744
02:49:50,230 --> 02:49:50,240
is barred and now being broken right now
 

9745
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:51,110
is barred and now being broken right now
the problem with

9746
02:49:51,110 --> 02:49:51,120
the problem with
 

9747
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:54,150
the problem with
debating most other topics is that most

9748
02:49:54,150 --> 02:49:54,160
debating most other topics is that most
 

9749
02:49:54,160 --> 02:49:55,990
debating most other topics is that most
people

9750
02:49:55,990 --> 02:49:56,000
people
 

9751
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:57,830
people
it isn't jujitsu and most people don't

9752
02:49:57,830 --> 02:49:57,840
it isn't jujitsu and most people don't
 

9753
02:49:57,840 --> 02:49:59,349
it isn't jujitsu and most people don't
tap out right they don't

9754
02:49:59,349 --> 02:49:59,359
tap out right they don't
 

9755
02:49:59,359 --> 02:50:00,630
tap out right they don't
even if they're wrong even if it's

9756
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:00,640
even if they're wrong even if it's
 

9757
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:02,469
even if they're wrong even if it's
obvious to you they're wrong and it's

9758
02:50:02,469 --> 02:50:02,479
obvious to you they're wrong and it's
 

9759
02:50:02,479 --> 02:50:03,429
obvious to you they're wrong and it's
obvious to the

9760
02:50:03,429 --> 02:50:03,439
obvious to the
 

9761
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:05,429
obvious to the
intelligent audience that they're wrong

9762
02:50:05,429 --> 02:50:05,439
intelligent audience that they're wrong
 

9763
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:07,750
intelligent audience that they're wrong
people just double down and double down

9764
02:50:07,750 --> 02:50:07,760
people just double down and double down
 

9765
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:09,110
people just double down and double down
they're either lying or lying to

9766
02:50:09,110 --> 02:50:09,120
they're either lying or lying to
 

9767
02:50:09,120 --> 02:50:10,550
they're either lying or lying to
themselves or they're just they're

9768
02:50:10,550 --> 02:50:10,560
themselves or they're just they're
 

9769
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:11,590
themselves or they're just they're
bluffing

9770
02:50:11,590 --> 02:50:11,600
bluffing
 

9771
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:13,990
bluffing
and so you have a lot of zombies walking

9772
02:50:13,990 --> 02:50:14,000
and so you have a lot of zombies walking
 

9773
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,750
and so you have a lot of zombies walking
around and zombie world views walking

9774
02:50:15,750 --> 02:50:15,760
around and zombie world views walking
 

9775
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:16,389
around and zombie world views walking
around which

9776
02:50:16,389 --> 02:50:16,399
around which
 

9777
02:50:16,399 --> 02:50:19,670
around which
have been disconfirmed as emphatically

9778
02:50:19,670 --> 02:50:19,680
have been disconfirmed as emphatically
 

9779
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:19,990
have been disconfirmed as emphatically
as

9780
02:50:19,990 --> 02:50:20,000
as
 

9781
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,990
as
someone gets armbard right or someone

9782
02:50:21,990 --> 02:50:22,000
someone gets armbard right or someone
 

9783
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,389
someone gets armbard right or someone
gets choked out in in jiu jitsu

9784
02:50:24,389 --> 02:50:24,399
gets choked out in in jiu jitsu
 

9785
02:50:24,399 --> 02:50:27,590
gets choked out in in jiu jitsu
but because it's not jiu-jitsu

9786
02:50:27,590 --> 02:50:27,600
but because it's not jiu-jitsu
 

9787
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:29,670
but because it's not jiu-jitsu
they're they can they can they can live

9788
02:50:29,670 --> 02:50:29,680
they're they can they can they can live
 

9789
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:31,110
they're they can they can they can live
to fight another day right or they can

9790
02:50:31,110 --> 02:50:31,120
to fight another day right or they can
 

9791
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:31,750
to fight another day right or they can
pretend

9792
02:50:31,750 --> 02:50:31,760
pretend
 

9793
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:33,349
pretend
that they didn't lose that particular

9794
02:50:33,349 --> 02:50:33,359
that they didn't lose that particular
 

9795
02:50:33,359 --> 02:50:35,269
that they didn't lose that particular
argument and

9796
02:50:35,269 --> 02:50:35,279
argument and
 

9797
02:50:35,279 --> 02:50:37,349
argument and
and science when it works is a lot like

9798
02:50:37,349 --> 02:50:37,359
and science when it works is a lot like
 

9799
02:50:37,359 --> 02:50:38,790
and science when it works is a lot like
jiu jitsu i mean science

9800
02:50:38,790 --> 02:50:38,800
jiu jitsu i mean science
 

9801
02:50:38,800 --> 02:50:41,429
jiu jitsu i mean science
when you falsify a thesis right when you

9802
02:50:41,429 --> 02:50:41,439
when you falsify a thesis right when you
 

9803
02:50:41,439 --> 02:50:42,630
when you falsify a thesis right when you
think

9804
02:50:42,630 --> 02:50:42,640
think
 

9805
02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:44,790
think
you know dna is one way and it proves to

9806
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:44,800
you know dna is one way and it proves to
 

9807
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:46,389
you know dna is one way and it proves to
be another way when you when you think

9808
02:50:46,389 --> 02:50:46,399
be another way when you when you think
 

9809
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:47,750
be another way when you when you think
it's um

9810
02:50:47,750 --> 02:50:47,760
it's um
 

9811
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:49,269
it's um
you know triple stranded or whatever

9812
02:50:49,269 --> 02:50:49,279
you know triple stranded or whatever
 

9813
02:50:49,279 --> 02:50:51,590
you know triple stranded or whatever
it's it's like there there is a there

9814
02:50:51,590 --> 02:50:51,600
it's it's like there there is a there
 

9815
02:50:51,600 --> 02:50:51,910
it's it's like there there is a there
there

9816
02:50:51,910 --> 02:50:51,920
there
 

9817
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:55,269
there
and you can get to a real consensus

9818
02:50:55,269 --> 02:50:55,279
and you can get to a real consensus
 

9819
02:50:55,279 --> 02:50:59,190
and you can get to a real consensus
um so jiu jitsu for me it was like

9820
02:50:59,190 --> 02:50:59,200
um so jiu jitsu for me it was like
 

9821
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:02,710
um so jiu jitsu for me it was like
it was more than just of interest for

9822
02:51:02,710 --> 02:51:02,720
it was more than just of interest for
 

9823
02:51:02,720 --> 02:51:04,309
it was more than just of interest for
self-defense and

9824
02:51:04,309 --> 02:51:04,319
self-defense and
 

9825
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:06,230
self-defense and
and uh you know the the sport of it it

9826
02:51:06,230 --> 02:51:06,240
and uh you know the the sport of it it
 

9827
02:51:06,240 --> 02:51:07,910
and uh you know the the sport of it it
was just there was something

9828
02:51:07,910 --> 02:51:07,920
was just there was something
 

9829
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,469
was just there was something
it's a language and an argument you're

9830
02:51:10,469 --> 02:51:10,479
it's a language and an argument you're
 

9831
02:51:10,479 --> 02:51:11,830
it's a language and an argument you're
having

9832
02:51:11,830 --> 02:51:11,840
having
 

9833
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:15,510
having
where um

9834
02:51:15,510 --> 02:51:15,520
where um
 

9835
02:51:15,520 --> 02:51:17,830
where um
you can't fool yourself anymore like

9836
02:51:17,830 --> 02:51:17,840
you can't fool yourself anymore like
 

9837
02:51:17,840 --> 02:51:18,790
you can't fool yourself anymore like
this there's a

9838
02:51:18,790 --> 02:51:18,800
this there's a
 

9839
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:23,670
this there's a
first of all it cancels any role of luck

9840
02:51:23,670 --> 02:51:23,680
first of all it cancels any role of luck
 

9841
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:26,150
first of all it cancels any role of luck
in a way that most uh most other other

9842
02:51:26,150 --> 02:51:26,160
in a way that most uh most other other
 

9843
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:27,670
in a way that most uh most other other
athletic feats don't it's like in

9844
02:51:27,670 --> 02:51:27,680
athletic feats don't it's like in
 

9845
02:51:27,680 --> 02:51:29,190

an antidote for that problem it's just

10410
03:01:08,309 --> 03:01:08,319
an antidote for that problem it's just
 

10411

10435
03:01:40,640 --> 03:01:42,950
your and you're captivated by all that
it's actually

10436
03:01:42,950 --> 03:01:42,960
it's actually
 

10437
03:01:42,960 --> 03:01:46,790
it's actually
there there are this is a domain

10438
03:01:46,790 --> 03:01:46,800
there there are this is a domain
 

10439
03:01:46,800 --> 03:01:49,349
there there are this is a domain
where somebody else's well-being

10440
03:01:49,349 --> 03:01:49,359
where somebody else's well-being
 

10441
03:01:49,359 --> 03:01:49,830
where somebody else's well-being
actually

10442
03:01:49,830 --> 03:01:49,840

than than you were experiencing when it

10478
03:02:27,349 --> 03:02:27,359
than than you were experiencing when it

10483
03:02:30,080 --> 03:02:32,309
you what kind of what can i get
next and do you think we'll ever build

10484
03:02:32,309 --> 03:02:32,319
next and do you think we'll ever build
 

10485
03:02:32,319 --> 03:02:33,750
next and do you think we'll ever build
robots that we can love

10486
03:02:33,750 --> 03:02:33,760
robots that we can love
 

10487
03:02:33,760 --> 03:02:37,030
robots that we can love
and they will love us back well i think

10488
03:02:37,030 --> 03:02:37,040
and they will love us back well i think
 

10489
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:37,670
and they will love us back well i think
we will

10490
03:02:37,670 --> 03:02:37,680
we will
 

10491
03:02:37,680 --> 03:02:40,710
we will
certainly seem to because we'll we'll

10492
03:02:40,710 --> 03:02:40,720
certainly seem to because we'll we'll
 

10493
03:02:40,720 --> 03:02:41,510
certainly seem to because we'll we'll
build those

10494
03:02:41,510 --> 03:02:41,520
build those
 

10495
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:43,030
build those
you know i mean i think i think that

10496
03:02:43,030 --> 03:02:43,040
you know i mean i think i think that
 

10497
03:02:43,040 --> 03:02:44,550
you know i mean i think i think that
turing test will be passed

10498
03:02:44,550 --> 03:02:44,560
turing test will be passed
 

10499
03:02:44,560 --> 03:02:48,150
turing test will be passed
whether what will actually be going on

10500
03:02:48,150 --> 03:02:48,160
whether what will actually be going on
 

10501
03:02:48,160 --> 03:02:51,190
whether what will actually be going on
on the robot side uh may remain a

10502
03:02:51,190 --> 03:02:51,200
on the robot side uh may remain a
 

10503
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:52,070
on the robot side uh may remain a
question

10504
03:02:52,070 --> 03:02:52,080
question
 

10505
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:54,950
question
that that that will be interesting but i

10506
03:02:54,950 --> 03:02:54,960
that that that will be interesting but i
 

10507
03:02:54,960 --> 03:02:55,830
that that that will be interesting but i
think if we just

10508
03:02:55,830 --> 03:02:55,840
think if we just
 

10509
03:02:55,840 --> 03:02:59,910
think if we just
keep going we will build

10510
03:02:59,910 --> 03:02:59,920
keep going we will build
 

10511
03:02:59,920 --> 03:03:02,550
keep going we will build

is intelligent enough to form a reason
 

10561
03:03:55,840 --> 03:03:58,309
is intelligent enough to form a reason
and a plan to manipulate you you know

10562
03:03:58,309 --> 03:03:58,319
and a plan to manipulate you you know
 

10563
03:03:58,319 --> 03:03:58,870
and a plan to manipulate you you know
like a

like a
 

10565
03:03:58,880 --> 03:04:01,590
like a
and this there's no there's once we

10566
03:04:01,590 --> 03:04:01,600
and this there's no there's once we
 

10567
03:04:01,600 --> 03:04:02,469
and this there's no there's once we
build

10568
03:04:02,469 --> 03:04:02,479
build
 

10569
03:04:02,479 --> 03:04:05,910
build
robots that are truly out of the uncanny

10570
03:04:05,910 --> 03:04:05,920
robots that are truly out of the uncanny

then then then it that does seem to me
 

10581
03:04:17,920 --> 03:04:18,550
then then then it that does seem to me
to be like

10582
03:04:18,550 --> 03:04:18,560
to be like
 

10583
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:21,670
to be like
chess where once they're better they're

chess where once they're better they're
they're

10586
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:22,080
they're
 

10587
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:26,230
they're
so much better at deceiving

10588
03:04:26,230 --> 03:04:26,240
so much better at deceiving
 

10589
03:04:26,240 --> 03:04:27,910
so much better at deceiving
us than people would be i mean people

10590
03:04:27,910 --> 03:04:27,920
us than people would be i mean people
 

10591
03:04:27,920 --> 03:04:29,670
us than people would be i mean people
are already good enough at deceiving us

10592
03:04:29,670 --> 03:04:29,680
are already good enough at deceiving us
 

10593
03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:30,950
are already good enough at deceiving us
it's very hard to tell when somebody's

10594
03:04:30,950 --> 03:04:30,960
it's very hard to tell when somebody's
 

10595
03:04:30,960 --> 03:04:31,990
it's very hard to tell when somebody's
lying

10596
03:04:31,990 --> 03:04:32,000
lying
 

10597
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:33,750
lying
but if you can imagine something that

10598
03:04:33,750 --> 03:04:33,760
but if you can imagine something that
 

10599
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:35,349
but if you can imagine something that
could give facial

10600
03:04:35,349 --> 03:04:35,359
could give facial
 

10601
03:04:35,359 --> 03:04:39,510
could give facial
a facial display of any emotion it wants

10602
03:04:39,510 --> 03:04:39,520
a facial display of any emotion it wants
 

10603
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:43,190
a facial display of any emotion it wants
at you know on cue uh

10604
03:04:43,190 --> 03:04:43,200
at you know on cue uh
 

10605
03:04:43,200 --> 03:04:44,790
at you know on cue uh
because if we've perfected the facial

10606
03:04:44,790 --> 03:04:44,800
because if we've perfected the facial
 

10607
03:04:44,800 --> 03:04:46,790
because if we've perfected the facial
display of emotion in robots in the year

10608
03:04:46,790 --> 03:04:46,800
display of emotion in robots in the year
 

10609
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:51,030

10611
03:04:51,040 --> 03:04:54,790
you know 20 70 or whatever it is um
then it is just it is like chess against

03:04:54,790 --> 03:04:54,800
then it is just it is like chess against
 

10613

divide by seven i mean it's
 

10695
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:23,190
divide by seven i mean it's
it has solved arithmetic see i don't i

10696
03:06:23,190 --> 03:06:23,200
it has solved arithmetic see i don't i
 

10697

03:13:43,990 --> 03:13:44,000
the next thing i mean we're constantly
 

11103
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:47,110
the next thing i mean we're constantly
we're stepping over the thing that we

11104
03:13:47,110 --> 03:13:47,120
we're stepping over the thing that we
 

11105
03:13:47,120 --> 03:13:48,229
we're stepping over the thing that we
think we're

11106
03:13:48,229 --> 03:13:48,239
think we're
 

11107
03:13:48,239 --> 03:13:51,429
think we're
seeking in the act of seeking it and so

11108
03:13:51,429 --> 03:13:51,439
seeking in the act of seeking it and so
 

11109
03:13:51,439 --> 03:13:53,030
seeking in the act of seeking it and so
it is kind of a paradox

11110
03:13:53,030 --> 03:13:53,040
it is kind of a paradox
 

11111
03:13:53,040 --> 03:13:55,990
it is kind of a paradox
i mean there is a there's this paradox

11112
03:13:55,990 --> 03:13:56,000
i mean there is a there's this paradox
 

11113
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:56,469
i mean there is a there's this paradox
that

11114
03:13:56,469 --> 03:13:56,479
that
 

11115
03:13:56,479 --> 03:14:00,229
that
which i mean it sounds trite but it's

11116
03:14:00,229 --> 03:14:00,239
which i mean it sounds trite but it's
 

11117
03:14:00,239 --> 03:14:01,349
which i mean it sounds trite but it's
like you you can't

11118
03:14:01,349 --> 03:14:01,359
like you you can't
 

11119
03:14:01,359 --> 03:14:04,389
like you you can't
actually become happy

11120
03:14:04,389 --> 03:14:04,399
actually become happy
 

11121
03:14:04,399 --> 03:14:07,429
actually become happy
you can only be happy and and and it's

11122
03:14:07,429 --> 03:14:07,439
you can only be happy and and and it's
 

11123
03:14:07,439 --> 03:14:09,349
you can only be happy and and and it's
that it's the illusion that because

11124
03:14:09,349 --> 03:14:09,359
that it's the illusion that because
 

11125
03:14:09,359 --> 03:14:10,790
that it's the illusion that because
it's the loot it's the illusion that

11126
03:14:10,790 --> 03:14:10,800
it's the loot it's the illusion that
 

11127
03:14:10,800 --> 03:14:14,550
it's the loot it's the illusion that
your future being happy

11128
03:14:14,550 --> 03:14:14,560
your future being happy
 

11129
03:14:14,560 --> 03:14:16,790
