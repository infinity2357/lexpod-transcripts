this is a very kind of
 

205
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,949
this is a very kind of
cyclical question but in some sense i

206
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959

cyclical question but in some sense i
mean

208

mean
that uh

210
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:49,599
that uh
 

211
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,910
that uh
if god is the thing that represents

212
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
if god is the thing that represents
 

213
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,710
if god is the thing that represents
the mystery all around us

214

00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
the way we talk about him is more a
 

219
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,910
the way we talk about him is more a
creation of our minds it's not the

220
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
creation of our minds it's not the
 

221
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,350

and therefore we're creating the god in
 

227
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,509
and therefore we're creating the god in
terms of the god that we we're talking

228
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
terms of the god that we we're talking

235
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,909

but this is this is uh this is the

236
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919

okay so that's how the physicists at

506
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
okay so that's how the physicists at
 

507
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,190
okay so that's how the physicists at
least some of them might look at it you

yeah the simulation thing

536
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
yeah the simulation thing
 

537
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,870
yeah the simulation thing
i was actually looking this morning at

538
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
i was actually looking this morning at
 

539
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,190
i was actually looking this morning at
video games just the statistics on video

540
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
video games just the statistics on video
 

541
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,150
video games just the statistics on video
games and i saw that the two top video

542
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
games and i saw that the two top video
 

543
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,630
games and i saw that the two top video
games in terms of hours played

544
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
games in terms of hours played
 

545
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,670
games in terms of hours played
is fortnite and world of warcraft and i

546
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
is fortnite and world of warcraft and i
 

547
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,910
is fortnite and world of warcraft and i
saw that it's 140 billion hours

548
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
saw that it's 140 billion hours
 

549
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,590
saw that it's 140 billion hours
billion hours have been played at those

550
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
worlds being created especially in the
 

559
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,069
worlds being created especially in the
world of warcraft it's a massive online

560
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
world of warcraft it's a massive online
 

561
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,670
world of warcraft it's a massive online
role-playing game so you have these

562
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
role-playing game so you have these
 

563
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,990
role-playing game so you have these
characters that are together sort of

564
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
characters that are together sort of
 

565
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,069
characters that are together sort of
creating a world but they in themselves

566
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
creating a world but they in themselves
 

567
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,069
creating a world but they in themselves
they're also developing they have all

568
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
they're also developing they have all
 

569
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,350
they're also developing they have all
these items and they're growing like

570
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
these items and they're growing like
 

571
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,269
these items and they're growing like
they're little humans like there's

572
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
they're little humans like there's
 

573
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,870
they're little humans like there's
complicated societies that are formed

574
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
complicated societies that are formed
 

575
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,310

they have goals they're striving and so
 

577
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,110

on
 

579
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,030
on
and it's we're creating a universe

580
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
and it's we're creating a universe
 

581
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,110
and it's we're creating a universe
within our universe and for now it's a

582
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
within our universe and for now it's a
 

583
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,269
within our universe and for now it's a
kind of um

584
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
kind of um
 

585
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,069
kind of um
it's a basic sort of constrained version

586
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
it's a basic sort of constrained version
 

587
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,310
it's a basic sort of constrained version
of our more richer earth like

588
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
of our more richer earth like
 

589
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,750
of our more richer earth like
civilization but it's conceivable that

590
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
civilization but it's conceivable that
 

591
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,350
civilization but it's conceivable that
you know that

592
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
you know that
 

593
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,069
you know that
we are this thing on earth is a kind of

594
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
we are this thing on earth is a kind of
 

595
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,069
we are this thing on earth is a kind of
video game that somebody else is playing

596
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
video game that somebody else is playing
 

597
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,590
video game that somebody else is playing
it's like you could see sort of video

games upon video games being created
 

601
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,430
games upon video games being created
that uh and this is something i think a

602
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
that uh and this is something i think a
 

603
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,190
that uh and this is something i think a
lot about not from a philosophical

604
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
lot about not from a philosophical
 

605
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,069
lot about not from a philosophical
perspective but practically how fun does

606
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
perspective but practically how fun does
 

607
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,230
perspective but practically how fun does
this video game have to be

608
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
this video game have to be
 

609
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,470
this video game have to be
for us to let go of the

610
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
for us to let go of the
 

611
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,870
for us to let go of the
silly pursuits in this meet space that

612
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
silly pursuits in this meet space that
 

613
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,430
silly pursuits in this meet space that
we live in and fully

614
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
we live in and fully
 

615
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,350

just stay in wow stay in world of

616
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
just stay in wow stay in world of
 

617
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,550
just stay in wow stay in world of
warcraft stay in the video game for full

618
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
warcraft stay in the video game for full
 

619
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,230
warcraft stay in the video game for full
time so i think about that from an

620
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
time so i think about that from an
 

621
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,910
time so i think about that from an
engineering perspective like is there

622
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
engineering perspective like is there
 

623
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,590
engineering perspective like is there
going to be a time when this video game

624
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
going to be a time when this video game
 

625
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,790
going to be a time when this video game
is actual real life for us and then the

626
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
is actual real life for us and then the
 

627
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,190
is actual real life for us and then the
creatures inside the video game

628
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
creatures inside the video game
 

629
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,949
creatures inside the video game
they'll be just borrowing our

630
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
they'll be just borrowing our
 

631
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,230
they'll be just borrowing our
consciousness

632
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
consciousness
 

633
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,870
consciousness
for sort of to ground themselves will

634
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
for sort of to ground themselves will
 

635
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,670
for sort of to ground themselves will
refer to us as the gods

636

refer to us as the gods
 

637
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,829
refer to us as the gods
right like won't we become the gods

638
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839

but they're all seem to be traveling on
 

905
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,990
but they're all seem to be traveling on
the same spaceships just to different

the same spaceships just to different
 

907
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,990
the same spaceships just to different

specifically about this place that they
 

927
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,030
specifically about this place that they
seem to all travel to

seem to all travel to
 

929
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,110
seem to all travel to
so the big question is is it real is it

930
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
so the big question is is it real is it
 

931
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,110
so the big question is is it real is it
really more real than real the ancient

932
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
really more real than real the ancient

philosophers were asking the same
 

935
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,510
philosophers were asking the same
question and their means of attempting

question and their means of attempting
 

937
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,510
question and their means of attempting
to answer that was by dying

938
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
to answer that was by dying
 

939
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,510
to answer that was by dying
so if you ask plato the definition of

940
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:09,520
so if you ask plato the definition of
 

941
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,750
so if you ask plato the definition of
philosophy he will say that

942
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
philosophy he will say that
 

943
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,990
philosophy he will say that
to practice it in the right way

944
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
to practice it in the right way
 

945
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,870
to practice it in the right way
is to practice dying and being dead and

946
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
is to practice dying and being dead and
 

947
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,429
is to practice dying and being dead and
many people describe the psychedelic

948

um and the encountering of all this

954
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
um and the encountering of all this
 

955
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,350
um and the encountering of all this
visual imagery tends to be something

that is often described as more real
 

959
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,029
that is often described as more real
than real so how does terence talk about

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
millions and millions of times
 

1311
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,909
millions and millions of times
over millions and millions of years so

1312
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
over millions and millions of years so
 

1313
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,070
over millions and millions of years so
it's not just a one-time event that

1314
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
it's not just a one-time event that
 

1315
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,590
it's not just a one-time event that
cascades but it's this it's the

1316
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:51,600
cascades but it's this it's the
 

1317
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,630
cascades but it's this it's the
accumulation of psychedelic experience

1318
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
accumulation of psychedelic experience
 

1319
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,350
accumulation of psychedelic experience
that it's really difficult to test that

1320
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
that it's really difficult to test that
 

1321
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,029
that it's really difficult to test that
hypothesis

1322
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
hypothesis
 

1323
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,350
hypothesis
but i've been talking with a

1324
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,360
but i've been talking with a
 

1325
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,710
but i've been talking with a
paleoanthropologist in south africa my

1326

friend lee berger
 

1329
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,549
friend lee berger
about ways that we might test for this

1330
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
about ways that we might test for this
 

1331
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,190
about ways that we might test for this
and so lee amongst many things is this

1332
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
and so lee amongst many things is this
 

1333
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,990
and so lee amongst many things is this

hominids like homo naledi
 

1347
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,870
hominids like homo naledi
and there's an interesting point

1348
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:26,880
and there's an interesting point
 

1349
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,110
and there's an interesting point
um so naledi

1350
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
um so naledi
 

1351
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,070
um so naledi
is

1352
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,080
is
 

1353
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,269
is
this archaic hominid morphologically

1354
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
this archaic hominid morphologically
 

1355
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,310
this archaic hominid morphologically
archaic but it dates to about 300 000

1356
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
archaic but it dates to about 300 000

years ago
 

1359
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,669
years ago
which is very strange um what's even

1360
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679
which is very strange um what's even
 

1361
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,430
which is very strange um what's even
more strange about homo naledi at the

1362
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
more strange about homo naledi at the
 

1363
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,269

1365
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,750

africa is that lee believes he's

deliberately disposing of its dead
 

1371
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,070
deliberately disposing of its dead
um so there is a recognition of

1372
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
um so there is a recognition of
 

1373
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,830
um so there is a recognition of
self-mortality

1374

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,590
leads to proto-language
now isn't it interesting this could be

1398
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,600
now isn't it interesting this could be
 

1399
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,269
now isn't it interesting this could be
entirely a coincidence

00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
about 45. so i don't know what to make

and so maybe we can go out and test for

1438
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
and so maybe we can go out and test for
 

1439
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,190
and so maybe we can go out and test for
this

actually test the stone tape theory to

figure out once and for all if there's
 

1451
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,990
figure out once and for all if there's
any merit there can you just linger a

any merit there can you just linger a

like how how would you how would it be

1456
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:29,760
like how how would you how would it be
 

1457
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,310
like how how would you how would it be

nice of archaic hominids dental calculus
i like that

1470
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,360
i like that
 

1471
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,750
i like that
evidence of their diet and

1472
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:49,760
evidence of their diet and
 

1473
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,269
evidence of their diet and
you might not believe how old this was

1474
00:26:51,269 --> 00:26:51,279
you might not believe how old this was
 

1475
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,710
you might not believe how old this was
but in in sediba australopithecus sediba

1476
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:54,720
but in in sediba australopithecus sediba
 

1477
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,190
but in in sediba australopithecus sediba
they found evidence of sadiba's diet

1478
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,200
they found evidence of sadiba's diet
 

1479
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,070
they found evidence of sadiba's diet
going back 2 million years

1480
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,080
going back 2 million years
 

1481
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,149
going back 2 million years
so through things like phytoliths which

1482
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,159
so through things like phytoliths which
 

1483
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,669
so through things like phytoliths which
are essentially

1484
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:03,679
are essentially
 

1485
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,710
are essentially
fossilized plant tissue they found

1486
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
fossilized plant tissue they found
 

1487
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,669
fossilized plant tissue they found
evidence that sediba was eating bark and

1488
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679
evidence that sediba was eating bark and
 

1489
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,510
evidence that sediba was eating bark and
leaves and grasses and fruits and palm

1490
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:13,520
leaves and grasses and fruits and palm
 

1491
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,830
leaves and grasses and fruits and palm
so no psychedelics to speak of but it

1492
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
so no psychedelics to speak of but it
 

1493
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,430
so no psychedelics to speak of but it
just goes to show that through things

1494
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
just goes to show that through things
 

1495
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,990
just goes to show that through things
like dental microwave analysis and other

1496
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,000
like dental microwave analysis and other
 

1497
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,669
like dental microwave analysis and other
techniques that we're still developing

1498
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:21,679
techniques that we're still developing
 

1499
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,510
techniques that we're still developing
we can actually figure out what the diet

1500
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
we can actually figure out what the diet
 

1501
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,990
we can actually figure out what the diet
was at the time i'll fast forward to 50

1502
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
was at the time i'll fast forward to 50
 

1503
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,909
was at the time i'll fast forward to 50
000 years ago

1504
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:27,919
000 years ago
 

1505
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,750
000 years ago
there was another study out of el cidron

1506
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:29,760
there was another study out of el cidron
 

1507
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,990
there was another study out of el cidron
cave in 2012 which found that

1508
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
cave in 2012 which found that
 

1509
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,789
cave in 2012 which found that
neanderthals again preceding our species

1510
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
neanderthals again preceding our species
 

1511
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,870
neanderthals again preceding our species
50 000 years ago

50 000 years ago
 

1513
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,070
50 000 years ago
were ingesting yarrow and chamomile

1514
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,080
were ingesting yarrow and chamomile
 

1515
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,750
were ingesting yarrow and chamomile
which had been identified as medicinal

1516
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
which had been identified as medicinal
 

1517
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,310
which had been identified as medicinal
so again not psychedelic or psychoactive

1518
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
so again not psychedelic or psychoactive
 

1519
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,630
so again not psychedelic or psychoactive
but we kind of have the beginnings of

1520
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
but we kind of have the beginnings of
 

1521
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,310
but we kind of have the beginnings of
the technology and this that was nine

1522
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
the technology and this that was nine
 

1523
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,029
the technology and this that was nine
years ago to begin figuring out the

1524
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:51,039
years ago to begin figuring out the
 

1525
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,830
years ago to begin figuring out the
ancestral diet of these hominids

1526
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:53,840
ancestral diet of these hominids
 

1527
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,590
ancestral diet of these hominids
presumably there could be a way to

1528
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
presumably there could be a way to
 

1529
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,909
presumably there could be a way to
figure out it's not just diet but which

1530
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
figure out it's not just diet but which
 

1531
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,830
figure out it's not just diet but which
are have psychoactive elements to them

1532
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840
are have psychoactive elements to them
 

1533
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,510
are have psychoactive elements to them
so whether you're chewing it whether

1534
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,520
so whether you're chewing it whether
 

1535
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,190
so whether you're chewing it whether
you're smoking it whether i mean i don't

1536
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,200
you're smoking it whether i mean i don't
 

1537
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,350
you're smoking it whether i mean i don't
know what licking it i don't know if

1538
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360
know what licking it i don't know if
 

1539
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,350
know what licking it i don't know if
there's any kind of ways through the

1540
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
there's any kind of ways through the
 

1541
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,430
there's any kind of ways through the
dental calculus to figure out

1542
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
dental calculus to figure out
 

1543
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,269
dental calculus to figure out
which exact substances were being

1544
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
which exact substances were being
 

1545
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,470
which exact substances were being
consumed

1546
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:12,480
consumed
 

1547
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,630
consumed
is it possible to figure out whether

1548
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
is it possible to figure out whether
 

1549
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,789
is it possible to figure out whether
psychedelic substances are being

1550
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:16,799
psychedelic substances are being
 

1551
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,510
psychedelic substances are being
consumed by looking at human behavior

1552
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:19,520
consumed by looking at human behavior
 

1553
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,630
consumed by looking at human behavior
like you said organized burials

1554
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:22,640
like you said organized burials
 

1555
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,190
like you said organized burials
or cave paintings

1556
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:25,200
or cave paintings
 

1557
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,549
or cave paintings
no but so that's a little bit of a

1558
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
no but so that's a little bit of a
 

1559
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,470
no but so that's a little bit of a
stretch to say like where did the sleep

1560
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,480
stretch to say like where did the sleep
 

1561
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,950
stretch to say like where did the sleep
come from but it's not it's not so so so

1562
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
come from but it's not it's not so so so
 

1563
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,430
come from but it's not it's not so so so
just last fall as a matter of fact so

1564
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
just last fall as a matter of fact so
 

1565
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,789
just last fall as a matter of fact so
that that notion has been out there for

1566
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:34,799
that that notion has been out there for
 

1567
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,950
that that notion has been out there for
a while the idea that hallucinogens and

1568
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
a while the idea that hallucinogens and
 

1569
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,430
a while the idea that hallucinogens and
the ritual consumption of hallucinogens

1570
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
the ritual consumption of hallucinogens
 

1571
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,269
the ritual consumption of hallucinogens
were somehow related to the great leap

1572
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279
were somehow related to the great leap
 

1573
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,430
were somehow related to the great leap
forward or somehow related to the

1574
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
forward or somehow related to the
 

1575
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,029

initial cape pain and graham hancock
 

1577
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,470
initial cape pain and graham hancock
wrote a beautiful book about this called

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:46,480
wrote a beautiful book about this called
 

1579
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,710
wrote a beautiful book about this called
supernatural which in many ways like

of psychedelics associated with cave art
 

1603
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,669
of psychedelics associated with cave art
was finally published it's it's not that

1604
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:11,679
was finally published it's it's not that
 

1605
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,190
was finally published it's it's not that
ancient it's only about four or five

ancient it's only about four or five
 

1607
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,710
ancient it's only about four or five
hundred years ago but it came from the

1608
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
hundred years ago but it came from the
 

1609
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,669
hundred years ago but it came from the
pinwheel cave a chumash site in in

1610
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
pinwheel cave a chumash site in in
 

1611
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,669
pinwheel cave a chumash site in in
california and what they found were

1612
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
california and what they found were
 

1613
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,590
california and what they found were
datura quids like these chewed up you

1614
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:21,600
datura quids like these chewed up you
 

1615
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,510
datura quids like these chewed up you
mentioned how did they ingest it these

1616
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,520
mentioned how did they ingest it these
 

1617
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,549
mentioned how did they ingest it these
chewed up quids like these these bunches

1618
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:26,559
chewed up quids like these these bunches
 

1619
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,789
chewed up quids like these these bunches
of datura which contain these very

1620
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
of datura which contain these very
 

1621
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,269
of datura which contain these very
powerful tropane alkaloids and what was

1622
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
powerful tropane alkaloids and what was
 

1623
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,990
powerful tropane alkaloids and what was
believed to be some kind of chumash

1624
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000
believed to be some kind of chumash
 

1625
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,070
believed to be some kind of chumash
initiation site so we can say that there

1627
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,750
initiation site so we can say that there
is initial

you know archaeochemical data for the

1630
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440
you know archaeochemical data for the
 

1631
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,269
you know archaeochemical data for the
consumption of psychedelics and cave art

1632
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:41,279
consumption of psychedelics and cave art
 

1633
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,070
consumption of psychedelics and cave art
and so where else might we find this

00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,080
and so where else might we find this
 

1635
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,070
and so where else might we find this
are there a lot of archaeochemists in

university has stood up a dedicated
 

1697
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,909
university has stood up a dedicated
center a team really which is what you

1698
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
center a team really which is what you
 

1699
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,710
center a team really which is what you
need

1700
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:54,720
need
 

1701
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,630
need
of archaeochemists looking at this stuff

1702
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:56,640
of archaeochemists looking at this stuff
 

1703
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,149
of archaeochemists looking at this stuff
but i mean even despite that there have

1704
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,159
but i mean even despite that there have
 

1705
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,149
but i mean even despite that there have
been some remarkable discoveries

1706
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:00,159
been some remarkable discoveries
 

1707
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,070
been some remarkable discoveries
over the past 10 20 years it's still a

1708
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
over the past 10 20 years it's still a
 

1709
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,990
over the past 10 20 years it's still a
discipline very much in its infancy

1710
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,000
discipline very much in its infancy
 

1711
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,149
discipline very much in its infancy
maybe it's becoming a toddler but as the

1712
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159
maybe it's becoming a toddler but as the
 

1713
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,750
maybe it's becoming a toddler but as the
technology gets better and cheaper um i

1714
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
technology gets better and cheaper um i
 

1715
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,269
technology gets better and cheaper um i
hope uh you'll see more and more

1716
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
hope uh you'll see more and more
 

1717
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,549
hope uh you'll see more and more
archaeochemists

1718
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:12,559
archaeochemists
 

1719
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,029
archaeochemists
joining the fight yeah and andrew is

1720
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,039
joining the fight yeah and andrew is
 

1721
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,029
joining the fight yeah and andrew is
fascinating his work is fascinating but

1722
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:17,039
fascinating his work is fascinating but
 

1723
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,350
fascinating his work is fascinating but
uh also i just because of because of

1724
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
uh also i just because of because of
 

1725
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,750
uh also i just because of because of
your work i came across an exchange a

1726
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:21,760
your work i came across an exchange a
 

1727
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,389
your work i came across an exchange a
few emails with patrick mcgovern

1728
00:31:24,389 --> 00:31:24,399
few emails with patrick mcgovern
 

1729
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,230
few emails with patrick mcgovern
who's basically what would you call him

1730
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,240
who's basically what would you call him
 

1731
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,549
who's basically what would you call him
so he has a center i guess that's

1732
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
so he has a center i guess that's
 

1733
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,389
so he has a center i guess that's
does biomolecular archaeology at upenn

history his work was some of the first
 

1777
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,870
history his work was some of the first
hard scientific data that i saw for the

1778
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
hard scientific data that i saw for the
 

1779
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,590
hard scientific data that i saw for the
ritual consumption of these intoxicants

1780
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
ritual consumption of these intoxicants
 

1781

um i don't think he's ever found

1782
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
um i don't think he's ever found
 

1783
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,070
um i don't think he's ever found
the hard and fast data for for

1784
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,080
the hard and fast data for for
 

1785
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,830
the hard and fast data for for
psychedelics but what he turned me on to

um because i really do think in many

3184
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:43,920
um because i really do think in many
 

3185
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,309
um because i really do think in many
ways as the fog of the war drug is

3186
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:46,319
ways as the fog of the war drug is
 

3187

ways as the fog of the war drug is
ending

3188

that we we've kind of come full circle
 

3193
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:52,710
that we we've kind of come full circle
back to

3194
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:52,720
back to
 

3195
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,589
back to
the late 1950s which might sound strange

3196
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
the late 1950s which might sound strange
 

3197
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,109
the late 1950s which might sound strange
um it'll make more sense when you hear

3198
00:57:57,109 --> 00:57:57,119
um it'll make more sense when you hear
 

3199
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:58,710
um it'll make more sense when you hear
what huxley said about psychedelics and

3200
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:58,720
what huxley said about psychedelics and
 

3201

01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,550
i think that we've we've lost the
coordinates to these irrational states

4356
01:18:58,550 --> 01:18:58,560
coordinates to these irrational states
 

4357
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,470
coordinates to these irrational states
again that were prized throughout

4358
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480
again that were prized throughout
 

4359
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,709
again that were prized throughout
antiquity and that continued to be

4360
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:02,719
antiquity and that continued to be
 

4361
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,110
antiquity and that continued to be
prized by the mystical communities even

4362
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,120
prized by the mystical communities even
 

4363
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,550
prized by the mystical communities even
in big organized religion it just

4364
01:19:06,550 --> 01:19:06,560
in big organized religion it just
 

4365
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,950
in big organized religion it just
doesn't filter out that much and so

4366
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:08,960
doesn't filter out that much and so
 

4367
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,750
doesn't filter out that much and so
psychedelics in my mind

4368
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:11,760
psychedelics in my mind
 

4369
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,510
psychedelics in my mind
help orient

4370
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:13,520
help orient
 

4371
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,550
help orient
our minds bodies and souls towards the

4372
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:16,560
our minds bodies and souls towards the
 

4373
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,229
our minds bodies and souls towards the
irrational right we talked about

4374
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:18,239
irrational right we talked about
 

4375
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:21,750
irrational right we talked about
mckenna's invisible world that seems to

4376
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:21,760
mckenna's invisible world that seems to
 

4377
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,070
mckenna's invisible world that seems to
have this symbiosis with our own and

4378
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:24,080
have this symbiosis with our own and
 

4379
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,790
have this symbiosis with our own and
perhaps has this higher intent for us um

4380
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
perhaps has this higher intent for us um
 

4381
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,070
perhaps has this higher intent for us um
you could very well

4382
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:28,080
you could very well
 

4383
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,149
you could very well
just you know take catalog of your

4384
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:30,159
just you know take catalog of your
 

4385
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:32,470
just you know take catalog of your
dreams right and that would do it too

4386
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,480
dreams right and that would do it too
 

4387
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,950
dreams right and that would do it too
but psychedelics seem to be particularly

4388
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:34,960
but psychedelics seem to be particularly
 

4389
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,390
but psychedelics seem to be particularly
fast acting um particularly potent and

4390
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:38,400
fast acting um particularly potent and
 

4391
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,870
fast acting um particularly potent and
very reliable especially in the clinical

4392
01:19:40,870 --> 01:19:40,880
very reliable especially in the clinical
 

4393
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,110
very reliable especially in the clinical
studies and so i looked at them as as

4394
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:43,120
studies and so i looked at them as as
 

4395
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,189
studies and so i looked at them as as
biochemical discoveries like like huxley

4396
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:45,199
biochemical discoveries like like huxley
 

4397
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,110
biochemical discoveries like like huxley
did maybe it's once

4398
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:47,120
did maybe it's once
 

4399
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,390
did maybe it's once
in your life or infrequently right but

4400
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
in your life or infrequently right but
 

4401
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,470
in your life or infrequently right but
maybe that's the beginning of a genuine

4402
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:52,480
maybe that's the beginning of a genuine
 

4403
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,510
maybe that's the beginning of a genuine
introspection and a life well examined

4404
01:19:55,510 --> 01:19:55,520
introspection and a life well examined
 

4405
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,350
introspection and a life well examined
as the ancients always instructed us

4406
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:57,360
as the ancients always instructed us
 

4407
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,110
as the ancients always instructed us
yeah it does seem like in the research

4408
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
yeah it does seem like in the research
 

4409
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,070
yeah it does seem like in the research
that's

4410
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:00,080
that's
 

4411
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,470
that's
the effect of psychedelics always comes

4412
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:02,480
the effect of psychedelics always comes
 

4413
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,510
the effect of psychedelics always comes
with the integration where you

4414
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:05,520
with the integration where you
 

4415
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,229
with the integration where you
use it just like you said as a catalyst

4416
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:08,239
use it just like you said as a catalyst
 

4417
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:10,709
use it just like you said as a catalyst
for thinking through stuff it's not it's

4418
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:10,719
for thinking through stuff it's not it's
 

4419
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:12,629
for thinking through stuff it's not it's
not going to be

4420
01:20:12,629 --> 01:20:12,639
not going to be
 

4421
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,350
not going to be
i don't even know if google maps

4422
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:15,360
i don't even know if google maps
 

4423
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,189
i don't even know if google maps
oh maybe maybe google maps is the right

4424
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:17,199
oh maybe maybe google maps is the right
 

4425
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,189
oh maybe maybe google maps is the right
analogy but it doesn't do the driving

4426
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:19,199
analogy but it doesn't do the driving
 

4427
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:20,870
analogy but it doesn't do the driving
for you

4428
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:20,880
for you
 

4429
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,189
for you
you still have to do the driving uh it

4430
01:20:23,189 --> 01:20:23,199
you still have to do the driving uh it
 

4431
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,669
you still have to do the driving uh it
just kind of gives you the directions

4432
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679
just kind of gives you the directions
 

4433
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:28,149
just kind of gives you the directions
uh so after you come come down from the

4434
01:20:28,149 --> 01:20:28,159
uh so after you come come down from the
 

4435
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:31,350
uh so after you come come down from the
trip or whatever you still have to drive

4436
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:31,360
trip or whatever you still have to drive
 

4437
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,709
trip or whatever you still have to drive
there's other tools that are kind of

4438
01:20:32,709 --> 01:20:32,719
there's other tools that are kind of
 

4439
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:33,910
there's other tools that are kind of
interesting we've been talking about

4440
01:20:33,910 --> 01:20:33,920
interesting we've been talking about
 

4441
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,350
interesting we've been talking about
this um

4442
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:35,360
this um
 

4443
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:37,430
this um
at the psychological level but there's

4444
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:37,440
at the psychological level but there's
 

4445
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,590
at the psychological level but there's
also a neuroscience perspective if we

4446
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:39,600
also a neuroscience perspective if we
 

4447
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,590
also a neuroscience perspective if we
kind of like go past the skull into the

4448
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:41,600
kind of like go past the skull into the
 

4449
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,070
kind of like go past the skull into the
brain with the neurons firing there's

4450
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,080
brain with the neurons firing there's
 

4451
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,390
brain with the neurons firing there's
ideas of brain computer interfaces first

4452
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:46,400
ideas of brain computer interfaces first
 

4453
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,350
ideas of brain computer interfaces first
of all there's a whole field of

4454
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,360
of all there's a whole field of
 

4455
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,110
of all there's a whole field of
neuroscience that's kind of zooming in

4456
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,120
neuroscience that's kind of zooming in
 

4457
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,030
neuroscience that's kind of zooming in
and studying the firing of the brain the

4458
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,040
and studying the firing of the brain the
 

4459
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,189
and studying the firing of the brain the
firing of the neurons in the brain

4460
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:53,199
firing of the neurons in the brain
 

4461
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:56,229
firing of the neurons in the brain
of how from those

4462
01:20:56,229 --> 01:20:56,239
of how from those
 

4463
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,950
of how from those
neurons emerges all the things that we

4464
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:58,960
neurons emerges all the things that we
 

4465
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,229
neurons emerges all the things that we
think that make us human that's a

4466
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:00,239
think that make us human that's a
 

4467
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:01,750
think that make us human that's a
fascinating exploration in the human

01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:39,760
i think that's
 

4563
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,229
i think that's
a winning combination um you know part

4577
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,229
environment is going to work i think
it'd probably work a lot better

4578
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:54,239
it'd probably work a lot better

with that myth and ritual incorporated
so the reason ellucis worked for 2 000

4582
01:22:59,430 --> 01:22:59,440
so the reason ellucis worked for 2 000
 

4583
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,550
so the reason ellucis worked for 2 000
years

4584
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:00,560
years
 

4585
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,310
years
and let's assume the psychedelic

4586
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:02,320
and let's assume the psychedelic
 

4587
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,550
and let's assume the psychedelic
hypothesis has some merit to it

4588
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
hypothesis has some merit to it
 

4589
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,310
hypothesis has some merit to it
but i think the reason it worked is

4590
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:06,320
but i think the reason it worked is
 

4591
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,790
but i think the reason it worked is
because you were born into a mythology

preparing for a few months it was a
 

4603
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,709
preparing for a few months it was a
lifetime of expectation anticipation

4604

they were between the years 1995 and
 

4653
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,470
they were between the years 1995 and
2005 you would describe them

4654
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:16,480
2005 you would describe them
 

4655
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,030
2005 you would describe them
as a fairly damaged person and yet who

4656

4661
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:26,149
western civilization between 900 and

4662
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,159
1300 let alone 2500 years ago so this is
 

4663
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,510
1300 let alone 2500 years ago so this is
in many ways the prophet of the

01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,520
in many ways the prophet of the
 

4665
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,189
in many ways the prophet of the
psychedelic renaissance saying that

5155
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,350
way weirder
uh than we can imagine that's and

5156

anyway that to me is humbling and so i

anyway that to me is humbling and so i
 

5161
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:39,669
anyway that to me is humbling and so i
it's almost like with the simulation

5162
01:33:39,669 --> 01:33:39,679
it's almost like with the simulation
 

5163
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:42,149
it's almost like with the simulation
uh conceding in the world of simulation

5164
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:42,159
uh conceding in the world of simulation

thinking of aliens to me is a useful

thought experiment of like what would

01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:45,760
thought experiment of like what would
 

5169
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:48,390

aliens look like if they visited how

5170
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:48,400
aliens look like if they visited how
 

5171
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,990
aliens look like if they visited how
would we know how would we communicate

5172
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:50,000
would we know how would we communicate
 

5173
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,510
would we know how would we communicate
with them how do we send signals to them

5174
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:53,520
with them how do we send signals to them
 

5175
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,629
with them how do we send signals to them
uh if they're already here

5176
01:33:56,629 --> 01:33:56,639
uh if they're already here
 

5177
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,790
uh if they're already here
and we don't see them how's that

5178
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:58,800
and we don't see them how's that
 

5179
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,990
and we don't see them how's that
possible

5180
01:33:59,990 --> 01:34:00,000
possible
 

5181
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,910
possible
that seems to me actually likely it

5182
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:01,920
that seems to me actually likely it
 

5183
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:03,669
that seems to me actually likely it
would just be too self-centered and too

5184
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:03,679
would just be too self-centered and too
 

5185
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,669
would just be too self-centered and too
dumb to see them if they're already here

5186
01:34:05,669 --> 01:34:05,679
dumb to see them if they're already here
 

5187
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:10,070
dumb to see them if they're already here
anyway uh but so that's kind of the

5188
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:10,080
anyway uh but so that's kind of the
 

5189
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,310
anyway uh but so that's kind of the
almost the the the pragmatic the

01:42:12,229 --> 01:42:12,239
no i do also hope psychedelics can help
 

5639
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,149
no i do also hope psychedelics can help
so how do you build that i'm curious

5640
01:42:14,149 --> 01:42:14,159
so how do you build that i'm curious
 

5641
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:16,229
so how do you build that i'm curious
that's a whole other discussion

5642
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:16,239
that's a whole other discussion
 

5643
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:17,669
that's a whole other discussion
this is uh

5644
01:42:17,669 --> 01:42:17,679
this is uh
 

5645
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:18,950
this is uh
there's a lot of things i can say here

5646
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:18,960
there's a lot of things i can say here
 

5647
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,270
there's a lot of things i can say here
but let me put simply

5648
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:21,280
but let me put simply
 

5649
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,830
but let me put simply
is i believe

5650
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:23,840
is i believe
 

5651
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:24,870
is i believe
that

5652
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:24,880
that
 

5653
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,390
that
you can go

5654
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,400
you can go
 

5655
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,910
you can go
a long way

5656
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:29,920

 

5657
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:30,870

building

5658
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:30,880
building
 

5659
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,870
building
towards building consciousness

5660
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:32,880
towards building consciousness
 

5661
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,550
towards building consciousness
by trying to fake

5662
01:42:34,550 --> 01:42:34,560
by trying to fake
 

5663
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,709
by trying to fake
consciousness

5664
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:36,719
consciousness
 

5665
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:39,030
consciousness
so fake it till you make it

5666
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:39,040
so fake it till you make it
 

5667
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,109
so fake it till you make it
as an engineering approach i think will

5668
01:42:41,109 --> 01:42:41,119
as an engineering approach i think will
 

5669
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:43,130
as an engineering approach i think will
work for consciousness

5670
01:42:43,130 --> 01:42:43,140
work for consciousness
 

5671
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:45,189
work for consciousness
[Laughter]

5672
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:45,199
[Laughter]
 

5673
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,510
[Laughter]
you seem satisfied with that i i'm

5674
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:47,520
you seem satisfied with that i i'm
 

5675
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:49,750
you seem satisfied with that i i'm
satisfied with that because i know how

5676
01:42:49,750 --> 01:42:49,760
satisfied with that because i know how
 

5677
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:52,310
satisfied with that because i know how
deeply unsatisfied others are

5678
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:52,320
deeply unsatisfied others are
 

5679
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,350
deeply unsatisfied others are
but just wait

5680
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:55,360

 

5681
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:57,270

so

5682
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:57,280
so
 

5683
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,830
so
i mean i don't know what to so most most

5684
01:42:59,830 --> 01:42:59,840
i mean i don't know what to so most most
 

5685
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,709
i mean i don't know what to so most most
the the the topic of consciousness is

5686
01:43:02,709 --> 01:43:02,719
the the the topic of consciousness is
 

5687
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,229
the the the topic of consciousness is
mostly handled by philosophers currently

5688
01:43:06,229 --> 01:43:06,239
mostly handled by philosophers currently
 

5689
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:07,510
mostly handled by philosophers currently
and

5690
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:07,520
and
 

5691
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,950
and
that's great uh and their

5692
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:10,960
that's great uh and their
 

5693
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:12,550
that's great uh and their
philosophers are wonderful and good at

5694
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:12,560
philosophers are wonderful and good at
 

5695
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,350
philosophers are wonderful and good at
what they do i'm not a philosopher i'm

5696
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:15,360
what they do i'm not a philosopher i'm
 

5697
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,750
what they do i'm not a philosopher i'm
an engineer and i think the approach

5698
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:17,760
an engineer and i think the approach
 

5699
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,669
an engineer and i think the approach
there is quite different

5700
01:43:19,669 --> 01:43:19,679
there is quite different
 

5701
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:24,310
there is quite different
i think

5702
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,320

 

5703
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,669

in love

5704
01:43:25,669 --> 01:43:25,679
in love
 

5705
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:26,950
in love
is different

5706
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:26,960
is different
 

5707
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,950
is different
than trying to have a podcast

5708
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
than trying to have a podcast
 

5709
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,430
than trying to have a podcast
conversation about what is love

5710
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:31,440
conversation about what is love
 

5711
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:32,709
conversation about what is love
uh

5712
01:43:32,709 --> 01:43:32,719
uh
 

5713
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:36,390
uh
you know i i think the engineering

5714
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:36,400
you know i i think the engineering
 

5715
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,550
you know i i think the engineering
effort is just fundamentally different

5716
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:38,560
effort is just fundamentally different
 

5717
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,350
effort is just fundamentally different
than the philosophical effort and i

5718
01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:41,360
than the philosophical effort and i
 

5719
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:43,030
than the philosophical effort and i
have a sense that consciousness can be

5720
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:43,040
have a sense that consciousness can be
 

5721
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:44,390
have a sense that consciousness can be
engineered

5722
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:44,400
engineered
 

5723
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,229
engineered
even before it is understood by the

5724
01:43:46,229 --> 01:43:46,239
even before it is understood by the
 

5725
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,149
even before it is understood by the
philosophers so i think there's a bunch

5726
01:43:48,149 --> 01:43:48,159
philosophers so i think there's a bunch
 

5727
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:50,470
philosophers so i think there's a bunch
of things like that in this world that

5728
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:50,480
of things like that in this world that
 

5729
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:51,750
of things like that in this world that
could be engineered before they're

5730
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:51,760
could be engineered before they're
 

5731
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,310
could be engineered before they're
understood i think the intelligence is

5732
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:54,320
understood i think the intelligence is
 

5733
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,030
understood i think the intelligence is
one such thing i think we'll be we'll

5734
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,040
one such thing i think we'll be we'll
 

5735
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,709
one such thing i think we'll be we'll
we'll be able to engineer

5736
01:43:58,709 --> 01:43:58,719
we'll be able to engineer
 

5737
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:00,629
we'll be able to engineer
super intelligent beings before we're

5738
01:44:00,629 --> 01:44:00,639
super intelligent beings before we're
 

5739
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:03,590
super intelligent beings before we're
able to understand the human mind

5740
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:03,600
able to understand the human mind
 

5741
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,830
able to understand the human mind
that's

5742
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:04,840
that's
 

5743
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,350
that's
um yeah i mean

5744
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:07,360
um yeah i mean
 

5745
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,790
um yeah i mean
there's less there's a lot of intuition

5746
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:08,800
there's less there's a lot of intuition
 

5747
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:12,870
there's less there's a lot of intuition
to unpack there of why that is but um

5748
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:12,880
to unpack there of why that is but um
 

5749
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,229
to unpack there of why that is but um
as it stands

5750
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:14,239
as it stands
 

5751
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,470
as it stands
that's perhaps my engineering

5752
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:16,480
that's perhaps my engineering
 

5753
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,950
that's perhaps my engineering
um optimism and engineering ethic under

5754
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:18,960
um optimism and engineering ethic under
 

5755
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,430
um optimism and engineering ethic under
which i operate

5756
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,440
which i operate
 

5757
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,430
which i operate
consciousness is easy to build hard to

5758
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:23,440
consciousness is easy to build hard to
 

5759
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,790
consciousness is easy to build hard to

the amount of books you read is uh
 

5781
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,910
the amount of books you read is uh
i cannot even imagine so is there

5782
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:45,920
i cannot even imagine so is there
 

5783
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,910
i cannot even imagine so is there
something in those in that in those in

that stuck with you that was especially

5790
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:54,400
that stuck with you that was especially
 

5791
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,149
that stuck with you that was especially
impactful i mentioned a couple of them

5792
01:44:56,149 --> 01:44:56,159
impactful i mentioned a couple of them
 

5793
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,270
impactful i mentioned a couple of them
but

5794
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:57,280
but
 

5795
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,390
but
so i i knew nothing about psychedelics

5796
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:00,400
so i i knew nothing about psychedelics
 

5797
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,550
so i i knew nothing about psychedelics
before 2007.

5798
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:02,560
before 2007.
 

5799
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:04,790
before 2007.
and it was in in hearing about some of

5800
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:04,800
and it was in in hearing about some of
 

5801
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:06,310
and it was in in hearing about some of
the first psilocybin experiments at

5802
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:06,320
the first psilocybin experiments at
 

5803
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,790
the first psilocybin experiments at
hopkins and then shortly thereafter

5804
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:08,800
