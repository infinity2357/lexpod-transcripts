is
 

133
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,630
is
this state of being conscious which is a

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
this state of being conscious which is a
 

135
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,390
this state of being conscious which is a
software state and software doesn't have

software state and software doesn't have
 

137
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,670
software state and software doesn't have
an identity it's a physical law

138
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:37,680
an identity it's a physical law
 

139
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,750
an identity it's a physical law
and it's a law that acts in all of us

140
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
and it's a law that acts in all of us
 

141
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,670
and it's a law that acts in all of us
and it's embedded in a suitable

142
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
and it's embedded in a suitable
 

143
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,030
and it's embedded in a suitable
substrate and we didn't pick that

144
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
substrate and we didn't pick that
 

145
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,589
substrate and we didn't pick that
substrate right we are mostly randomly

146
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
substrate right we are mostly randomly
 

147
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,070
substrate right we are mostly randomly
instantiated on it and there all these

148
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
instantiated on it and there all these
 

149
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,589
instantiated on it and there all these
individuals and

150
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:49,599
individuals and
 

151
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,750
individuals and
everybody has to be one of them

152
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
everybody has to be one of them
 

153
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,830
everybody has to be one of them
and uh eventually you're stuck on one of

154
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
and uh eventually you're stuck on one of
 

155
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,390
and uh eventually you're stuck on one of
them and um have to deal with that so

156
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
them and um have to deal with that so
 

157
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,910
them and um have to deal with that so
you're like a leaf floating down the

158
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
you're like a leaf floating down the
 

159
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,110
you're like a leaf floating down the
river

160
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
river
 

161
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,790
river
you just have to accept that there's a

162
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
you just have to accept that there's a
 

163
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,309
you just have to accept that there's a
river and you just

164
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319

 

165
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,190

that you are an agent is a construct

166
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
that you are an agent is a construct
 

167
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,350
that you are an agent is a construct
right what part of that is actually

168
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
right what part of that is actually
 

169
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,030
right what part of that is actually
under your control

170
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
under your control
 

171
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,589
under your control
and i think that our consciousness is

172
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
and i think that our consciousness is
 

173
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,830
and i think that our consciousness is
largely a control model for our own

174
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
largely a control model for our own
 

175
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,509
largely a control model for our own
attention so we

176
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
attention so we
 

177
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,589
attention so we
notice where we are looking and we can

178
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
notice where we are looking and we can
 

179
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,110
notice where we are looking and we can
influence what we are looking how we are

180
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
influence what we are looking how we are
 

181
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,869
influence what we are looking how we are
disambiguating things how we put things

182
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
disambiguating things how we put things
 

183
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,550
disambiguating things how we put things
together in our mind

184
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
together in our mind
 

185
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,869
together in our mind
and the whole system that runs us is

186
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
and the whole system that runs us is
 

187
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,869
and the whole system that runs us is
this big cybernetic motivational system

188
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
this big cybernetic motivational system
 

189
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,869
this big cybernetic motivational system
so we're basically like a little monkey

190
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
so we're basically like a little monkey
 

191
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,430
so we're basically like a little monkey
sitting on top of an elephant and we can

192
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
sitting on top of an elephant and we can
 

193
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,910
sitting on top of an elephant and we can
put this elephant here and there to go

194
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
put this elephant here and there to go
 

195
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,149
put this elephant here and there to go
this way or that way and we might have

196
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
this way or that way and we might have
 

197
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,070
this way or that way and we might have
the illusion that we are the elephant or

198
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
the illusion that we are the elephant or
 

199
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,589
the illusion that we are the elephant or
that we are telling it what to do and

200
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
that we are telling it what to do and
 

201
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,910
that we are telling it what to do and
sometimes we notice that it walks into a

202
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
sometimes we notice that it walks into a
 

203
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,589
sometimes we notice that it walks into a
completely different direction and we

204
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
completely different direction and we
 

205
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,070
completely different direction and we
didn't set this thing up it just is the

206
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
didn't set this thing up it just is the
 

207
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,550
didn't set this thing up it just is the
situation that we find ourselves in

208
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
situation that we find ourselves in
 

209
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,229
situation that we find ourselves in
how much prodding can we actually do of

210
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
how much prodding can we actually do of
 

211
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,390
how much prodding can we actually do of
the elephant

212
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
the elephant
 

213
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,550
the elephant
a lot but

214
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
a lot but
 

215
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,110
a lot but
i think that our uh consciousness cannot

216
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
i think that our uh consciousness cannot
 

217
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,949
i think that our uh consciousness cannot
create the motive force

218
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
create the motive force
 

219
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,630
create the motive force
is the elephant consciousness in this

220
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
is the elephant consciousness in this
 

221
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,949
is the elephant consciousness in this
metaphor no the monkey

222
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
metaphor no the monkey
 

223
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,550
metaphor no the monkey
is the consciousness the monkey is the

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
is the consciousness the monkey is the
 

225
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,070
is the consciousness the monkey is the
attentional system that is observing

226
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
attentional system that is observing
 

227
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,750
attentional system that is observing
things there is a large perceptual

228
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
things there is a large perceptual
 

229
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,509
things there is a large perceptual
system combined with the motivational

230
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
system combined with the motivational
 

231
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,069
system combined with the motivational
system that is actually providing the

232
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
system that is actually providing the
 

233
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,990
system that is actually providing the
interface to everything and our own

234
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
interface to everything and our own
 

235
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,629
interface to everything and our own
consciousness i think is a tool that

236
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
consciousness i think is a tool that
 

237
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,390
consciousness i think is a tool that
directs the attention of that system

238
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
directs the attention of that system
 

239
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,710
directs the attention of that system
which means it singles out features

240
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
which means it singles out features
 

241
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,030
which means it singles out features
and performs conditional operations for

242
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
and performs conditional operations for
 

243
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,590
and performs conditional operations for
which it needs an index memory but this

244
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
which it needs an index memory but this
 

245
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,670
which it needs an index memory but this
index memory is what we perceive as our

246
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
index memory is what we perceive as our
 

247
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,189
index memory is what we perceive as our
stream of consciousness but the

248
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
stream of consciousness but the
 

249
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,189
stream of consciousness but the
consciousness is not in charge that's an

250
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
consciousness is not in charge that's an
 

251
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,510
consciousness is not in charge that's an
illusion so everything

252
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
illusion so everything
 

253
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,310
illusion so everything
outside of that consciousness

254
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
outside of that consciousness
 

255
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,390
outside of that consciousness
is the elephant so it's the physics of

256
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
is the elephant so it's the physics of
 

257
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,230
is the elephant so it's the physics of
the universe but it's also society

258
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
the universe but it's also society
 

259
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,710
the universe but it's also society
that's outside of europe i would say the

260
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
that's outside of europe i would say the
 

261
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,950
that's outside of europe i would say the
elephant is the agent so there is an

262
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
elephant is the agent so there is an
 

263
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,270
elephant is the agent so there is an
environment which the agent is stomping

264
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
environment which the agent is stomping
 

265
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,670
environment which the agent is stomping
and uh you are influencing a little part

266
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
and uh you are influencing a little part
 

267
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,030
and uh you are influencing a little part
of that agent

268
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
of that agent
 

269
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,670
of that agent
so uh can you is the agent a single

270
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
so uh can you is the agent a single
 

271
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,950
so uh can you is the agent a single
human being

272
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
human being
 

273
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,230
human being
what's what which object has agency

274
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
what's what which object has agency
 

275
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,550
what's what which object has agency
that's an interesting question i think a

276
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
that's an interesting question i think a
 

277
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,430
that's an interesting question i think a
way to think about an agent is that it's

278
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
way to think about an agent is that it's
 

279
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,390
way to think about an agent is that it's
a controller with a set point generator

280
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
a controller with a set point generator
 

281
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,230
a controller with a set point generator
the notion of a controller comes from

282
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
the notion of a controller comes from
 

283
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,110
the notion of a controller comes from
cybernetics and control theory control

284
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
cybernetics and control theory control
 

285
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,469
cybernetics and control theory control
system consists out of a system that is

286
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
system consists out of a system that is
 

287
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,230
system consists out of a system that is
regulating some value and the deviation

288
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
regulating some value and the deviation
 

289
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,150
regulating some value and the deviation
of that value from a set point and it

290
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
of that value from a set point and it
 

291
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,950
of that value from a set point and it
has a sensor that measures the system's

292
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
has a sensor that measures the system's
 

293
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,870
has a sensor that measures the system's
deviation from that set point

294
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
deviation from that set point
 

295
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,670
deviation from that set point
and an effector that can be parametrized

296
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
and an effector that can be parametrized
 

297
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,350
and an effector that can be parametrized
by the controller so the controller

298
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
by the controller so the controller
 

299
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,430
by the controller so the controller
tells the effector to do a certain thing

300
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
tells the effector to do a certain thing
 

301
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,390
tells the effector to do a certain thing
and the goal is to reduce the distance

302
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
and the goal is to reduce the distance
 

303
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,909
and the goal is to reduce the distance
between the set point and the current

304
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
between the set point and the current
 

305
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,110
between the set point and the current
value of the system and there's

306
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
value of the system and there's
 

307
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,189
value of the system and there's
environment which disturbs the regulated

308
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
environment which disturbs the regulated
 

309
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,790
environment which disturbs the regulated
system which brings it away from that

310
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
system which brings it away from that
 

311
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,710
system which brings it away from that
set point so simplest case is the

312
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
set point so simplest case is the
 

313
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,710
set point so simplest case is the
thermostat the thermostat is really

314
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:48,720
thermostat the thermostat is really
 

315
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,150
thermostat the thermostat is really
simple because it doesn't have a model

316
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
simple because it doesn't have a model
 

317
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,830
simple because it doesn't have a model
the thermostat is only trying to

318
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
the thermostat is only trying to
 

319
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,990
the thermostat is only trying to
minimize the set point deviation in the

320
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
minimize the set point deviation in the
 

321
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,749
minimize the set point deviation in the
next moment

322
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
next moment
 

323
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,990
next moment
and if you want to minimize the set

324
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
and if you want to minimize the set
 

325
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,830
and if you want to minimize the set
point deviation over a longer time span

326
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
point deviation over a longer time span
 

327
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,510
point deviation over a longer time span
you need to integrate it you need to

328
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
you need to integrate it you need to
 

329
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,990
you need to integrate it you need to
model what is going to happen so for

330
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
model what is going to happen so for
 

331
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,909
model what is going to happen so for
instance when you think about that your

332
00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:05,919
instance when you think about that your
 

333
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,150
instance when you think about that your
set point is to be comfortable in life

334
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
set point is to be comfortable in life
 

335
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,430
set point is to be comfortable in life
maybe you need to make yourself

336
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
maybe you need to make yourself
 

337
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,110
maybe you need to make yourself
uncomfortable first

338
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
uncomfortable first
 

339
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,790
uncomfortable first
right so you need to make a model of

340
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
right so you need to make a model of
 

341
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,629
right so you need to make a model of
what's going to happen when and this is

342
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
what's going to happen when and this is
 

343
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,950
what's going to happen when and this is
task of the controller is to use its

344
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
task of the controller is to use its
 

345
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,510
task of the controller is to use its
sensors to measure the state of the

346
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,520
sensors to measure the state of the
 

347
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,469
sensors to measure the state of the
environment

348
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
environment
 

349
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,790
environment
and the system that is being regulated

350
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
and the system that is being regulated
 

351
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,790
and the system that is being regulated
and figure out what to do

352
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
and figure out what to do
 

353
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,990
and figure out what to do
and if the task is complex enough the

354
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
and if the task is complex enough the
 

355
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,629
and if the task is complex enough the
set points are complicated enough and if

356
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
set points are complicated enough and if
 

357
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,629
set points are complicated enough and if
the controller has enough capacity and

358
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
the controller has enough capacity and
 

359
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,590
the controller has enough capacity and
enough

360
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
enough
 

361
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,830
enough
sensor feedback then the task of the

362
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
sensor feedback then the task of the
 

363
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,430
sensor feedback then the task of the
controller is to make a model of the

364
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
controller is to make a model of the
 

365
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,189
controller is to make a model of the
entire universe that it's in the

366
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
entire universe that it's in the
 

367
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,870
entire universe that it's in the
conditions under which it exists and of

itself
 

371
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,990
itself
and this is a very complex agent and we

372
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
and this is a very complex agent and we
 

373
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,670
and this is a very complex agent and we
are in that category

374
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
are in that category
 

375
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,629
are in that category
and

376
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:46,639
and
 

377
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,710
and
an agent is not necessarily a thing in

378
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
an agent is not necessarily a thing in
 

379
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,110
an agent is not necessarily a thing in
the universe it's a class of models that

380
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
the universe it's a class of models that
 

381
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,029
the universe it's a class of models that
we use to interpret aspects of the

00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
we use to interpret aspects of the

universe
 

385
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,189
universe
and

386
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
and
 

387
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,110
and
be when we notice the

388
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
be when we notice the
 

389
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,870
be when we notice the
around us a lot of things only make

390
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
around us a lot of things only make
 

391
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,150
around us a lot of things only make
sense at the level that you are

392
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
sense at the level that you are
 

393
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,070
sense at the level that you are
entangled with them is we interpret them

394
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
entangled with them is we interpret them
 

395
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,070
entangled with them is we interpret them
as control systems that make models of

396
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
as control systems that make models of
 

397
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,550
as control systems that make models of
the world and try to minimize their own

398
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
the world and try to minimize their own
 

399
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,710
the world and try to minimize their own
set points so but the models

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
set points so but the models
 

401
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,390
set points so but the models
are the agents

402
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
are the agents
 

403
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,390
are the agents
the agent is a class of model

404
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
the agent is a class of model
 

405
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,070
the agent is a class of model
and we notice that we are an agent

406
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
and we notice that we are an agent
 

407
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,309
and we notice that we are an agent
ourself we are the agent that is using

408
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
ourself we are the agent that is using
 

409
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,710
ourself we are the agent that is using
our own control model to perform actions

410
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
our own control model to perform actions
 

411
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,150
our own control model to perform actions
we notice we

412
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
we notice we
 

413
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,230
we notice we
uh produce a change in the model and

414
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
uh produce a change in the model and
 

415
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,749
uh produce a change in the model and
things in the world change and this is

416
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
things in the world change and this is
 

417
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,189
things in the world change and this is
how we discover

418
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
how we discover
 

419
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,110
how we discover
the idea that we have a body that we are

420
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:27,120
the idea that we have a body that we are
 

421
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,790
the idea that we have a body that we are
situated environment and that we have a

422
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
situated environment and that we have a
 

423
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,110
situated environment and that we have a
first person perspective

424
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
first person perspective
 

425
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,350
first person perspective
still don't understand

426
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
still don't understand
 

427
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,909
still don't understand
what's the best way to think of which

428
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
what's the best way to think of which
 

429
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,309
what's the best way to think of which
object has agency with with respect to

430
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
object has agency with with respect to
 

431
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,749
object has agency with with respect to
human beings

432
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
human beings
 

433
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,430
human beings
is is it the body

434
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
is is it the body
 

435
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,350
is is it the body
is it the brain

436
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
is it the brain
 

437
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,270
is it the brain
is it the contents of the brain that has

438
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
is it the contents of the brain that has
 

439
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,270
is it the contents of the brain that has
agency like what's the actuators that

440
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
agency like what's the actuators that
 

441
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,350
agency like what's the actuators that
you're referring to

442
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
you're referring to
 

443
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,029
you're referring to
what is the controller and where does it

444
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
what is the controller and where does it
 

445
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,670
what is the controller and where does it
reside or is it these impossible things

446
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:53,680
reside or is it these impossible things
 

447
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,589
reside or is it these impossible things
like because i keep trying to ground it

what's the agent in that for humans

456
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
what's the agent in that for humans
 

457
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,029
what's the agent in that for humans
there is not just one it depends on the

458
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
there is not just one it depends on the
 

459
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,710
there is not just one it depends on the
way in which you're looking at the thing

460
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
way in which you're looking at the thing
 

461
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,629
way in which you're looking at the thing
in which you're framing it imagine that

462
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
in which you're framing it imagine that
 

463
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,230
in which you're framing it imagine that
you are

464
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
you are
 

465
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,029
you are
say angela merkel and you are acting on

466
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
say angela merkel and you are acting on
 

467
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,629
say angela merkel and you are acting on
behalf of germany

468
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
behalf of germany
 

469
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,790
behalf of germany
then you could say that germany is the

470
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
then you could say that germany is the
 

471
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,589
then you could say that germany is the
agent and in the mind of angela merkel

472
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
agent and in the mind of angela merkel
 

473
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,230
agent and in the mind of angela merkel
she is germany to some extent because in

474
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
she is germany to some extent because in
 

475
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,469
she is germany to some extent because in
the way in which she acts the destiny of

476
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
the way in which she acts the destiny of
 

477
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,909
the way in which she acts the destiny of
germany changes

478
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:27,919
germany changes
 

479
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,589
germany changes
there are things that she can change

480
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
there are things that she can change
 

481
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,189
there are things that she can change
that basically

482
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
that basically
 

483
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,430
that basically
affect the behavior of that nation state

484
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
affect the behavior of that nation state
 

485
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,430
affect the behavior of that nation state
okay so it's hierarchies of to go to

486
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
okay so it's hierarchies of to go to
 

487
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,430
okay so it's hierarchies of to go to

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
with saying his brains all the way down
 

495
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,910
with saying his brains all the way down
so it's like it's agents all the way

496
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
so it's like it's agents all the way
 

497
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,870
so it's like it's agents all the way
down

498
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
down
 

499
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,870
down
it's agents made up of agents made up of

500
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
it's agents made up of agents made up of
 

501
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,550
it's agents made up of agents made up of
agents like if phanja marco's germany

502
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
agents like if phanja marco's germany
 

503
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,470
agents like if phanja marco's germany
and germany's made up a bunch of people

504
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,480
and germany's made up a bunch of people
 

505
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,790
and germany's made up a bunch of people
and the people are themselves agents

506
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
and the people are themselves agents
 

507
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,949
and the people are themselves agents
in in some kind of context

508
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:00,959
in in some kind of context
 

509
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,269
in in some kind of context
and then people are made up of cells

510
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
and then people are made up of cells
 

511
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,870
and then people are made up of cells
each individual

512
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
each individual
 

513
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,110
each individual
so is it agents all the way down

514
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
so is it agents all the way down
 

515
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,070
so is it agents all the way down
i suspect that has to be like this in

516
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
i suspect that has to be like this in
 

517
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,790
i suspect that has to be like this in
a world where things are self-organizing

518
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:12,800
a world where things are self-organizing
 

519
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,310
a world where things are self-organizing
most of the complexity that we are

520
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
most of the complexity that we are
 

521
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,509
most of the complexity that we are
looking at

522
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
looking at
 

523
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,630
looking at
everything in life is about

524
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
everything in life is about
 

525
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,670
everything in life is about
self-organization yeah so i think up

526
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
self-organization yeah so i think up
 

527
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,110
self-organization yeah so i think up
from the level of

528
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
from the level of
 

529
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,949
from the level of
life you have

530
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:22,959
life you have
 

531
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,150
life you have
agents

532
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
agents
 

533
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,949
agents
and

534
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
and
 

535
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,430
and
below life you rarely have agents

536
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,440
below life you rarely have agents
 

537
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,550
below life you rarely have agents
because

538
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
because
 

539
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,150
because
sometimes you have control systems that

540
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
sometimes you have control systems that
 

541
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,310
sometimes you have control systems that
emerge randomly in nature and try to

542
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
emerge randomly in nature and try to
 

543
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,470
emerge randomly in nature and try to
achieve a set point but

544
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
achieve a set point but
 

545
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,990
achieve a set point but
they're not that interesting agents that

546
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
they're not that interesting agents that
 

547
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,910
they're not that interesting agents that
make models and because to make an

548
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
make models and because to make an
 

549
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,590
make models and because to make an
interesting model of the world you

550
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
interesting model of the world you
 

551
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,350
interesting model of the world you
typically need a system that is true and

552
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
typically need a system that is true and
 

553
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,269
typically need a system that is true and
complete can i ask you a personal

554
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
complete can i ask you a personal
 

555
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,030
complete can i ask you a personal
question

556
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
question
 

557
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,070
question
uh

558
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
uh
 

559
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,829
uh
what's the line between life and

560
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
what's the line between life and
 

561
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,389
what's the line between life and
non-life it's personal because you're

562
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
non-life it's personal because you're
 

563
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,230
non-life it's personal because you're
a life form

564
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
a life form
 

565
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,389
a life form
so what do you think in this

566
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
so what do you think in this
 

567
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,630
so what do you think in this
emerging complexity at which point does

568
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
emerging complexity at which point does
 

569
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,310
emerging complexity at which point does
the thing start being living and have

570
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
the thing start being living and have
 

571
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,070
the thing start being living and have
agency

572
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
agency
 

573
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,509
agency
personally i think that the simplest

574
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
personally i think that the simplest
 

575
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,470
personally i think that the simplest
answer is that life is sales because

576
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
answer is that life is sales because
 

577
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,110
answer is that life is sales because
life is what cells cells biological

578
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
life is what cells cells biological
 

579
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,110
life is what cells cells biological
cells so it's a particular kind of

580
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
cells so it's a particular kind of
 

581
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,790
cells so it's a particular kind of
principle that we have discovered to

582
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
principle that we have discovered to
 

583
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,150
principle that we have discovered to
exist in nature it's modular stuff that

584
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
exist in nature it's modular stuff that
 

585
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,710
exist in nature it's modular stuff that
consists out of

586
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:16,720
consists out of
 

587
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,710
consists out of
basically this dna tape is a read write

588
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
basically this dna tape is a read write
 

589
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,389
basically this dna tape is a read write
head on top of it

590
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
head on top of it
 

591
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,630
head on top of it
that is able to perform arbitrary

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
that is able to perform arbitrary
 

593
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,389
that is able to perform arbitrary
computations and state transitions

594
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
computations and state transitions
 

595
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,190
computations and state transitions
within the cell and it's combined with a

596
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
within the cell and it's combined with a
 

597
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,509
within the cell and it's combined with a
membrane that insulates the cell from

598
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:29,519
membrane that insulates the cell from
 

599
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,790
membrane that insulates the cell from
its environment

600
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
its environment
 

601
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,870
its environment
and there are

602
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
and there are
 

603
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,030
and there are
chemical reactions inside of the cell

604
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
chemical reactions inside of the cell
 

605
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,030
chemical reactions inside of the cell
that are in this equilibrium and the

606
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
that are in this equilibrium and the
 

607
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,430
that are in this equilibrium and the
cell is running in such a way that this

608
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
cell is running in such a way that this
 

609
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,910
cell is running in such a way that this
this equilibrium doesn't disappear and

610
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
this equilibrium doesn't disappear and
 

611
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,190
this equilibrium doesn't disappear and
the cell

612
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
the cell
 

613
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,630
the cell
goes if the cell goes into an

614
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
goes if the cell goes into an
 

615
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,470
goes if the cell goes into an
equilibrium state it dies

616
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
equilibrium state it dies
 

617
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,269
equilibrium state it dies
and it requires something like an neck

618
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
and it requires something like an neck
 

619
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,350
and it requires something like an neck
entropy extractor to maintain this this

620
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
entropy extractor to maintain this this
 

621
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,630
entropy extractor to maintain this this
equilibrium so it's able to harvest like

622
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
equilibrium so it's able to harvest like
 

623
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,470
equilibrium so it's able to harvest like
entropy from its environment and keep

624
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
entropy from its environment and keep
 

625
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,990
entropy from its environment and keep
itself running

626
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
itself running
 

627
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,910
itself running
yeah so there's information and there's

628
00:10:59,910 --> 00:10:59,920
yeah so there's information and there's
 

629
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,110
yeah so there's information and there's
a wall to protect to to to maintain this

630
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,120
a wall to protect to to to maintain this
 

631
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,030
a wall to protect to to to maintain this
disequilibrium but isn't this very

632
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
disequilibrium but isn't this very
 

633
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,870
disequilibrium but isn't this very
earth-centric

634
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
earth-centric
 

635
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,030
earth-centric
like what you're referring to as

636
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
like what you're referring to as
 

637
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,190
like what you're referring to as
i'm not making a normative notion uh you

638
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
i'm not making a normative notion uh you
 

639
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,030
i'm not making a normative notion uh you
could say that there are probably other

640
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
could say that there are probably other
 

641
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,550
could say that there are probably other
things in the universe that are

642
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
things in the universe that are
 

643
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,110
things in the universe that are
cell-like and life-like and you could

644
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
cell-like and life-like and you could
 

645
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,870
cell-like and life-like and you could
also call them life but eventually it's

646
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
also call them life but eventually it's
 

647
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,389
also call them life but eventually it's
just a

648
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
just a
 

649
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,389
just a
willingness of to find an agreement of

650
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
willingness of to find an agreement of
 

651
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,990
willingness of to find an agreement of
how to use the terms

652
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
how to use the terms
 

653
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,990
how to use the terms
i like cells because it's completely

654
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
i like cells because it's completely
 

655
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,230
i like cells because it's completely
co-extensional with the way that we used

656
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
co-extensional with the way that we used
 

657
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,550
co-extensional with the way that we used
the word even before we knew about cells

658
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,560
the word even before we knew about cells
 

659
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,630
the word even before we knew about cells
so people were pointing at some stuff

660
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:32,640
so people were pointing at some stuff
 

661
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,630
so people were pointing at some stuff
and saying this is somehow animate and

662
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
and saying this is somehow animate and
 

663
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,829
and saying this is somehow animate and
this is very different from the

664
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
this is very different from the
 

665
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,750
this is very different from the
non-animated stuff and what's the

666
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
non-animated stuff and what's the
 

667
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,190
non-animated stuff and what's the
difference between the living and the

668
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
difference between the living and the
 

669
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,269
difference between the living and the
dead stuff and it's mostly whether the

670
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
dead stuff and it's mostly whether the
 

671
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,949
dead stuff and it's mostly whether the
cells are working or not

672
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
cells are working or not
 

673
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,509
cells are working or not
and uh also this boundary of life where

674
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
and uh also this boundary of life where
 

675
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,670
and uh also this boundary of life where
we say that for instance a virus is

676
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
we say that for instance a virus is
 

677
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,190
we say that for instance a virus is
basically an information packet that is

678
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
basically an information packet that is
 

679
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,030
basically an information packet that is
subverting the cell and not life by

680
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
subverting the cell and not life by
 

681
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,629
subverting the cell and not life by
itself

682
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
itself
 

683
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,949
itself
that makes sense to me and

684
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
that makes sense to me and
 

685
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,389
that makes sense to me and
it's somewhat arbitrary you could of

686
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
it's somewhat arbitrary you could of
 

687
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,870
it's somewhat arbitrary you could of
course say that systems that permanently

688
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
course say that systems that permanently
 

689
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,629
course say that systems that permanently
maintain a disequilibrium and can

690
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:00,639
maintain a disequilibrium and can
 

691
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,430
maintain a disequilibrium and can
self-replicate are always life

692
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
self-replicate are always life
 

693
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,629
self-replicate are always life
and

694
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
and
 

695
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,990
and
maybe that's a useful definition too but

696
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
maybe that's a useful definition too but
 

697
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,910
maybe that's a useful definition too but
this is eventually just how you want to

698
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:09,920
this is eventually just how you want to
 

699
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,990
this is eventually just how you want to
use the word is it uh so useful for

700
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
use the word is it uh so useful for
 

701
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,069
use the word is it uh so useful for
conversation but

702
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
conversation but
 

703
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,509
conversation but
is it uh

704
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
is it uh
 

705
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,509
is it uh
somehow fundamental to the universe do

706
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
somehow fundamental to the universe do
 

707
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,509
somehow fundamental to the universe do
you think there's a actual line to

708
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
you think there's a actual line to
 

709
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,110
you think there's a actual line to
eventually be drawn between life and

710
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
eventually be drawn between life and
 

711
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,870
eventually be drawn between life and
non-life or is it all a kind of

712
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
non-life or is it all a kind of
 

713
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,509
non-life or is it all a kind of
continuum i don't think it's a continuum

714
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
continuum i don't think it's a continuum
 

715
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,030
continuum i don't think it's a continuum
but there's nothing magical that is

716
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
but there's nothing magical that is
 

717
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,509
but there's nothing magical that is
happening um living systems are a

718
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
happening um living systems are a
 

719
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,190
happening um living systems are a
certain type of machine

720
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
certain type of machine
 

721
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,670
certain type of machine
what about non-living systems is it also

722
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680
what about non-living systems is it also
 

723
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,069
what about non-living systems is it also
a machine there are non-living machines

724
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
a machine there are non-living machines
 

725
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,069
a machine there are non-living machines
but the question is at which point is

726
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
but the question is at which point is
 

727
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,310
but the question is at which point is
the system able to un uh perform

728
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
the system able to un uh perform
 

729
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,350
the system able to un uh perform
arbitrary state transitions in uh to

730
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
arbitrary state transitions in uh to
 

731
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,030
arbitrary state transitions in uh to
make representations

732
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
make representations
 

733
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,190
make representations
and living things can do this and of

734
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
and living things can do this and of
 

735
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,870
and living things can do this and of
course we can also build non-living

736
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
course we can also build non-living
 

737
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,710
course we can also build non-living
things that can do this but we don't

738
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:50,720
things that can do this but we don't
 

739
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,670
things that can do this but we don't
know anything in nature that is not a

740
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
know anything in nature that is not a
 

741
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,629
know anything in nature that is not a
cell

742
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
cell
 

743
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,389
cell
and is not created by the lola life that

744
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
and is not created by the lola life that
 

745
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,030
and is not created by the lola life that
is able to do that

746
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
is able to do that
 

747
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,150
is able to do that
not

748
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
not
 

749
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,949
not
not only do we not know

750
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
not only do we not know
 

751
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,470
not only do we not know
i don't think we have the tools to see

752
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
i don't think we have the tools to see
 

753
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,069
i don't think we have the tools to see
otherwise

754
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,079
otherwise
 

755
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,870
otherwise
i always worry that we we

756
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:08,880
i always worry that we we
 

757
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,190
i always worry that we we
look at the world too narrowly

758
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
look at the world too narrowly
 

759
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,829
look at the world too narrowly
like we have there could be life

760
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
like we have there could be life
 

761
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,829
like we have there could be life
of a very different kind right under our

762
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
of a very different kind right under our
 

763
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,870
of a very different kind right under our
noses

764
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
noses
 

765
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,310
noses
that we're just not

766
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
that we're just not
 

767
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,710
that we're just not
seeing because we're not

768
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
seeing because we're not
 

769
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,470
seeing because we're not
either limitations of our cognitive

770
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
either limitations of our cognitive
 

771
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,470
either limitations of our cognitive
capacity or

772
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480
capacity or
 

773
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,030
capacity or
we're just not open-minded enough

774
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
we're just not open-minded enough
 

775
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,750
we're just not open-minded enough
either with the tools of science or just

776
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
either with the tools of science or just
 

777
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,069
either with the tools of science or just
the tools of our own mind

778
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
the tools of our own mind
 

779
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,150
the tools of our own mind
yeah that's possible i find the thought

780
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
yeah that's possible i find the thought
 

781
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,710
yeah that's possible i find the thought
very fascinating and i suspect that many

782
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
very fascinating and i suspect that many
 

783
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,350
very fascinating and i suspect that many
of us ask ourselves since childhood what

784
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
of us ask ourselves since childhood what
 

785
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,870
of us ask ourselves since childhood what
are the things that we are missing what

786
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
are the things that we are missing what
 

787
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,710
are the things that we are missing what
kind of systems and interconnections

788
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
kind of systems and interconnections
 

789
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,750
kind of systems and interconnections
exist

790
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
exist
 

791
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,829
exist
that are outside of our

792
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:46,839
that are outside of our
 

793
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,150
that are outside of our
gaze but the um

794
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,160
gaze but the um
 

795
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,230
gaze but the um
we are looking for it and physics

796
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
we are looking for it and physics
 

797
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,269
we are looking for it and physics
doesn't have much room at the moment

798
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
doesn't have much room at the moment
 

799
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,350
doesn't have much room at the moment
for uh

800
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
for uh
 

801
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,790
for uh
opening up something that would not

802
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
opening up something that would not
 

803
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,949
opening up something that would not
violate the conservation of information

804
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
violate the conservation of information
 

805
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,430
violate the conservation of information
as we know it

806
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
as we know it
 

807
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,910
as we know it
yeah but i i wonder about time time

808
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
yeah but i i wonder about time time
 

809
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,710
yeah but i i wonder about time time
scale and scale spatial scale whether we

810
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
scale and scale spatial scale whether we
 

811
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,110
scale and scale spatial scale whether we
just need to um

812
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
just need to um
 

813
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,430
just need to um
open up our idea of what

814
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:13,440
open up our idea of what
 

815
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,590
open up our idea of what
like how life presents itself it could

816
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
like how life presents itself it could
 

817
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,670
like how life presents itself it could
be operating in a much slower time scale

818
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
be operating in a much slower time scale
 

819
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,150
be operating in a much slower time scale
yeah a much faster time scale

820
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
yeah a much faster time scale
 

821
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:20,949
yeah a much faster time scale
and

822
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
and
 

823
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,189
and
it's almost sad to think that there's

it's almost sad to think that there's
all this life around us that we're not

all this life around us that we're not

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
like
 

831
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,629
like
thinking in terms of the right of the

it seems to me that life is the main

it seems to me that life is the main

it seems to me that life is the main

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,350
by processing information in such a way
that you can perform reactions that

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
that you can perform reactions that
 

881
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,670
that you can perform reactions that

would not be possible for dump systems
 

883
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,269
would not be possible for dump systems
and this means that you can harvest neck

884
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279
and this means that you can harvest neck

yeah in some sense the purpose of life
 

893
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,030
yeah in some sense the purpose of life
is to create complexity

is to create complexity
yeah

896
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:46,079
yeah
 

897
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,670
yeah

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,629
at some point
right so every if you see this

940
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
right so every if you see this
 

941
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,949
right so every if you see this

usually the beginning of an s-curve
where something eventually reaches

where something eventually reaches
 

947
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,470
where something eventually reaches
saturation and the s-curve is the

948
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
saturation and the s-curve is the
 

949
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,150
saturation and the s-curve is the
beginning of some kind of bump that goes

there is

956
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
there is
 

957
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,550
there is
just the thing that when you are in

958
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
just the thing that when you are in
 

959
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,150
just the thing that when you are in
sight of an evolution of life you are on

sight of an evolution of life you are on
 

961
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,150
sight of an evolution of life you are on

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
by life and during uh that happening you
 

967
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,870
by life and during uh that happening you
see an increase in complexity

968
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:02,880
see an increase in complexity
 

969
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,309
see an increase in complexity
because life forms are competing with

970
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
because life forms are competing with
 

971
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,510
because life forms are competing with
each other to get more and more and a

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,160
that's a gradual beautiful process like
 

979
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,350
that's a gradual beautiful process like
that's almost

980
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
that's almost
 

981
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,110
that's almost
you know follows a process akin to

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
you know follows a process akin to

you know follows a process akin to

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
and quickly
 

991
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,950
and quickly
so usually there's some kind of

992
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
so usually there's some kind of
 

993
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,430
so usually there's some kind of
catastrophic event well the roman empire

994
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
catastrophic event well the roman empire
 

995
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,830
catastrophic event well the roman empire
took a long time

996
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:33,840
took a long time
 

997
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,710
took a long time
uh

998
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
uh
 

999
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,710
uh
but that's would that be would you

1000
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
but that's would that be would you
 

1001
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,630
but that's would that be would you
classify this as a decrease in

1002
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
classify this as a decrease in
 

1003
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,870
classify this as a decrease in
complexity though yes i think that this

1004
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
complexity though yes i think that this
 

1005
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,870
complexity though yes i think that this
uh size of the cities that could be fed

1006
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
uh size of the cities that could be fed
 

1007
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,190
uh size of the cities that could be fed
has decreased dramatically and you could

1008
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,200
has decreased dramatically and you could
 

1009
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,029
has decreased dramatically and you could
see that the quality of the art

1010
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
see that the quality of the art
 

1011
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,909
see that the quality of the art
decreased and it did so gradually

1012
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:49,919
decreased and it did so gradually
 

1013
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:50,710
decreased and it did so gradually
and

1014
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
and
 

1015
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,150
and
maybe

1016
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
maybe
 

1017
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,830
maybe
future generations when they look at the

1018
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
future generations when they look at the
 

1019
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,549
future generations when they look at the
history of the united states in the 21st

1020
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
history of the united states in the 21st
 

1021
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,710
history of the united states in the 21st
century will also talk about the gradual

1022
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
century will also talk about the gradual
 

1023
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,150
century will also talk about the gradual
decline not something that suddenly

1024
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
decline not something that suddenly
 

1025
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,510
decline not something that suddenly
happens

1026
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,520

 

1027
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,590

do you have a sense of where we are

1028
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
do you have a sense of where we are
 

1029
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,070
do you have a sense of where we are
are we on the exponential rise are we at

1030
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
are we on the exponential rise are we at
 

1031
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,190
are we on the exponential rise are we at
the peak

1032
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
the peak
 

1033
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,190
the peak
or are we the downslope

1034
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
or are we the downslope
 

1035
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,909
or are we the downslope
of the the united states empire it's

1036
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
of the the united states empire it's
 

1037
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,830
of the the united states empire it's
very hard to say from a single human

1038
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
very hard to say from a single human
 

1039
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,350
very hard to say from a single human
perspective but

1040
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:19,360
perspective but
 

1041
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,710
perspective but
i it seems to me that we are probably

1042
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
i it seems to me that we are probably
 

1043
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,270
i it seems to me that we are probably
at the peak

1044
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
at the peak
 

1045
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,870
at the peak
i think that's probably the definition

1046
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
i think that's probably the definition
 

1047
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,590
i think that's probably the definition
of like optimism and cynicism

1048
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
of like optimism and cynicism
 

1049
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,830
of like optimism and cynicism
so my nature of optimism is i think

1050
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
so my nature of optimism is i think
 

1051
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,750
so my nature of optimism is i think
we're on the rise

1052
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760

 

1053
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,549

but

1054
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
but
 

1055
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,310
but
uh i think it's just all a matter of

1056
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
uh i think it's just all a matter of
 

1057
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,710
uh i think it's just all a matter of
perspective nobody knows but i do think

1058
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
perspective nobody knows but i do think
 

1059
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,190
perspective nobody knows but i do think
that erroring on the side of optimism

1060
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
that erroring on the side of optimism
 

1061
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,270
that erroring on the side of optimism
like you need a sufficient number

1062
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:45,280
like you need a sufficient number
 

1063
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,430
like you need a sufficient number
you need a minimum number of optimists

1064
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
you need a minimum number of optimists
 

1065
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,590
you need a minimum number of optimists
in order to make that up thing actually

1066
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
in order to make that up thing actually
 

1067
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,870
in order to make that up thing actually
work

1068
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
work
 

1069
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,549
work
and so i tend to be on the side of the

1070
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
and so i tend to be on the side of the
 

1071
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,950
and so i tend to be on the side of the
optimists i think that we are basically

1072
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:54,960
optimists i think that we are basically
 

1073
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,870
optimists i think that we are basically
a species of grasshoppers that have

1074
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
a species of grasshoppers that have
 

1075
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,549
a species of grasshoppers that have
turned into locusts

1076
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
turned into locusts
 

1077
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,950
turned into locusts
and when you are in that locust mode you

1078
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:00,960
and when you are in that locust mode you
 

1079
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,510
and when you are in that locust mode you
see an amazing rise of population

1080
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
see an amazing rise of population
 

1081
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,270
see an amazing rise of population
numbers and of the

1082
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
numbers and of the
 

1083
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,270
numbers and of the
complexity of the interactions between

1084
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
complexity of the interactions between
 

1085
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,710
complexity of the interactions between
the individuals

1086
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:08,720
the individuals
 

1087
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,070
the individuals
but

1088
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
but
 

1089
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,590
but
it's ultimately the question is is it

1090
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
it's ultimately the question is is it
 

1091
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,950
it's ultimately the question is is it
sustainable see i think we're a bunch of

1092
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
sustainable see i think we're a bunch of
 

1093
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,270
sustainable see i think we're a bunch of
lions and tigers that have become

1094
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,280
lions and tigers that have become
 

1095
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,070
lions and tigers that have become
domesticated cats

1096
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,080
domesticated cats
 

1097
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,830
domesticated cats
to use a different metaphor as i'm not

1098
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:21,840
to use a different metaphor as i'm not
 

1099
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,110
to use a different metaphor as i'm not
exactly sure

1100
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
exactly sure
 

1101
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,750
exactly sure
we're so destructive or just softer

1102
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
we're so destructive or just softer
 

1103
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,590
we're so destructive or just softer
and nicer and lazier

1104
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
and nicer and lazier
 

1105
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,350
and nicer and lazier
but i think we have monkeys and not the

1106
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
but i think we have monkeys and not the
 

1107
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,110
but i think we have monkeys and not the
cats and if you look at the monkeys they

1108
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
cats and if you look at the monkeys they
 

1109
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,190
cats and if you look at the monkeys they
are very busy

1110
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,200
are very busy
 

1111
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,870
are very busy
are the ones that have a lot of sex

1112
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
are the ones that have a lot of sex
 

1113
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,190
are the ones that have a lot of sex
those monkeys not just the bonobos i

1114
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
those monkeys not just the bonobos i
 

1115
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,789
those monkeys not just the bonobos i
think that all the monkeys are basically

1116
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
think that all the monkeys are basically
 

1117
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,470
think that all the monkeys are basically
a discontent species that always needs

1118
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
a discontent species that always needs
 

1119
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,549
a discontent species that always needs
to meddle

1120
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:42,559
to meddle
 

1121
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,789
to meddle
well the gorillas seem to have a little

1122
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
well the gorillas seem to have a little
 

1123
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,150
well the gorillas seem to have a little
bit more of a structure but it's a

1124
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
bit more of a structure but it's a
 

1125
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,060
bit more of a structure but it's a
different different part of the tree

1126
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,070
different different part of the tree
 

1127
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,470
different different part of the tree
[Laughter]

1128
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
[Laughter]
 

1129
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,870
[Laughter]
okay uh you mentioned the elephant and

1130
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
okay uh you mentioned the elephant and
 

1131
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,590
okay uh you mentioned the elephant and
the the monkey riding the elephant

1132
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
the the monkey riding the elephant
 

1133
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,230
the the monkey riding the elephant
and uh consciousness is the monkey

1134
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
and uh consciousness is the monkey
 

1135
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,750
and uh consciousness is the monkey
and there's some prodding that the

1136
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
and there's some prodding that the
 

1137
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,830
and there's some prodding that the
monkey gets to do and sometimes the

1138
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:03,840
monkey gets to do and sometimes the
 

1139
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,070
monkey gets to do and sometimes the
elephant listens

1140
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
elephant listens
 

1141
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,510
elephant listens
i heard you got

me but i heard you got into some
contentious free will discussions

1148
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:13,360
contentious free will discussions
 

1149
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,270
contentious free will discussions

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,470
like that not that i know of
some people on clubhouse told me you

1154
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
some people on clubhouse told me you
 

1155
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,510
some people on clubhouse told me you
made a a bunch of uh um

1156
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
made a a bunch of uh um
 

1157
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,909
made a a bunch of uh um
big debate points about free will well

1158
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:25,919
big debate points about free will well
 

1159
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,710
big debate points about free will well
let me just then ask you where where

1160
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
let me just then ask you where where
 

1161
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,190
let me just then ask you where where
in terms of the monkey and the elephant

1162
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
in terms of the monkey and the elephant
 

1163
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,909
in terms of the monkey and the elephant
uh do you think we land in terms of the

1164
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:33,919
uh do you think we land in terms of the
 

1165
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,149
uh do you think we land in terms of the
illusion of free will how much control

1166
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
illusion of free will how much control
 

1167
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,470
illusion of free will how much control
does the monkey have

1168
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
does the monkey have
 

1169
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,630
does the monkey have
we have to think about what the

1170
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:40,640
we have to think about what the
 

1171
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,110
we have to think about what the
free will is in the first place

1172
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
free will is in the first place
 

1173
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,950
free will is in the first place
we are not the machine we are not the

1174
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
we are not the machine we are not the
 

1175
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,789
we are not the machine we are not the
thing that is making the decisions we

1176
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
thing that is making the decisions we
 

1177
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,549
thing that is making the decisions we
are a model of that decision making

1178
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
are a model of that decision making
 

1179
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,350
are a model of that decision making
process yeah and there is a difference

1180
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
process yeah and there is a difference
 

1181
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,870
process yeah and there is a difference
between

1182
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
between
 

1183
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,710
between
making your own decisions and predicting

1184
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
making your own decisions and predicting
 

1185
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,390
making your own decisions and predicting
your own decisions yes and that

1186
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
your own decisions yes and that
 

1187
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,510
your own decisions yes and that
difference is the first person

1188
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:57,520
difference is the first person
 

1189
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,750

and

1192
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
and
 

1193
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,470
and
what

1194
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
what
 

1195
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,789
what
basically makes decision-making um and

1196
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
basically makes decision-making um and
 

1197
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,630
basically makes decision-making um and

from just automatically doing the best

1200
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
from just automatically doing the best
 

1201
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,230
from just automatically doing the best
thing is

1202
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,240
thing is
 

1203
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,310
thing is
that uh we often don't know what the

1204
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,320
that uh we often don't know what the
 

1205
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,390
that uh we often don't know what the
best thing is we make decisions under

1206
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
best thing is we make decisions under
 

1207
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,870
best thing is we make decisions under
uncertainty we make informed bets using

1208
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:16,880
uncertainty we make informed bets using
 

1209
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,470
uncertainty we make informed bets using
a betting algorithm that we don't yet

1210
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
a betting algorithm that we don't yet
 

1211
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,390
a betting algorithm that we don't yet
understand because we haven't reverse

1212
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:20,400
understand because we haven't reverse

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,310
understand because we haven't reverse
engineered our own mind sufficiently we

1214
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
engineered our own mind sufficiently we
 

1215
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,070
engineered our own mind sufficiently we
don't know the expected rewards we don't

1216
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
don't know the expected rewards we don't
 

1217
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,830
don't know the expected rewards we don't
know the mechanism by which we estimate

1218
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:25,840
know the mechanism by which we estimate
 

1219
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,149
know the mechanism by which we estimate
the rewards and so on but there is

1220
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
the rewards and so on but there is
 

1221
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,950
the rewards and so on but there is
we observe ourselves performing where we

1222
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:30,960
we observe ourselves performing where we
 

1223
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,710
we observe ourselves performing where we
see that uh we evade facts and factors

1224
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
see that uh we evade facts and factors
 

1225
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,669
see that uh we evade facts and factors
and the future and then

1226
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
and the future and then
 

1227
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,750
and the future and then
some kind of possibility some motive

1228
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
some kind of possibility some motive
 

1229
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,510
some kind of possibility some motive
gets raised to an intention

1230
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,520
gets raised to an intention
 

1231
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,190
gets raised to an intention
and that's informed bad that the system

1232
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,200
and that's informed bad that the system
 

1233
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,390
and that's informed bad that the system
is making

1234
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
is making
 

1235
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,470
is making
and that making of the open bet the

1236
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
and that making of the open bet the
 

1237
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,149
and that making of the open bet the
representation of that is what we call

1238
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
representation of that is what we call
 

1239
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,350
representation of that is what we call
free will

1240
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:49,360
free will
 

1241
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,909
free will
and it seems to be paradoxical because

1242
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
and it seems to be paradoxical because
 

1243
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,590
and it seems to be paradoxical because
we think that's the crucial thing is

1244
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:53,600
we think that's the crucial thing is
 

1245
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,630
we think that's the crucial thing is
about it that it's somehow

1246
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
about it that it's somehow
 

1247
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,390
about it that it's somehow
indeterministic

1248
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
indeterministic
 

1249
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,310
indeterministic
and yet if it wasn't deterministic it

1250
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
and yet if it wasn't deterministic it
 

1251
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,230
and yet if it wasn't deterministic it
would be random

1252
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
would be random
 

1253
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,830
would be random
and of course it cannot be random

1254
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
and of course it cannot be random
 

1255
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,669
and of course it cannot be random
because it was if it was random if just

1256
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:03,679
because it was if it was random if just
 

1257
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,190
because it was if it was random if just
dice were being thrown in the universe

1258
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
dice were being thrown in the universe
 

1259
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,950
dice were being thrown in the universe
randomly forces you to do things it

1260
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
randomly forces you to do things it
 

1261
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,350
randomly forces you to do things it
would be meaningless so the important

1262
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,360
would be meaningless so the important
 

1263
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,789
would be meaningless so the important
part of the decisions is always the

1264
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:10,799
part of the decisions is always the
 

1265
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,549
part of the decisions is always the
deterministic stuff

1266
00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:12,559
deterministic stuff
 

1267
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,950
deterministic stuff
but it appears to be indeterministic to

1268
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
but it appears to be indeterministic to
 

1269
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,110
but it appears to be indeterministic to
you because it's unpredictable because

1270
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
you because it's unpredictable because
 

1271
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,870
you because it's unpredictable because
if it was predictable you wouldn't

1272
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:18,880
if it was predictable you wouldn't
 

1273
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,270
if it was predictable you wouldn't
experience it as a free will decision

1274
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,280
experience it as a free will decision
 

1275
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,110
experience it as a free will decision
you would experience it as just doing

1276
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:23,120
you would experience it as just doing
 

1277
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,510
you would experience it as just doing
the necessary right thing

1278
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
the necessary right thing
 

1279
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,070
the necessary right thing
and you see this continuum between the

1280
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,080
and you see this continuum between the
 

1281
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,630
and you see this continuum between the
free will and the execution of automatic

1282
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:30,640
free will and the execution of automatic
 

1283
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,590
free will and the execution of automatic

1284
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,600
behavior
 

1285
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,270
behavior
when you're observing other people so

1286
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:33,280
when you're observing other people so
 

1287
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,789
when you're observing other people so
for instance when you are observing your

1288
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
for instance when you are observing your
 

1289
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,149
for instance when you are observing your
own children

1290
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,159
own children
 

1291
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,549
own children
if you don't understand them you will

1292
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
if you don't understand them you will
 

1293
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,789
if you don't understand them you will
use this agent model where you have a

1294
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:40,799
use this agent model where you have a
 

1295
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,750
use this agent model where you have a
agent with a set point generator and uh

1296
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:43,760
agent with a set point generator and uh
 

1297
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,430
agent with a set point generator and uh
the agent is doing the best it can to

1298
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
the agent is doing the best it can to
 

1299
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,270
the agent is doing the best it can to
minimize the difference to the set point

1300
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
minimize the difference to the set point
 

1301
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,270
minimize the difference to the set point
and it might be confused and uh

1302
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
and it might be confused and uh
 

1303
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,430
and it might be confused and uh
sometimes impulsive or whatever but it's

1304
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440
sometimes impulsive or whatever but it's
 

1305
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,270
sometimes impulsive or whatever but it's
acting on its own free will

1306
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,280
acting on its own free will
 

1307
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,430
acting on its own free will
and when you understand what happens in

1308
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
and when you understand what happens in
 

1309
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,510
and when you understand what happens in
the mind of the child you see that is

1310
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
the mind of the child you see that is
 

1311
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,230
the mind of the child you see that is
automatic and you can outmodel the child

1312
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
automatic and you can outmodel the child
 

1313
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,230
automatic and you can outmodel the child
you can build things around the child

00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
you can build things around the child
 

1315
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,070
you can build things around the child
that will lead the child to making

1316
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
that will lead the child to making
 

1317
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,510
that will lead the child to making
exactly the decision that you are

1318
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
exactly the decision that you are
 

1319
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,630
exactly the decision that you are
predicting

1320
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
predicting
 

1321
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,870
predicting
and in under these circumstances like

1322
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:08,880
and in under these circumstances like
 

1323
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,549
and in under these circumstances like
when you were a stage magician or

1324
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
when you were a stage magician or
 

1325
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,270
when you were a stage magician or
somebody who is dealing uh with people

1326
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
somebody who is dealing uh with people
 

1327
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,590
somebody who is dealing uh with people
that this you sell a car to and you

1328
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
that this you sell a car to and you
 

1329
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,350
that this you sell a car to and you
completely understand the psychology and

1330
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,360
completely understand the psychology and
 

1331
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,510
completely understand the psychology and
the impulses and the space of thoughts

1332
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
the impulses and the space of thoughts
 

1333

the impulses and the space of thoughts
that this individual can have at that

that this individual can have at that
 

1335
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,710
that this individual can have at that
moment under these circumstances it

1336
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:22,720
moment under these circumstances it
 

1337
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,909
moment under these circumstances it
makes no sense to attribute free will

1338
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
makes no sense to attribute free will
 

1339
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,430
makes no sense to attribute free will
because it's no longer decision making

1340
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
because it's no longer decision making
 

1341
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,789
because it's no longer decision making
under uncertainty you are already

00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:28,799
under uncertainty you are already
 

1343
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,390
under uncertainty you are already
certain for them there is uncertainty

certain for them there is uncertainty
 

1345
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,669
certain for them there is uncertainty
but you already know what they are doing

but you already know what they are doing
 

1347
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,870
but you already know what they are doing
but what about for you so

1348
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
but what about for you so
 

1349
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,710
but what about for you so
is this akin to like

1350
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:38,720
is this akin to like
 

1351
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,430
is this akin to like
systems like cellular automata

1352
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
systems like cellular automata
 

1353
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,710

00:24:12,549 --> 00:24:12,559
making decisions is that
 

1381
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,110
making decisions is that
where the illusion of free will emerges

where the illusion of free will emerges
 

1383
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,350
where the illusion of free will emerges
that jump and scale

1384
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
that jump and scale
 

1385
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,510
that jump and scale
it's a particular type of model but this

1386
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
it's a particular type of model but this
 

1387
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,830
it's a particular type of model but this
jump in scale is crucial the jump in

1388
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840
jump in scale is crucial the jump in
 

1389
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,590
jump in scale is crucial the jump in
scale happens whenever you have too many

1390
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:23,600
scale happens whenever you have too many
 

1391
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,190
scale happens whenever you have too many
parts to count and you cannot make a

1392
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
parts to count and you cannot make a
 

1393
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,269
parts to count and you cannot make a
model at that level and you try to find

1394
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:27,279
model at that level and you try to find
 

1395
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,350
model at that level and you try to find
some higher level regularity

1396
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
some higher level regularity
 

1397
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,110
some higher level regularity
and the higher level regularity is a

1398
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,120
and the higher level regularity is a
 

1399
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,510
and the higher level regularity is a
pattern that you project into the world

1400
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,520
pattern that you project into the world
 

1401
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,149
pattern that you project into the world
to make sense of it and agency is one of

1402
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
to make sense of it and agency is one of
 

1403
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,590
to make sense of it and agency is one of
these patterns right you have all these

1404
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:37,600
these patterns right you have all these
 

1405
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,310
these patterns right you have all these
cells that interact with each other and

1406
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
cells that interact with each other and
 

1407
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,390
cells that interact with each other and
the cells in our body are set up in such

1408
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
the cells in our body are set up in such
 

1409
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,909
the cells in our body are set up in such
a way that they benefit if their

1410
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
a way that they benefit if their
 

1411
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,310
a way that they benefit if their
behavior is coherent which means that

1412
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,320
behavior is coherent which means that
 

1413
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,310
behavior is coherent which means that
they act as if they were serving a

1414
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
they act as if they were serving a
 

1415
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,590
they act as if they were serving a
common goal

1416
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
common goal
 

1417
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,350
common goal
and which that means that they will

1418
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,360
and which that means that they will
 

1419
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,510
and which that means that they will
evolve regulation mechanisms that

1420
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:53,520
evolve regulation mechanisms that
 

1421
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,269
evolve regulation mechanisms that
act as if they were serving a common

1422
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
act as if they were serving a common
 

1423
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,350
act as if they were serving a common
goal and now you can make sense of these

1424
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:57,360
goal and now you can make sense of these
 

1425
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,269
goal and now you can make sense of these
all these cells by projecting the common

1426
00:24:59,269 --> 00:24:59,279
all these cells by projecting the common
 

1427
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,390
all these cells by projecting the common
goal into them

1428
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
goal into them
 

1429
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,390
goal into them
right so for you then free will is an

1430
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:02,400
right so for you then free will is an
 

1431
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,750
right so for you then free will is an
illusion

1432
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:03,760
illusion
 

1433
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,789
illusion
no it's a model and it's a construct

1434
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
no it's a model and it's a construct
 

1435
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,390
no it's a model and it's a construct
it's basically a model that the system

1436
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:08,400
it's basically a model that the system
 

1437
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,149
it's basically a model that the system
is making of its own behavior and it's

1438
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
is making of its own behavior and it's
 

1439
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,909
is making of its own behavior and it's
the best model that it can come up with

1440
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:11,919
the best model that it can come up with
 

1441
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,909
the best model that it can come up with
under the circumstances and it can get

1442
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:13,919
under the circumstances and it can get
 

1443
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,430
under the circumstances and it can get
replaced by a different model which is

1444
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,440
replaced by a different model which is
 

1445
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,350
replaced by a different model which is
automatic behavior when you fully

1446
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
automatic behavior when you fully
 

1447
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,789
automatic behavior when you fully
understand the mechanism under which you

1448
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:18,799
understand the mechanism under which you
 

1449
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,750
understand the mechanism under which you
are acting yeah but the another word for

1450
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
are acting yeah but the another word for
 

1451
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,230
are acting yeah but the another word for
model is what story

1452
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,240
model is what story
 

1453
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,990
model is what story
so it's the story you're telling i mean

1454
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
so it's the story you're telling i mean
 

1455
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,310
so it's the story you're telling i mean
you actually have control is there such

1456
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
you actually have control is there such
 

1457
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,230
you actually have control is there such
a thing as a you

1458
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
a thing as a you
 

1459
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,630
a thing as a you
and is there such a thing as you having

1460
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
and is there such a thing as you having
 

1461
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,830
and is there such a thing as you having
control

1462
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
control
 

1463
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,549
control
it's like are you

1464
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:36,559
it's like are you
 

1465
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,870
it's like are you
manifesting

1466
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880

u is the model of the system that is in
 

1473
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,950
u is the model of the system that is in
control it's a story that the system

control it's a story that the system
tells itself about somebody who is in

1476
00:25:49,269 --> 00:25:49,279
tells itself about somebody who is in
 

1477
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,310
tells itself about somebody who is in
control

1478
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,320
control
 

1479
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,390
control
yeah and the contents of that model are

1480
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
yeah and the contents of that model are
 

1481
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,230
yeah and the contents of that model are
being used to inform the behavior of the

1482
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
being used to inform the behavior of the
 

1483
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,870
being used to inform the behavior of the
system

1484
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
system
 

1485
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,350
system
okay so the system is completely

1486
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
okay so the system is completely
 

1487
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,590
okay so the system is completely
mechanical and the system creates that

1488
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:01,600
mechanical and the system creates that
 

1489
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,190
mechanical and the system creates that
story like a loom

1490
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,200
story like a loom
 

1491
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,430
story like a loom
and then it uses the contents of that

1492
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
and then it uses the contents of that
 

1493
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,390
and then it uses the contents of that
story to inform its actions and writes

1494
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,400
story to inform its actions and writes
 

1495
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,310
story to inform its actions and writes
the results of that actions into the

1496
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,320
the results of that actions into the
 

1497
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,269
the results of that actions into the
story so how's that not an illusion

1498
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:13,279
story so how's that not an illusion
 

1499
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,070
story so how's that not an illusion
the story is written then

1500
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,080
the story is written then
 

1501
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,190
the story is written then
or

1502
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,200
or
 

1503
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,029
or
or rather we're not the writers of the

1504
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:19,039
or rather we're not the writers of the
 

1505
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,110
or rather we're not the writers of the
story

1506
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,120
story
 

1507
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,830
story
yes but we always knew

1508
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:22,840
yes but we always knew
 

1509
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,510
yes but we always knew
that no we we don't know that when did

1510
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,520
that no we we don't know that when did
 

1511
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,750
that no we we don't know that when did
we know that i think that's mostly a

1512
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
we know that i think that's mostly a
 

1513
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,909
we know that i think that's mostly a
confusion about concepts the

1514
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
confusion about concepts the
 

1515
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,310
confusion about concepts the
conceptual illusion in our culture comes

1516
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,320
conceptual illusion in our culture comes
 

1517
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,470
conceptual illusion in our culture comes
from the idea that we live in physical

1518
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:34,480
from the idea that we live in physical
 

1519
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,590
from the idea that we live in physical
reality

1520
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
reality
 

1521
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,350
reality
and that we experience physical reality

1522
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,360
and that we experience physical reality
 

1523
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,350
and that we experience physical reality
and that you have ideas about it

1524
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
and that you have ideas about it
 

1525
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,870
and that you have ideas about it
and then you have this dual list

1526
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:40,880
and then you have this dual list
 

1527
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,710
and then you have this dual list
interpretation where you have

1528
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:42,720
interpretation where you have
 

1529
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,909
interpretation where you have
two substances res extensor the world

1530
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
two substances res extensor the world
 

1531
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,669
two substances res extensor the world
that you can touch and that is made of

1532
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:47,679
that you can touch and that is made of
 

1533
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,909
that you can touch and that is made of
extended things and res cognitions which

1534
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
extended things and res cognitions which
 

1535
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,510
extended things and res cognitions which
is the world of ideas

1536
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:51,520
is the world of ideas
 

1537
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,029
is the world of ideas
and in fact both of them are mental

1538
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:53,039
and in fact both of them are mental
 

1539
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,470
and in fact both of them are mental
representations

1540
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:54,480
representations
 

1541
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,470
representations
one is the representations of the world

1542
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,480
one is the representations of the world
 

1543
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,310
one is the representations of the world
as a game engine that your mind

1544
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:58,320
as a game engine that your mind
 

1545
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,669
as a game engine that your mind
generates to make sense of the

1546
00:26:59,669 --> 00:26:59,679
generates to make sense of the
 

1547
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,149
generates to make sense of the
perceptual data and the other one

1548
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:02,159
perceptual data and the other one
 

1549
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,669
perceptual data and the other one
yes that's what we perceive as the

1550
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:03,679
yes that's what we perceive as the
 

1551
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,190
yes that's what we perceive as the
physical world but we already know that

1552
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,200
physical world but we already know that
 

1553
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,710
physical world but we already know that
the physical world is nothing like that

1554
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
the physical world is nothing like that
 

1555
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,149
the physical world is nothing like that
right quantum mechanics is very

1556
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
right quantum mechanics is very
 

1557
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,310
right quantum mechanics is very
different from what you and me perceive

1558
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
different from what you and me perceive
 

1559
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,470
different from what you and me perceive
as the world the world that you and me

1560
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
as the world the world that you and me
 

1561
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,110
as the world the world that you and me
perceive is a game engine yeah and there

1562
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:15,120
perceive is a game engine yeah and there
 

1563
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,789
perceive is a game engine yeah and there
are no colors and sounds in the physical

1564
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
are no colors and sounds in the physical
 

1565
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,470
are no colors and sounds in the physical
world they only exist in the game engine

1566
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
world they only exist in the game engine
 

1567
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,310
world they only exist in the game engine
generated by your brain and then you

1568
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
generated by your brain and then you
 

1569
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,789
generated by your brain and then you
have ideas that are not cannot be mapped

1570
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
have ideas that are not cannot be mapped
 

1571
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,029
have ideas that are not cannot be mapped
onto extended regions right so the

1572
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:25,039
onto extended regions right so the
 

1573
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,950
onto extended regions right so the
objects that have a spatial extension in

1574
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:26,960
objects that have a spatial extension in
 

1575
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,669
objects that have a spatial extension in
the game engine are res extensor and the

1576
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
the game engine are res extensor and the
 

1577
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,870
the game engine are res extensor and the
objects that don't have a physical

1578
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:30,880
objects that don't have a physical
 

1579
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,630
objects that don't have a physical
extension in the game

1580
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
extension in the game
 

1581
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,389
extension in the game
engine our ideas

1582
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
engine our ideas
 

1583
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,230
engine our ideas
and they both interact in our mind to

1584
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,240
and they both interact in our mind to
 

1585
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,590
and they both interact in our mind to
produce models of the world yep but

1586
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
produce models of the world yep but
 

1587
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,630
produce models of the world yep but
you know when you play video games

1588
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
you know when you play video games
 

1589
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,389
you know when you play video games
i understand that what's actually

1590
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:44,399
i understand that what's actually
 

1591
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,070
i understand that what's actually
happening is zeros and ones inside of uh

1592
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,080
happening is zeros and ones inside of uh
 

1593
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,269
happening is zeros and ones inside of uh
inside of a computer instead of a cpu

1594
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:51,279
inside of a computer instead of a cpu
 

1595
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,789
inside of a computer instead of a cpu
and a gpu

1596
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
and a gpu
 

1597
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,430
and a gpu
but you're still seeing

1598
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:55,440
but you're still seeing
 

1599
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,070
but you're still seeing
like uh the rendering of that

1600
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
like uh the rendering of that
 

1601
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,630
like uh the rendering of that
and you're still making decisions

1602
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
and you're still making decisions
 

1603
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,110
and you're still making decisions
whether to shoot to turn left or to turn

1604
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,120
whether to shoot to turn left or to turn
 

1605
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,350
whether to shoot to turn left or to turn
right if you're playing a shooter or

1606
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360
right if you're playing a shooter or
 

1607
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,549
right if you're playing a shooter or
every time you start thinking about

1608
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
every time you start thinking about
 

1609
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,710
every time you start thinking about
skyrim and elder scrolls and walking

1610
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
skyrim and elder scrolls and walking
 

1611
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,149
skyrim and elder scrolls and walking
around in beautiful nature and swinging

1612
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:10,159
around in beautiful nature and swinging
 

1613
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,510
around in beautiful nature and swinging
a sword but

1614
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,520
a sword but
 

1615
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,029
a sword but
it feels like you're making decisions

1616
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,039
it feels like you're making decisions
 

1617
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,950
it feels like you're making decisions
inside that video game

1618
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:14,960
inside that video game
 

1619
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,389
inside that video game
so even though you don't have direct

1620
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:16,399
so even though you don't have direct
 

1621
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,909
so even though you don't have direct
access

1622
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
access
 

1623
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,630
access
uh in terms of perception to the

1624
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
uh in terms of perception to the
 

1625
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,110
uh in terms of perception to the
bits to the zeros and ones it still

1626
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
bits to the zeros and ones it still
 

1627
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,510
bits to the zeros and ones it still
feels like you're making decisions and

1628
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
feels like you're making decisions and
 

1629
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,909
feels like you're making decisions and
your decisions are actually feels like

1630
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,919
your decisions are actually feels like
 

1631
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,070
your decisions are actually feels like
they're being applied

1632
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,080
they're being applied
 

1633
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,990
they're being applied
all the way down to the zeros and ones

1634
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,000
all the way down to the zeros and ones
 

1635
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,669
all the way down to the zeros and ones
yes it feels like you have control even

1636
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
yes it feels like you have control even
 

1637
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,110
yes it feels like you have control even
though you don't direct

1638
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,120
though you don't direct
 

1639
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,430
though you don't direct
access to reality so there is basically

1640
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
access to reality so there is basically
 

1641
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,430
access to reality so there is basically
a special character in the video game

1642
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
a special character in the video game
 

1643
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,190
a special character in the video game
that is being created by the video game

1644
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:41,200
that is being created by the video game
 

1645
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,870
that is being created by the video game
engine yeah and this character is

1646
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:42,880
engine yeah and this character is
 

1647
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,510
engine yeah and this character is
serving the aesthetics of the video game

1648
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,520
serving the aesthetics of the video game
 

1649
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,029
serving the aesthetics of the video game
and that is you

1650
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:47,039
and that is you
 

1651
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,950
and that is you
yes but i feel like you have control

1652
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:48,960
yes but i feel like you have control
 

1653
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,789
yes but i feel like you have control
inside the video game

1654
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:50,799
inside the video game
 

1655
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,950
inside the video game
like the all those like 12 year olds

1656
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
like the all those like 12 year olds
 

1657
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,350
like the all those like 12 year olds
that kick my ass on the internet

1658
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
that kick my ass on the internet
 

1659
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,590
that kick my ass on the internet
so uh for when you play the video game

1660
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
so uh for when you play the video game
 

1661
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,789
so uh for when you play the video game
it doesn't really matter that they're

1662
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
it doesn't really matter that they're
 

1663
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,549
it doesn't really matter that they're
zeros and once right you don't care

1664
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
zeros and once right you don't care
 

1665
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,149
zeros and once right you don't care
about the vids of the bus you don't care

1666
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:02,159
about the vids of the bus you don't care
 

1667
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,070
about the vids of the bus you don't care
about the nature of the cpu that it runs

1668
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
about the nature of the cpu that it runs
 

1669
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,510
about the nature of the cpu that it runs
on what you care about are the

1670
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,520
on what you care about are the
 

1671
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,950
on what you care about are the
properties of the game that you're

1672
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
properties of the game that you're
 

1673
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,870
properties of the game that you're
playing and you hope that the cpu is

1674
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:08,880
playing and you hope that the cpu is
 

1675
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,990
playing and you hope that the cpu is
good enough

1676
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,000
good enough
 

1677
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,990
good enough
yes and a similar thing happens when we

1678
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
yes and a similar thing happens when we
 

1679
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,909
yes and a similar thing happens when we
interact with physics the world that you

1680
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:13,919
interact with physics the world that you
 

1681
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,909
interact with physics the world that you
and me are in is not the physical world

1682
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:15,919
and me are in is not the physical world
 

1683
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,590
and me are in is not the physical world
the world that you and me are in is a

1684
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,600
the world that you and me are in is a
 

1685
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,510
the world that you and me are in is a
dream world

1686
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,520
dream world
 

1687
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,350
dream world
how close is it to the real world though

1688
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360
how close is it to the real world though
 

1689
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,350
how close is it to the real world though
we know that it's not very close but we

1690
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:25,360
we know that it's not very close but we
 

1691
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,029
we know that it's not very close but we
know that the dynamics of the dream

1692
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:27,039
know that the dynamics of the dream
 

1693
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,029
know that the dynamics of the dream
world match the dynamics of the physical

1694
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,039
world match the dynamics of the physical
 

1695
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,950
world match the dynamics of the physical
world to a certain degree of resolution

1696
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
world to a certain degree of resolution
 

1697
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,149
world to a certain degree of resolution
right the causal structure of the

1698
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:32,159
right the causal structure of the
 

1699
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,110
right the causal structure of the
dreamworld is different

1700
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
dreamworld is different
 

1701
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,830
dreamworld is different
so you see waves crashing on your feet

1702
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
so you see waves crashing on your feet
 

1703
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,110
so you see waves crashing on your feet
right but there are no waves in the

1704
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
right but there are no waves in the
 

1705
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,950
right but there are no waves in the
ocean there's only water molecules that

1706
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
ocean there's only water molecules that
 

1707
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,510
ocean there's only water molecules that
have tangents uh between the molecules

1708
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
have tangents uh between the molecules
 

1709
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,029
have tangents uh between the molecules
that are uh

1710
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
that are uh
 

1711
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:45,830
that are uh
ex

1712
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
ex
 

1713
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,789
ex
the result of electrons in the molecules

1714
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:48,799
the result of electrons in the molecules
 

1715
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,470
the result of electrons in the molecules
interacting with each other aren't they

1716
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
interacting with each other aren't they
 

1717
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,190
interacting with each other aren't they
like very consistent we're just seeing a

1718
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,200
like very consistent we're just seeing a
 

1719
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,630
like very consistent we're just seeing a
very uh crude approximation isn't

1720
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
very uh crude approximation isn't
 

1721
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,990
very uh crude approximation isn't
our dream world very consistent like to

1722
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,000
our dream world very consistent like to
 

1723
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,909
our dream world very consistent like to
the point of being mapped directly

1724
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
the point of being mapped directly
 

1725
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,149
the point of being mapped directly
one-to-one to the actual physical world

1726
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:04,159
one-to-one to the actual physical world
 

1727
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,990
one-to-one to the actual physical world
as opposed to

1728
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
as opposed to
 

1729
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,990
as opposed to
us being completely tricked is this is

1730
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,000
us being completely tricked is this is
 

1731
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,510
us being completely tricked is this is
like where you have like that it's not a

1732
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
like where you have like that it's not a
 

1733
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,269
like where you have like that it's not a
trick that's that's my point it's not an

1734
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
trick that's that's my point it's not an
 

1735
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,350
trick that's that's my point it's not an
illusion it's a form of data compression

1736
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,360
illusion it's a form of data compression
 

1737
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,870
illusion it's a form of data compression
yeah it's an attempt to deal with the

1738
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:14,880
yeah it's an attempt to deal with the
 

1739
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,950
yeah it's an attempt to deal with the
dynamics of too many parts to count at

1740
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:16,960
dynamics of too many parts to count at
 

1741
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,789
dynamics of too many parts to count at
the level at which we're entangled with

1742
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:18,799
the level at which we're entangled with
 

1743
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,950
the level at which we're entangled with
the best model that you can find yeah so

1744
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:20,960
the best model that you can find yeah so
 

1745
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,950
the best model that you can find yeah so
we can act in that dream world and our

1746
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
we can act in that dream world and our
 

1747
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,590
we can act in that dream world and our
actions have impact in the in the real

1748
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
actions have impact in the in the real
 

1749
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,750
actions have impact in the in the real
world in the physical world yes to which

1750
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:27,760
world in the physical world yes to which
 

1751
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,510
world in the physical world yes to which
we don't have access yes but it's

1752
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,520
we don't have access yes but it's
 

1753
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,789
we don't have access yes but it's
basically like

1754
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799
basically like
 

1755
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,470
basically like
accepting the fact that the software

1756
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:32,480
accepting the fact that the software
 

1757
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,990
accepting the fact that the software
that we live in the dream that we live

1758
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,000
that we live in the dream that we live
 

1759
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,549
that we live in the dream that we live
in is generated by something outside of

1760
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
in is generated by something outside of
 

1761
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,230
in is generated by something outside of
this world that you and me are in so is

1762
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,240
this world that you and me are in so is
 

1763
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,549
this world that you and me are in so is
the software deterministic and do we not

1764
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:40,559
the software deterministic and do we not
 

1765
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,230
the software deterministic and do we not
have any control

1766
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
have any control
 

1767
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,909
have any control
do we have

1768
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:43,919
do we have
 

1769
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,750
do we have
so free will

1770
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:45,760
so free will
 

1771
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,110
so free will
is uh

1772
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,120
is uh
 

1773
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,350
is uh
having a conscious being

1774
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
having a conscious being
 

1775
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,510
having a conscious being
the free will is the monkey being able

1776
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
the free will is the monkey being able
 

1777
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,350
the free will is the monkey being able
to steer the elephant

1778
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360

 

1779
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,310

no

1780
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
no
 

1781
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,990
no
it's slightly different

1782
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,000
it's slightly different
 

1783
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,590
it's slightly different
basically in the same way as you are

1784
00:30:59,590 --> 00:30:59,600
basically in the same way as you are
 

1785
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,750
basically in the same way as you are
modeling the water molecules in the

1786
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
modeling the water molecules in the
 

1787
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,750
modeling the water molecules in the
ocean that engulf your feet when you are

1788
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
ocean that engulf your feet when you are
 

1789
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,149
ocean that engulf your feet when you are
walking on the beach as waves and there

1790
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159
walking on the beach as waves and there
 

1791
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,470
walking on the beach as waves and there
are no waves uh but only the atoms on

1792
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:08,480
are no waves uh but only the atoms on
 

1793
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,310
are no waves uh but only the atoms on
more complicated stuff underneath the

1794
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
more complicated stuff underneath the
 

1795
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,909
more complicated stuff underneath the
atoms and so on and you know that right

1796
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
atoms and so on and you know that right
 

1797
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,149
atoms and so on and you know that right
you would accept yes there is a certain

1798
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
you would accept yes there is a certain
 

1799
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,830
you would accept yes there is a certain
abstraction that happens here it's a

1800
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:17,840
abstraction that happens here it's a
 

1801
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,509
abstraction that happens here it's a
simplification of what happens in

1802
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:19,519
simplification of what happens in
 

1803
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,310
simplification of what happens in
simplification that is designed in such

1804
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
simplification that is designed in such
 

1805
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,149
simplification that is designed in such
a way that your brain can deal with it

1806
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:24,159
a way that your brain can deal with it
 

1807
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,909
a way that your brain can deal with it
temporarily and spatially in terms of

1808
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:25,919
temporarily and spatially in terms of
 

1809
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,310
temporarily and spatially in terms of
resources and tuned for the predictive

1810
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
resources and tuned for the predictive
 

1811
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,549
resources and tuned for the predictive
value so you can predict with some

1812
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:30,559
value so you can predict with some
 

1813
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,070
value so you can predict with some
accuracy whether your feet are going to

1814
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
accuracy whether your feet are going to
 

1815
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,149
accuracy whether your feet are going to
get wet or not but it's a really good

1816
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
get wet or not but it's a really good
 

1817
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,549
get wet or not but it's a really good
approach it's a really good interface

1818
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
approach it's a really good interface
 

1819
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,630
approach it's a really good interface
and approximation yes it's like equals

1820
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
and approximation yes it's like equals
 

1821
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,230
and approximation yes it's like equals
mg squared is a good

1822
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,240
mg squared is a good
 

1823
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,710
mg squared is a good
equations are good approximations for

1824
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
equations are good approximations for
 

1825
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,669
equations are good approximations for
what they're much better approximation

1826
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:45,679
what they're much better approximation
 

1827
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,630
what they're much better approximation
so

1828
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:46,640
so
 

1829
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,549
so
to me waves is a really nice

1830
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:48,559
to me waves is a really nice
 

1831
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,950
to me waves is a really nice
approximation what's all the complexity

1832
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
approximation what's all the complexity
 

1833
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,070
approximation what's all the complexity
that's happening underneath basically

1834
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,080
that's happening underneath basically
 

1835
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,350
that's happening underneath basically
it's a machine learning model that is

1836
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,360
it's a machine learning model that is
 

1837
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,509
it's a machine learning model that is
constantly tuned to minimize surprises

1838
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:55,519
constantly tuned to minimize surprises
 

1839
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,909
constantly tuned to minimize surprises
so it basically tries to predict as well

1840
00:31:57,909 --> 00:31:57,919
so it basically tries to predict as well
 

1841
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,350
so it basically tries to predict as well
as it can what you're going to perceive

1842
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
as it can what you're going to perceive
 

1843
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,350
as it can what you're going to perceive
next are we talking about

1844
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,360
next are we talking about
 

1845
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,789
next are we talking about
which is the machine learning our

1846
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:02,799
which is the machine learning our
 

1847
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,669
which is the machine learning our
perception system or the dream world

1848
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
perception system or the dream world
 

1849
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,269
perception system or the dream world
the machine world is a dream world is

1850
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279
the machine world is a dream world is
 

1851
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,590
the machine world is a dream world is
the result of the machine learning

1852
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
the result of the machine learning
 

1853
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,269
the result of the machine learning
process of the perception system that's

1854
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:11,279
process of the perception system that's
 

1855
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,029
process of the perception system that's
doing the compression yes

1856
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
doing the compression yes
 

1857
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,630
doing the compression yes
and uh the model of you as an agent is

1858
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:16,640
and uh the model of you as an agent is
 

1859
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,870
and uh the model of you as an agent is
not a different type of model or it's a

1860
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
not a different type of model or it's a
 

1861
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,029
not a different type of model or it's a
different type but not uh not different

1862
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:21,039
different type but not uh not different
 

1863
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,070
different type but not uh not different
as in its model like nature from the

1864
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,080
as in its model like nature from the
 

1865
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,149
as in its model like nature from the
model of the ocean right some things are

1866
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:26,159
model of the ocean right some things are
 

1867
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,110
model of the ocean right some things are
oceans some things are agents and one of

1868
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
oceans some things are agents and one of
 

1869
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,110
oceans some things are agents and one of
these agents is using your own control

1870
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,120
these agents is using your own control
 

1871
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,870
these agents is using your own control
model the output of your model the

1872
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:32,880
model the output of your model the
 

1873
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,950
model the output of your model the
things that you perceive yourself as

1874
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:34,960
things that you perceive yourself as
 

1875
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,230
things that you perceive yourself as
doing

1876
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
doing
 

1877
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,149
doing
and that is you

1878
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:38,159
and that is you
 

1879
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,430
and that is you
what about

1880
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,440
what about
 

1881
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,789
what about
the fact that like when you're standing

1882
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:42,799
the fact that like when you're standing
 

1883
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,909
the fact that like when you're standing
um and with the water on your feet and

1884
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
um and with the water on your feet and
 

1885
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,269
um and with the water on your feet and
you're looking out

1886
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
you're looking out
 

1887
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,430
you're looking out
into the vest

1888
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
into the vest
 

1889
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,149
into the vest
like open water of the ocean and then

1890
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:52,159
like open water of the ocean and then
 

1891
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,470
like open water of the ocean and then
there's a beautiful sunset

1892
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:54,480
there's a beautiful sunset
 

1893
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,470
there's a beautiful sunset
and it well the fact that it's beautiful

1894
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
and it well the fact that it's beautiful
 

1895
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,070
and it well the fact that it's beautiful
and then maybe you have like friends or

1896
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
and then maybe you have like friends or
 

1897
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,909
and then maybe you have like friends or
a loved one with you and like you feel

1898
00:32:59,909 --> 00:32:59,919
a loved one with you and like you feel
 

1899
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,750
a loved one with you and like you feel
love what is that as the dream world

1900
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:01,760
love what is that as the dream world
 

1901
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,310
love what is that as the dream world
what is that yes it's all uh happening

1902
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
what is that yes it's all uh happening
 

1903
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,789
what is that yes it's all uh happening
inside of the dream okay

1904
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
inside of the dream okay
 

1905
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,269
inside of the dream okay
but see the word dream makes it seem

1906
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:09,279
but see the word dream makes it seem
 

1907
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,190
but see the word dream makes it seem
like it's not real

1908
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,200
like it's not real
 

1909
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,029
like it's not real
yeah of course it's not real

1910
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039

 

1911
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,710

the physical universe is real but the

1912
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
the physical universe is real but the
 

1913
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,549
the physical universe is real but the
physical universe is incomprehensible

1914
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
physical universe is incomprehensible
 

1915
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,070
physical universe is incomprehensible
and it doesn't have any feeling of

1916
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
and it doesn't have any feeling of
 

1917
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,149
and it doesn't have any feeling of
realness the feeling of realness that

1918
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:22,159
realness the feeling of realness that
 

1919
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,990
realness the feeling of realness that
you experience gets attached to certain

1920
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
you experience gets attached to certain
 

1921
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,990
you experience gets attached to certain
representations where your brain

1922
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,000
representations where your brain
 

1923
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,509
representations where your brain
assesses this is the best model of

1924
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:27,519
assesses this is the best model of
 

1925
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,350
assesses this is the best model of
reality that i have so the only thing

1926
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
reality that i have so the only thing
 

1927
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,509
reality that i have so the only thing
that's real to you is the thing that's

1928
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:31,519
that's real to you is the thing that's
 

1929
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,350
that's real to you is the thing that's
happening at the very

1930
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
happening at the very
 

1931
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,630
happening at the very
base of reality like

1932
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:36,640
base of reality like
 

1933
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,149
base of reality like
for something to be real it needs to be

1934
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
for something to be real it needs to be
 

1935
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,990
for something to be real it needs to be
implemented

1936
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,000
implemented
 

1937
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,310
implemented
so uh the model that you have of reality

1938
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,320
so uh the model that you have of reality
 

1939
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,789
so uh the model that you have of reality
is a real in as far as it is a model

1940
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:44,799
is a real in as far as it is a model
 

1941
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,430
is a real in as far as it is a model
right it's an appropriate description of

1942
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,440
right it's an appropriate description of
 

1943
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,110
right it's an appropriate description of
the world to say that there are models

1944
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,120
the world to say that there are models
 

1945
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,430
the world to say that there are models
that are being experienced

1946
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
that are being experienced
 

1947
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,789
that are being experienced
but

1948
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:52,799
but
 

1949
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,950
but
the world that you experience is not

1950
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:54,960
the world that you experience is not
 

1951
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,789
the world that you experience is not
necessarily implemented

1952
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:56,799
necessarily implemented
 

1953
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,269
necessarily implemented
there is a difference between a reality

1954
00:33:59,269 --> 00:33:59,279
there is a difference between a reality
 

1955
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,149
there is a difference between a reality
a simulation and a simulacrum

1956
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:02,159
a simulation and a simulacrum
 

1957
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:02,870
a simulation and a simulacrum
the

1958
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:02,880
the
 

1959
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,470
the
reality that we are talking about is

1960
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
reality that we are talking about is
 

1961
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,789
reality that we are talking about is
something that fully emerges over a

1962
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
something that fully emerges over a
 

1963
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,190
something that fully emerges over a
causally closed lowest layer the idea of

1964
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
causally closed lowest layer the idea of
 

1965
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,190
causally closed lowest layer the idea of
physicalism is that we are in that layer

1966
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
physicalism is that we are in that layer
 

1967
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,950
physicalism is that we are in that layer
that basically our world emerges over

1968
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
that basically our world emerges over
 

1969
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,030
that basically our world emerges over
that every alternative to physicalism is

1970
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,040
that every alternative to physicalism is
 

1971
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,190
that every alternative to physicalism is
a simulation theory which basically says

1972
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:17,200
a simulation theory which basically says
 

1973
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,950
a simulation theory which basically says
that we are in some kind of simulation

1974
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:18,960
that we are in some kind of simulation
 

1975
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,550
that we are in some kind of simulation
universe and the real world needs to be

1976
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:20,560
universe and the real world needs to be
 

1977
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,310
universe and the real world needs to be
an apparent universe of that where the

1978
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,320
an apparent universe of that where the
 

1979
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,310
an apparent universe of that where the
actual causal structure is right

1980
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,320
actual causal structure is right
 

1981
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,629
actual causal structure is right
and when you look at the ocean and your

1982
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
and when you look at the ocean and your
 

1983
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,790
and when you look at the ocean and your
own mind you are looking at a simulation

1984
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
own mind you are looking at a simulation
 

1985
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,310
own mind you are looking at a simulation
that explains what you're going to see

1986
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320
that explains what you're going to see
 

1987
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,349
that explains what you're going to see
next

1988
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:31,359
next
 

1989
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,030
next
and we are living in a simulation yes

1990
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,040
and we are living in a simulation yes
 

1991
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,710
and we are living in a simulation yes
but the simulation generated by our own

1992
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
but the simulation generated by our own
 

1993
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,829
but the simulation generated by our own
brains

1994
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:35,839
brains
 

1995
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,310
brains
yeah and this simulation is different

1996
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:38,320
yeah and this simulation is different
 

1997
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,069
yeah and this simulation is different
from the physical reality because the

1998
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:40,079
from the physical reality because the
 

1999
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,909
from the physical reality because the
causal structure that is being produced

2000
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:41,919
causal structure that is being produced
 

2001
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:43,430
causal structure that is being produced
what you are seeing is different from

2002
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:43,440
what you are seeing is different from
 

2003
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,030
what you are seeing is different from
the causal structure of physics but

2004
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040
the causal structure of physics but
 

2005
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,790
the causal structure of physics but
consistent

2006
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:46,800
consistent
 

2007
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,190
consistent
hopefully if not then you are going to

2008
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
hopefully if not then you are going to
 

2009
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,109
hopefully if not then you are going to
end up in some kind of institution where

2010
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,119
end up in some kind of institution where
 

2011
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,310
end up in some kind of institution where
people will take care of you because

2012
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:52,320
people will take care of you because
 

2013
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,470
people will take care of you because
your behavior will be inconsistent right

2014
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
your behavior will be inconsistent right
 

2015
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,030
your behavior will be inconsistent right
your uh behavior needs to work in such a

2016
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
your uh behavior needs to work in such a
 

2017
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,030
your uh behavior needs to work in such a
way that it's interacting with an

2018
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
way that it's interacting with an
 

2019
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,950
way that it's interacting with an
accurately predictive model of reality

2020
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:00,960
accurately predictive model of reality
 

2021
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,190
accurately predictive model of reality
and if your brain is unable to make your

2022
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:03,200
and if your brain is unable to make your
 

2023
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,950
and if your brain is unable to make your
model of reality predictive

model of reality predictive
 

2025
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,109
model of reality predictive
um you will need help so what uh what do

2026
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:07,119
um you will need help so what uh what do
 

2027
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,790
um you will need help so what uh what do
you think about donald hoffman's

2028
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:08,800
you think about donald hoffman's
 

2029
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,310
you think about donald hoffman's
argument

2030
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
argument
 

2031
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,710
argument
that it doesn't have to be consistent

2032
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
that it doesn't have to be consistent
 

2033
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,230
that it doesn't have to be consistent
the dream world

2034
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,240
the dream world
 

2035
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,990
the dream world
to the the what he calls like the

2036
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,000
to the the what he calls like the
 

2037
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,270
to the the what he calls like the
interface

2038
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,280
interface
 

2039
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,589
interface
uh to the actual physical reality where

2040
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
uh to the actual physical reality where
 

2041
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,030
uh to the actual physical reality where
there could be evolution i think he

2042
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,040
there could be evolution i think he
 

2043
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,950
there could be evolution i think he
makes an evolutionary argument

2044
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
makes an evolutionary argument
 

2045
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,790
makes an evolutionary argument
which is like it could be an

2046
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:24,800
which is like it could be an
 

2047
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,349
which is like it could be an
evolutionary advantage to have the dream

2048
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:27,359
evolutionary advantage to have the dream
 

2049
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,950
evolutionary advantage to have the dream
world drift away from physical reality i

2050
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
world drift away from physical reality i
 

2051
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,710
world drift away from physical reality i
think that only works if you have tenure

2052
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:32,720
think that only works if you have tenure
 

2053
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,990
think that only works if you have tenure
as long as you are still interacting

2054
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,000
as long as you are still interacting
 

2055
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,230
as long as you are still interacting
with the ground tools your model needs

2056
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,240
with the ground tools your model needs
 

2057
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,950
with the ground tools your model needs
to be somewhat predictive

2058
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960
to be somewhat predictive
 

2059
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,829
to be somewhat predictive
well

2060
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:39,839
well
 

2061
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,750
well
in some sense humans have achieved a

2062
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:41,760
in some sense humans have achieved a
 

2063
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,829
in some sense humans have achieved a
kind of tenure in the animal kingdom

2064
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
kind of tenure in the animal kingdom
 

2065
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,589
kind of tenure in the animal kingdom
at some point we became too big to fail

2066
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:47,599
at some point we became too big to fail
 

2067
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,349
at some point we became too big to fail
so we became postmodernist

2068
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:51,359

 

2069
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,950

it all makes sense the version of

2070
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:52,960
it all makes sense the version of
 

2071
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,030
it all makes sense the version of
reality that we like

2072
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
reality that we like
 

2073
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,470
reality that we like
oh man

2074
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,480
oh man
 

2075
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,349
oh man
okay

2076
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,359
okay
 

2077
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,550
okay
yeah but

2078
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
yeah but
 

2079
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,630
yeah but
basically you can do magic you can

2080
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,640
basically you can do magic you can
 

2081
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,710
basically you can do magic you can
change your assessment of reality but

2082
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:02,720
change your assessment of reality but
 

2083
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,710
change your assessment of reality but
eventually uh reality is going to come

2084
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:04,720
eventually uh reality is going to come
 

2085
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,710
eventually uh reality is going to come
bite you in the s if it's not predictive

2086
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:06,720
bite you in the s if it's not predictive
 

2087
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,030
bite you in the s if it's not predictive
do you have a sense

2088
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,040
do you have a sense
 

2089
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,589
do you have a sense
of what is that base layer physical

2090
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:11,599
of what is that base layer physical
 

2091
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,550
of what is that base layer physical
reality

2092
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
reality
 

2093
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,589
reality
you have

2094
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:13,599
you have
 

2095
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,589
you have
like uh so you have these attempts at

2096
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:15,599
like uh so you have these attempts at
 

2097
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,670
like uh so you have these attempts at
the theories of everything

2098
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:17,680
the theories of everything
 

2099
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,069
the theories of everything
the very very small of like strength

2100
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:20,079
the very very small of like strength
 

2101
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,109
the very very small of like strength
theory

2102
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:21,119
theory
 

2103
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,910
theory
or what um stephen wolfram talks about

2104
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
or what um stephen wolfram talks about
 

2105
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,230
or what um stephen wolfram talks about
with a hyper grass these are these tiny

2106
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,240
with a hyper grass these are these tiny
 

2107
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,470
with a hyper grass these are these tiny
tiny tiny tiny objects

2108
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:28,480
tiny tiny tiny objects
 

2109
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,310
tiny tiny tiny objects
and then there is more like

2110
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:30,320
and then there is more like
 

2111
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,550
and then there is more like
quantum mechanics

2112
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:32,560
quantum mechanics
 

2113
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,150
quantum mechanics
that's talking about objects that are

2114
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,160
that's talking about objects that are
 

2115
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,069
that's talking about objects that are
much larger but still very very very

2116
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
much larger but still very very very
 

2117
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,470
much larger but still very very very
tiny do you have a sense of where the

2118
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:38,480
tiny do you have a sense of where the
 

2119
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,589
tiny do you have a sense of where the
tiniest thing is that is like

2120
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:41,599
tiniest thing is that is like
 

2121
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,589
tiniest thing is that is like
at the lowest level the turtle at the

2122
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:43,599
at the lowest level the turtle at the
 

2123
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,910
at the lowest level the turtle at the
very bottom do you have a sense

2124
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:45,920
very bottom do you have a sense
 

2125
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,750
very bottom do you have a sense
i don't think that you can talk about

2126
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:47,760
i don't think that you can talk about
 

2127
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,750
i don't think that you can talk about
where it is because space is emergent

2128
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:49,760
where it is because space is emergent
 

2129
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,910
where it is because space is emergent
over the activity of these things so

2130
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:51,920
over the activity of these things so
 

2131
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,829
over the activity of these things so
space

2132
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:52,839
space
 

2133
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,589
space
uh the coordinates only exist in

2134
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:55,599
uh the coordinates only exist in
 

2135
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,349
uh the coordinates only exist in
relation to the

2136
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:57,359
relation to the
 

2137
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,589
relation to the
things other things and so you could in

2138
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
things other things and so you could in
 

2139
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,589
things other things and so you could in
some sense abstract it into locations

2140
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
some sense abstract it into locations
 

2141
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,109
some sense abstract it into locations
that can hold information and

2142
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:03,119
that can hold information and
 

2143
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,190
that can hold information and
trajectories that the information can

2144
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,200
trajectories that the information can
 

2145
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,870
trajectories that the information can
take between the different locations and

2146
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880
take between the different locations and
 

2147
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,030
take between the different locations and
this is how we construct our notion of

2148
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,040
this is how we construct our notion of
 

2149
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,990
this is how we construct our notion of
space

2150
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,000
space
 

2151
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,190
space
yeah and uh physicists uh usually have a

2152
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
yeah and uh physicists uh usually have a
 

2153
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,589
yeah and uh physicists uh usually have a
notion of space that is continuous

2154
00:37:15,589 --> 00:37:15,599
notion of space that is continuous
 

2155
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,230
notion of space that is continuous
and this is a point where i

2156
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,240
and this is a point where i
 

2157
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,310
and this is a point where i
tend to agree with people like stephen

2158
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:20,320
tend to agree with people like stephen
 

2159
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,069
tend to agree with people like stephen
warfram who are very skeptical of the

2160
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:22,079
warfram who are very skeptical of the
 

2161
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,670
warfram who are very skeptical of the
geometric notions

2162
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:23,680
geometric notions
 

2163
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,990
geometric notions
i think that geometry is the dynamics of

2164
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,000
i think that geometry is the dynamics of
 

2165
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,030
i think that geometry is the dynamics of
too many parts to count and

2166
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,040
too many parts to count and
 

2167
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,190
too many parts to count and
when there are no infinities if there

2168
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
when there are no infinities if there
 

2169
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,109
when there are no infinities if there
were two infinities you would be running

2170
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
were two infinities you would be running
 

2171
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,790
were two infinities you would be running
into contradictions which is in some

2172
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:34,800
into contradictions which is in some
 

2173
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,390
into contradictions which is in some
sense what uh google and turing

2174
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
sense what uh google and turing
 

2175
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,670
sense what uh google and turing
discovered

2176
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
discovered
 

2177
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,670
discovered
in response to hilbert's call

2178
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:39,680
in response to hilbert's call
 

2179
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,589
in response to hilbert's call
so there are no infinities there are no

2180
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:41,599
so there are no infinities there are no
 

2181
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,910
so there are no infinities there are no
infinities fake there is unboundedness

2182
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:43,920
infinities fake there is unboundedness
 

2183
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,829
infinities fake there is unboundedness
but if you have a language that talks

2184
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:45,839
but if you have a language that talks
 

2185
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,270
but if you have a language that talks
about infinity at some point the

2186
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,280
about infinity at some point the
 

2187
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,430
about infinity at some point the
language is going to contradict itself

2188
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:49,440
language is going to contradict itself
 

2189
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,589
language is going to contradict itself
which means it's no longer valid

2190
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
which means it's no longer valid
 

2191
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,349
which means it's no longer valid
in order to deal with infinities and

2192
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:53,359
in order to deal with infinities and
 

2193
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,950
in order to deal with infinities and
mathematics you have to postulate the

2194
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:54,960
mathematics you have to postulate the
 

2195
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,829
mathematics you have to postulate the
existence in uh initially you cannot

2196
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
existence in uh initially you cannot
 

2197
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,670
existence in uh initially you cannot
construct the infinities and that's an

2198
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
construct the infinities and that's an
 

2199
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,190
construct the infinities and that's an
issue right you cannot build up an

2200
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,200
issue right you cannot build up an
 

2201
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,750
issue right you cannot build up an
infinity from zero but in practice you

2202
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:03,760
infinity from zero but in practice you
 

2203
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,270
infinity from zero but in practice you
never do this right when you perform

2204
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:05,280
never do this right when you perform
 

2205
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,710
never do this right when you perform
calculations you only look at the

2206
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:06,720
calculations you only look at the
 

2207
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,950
calculations you only look at the
dynamics of too many parts to count

2208
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:08,960
dynamics of too many parts to count

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,750
and
usually these

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:11,760
usually these

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,670
usually these

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,790

infinity would work so to speak that you

would know the last digit of pi and that
 

2265
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,349
would know the last digit of pi and that
you have a physical process that rests

2266
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:07,359
you have a physical process that rests
 

2267
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,349
you have a physical process that rests

00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:09,359
on knowing the last digit of pi
 

2269
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,510
on knowing the last digit of pi
yeah that that could be just a peculiar

00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
yeah that that could be just a peculiar
 

2271
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,069
yeah that that could be just a peculiar

00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:21,599
issue is that uh everything that we
 

2281
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,910
issue is that uh everything that we
think about uh needs to be expressed in

2282
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:23,920
think about uh needs to be expressed in
 

2283
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,470
think about uh needs to be expressed in
some kind of mental language not not

2284
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:26,480
some kind of mental language not not
 

2285
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,990
some kind of mental language not not
necessarily a natural language but some

2286
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,000
necessarily a natural language but some
 

2287
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,069
necessarily a natural language but some
kind of mathematical language that your

2288
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
kind of mathematical language that your
 

2289
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,790
kind of mathematical language that your
neurons can speak that refers to

2290
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:32,800
neurons can speak that refers to
 

2291
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,790
neurons can speak that refers to
something in the world and what we have

2292
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
something in the world and what we have
 

2293
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,470
something in the world and what we have
discovered is that

2294
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:36,480
discovered is that
 

2295
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,390
discovered is that
uh we cannot construct a notion of

2296
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,400
uh we cannot construct a notion of
 

2297
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,670
uh we cannot construct a notion of
infinity without running into

2298
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680
infinity without running into
 

2299
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,430
infinity without running into
contradictions which means that such a

2300
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,440
contradictions which means that such a
 

2301
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,510
contradictions which means that such a
language is no longer valid

2302
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
language is no longer valid
 

2303
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,430
language is no longer valid
and i suspect this is what made

2304
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:45,440
and i suspect this is what made
 

2305
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,349
and i suspect this is what made

not values they're functions
 

2331
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,950
not values they're functions
right so you can calculate these

00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:10,960
right so you can calculate these
 

2333
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,390
right so you can calculate these

functions to a certain degree of
 

2335

think growing in popularity

2404
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:24,319
think growing in popularity
 

2405
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,430
think growing in popularity
but uh

2406
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
but uh
 

2407
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,550
but uh
the

2408
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,560

 

2409
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,990

main reason why this is interesting is

2410
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:32,000
main reason why this is interesting is
 

2411
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,150
main reason why this is interesting is
because it uh it's important sometimes

2412
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,160
because it uh it's important sometimes
 

2413
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,990
because it uh it's important sometimes
to settle disagreements i don't think

2414
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000
to settle disagreements i don't think
 

2415
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,750
to settle disagreements i don't think
that you need infinities as or at all

2416
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:37,760
that you need infinities as or at all
 

2417
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,670
that you need infinities as or at all
and you never needed them

2418
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:39,680
and you never needed them
 

2419
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,430
and you never needed them
you can always deal with very large

2420
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
you can always deal with very large
 

2421
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,790
you can always deal with very large
numbers and you can do it with limits

2422
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,800
numbers and you can do it with limits
 

2423
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,630
numbers and you can do it with limits
right you're fine with doing that you

2424
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:44,640
right you're fine with doing that you
 

2425
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,390
right you're fine with doing that you
don't need any kind of infinity you can

2426
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,400
don't need any kind of infinity you can
 

2427
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,390
don't need any kind of infinity you can
build your computer algebra systems just

2428
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
build your computer algebra systems just
 

2429
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,470
build your computer algebra systems just
as well without believing in infinity in

2430
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:50,480
as well without believing in infinity in
 

2431
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,710
as well without believing in infinity in
the first place you're okay with limits

2432
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:52,720
the first place you're okay with limits
 

2433
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,710
the first place you're okay with limits
yeah so basically a limit means that

2434
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:54,720
yeah so basically a limit means that
 

2435
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,270
yeah so basically a limit means that
something is behaving pretty much the

2436
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:57,280
something is behaving pretty much the
 

2437
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,309
something is behaving pretty much the
same

2438
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:58,319
same
 

2439
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,309
same
if you make the number larger

2440
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:00,319
if you make the number larger
 

2441
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,750
if you make the number larger
right because it's converging to a

2442
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:01,760
right because it's converging to a
 

2443
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,190
right because it's converging to a
certain value and at some point the

2444
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:03,200
certain value and at some point the
 

2445
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,870
certain value and at some point the
difference becomes measurable and you

2446
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:04,880
difference becomes measurable and you
 

2447
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,550
difference becomes measurable and you
can no longer measure it

2448
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:06,560
can no longer measure it
 

2449
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,550
can no longer measure it
and uh in this sense you have things

2450
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
and uh in this sense you have things
 

2451
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,670
and uh in this sense you have things
that uh

2452
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:09,680
that uh
 

2453
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,990
that uh
yeah if every ngon which is has enough

2454
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,000
yeah if every ngon which is has enough
 

2455
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,910
yeah if every ngon which is has enough
corners then it's going to behave like a

2456
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:13,920
corners then it's going to behave like a
 

2457
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,069
corners then it's going to behave like a
circle at some point right and it's only

2458
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:16,079
circle at some point right and it's only
 

2459
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,069
circle at some point right and it's only
going to be in some kind of esoteric

2460
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:18,079
going to be in some kind of esoteric
 

2461
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,150
going to be in some kind of esoteric
thing that cannot exist in the physical

2462
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
thing that cannot exist in the physical
 

2463
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,150
thing that cannot exist in the physical
universe that you would be talking about

2464
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,160
universe that you would be talking about
 

2465
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,710
universe that you would be talking about
this perfect circle and now it turns out

2466
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:24,720
this perfect circle and now it turns out
 

2467
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,910
this perfect circle and now it turns out
that it also wouldn't work in

2468
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
that it also wouldn't work in
 

2469
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,750
that it also wouldn't work in
mathematics because you cannot construct

2470
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
mathematics because you cannot construct
 

2471
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,910
mathematics because you cannot construct
mathematics that has infinite resolution

2472
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:29,920
mathematics that has infinite resolution
 

2473
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,790
mathematics that has infinite resolution
without running into contradictions

2474
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:32,800
without running into contradictions
 

2475
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,950
without running into contradictions
so that is itself not that important

2476
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:34,960
so that is itself not that important
 

2477
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,390
so that is itself not that important
because we never did that right it's

2478
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,400
because we never did that right it's
 

2479
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,069
because we never did that right it's
just a thing that some people thought we

2480
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:38,079
just a thing that some people thought we
 

2481
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:38,950
just a thing that some people thought we
could

2482
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
could
 

2483
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,030
could
and this leads to confusion so for

2484
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
and this leads to confusion so for
 

2485
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,030
and this leads to confusion so for
instance roger penrose uses this as an

2486
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,040
instance roger penrose uses this as an
 

2487
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,390
instance roger penrose uses this as an
argument to say

2488
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,400
argument to say
 

2489
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,309
argument to say
that there are certain things that

2490
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:46,319
that there are certain things that
 

2491
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,630
that there are certain things that
mathematicians can do

2492
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640
mathematicians can do
 

2493
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,470
mathematicians can do
dealing with infinities

2494
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:50,480
dealing with infinities
 

2495
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,190
dealing with infinities
and by extension our mind can do

2496
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,200
and by extension our mind can do
 

2497
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,069
and by extension our mind can do
that computers cannot do yeah he he

2498
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
that computers cannot do yeah he he
 

2499
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,390
that computers cannot do yeah he he
talks about that there's the human mind

2500
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400
talks about that there's the human mind
 

2501
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,710
talks about that there's the human mind
can do certain mathematical things

2502
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:00,720
can do certain mathematical things
 

2503
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,589
can do certain mathematical things
that the computer as defined by

2504
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
that the computer as defined by
 

2505
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,790
that the computer as defined by
the universal touring machine cannot yes

2506
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:06,800
the universal touring machine cannot yes
 

2507
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,790
the universal touring machine cannot yes
what so that it has to do with infinity

2508
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
what so that it has to do with infinity
 

2509
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,270
what so that it has to do with infinity
yes it's one of the things so he is

2510
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,280
yes it's one of the things so he is
 

2511
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,109
yes it's one of the things so he is
basically pointing at the fact that

2512
00:43:13,109 --> 00:43:13,119
basically pointing at the fact that
 

2513
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,589
basically pointing at the fact that
there are things that are possible

2514
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:15,599
there are things that are possible
 

2515
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,790
there are things that are possible
in

2516
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:18,800

 

2517
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,710

the mathematical mind and in pure

2518
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:20,720
the mathematical mind and in pure
 

2519
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,510
the mathematical mind and in pure
mathematics that are not possible in uh

2520
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:23,520
mathematics that are not possible in uh
 

2521
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,109
mathematics that are not possible in uh
machines that can be constructed in the

2522
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
machines that can be constructed in the
 

2523
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,030
machines that can be constructed in the
physical universe

2524
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:27,040
physical universe
 

2525
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,589
physical universe
and because he's an honest guy he thinks

2526
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:29,599
and because he's an honest guy he thinks
 

2527
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,589
and because he's an honest guy he thinks
this means that uh present physics

2528
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:31,599
this means that uh present physics
 

2529
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,910
this means that uh present physics
cannot explain operations that happen in

2530
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:33,920
cannot explain operations that happen in
 

2531
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,790
cannot explain operations that happen in
our mind do you think he's right and uh

2532
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:36,800
our mind do you think he's right and uh
 

2533
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,790
our mind do you think he's right and uh
so let's let's leave his discussion of

2534
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
so let's let's leave his discussion of
 

2535
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,790
so let's let's leave his discussion of
consciousness aside for the moment do

2536
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:40,800
consciousness aside for the moment do
 

2537
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,710
consciousness aside for the moment do
you think he's right about just

2538
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:42,720
you think he's right about just
 

2539
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,550
you think he's right about just
what he's basically referring to as

2540
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:44,560
what he's basically referring to as
 

2541
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,069
what he's basically referring to as
intelligence

2542
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
intelligence
 

2543
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,589
intelligence
so

2544
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:47,599
so
 

2545
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,750
so
are is the human mind fundamentally more

2546
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
are is the human mind fundamentally more
 

2547
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,550
are is the human mind fundamentally more
capable as a thinking machine than a

2548
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,560
capable as a thinking machine than a
 

2549
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,349
capable as a thinking machine than a
universal touring machine no

2550
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:55,359
universal touring machine no
 

2551
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,630
universal touring machine no
but so he's suggesting that right

2552
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:58,640
but so he's suggesting that right
 

2553
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,309
but so he's suggesting that right
so our mind is actually less than a

2554
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:00,319
so our mind is actually less than a
 

2555
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,750
so our mind is actually less than a
turing machine there can be no touring

2556
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:01,760
turing machine there can be no touring
 

2557
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,589
turing machine there can be no touring
machine because it's defined as having

2558
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:03,599
machine because it's defined as having
 

2559
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,109
machine because it's defined as having
an infinite tape

2560
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
an infinite tape
 

2561
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,109
an infinite tape
and we always only have a finite tape

2562
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119
and we always only have a finite tape
 

2563
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,190
and we always only have a finite tape
but you can perform finally many

2564
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:09,200
but you can perform finally many
 

2565
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,190
but you can perform finally many
operations yes

2566
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:11,200
operations yes
 

2567
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,270
operations yes
it can do the kind of computation the

2568
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,280
it can do the kind of computation the
 

2569
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,630
it can do the kind of computation the
yes the touring machine cannot and

2570
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:14,640
yes the touring machine cannot and
 

2571
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,630
yes the touring machine cannot and
that's because he thinks that our minds

2572
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:16,640
that's because he thinks that our minds
 

2573
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,870
that's because he thinks that our minds
can do operations that have infinite

2574
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:18,880
can do operations that have infinite
 

2575
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,950
can do operations that have infinite
resolution in some sense

2576
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:20,960
resolution in some sense
 

2577
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,430
resolution in some sense
and i don't think that's the case our

2578
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:23,440
and i don't think that's the case our
 

2579
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,270
and i don't think that's the case our
minds are just able to discover these

2580
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
minds are just able to discover these
 

2581
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,270
minds are just able to discover these
limit operators over too many parts to

2582
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,280
limit operators over too many parts to
 

2583
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,150
limit operators over too many parts to
count

2584
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,160

 

2585
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,710

what about his idea that consciousness

2586
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:32,720
what about his idea that consciousness
 

2587
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,829
what about his idea that consciousness
is

2588
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:34,839
is
 

2589
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,829
is
more uh more than a computation so it's

2590
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839
more uh more than a computation so it's
 

2591
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,150
more uh more than a computation so it's
more than something that uh a touring

2592
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:40,160
more than something that uh a touring
 

2593
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,990
more than something that uh a touring
machine can can do

2594
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,000
machine can can do
 

2595
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,030
machine can can do
so again

2596
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:43,040
so again
 

2597
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,390
so again
saying that there's something special

2598
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
saying that there's something special
 

2599
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,870
saying that there's something special
about our mind they cannot be replicated

2600
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:46,880
about our mind they cannot be replicated
 

2601
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,670
about our mind they cannot be replicated
in the machine

2602
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:49,680

 

2603
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,430

the issue is that i don't even know how

2604
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:51,440
the issue is that i don't even know how
 

2605
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,670
the issue is that i don't even know how
to construct a language to

2606
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:53,680
to construct a language to
 

2607
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,390
to construct a language to
express this statement correctly

2608
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
express this statement correctly
 

2609
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,190
express this statement correctly
well

2610
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,200

 

2611
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,750

the the the basic statement is

2612
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
the the the basic statement is
 

2613
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,790
the the the basic statement is
there's a there's a human experience

2614
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:06,800
there's a there's a human experience
 

2615
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,550
there's a there's a human experience
that includes intelligence that includes

2616
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:08,560
that includes intelligence that includes
 

2617
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,550
that includes intelligence that includes
self-awareness that includes

2618
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:10,560
self-awareness that includes
 

2619
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,870
self-awareness that includes
the hard problem of consciousness

2620
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:12,880
the hard problem of consciousness
 

2621
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,430
the hard problem of consciousness
and the question is can that be fully

2622
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:15,440
and the question is can that be fully
 

2623
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,790
and the question is can that be fully
simulated

2624
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:16,800
simulated
 

2625
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,870
simulated
in the computer

2626
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:18,880
in the computer
 

2627
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,309
in the computer
in the mathematical model of the

2628
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:20,319
in the mathematical model of the
 

2629
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,589
in the mathematical model of the
computer as we understand it today

2630
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:23,599
computer as we understand it today
 

2631
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,829
computer as we understand it today
rajapanos says no

2632
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:25,839
rajapanos says no
 

2633
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,990
rajapanos says no
so the the

2634
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
so the the
 

2635
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,030
so the the
uh

2636
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,040
uh
 

2637
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,109

the universe
 

2641
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,390
the universe
so the interesting question is uh and

2642
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:34,400
so the interesting question is uh and
 

2643
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,630
so the interesting question is uh and
you have to ask him this is why not what

2644
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:36,640
you have to ask him this is why not what
 

2645
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,349
you have to ask him this is why not what
is this specific thing that cannot be

2646
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:39,359
is this specific thing that cannot be
 

2647
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,870
is this specific thing that cannot be
modeled and

2648
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:40,880

2649
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,390

when i looked at his writings and i

2650
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:42,400
when i looked at his writings and i
 

2651
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,710
when i looked at his writings and i
haven't read all of it but when i read

2652
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:44,720
haven't read all of it but when i read
 

2653
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,550
haven't read all of it but when i read
for instance um the

2654
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
for instance um the
 

2655
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,990
for instance um the
section that he writes in the

2656
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:48,000
section that he writes in the
 

2657
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,870
section that he writes in the
introduction to and wrote to infinity

2658
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
introduction to and wrote to infinity
 

2659
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,190
introduction to and wrote to infinity
the thing that he specifically refers to

2660
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
the thing that he specifically refers to
 

2661
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,990
the thing that he specifically refers to
is

2662
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,000
is
 

2663
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,750
is
the way in which human minds deal with

2664
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
the way in which human minds deal with
 

2665
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,589
the way in which human minds deal with
infinities

2666
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:57,599
infinities
 

2667
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:58,950
infinities
and

2668
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:58,960
and
 

2669
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,030
and
that itself can i think easily be

2670
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:01,040
that itself can i think easily be
 

2671
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,950
that itself can i think easily be
deconstructed

2672
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:02,960
deconstructed
 

2673
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,870
deconstructed
a lot of uh people feel that our

2674
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:04,880
a lot of uh people feel that our
 

2675
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,630
a lot of uh people feel that our
experience cannot be explained in a

2676
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:06,640
experience cannot be explained in a
 

2677
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,550
experience cannot be explained in a
mechanical way

mechanical way
 

2679
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,030
mechanical way
and therefore it needs to be different

2680
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,040
and therefore it needs to be different
 

2681
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,750
and therefore it needs to be different
and i concur our experience is not

2682
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,760
and i concur our experience is not
 

2683
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,550
and i concur our experience is not
mechanical our experience is simulated

2684

mechanical our experience is simulated
 

2685
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,630
mechanical our experience is simulated
it exists only in a simulation the only

00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:18,640
it exists only in a simulation the only

be conscious as far as you if you
 

2699
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,829
be conscious as far as you if you
understand them as physical systems

understand them as physical systems
 

2701
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,910
understand them as physical systems
what can be conscious is

2702
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:33,920
what can be conscious is
 

2703
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,790
what can be conscious is
the story of a system in the world where

2704
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,800
the story of a system in the world where
 

2705
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,230
the story of a system in the world where
you write all these things into the

00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,240
you write all these things into the
 

2707
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,270
you write all these things into the
story

2708
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280
story
 

2709
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,270
story
you have experiences for the same reason

2710
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
you have experiences for the same reason
 

2711
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,190
you have experiences for the same reason
that a character novel has experiences

2712
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,200
that a character novel has experiences
 

2713
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,670
that a character novel has experiences
because it's written into the story

2714
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:45,680
because it's written into the story
 

2715
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,750
because it's written into the story
and now the system is acting on that

2716
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:47,760
and now the system is acting on that
 

2717
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,430
and now the system is acting on that
story and it's not a story that is

2718
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
story and it's not a story that is
 

2719
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,790
story and it's not a story that is
written in a natural language it's

2720
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:50,800
written in a natural language it's
 

2721
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,870
written in a natural language it's
written in a perceptual language in this

2722
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:52,880
written in a perceptual language in this
 

2723
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,270
written in a perceptual language in this
multimedia language of the game engine

2724
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
multimedia language of the game engine
 

2725
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,630
multimedia language of the game engine
and in there

2726
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:56,640
and in there
 

2727
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,030
and in there
you write in what kind of experience you

2728
00:46:59,030 --> 00:46:59,040
you write in what kind of experience you
 

2729
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,390
you write in what kind of experience you
have and what this means for the

2730
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,400
have and what this means for the
 

2731
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,990
have and what this means for the
behavior of the system for your behavior

2732
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:02,000
behavior of the system for your behavior
 

2733
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,829
behavior of the system for your behavior
tendencies for your focus for your

2734
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:03,839
tendencies for your focus for your
 

2735
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,349
tendencies for your focus for your
attention for your experience of valence

2736
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:05,359
attention for your experience of valence
 

2737
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,990
attention for your experience of valence
and so on and this is being used to

2738
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:08,000
and so on and this is being used to
 

2739
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,670
and so on and this is being used to
inform the behavior of the system in the

2740
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:09,680
inform the behavior of the system in the
 

2741
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,790
inform the behavior of the system in the
next step and then the

2742
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
next step and then the
 

2743
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,190
next step and then the
story updates with the reactions of the

2744
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
story updates with the reactions of the
 

2745
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,950
story updates with the reactions of the
system and the changes in the world and

2746
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:16,960
system and the changes in the world and
 

2747
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,190
system and the changes in the world and
so on and you live inside of that model

2748
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:19,200
so on and you live inside of that model
 

2749
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,790
so on and you live inside of that model
you don't live inside of the physical

2750
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:20,800
you don't live inside of the physical
 

2751
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,349
you don't live inside of the physical
reality

2752
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,359

 

2753
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,030

and

2754
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,040
and
 

2755
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,430
and
i mean just just to linger on it like

2756
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:27,440
i mean just just to linger on it like
 

2757
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,069
i mean just just to linger on it like
you see okay yeah it's in the perceptual

2758
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079
you see okay yeah it's in the perceptual
 

2759
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,069
you see okay yeah it's in the perceptual
language the multimodal perceptual

2760
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:32,079
language the multimodal perceptual
 

2761
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,349
language the multimodal perceptual

2762
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:33,359
language
 

2763
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,190
language
that's the experience that's what

2764
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
that's the experience that's what
 

2765
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,670
that's the experience that's what
consciousness is within that

2766
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:37,680
consciousness is within that
 

2767
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,790
consciousness is within that
within that model within that story

2768
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:40,800
within that model within that story
 

2769
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,150
within that model within that story
but do you do you have agency

2770
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:44,160
but do you do you have agency
 

2771
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,589
but do you do you have agency
when you play a video game you can turn

2772
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:45,599
when you play a video game you can turn
 

2773
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,430
when you play a video game you can turn
left and you can turn right

2774
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,440
left and you can turn right
 

2775
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,510
left and you can turn right
in that story

2776
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:49,520
in that story
 

2777
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,589
in that story
so in that dream world how much control

2778
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:53,599
so in that dream world how much control
 

2779
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,670
so in that dream world how much control
do you is there such a thing as you in

2780
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:55,680
do you is there such a thing as you in
 

2781
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,589
do you is there such a thing as you in
that story

2782
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
that story
 

2783
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,390
that story
like

2784
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
like
 

2785
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,790
like
is it right to say the main character

2786
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:00,800
is it right to say the main character
 

2787
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,710
is it right to say the main character
you know everybody's npcs and then

2788
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:02,720
you know everybody's npcs and then
 

2789
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,549
you know everybody's npcs and then
there's the main character and you're

2790
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:04,559
there's the main character and you're
 

2791
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,870
there's the main character and you're
controlling the main character

2792
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:06,880
controlling the main character
 

2793
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,270
controlling the main character
or is that an illusion is there a main

2794
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
or is that an illusion is there a main
 

2795
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,950
or is that an illusion is there a main
character that you're controlling i'm

2796
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:10,960
character that you're controlling i'm
 

2797
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,630
character that you're controlling i'm
getting to the point of like

2798
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:12,640
getting to the point of like
 

2799
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,470
getting to the point of like
the free will point

2800
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:14,480
the free will point
 

2801
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,309
the free will point
imagine that you are building a robot

2802
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:16,319
imagine that you are building a robot
 

2803
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,390
imagine that you are building a robot
that plays soccer yeah and you've been

2804
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:18,400
that plays soccer yeah and you've been
 

2805
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,309
that plays soccer yeah and you've been
to mit computer science you basically

2806
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
to mit computer science you basically
 

2807
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,670
to mit computer science you basically
know how to do that

2808
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:21,680
know how to do that
 

2809
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,549
know how to do that
right and so uh you would say the robot

2810
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:24,559
right and so uh you would say the robot
 

2811
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,069
right and so uh you would say the robot
is an agent that solves the control

2812
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,079
is an agent that solves the control
 

2813
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,589
is an agent that solves the control
problem

2814
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:27,599
problem
 

2815
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,430
problem
how to get the ball into the goal and it

2816
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
how to get the ball into the goal and it
 

2817
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,790
how to get the ball into the goal and it
needs to perceive the world and the

2818
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
needs to perceive the world and the
 

2819
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,710
needs to perceive the world and the
world is disturbing him and trying to do

2820
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:32,720
world is disturbing him and trying to do
 

2821
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,309
world is disturbing him and trying to do
this right so he has to control many

2822
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
this right so he has to control many
 

2823
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,150
this right so he has to control many
variables to make that happen and to

2824
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:36,160
variables to make that happen and to
 

2825
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,910
variables to make that happen and to
project itself and the ball into the

2826
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:37,920
project itself and the ball into the
 

2827
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,069
project itself and the ball into the
future and understand its position on

2828
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:40,079
future and understand its position on
 

2829
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,069
future and understand its position on
the field relative to the ball and so on

2830
00:48:42,069 --> 00:48:42,079
the field relative to the ball and so on
 

2831
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,109
the field relative to the ball and so on
in the uh position of its limbs or in in

2832
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
in the uh position of its limbs or in in
 

2833
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,030
in the uh position of its limbs or in in
the space around it and so on so it

2834
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:47,040
the space around it and so on so it
 

2835
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,470
the space around it and so on so it
needs to have an adequate model that

2836
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:48,480
needs to have an adequate model that
 

2837
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,270
needs to have an adequate model that
abstracting reality in a useful way

2838
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:51,280
abstracting reality in a useful way
 

2839
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,549
abstracting reality in a useful way
and

2840
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:52,559
and
 

2841
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,309
and
you could say that this

2842
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:54,319
you could say that this
 

2843
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,309
you could say that this
robot does have agency over what it's

2844
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
robot does have agency over what it's
 

2845
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,309
robot does have agency over what it's
doing in some sense

2846
00:48:58,309 --> 00:48:58,319
doing in some sense
 

2847
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,069
doing in some sense
and the model is

2848
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
and the model is
 

2849
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,990
and the model is
going to be a control model and inside

2850
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,000
going to be a control model and inside
 

2851
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,309
going to be a control model and inside
of that control model you can

2852
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
of that control model you can
 

2853
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,150
of that control model you can
possibly get to a point where this thing

2854
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,160
possibly get to a point where this thing
 

2855
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,390
possibly get to a point where this thing
is sufficiently abstract to discover its

2856
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:08,400
is sufficiently abstract to discover its
 

2857
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,470
is sufficiently abstract to discover its
own agency our current robots don't do

2858
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:10,480
own agency our current robots don't do
 

2859
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,910
own agency our current robots don't do
that they don't have a unified model of

2860
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:11,920
that they don't have a unified model of
 

2861
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,990
that they don't have a unified model of
the universe but

2862
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,000
the universe but
 

2863
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,430
the universe but
there is not a reason why we shouldn't

2864
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:15,440
there is not a reason why we shouldn't
 

2865
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,950
there is not a reason why we shouldn't
be getting there at some point in the

2866
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:16,960
be getting there at some point in the
 

2867
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,109
be getting there at some point in the
not too distant future and once that

2868
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:19,119
not too distant future and once that
 

2869
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,510
not too distant future and once that
happens you will notice that the uh

2870
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:21,520
happens you will notice that the uh
 

2871
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,390
happens you will notice that the uh
robot tells a story about the robot

2872
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:24,400
robot tells a story about the robot
 

2873
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,829
robot tells a story about the robot
playing soccer

2874
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:25,839
playing soccer
 

2875
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,230
playing soccer
so the robot will experience itself

2876
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:28,240
so the robot will experience itself
 

2877
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,790
so the robot will experience itself
playing soccer in a simulation of the

2878
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:30,800
playing soccer in a simulation of the
 

2879
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,710
playing soccer in a simulation of the
world that it uses to

2880
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
world that it uses to
 

2881
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,630
world that it uses to
construct a model of the locations of it

2882
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:34,640
construct a model of the locations of it
 

2883

with relationship to the ball and it's
 

2887
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,710
with relationship to the ball and it's
not going to be at the level of the

molecules
 

2891
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,230
molecules
it will be an abstraction that is

2892
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,240
it will be an abstraction that is
 

2893
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,670
it will be an abstraction that is
exactly at the level that is most

2894
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:45,680
exactly at the level that is most
 

2895
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,510
exactly at the level that is most
suitable for past planning of the

00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520
suitable for past planning of the
 

2897
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,510
suitable for past planning of the

movements of the robot
 

2899
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,790
movements of the robot
right it's going to be a high level

2900
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:50,800
right it's going to be a high level
 

2901
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,390
right it's going to be a high level
abstraction but a very useful one that

2902
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:52,400
abstraction but a very useful one that
 

2903
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,270
abstraction but a very useful one that
is as predictive as we can make it and

2904
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:55,280
is as predictive as we can make it and
 

2905
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,950
is as predictive as we can make it and
in that side of that story there is a

2906
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:56,960
in that side of that story there is a
 

2907
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,790
in that side of that story there is a
model of the agency of that system so

2908
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:58,800
model of the agency of that system so
 

2909
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,990
model of the agency of that system so
this model can accurately

2910
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,000
this model can accurately
 

2911
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,630
this model can accurately
predict that the contents of the model

2912
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
predict that the contents of the model
 

2913
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,710
predict that the contents of the model
are going to be driving the behavior of

2914
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:06,720
are going to be driving the behavior of
 

2915
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,870
are going to be driving the behavior of
the robot in the immediate future but

2916
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:08,880
the robot in the immediate future but
 

2917
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,230
the robot in the immediate future but
there's the hard problem of

2918
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:10,240
there's the hard problem of
 

2919
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,309
there's the hard problem of
consciousness

2920
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
consciousness
 

2921
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,549
consciousness
which i would also

00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:14,559
which i would also
 

2923
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,390
which i would also
there's a subjective experience of free

2924
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:16,400
there's a subjective experience of free
 

2925
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,910
there's a subjective experience of free
will as well

2926
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
will as well
 

2927
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,309
will as well
that i'm not sure where the robot gets

2928
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:20,319

build the robot you have to
 

2985

00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,160
in order for it to have because i feel
 

2995
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,910
in order for it to have because i feel
like there's always a human

2996
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:27,920
like there's always a human

um and that

3000
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:31,520
um and that
 

3001
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,750
um and that
makes it seem like the robot is cheating

3002
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:33,760
makes it seem like the robot is cheating
 

3003
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,750
makes it seem like the robot is cheating

what i've been told about the previous
 

3037
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,510
what i've been told about the previous
ones was that it's basically all

00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:03,520
ones was that it's basically all

cybernetic control
which means you still have uh feedback

3042
00:52:07,109 --> 00:52:07,119
which means you still have uh feedback
 

3043
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,750
which means you still have uh feedback
mechanisms and so on but it's not uh

00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:09,760
mechanisms and so on but it's not uh
 

3045
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,069
mechanisms and so on but it's not uh
deep learning for the most part as it's

00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:13,920
currently done it's
 

3049
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,589
currently done it's
for the most part just identifying a

3050
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:15,599
for the most part just identifying a

the limbs that exist and the parameters

3054
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:20,319
the limbs that exist and the parameters
 

3055
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,589
the limbs that exist and the parameters
that need to be optimized for the

3056
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:21,599
that need to be optimized for the
 

3057
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,870
that need to be optimized for the
movement of these limbs and then there

3058
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880
movement of these limbs and then there
 

3059
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,870
movement of these limbs and then there
is a convergence progress so it's

3060
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:24,880
is a convergence progress so it's
 

3061
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,630
is a convergence progress so it's
basically just regression that you would

00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,640
basically just regression that you would
 

3063

basically just regression that you would
need to control this but again i don't

need to control this but again i don't
know whether that's true that's just

00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:29,760
know whether that's true that's just

how to always maintain balance yes and
 

3089
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,109
how to always maintain balance yes and
there's a tricky like set of heuristics

3090
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:57,119
there's a tricky like set of heuristics
 

3091
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,790
there's a tricky like set of heuristics
around that but

3092
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:58,800
around that but
 

3093
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,390
around that but
uh that's the only goal

3094
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:00,400
uh that's the only goal
 

3095
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,549
uh that's the only goal
everything you see boston dynamics doing

3096
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
everything you see boston dynamics doing
 

3097
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,710
everything you see boston dynamics doing
in terms of that to us humans is

00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:04,720
in terms of that to us humans is
 

3099
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:05,990
in terms of that to us humans is
compelling

movement like turning

3104
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:10,640
movement like turning
 

3105
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,390
movement like turning
uh wiggling its butt

3106
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:12,400
uh wiggling its butt
 

3107
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,510
uh wiggling its butt
uh like uh you know uh

3108
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:15,520
uh like uh you know uh

dancing the dancing is even worse

3112
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:19,920
dancing the dancing is even worse
 

3113
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,109
dancing the dancing is even worse
because dancing is hard coded in it's um

3114
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:23,119
because dancing is hard coded in it's um
 

3115
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,829
because dancing is hard coded in it's um
it's choreographed by humans there's

3116
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839
it's choreographed by humans there's
 

3117
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,150
it's choreographed by humans there's
choreography software so like there is

3118
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,160
choreography software so like there is
 

3119
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,790
choreography software so like there is
no of all that high level movement

3120

no of all that high level movement
 

3121
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,230

there's no
 

3123
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,470
there's no
anything that you can call certainly

3124

anything that you can call certainly
 

3125
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,750
anything that you can call certainly
can't call ai but there's no uh

3126
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:37,760
can't call ai but there's no uh
 

3127
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,309
can't call ai but there's no uh
even like basic heuristics it's all hard

3128
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:40,319
even like basic heuristics it's all hard
 

3129
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,470
even like basic heuristics it's all hard
coded in and yet

3130
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:42,480
coded in and yet
 

3131
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,150
coded in and yet
we humans immediately project

3132
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:46,160
we humans immediately project
 

3133
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,470
we humans immediately project
agency onto them which is which is

3134
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:48,480
agency onto them which is which is
 

3135
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,510
agency onto them which is which is
fascinating so the gap here is uh it

3136
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,520
fascinating so the gap here is uh it
 

3137
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,349
fascinating so the gap here is uh it
doesn't necessarily have agency well it

3138
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:53,359
doesn't necessarily have agency well it
 

3139
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,430
doesn't necessarily have agency well it
has a cybernetic control and the

3140
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:55,440
has a cybernetic control and the
 

3141
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,870
has a cybernetic control and the
cybernetic control means you have a

3142
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
cybernetic control means you have a
 

3143
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,950
cybernetic control means you have a
hierarchy of feedback loops that keep

3144
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:58,960
hierarchy of feedback loops that keep
 

3145
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,870
hierarchy of feedback loops that keep
the behavior in certain boundaries so

3146
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:00,880
the behavior in certain boundaries so
 

3147
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,630
the behavior in certain boundaries so
the robot doesn't fall over and it's

3148
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640
the robot doesn't fall over and it's
 

3149
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,630
the robot doesn't fall over and it's
able to perform the movements and the

3150
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:04,640
able to perform the movements and the
 

3151
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,710
able to perform the movements and the
choreography cannot really happen with

3152
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
choreography cannot really happen with
 

3153
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,710
choreography cannot really happen with
motion capture because the robot would

3154
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:08,720
motion capture because the robot would
 

3155
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,150
motion capture because the robot would
fall over because the physics of the

3156
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:10,160
fall over because the physics of the
 

3157
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,829
fall over because the physics of the
robot the weight distribution and so on

3158
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839
robot the weight distribution and so on
 

3159
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,109
robot the weight distribution and so on
is different from the weight

3160
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
is different from the weight
 

3161
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,910
is different from the weight
distribution in the human body so if you

3162
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:15,920
distribution in the human body so if you
 

3163
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,030
distribution in the human body so if you
were using the directly motion captured

3164
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,040
were using the directly motion captured
 

3165
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,710
were using the directly motion captured
movements of the human body to project

3166
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:20,720
movements of the human body to project
 

3167
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,549

00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:25,440
it will look a little bit off but who
 

3173
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,950
it will look a little bit off but who
cares but

3174
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:26,960
cares but
 

3175
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,950
cares but
if you want to correct for the physics

3176
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:28,960
if you want to correct for the physics
 

3177
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,430
if you want to correct for the physics
you need to basically tell the robot

3178
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:31,440
you need to basically tell the robot
 

3179
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,470
you need to basically tell the robot
where it should move its limbs and then

3180
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,480
where it should move its limbs and then

possible within the physics of the robot
 

3187
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,270
possible within the physics of the robot
and you have to find um the basic

3188
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:43,280
and you have to find um the basic
 

3189
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,710
and you have to find um the basic
solution for making that happen and

3190
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
solution for making that happen and
 

3191
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,069
solution for making that happen and
there's probably going to be some

3192
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:46,079
there's probably going to be some

can maybe handcraft it
 

3249
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:41,990
can maybe handcraft it
but if you don't know your hardware you

3250
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
but if you don't know your hardware you
 

3251
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,750
but if you don't know your hardware you
can search for such an architecture and

3252
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
can search for such an architecture and
 

3253
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,990
can search for such an architecture and
this work already existed in the

3254
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
this work already existed in the
 

3255
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,750
this work already existed in the
80s and 90s people were starting to

3256
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:47,760
80s and 90s people were starting to
 

3257
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,829
80s and 90s people were starting to
search for control architectures by

3258
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:49,839
search for control architectures by
 

3259
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,309
search for control architectures by
motor babbling and so on and just use

3260
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:52,319
motor babbling and so on and just use
 

3261
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,910
motor babbling and so on and just use
reinforcement learning architectures to

3262
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:53,920
reinforcement learning architectures to
 

3263
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,510
reinforcement learning architectures to
discover such a thing

00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
discover such a thing
 

3265
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,549
discover such a thing
and

3266
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
and
 

3267
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,230
and
now imagine that you have the cybernetic

3268
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
now imagine that you have the cybernetic
 

3269
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,710
now imagine that you have the cybernetic

you and you extend this a little bit so

3272
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
you and you extend this a little bit so
 

3273
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,950
you and you extend this a little bit so
you are seeking out food for instance or

3274
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:06,960
you are seeking out food for instance or
 

3275
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,950
you are seeking out food for instance or
rest or and so on and

00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:08,960
rest or and so on and
 

3277
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,750
rest or and so on and
you get to have a baby at some point

3278
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
you get to have a baby at some point
 

3279
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,549
you get to have a baby at some point
and now you add more and more control

3280
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:14,559
and now you add more and more control
 

3281
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,109
and now you add more and more control
layers to this and the system is reverse

3282
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:17,119
layers to this and the system is reverse
 

3283
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,510

rest and pain avoidance and so on and
 

3305
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,270

you put all these things together and

00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
you put all these things together and
 

3307
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,510
you put all these things together and
eventually you need to come up with a

eventually you need to come up with a

00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,910
eventually you need to come up with a

strategy to synchronize them all
 

3311
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,150
strategy to synchronize them all
and you don't need uh just to do this

3312
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,160
and you don't need uh just to do this
 

3313
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,910
and you don't need uh just to do this
alone by yourself because we are state

00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:57,670
the isolation the way that homo sapiens
is set up so our own behavior only makes

00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,309
is set up so our own behavior only makes

makes sense in these larger contexts and
 

3331
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,750
makes sense in these larger contexts and
we have a number of priors built into us

3332
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,760
we have a number of priors built into us
 

3333
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,630
we have a number of priors built into us
so we are behaving as if we are acting

3334
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
so we are behaving as if we are acting
 

3335
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,230
so we are behaving as if we are acting
on these high level goals pretty much

3336
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:16,240
on these high level goals pretty much
 

3337
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,829
on these high level goals pretty much
right from the start

right from the start
 

3339
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,750
right from the start
and eventually in the course of our life

3340
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:19,760
and eventually in the course of our life
 

3341
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,910
and eventually in the course of our life
we can reverse engineer the goals that

00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:21,920
we can reverse engineer the goals that
 

3343
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,589
we can reverse engineer the goals that
we are acting on what actually are our

3344
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
we are acting on what actually are our

we are acting on what actually are our
higher level purposes

higher level purposes
 

3347
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,430
higher level purposes
and the more we understand that the more

3348
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,440
and the more we understand that the more
 

3349
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,430
and the more we understand that the more
our behavior makes sense but this is all

3350
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:29,440
our behavior makes sense but this is all
 

3351
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,589
our behavior makes sense but this is all
at this point complex stories within

at this point complex stories within
 

3353
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:34,470
at this point complex stories within
stories that are driving our behavior

3354

stories that are driving our behavior
 

3355
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,630

yeah i just

don't know how big of a leap it is to

00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,349
don't know how big of a leap it is to
start uh create a system that's able to

00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,950
model of the world can be described
through something like an energy

3410
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
through something like an energy
 

3411
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,589
through something like an energy
function the energy function is modeling

3412
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
function the energy function is modeling
 

3413
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,510
function the energy function is modeling
the contradictions that exist within the

3414
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:33,520
the contradictions that exist within the
 

3415
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,190
the contradictions that exist within the
model at any given point and you try to

3416
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,200
model at any given point and you try to
 

3417
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,710
model at any given point and you try to
minimize these contradictions the

3418
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
minimize these contradictions the
 

3419
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,230
minimize these contradictions the
tangents in the model

3420
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:38,240
tangents in the model
 

3421
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,390
tangents in the model
and to do this you need to sometimes

3422
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:40,400
and to do this you need to sometimes
 

3423
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,309
and to do this you need to sometimes
test things you need to conditionally

3424
00:58:42,309 --> 00:58:42,319
test things you need to conditionally
 

3425
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,910
test things you need to conditionally
disambiguate figure and ground you need

3426
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:43,920
disambiguate figure and ground you need
 

3427
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,789
disambiguate figure and ground you need
to just

3428
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:44,799
to just
 

3429
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,789
to just
distinguish whether this is true or that

3430
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
distinguish whether this is true or that
 

3431
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,630
distinguish whether this is true or that
is true and so on eventually you get to

3432
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,640
is true and so on eventually you get to
 

3433
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,789
is true and so on eventually you get to
an interpretation but you will need to

3434
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:50,799
an interpretation but you will need to
 

3435
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,470
an interpretation but you will need to
manually depress a few points in your

3436
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:52,480
manually depress a few points in your
 

3437
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,549
manually depress a few points in your
model to let it snap into a state that

3438
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:54,559
model to let it snap into a state that
 

3439
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,789
model to let it snap into a state that
makes sense and this function that tries

3440
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:56,799
makes sense and this function that tries
 

3441
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,230
makes sense and this function that tries
to get the biggest dip in the energy

3442
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:58,240
to get the biggest dip in the energy
 

3443
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,069
to get the biggest dip in the energy
function in your model according to

3444
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:00,079
function in your model according to
 

3445
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,589
function in your model according to
joshua bangio is related to

joshua bangio is related to
 

3447

maximize this dip in the energy function
i yeah

3454
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:11,440
i yeah
 

3455
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,270
i yeah
i think i would need to dig into details

3456
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:13,280
i think i would need to dig into details
 

3457

consciousness is more akin to like
 

3461
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,789

00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:28,880
agent and you don't need to be aware of
 

3473

right where you're just aware of the

attention right
i don't see where uh

3510
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,160
i don't see where uh
 

3511
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,670
i don't see where uh
the uh awareness that we're aware

3512
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
the uh awareness that we're aware

the the heart problem doesn't feel like

3514
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839
the the heart problem doesn't feel like
 

3515
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,069
the the heart problem doesn't feel like
it's solved i mean they they're they're

3516
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:12,079
it's solved i mean they they're they're
 

3517
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,589
it's solved i mean they they're they're
it it's called a hard problem for a

3518
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:13,599
it it's called a hard problem for a
 

3519
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,030
it it's called a hard problem for a
reason

3520
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:15,040
reason
 

3521
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,150
reason
because

3522
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,160
because
 

3523
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,069
because
it seems like there needs to be a major

3524
01:00:18,069 --> 01:00:18,079
it seems like there needs to be a major
 

3525
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,190
it seems like there needs to be a major
leap

3526
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
leap
 

3527
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,870
leap
yeah i think the major leap is to

3528
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:20,880
yeah i think the major leap is to
 

3529
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,430
yeah i think the major leap is to
understand how it is possible that a

3530
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:23,440
understand how it is possible that a
 

3531
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,109
understand how it is possible that a
machine can dream

3532
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:25,119
machine can dream
 

3533
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:26,950
machine can dream
that the physical system

3534
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:26,960
that the physical system
 

3535
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,510
that the physical system
is able to create a representation that

3536
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:29,520
is able to create a representation that
 

3537
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,270
is able to create a representation that
the physical system is acting on and

3538
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:31,280
the physical system is acting on and
 

3539
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,309
the physical system is acting on and
that is spun force and so on but once

3540
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
that is spun force and so on but once
 

3541
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,990
that is spun force and so on but once
you accept the fact that you are not in

3542
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:36,000
you accept the fact that you are not in
 

3543
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,150
you accept the fact that you are not in
physics but that you exist inside of the

3544
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
physics but that you exist inside of the
 

3545
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,630
physics but that you exist inside of the
story i think the mystery disappears

3546
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
story i think the mystery disappears
 

3547
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,990
story i think the mystery disappears
everything is possible in a statement

3548
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:42,000
everything is possible in a statement
 

3549
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,750
everything is possible in a statement
exists inside the story okay so your

3550
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:43,760
exists inside the story okay so your
 

3551
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,349
exists inside the story okay so your
consciousness is being written into the

3552
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:45,359
consciousness is being written into the
 

3553
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:46,789
consciousness is being written into the
story the fact that you experience

3554
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:46,799
story the fact that you experience
 

3555
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,109
story the fact that you experience
things is written to the story you ask

3556
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:49,119
things is written to the story you ask
 

3557
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,190
things is written to the story you ask
yourself is this real what i'm seeing

3558
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:51,200
yourself is this real what i'm seeing
 

3559
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,710
yourself is this real what i'm seeing
and your brain writes into the story yes

3560
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:52,720
and your brain writes into the story yes
 

3561
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,750
and your brain writes into the story yes
it's real

3562
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:53,760
it's real
 

3563
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,589
it's real
so what about the perception of

3564
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:55,599
so what about the perception of
 

3565
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,030
so what about the perception of
consciousness so

3566
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:57,040
consciousness so
 

3567
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,510
consciousness so
to me you look conscious

3568
01:00:59,510 --> 01:00:59,520
to me you look conscious
 

3569
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,390
to me you look conscious
so

3570
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:00,400
so
 

3571
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,549
so
um the illusion of consciousness the

3572
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:02,559
um the illusion of consciousness the
 

3573
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,510
um the illusion of consciousness the
demonstration of consciousness i ask for

3574
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:05,520
demonstration of consciousness i ask for
 

3575
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,630
demonstration of consciousness i ask for
the

3576
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:06,640
the
 

3577
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,470
the
the legged robot how do we make this

3578
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:08,480
the legged robot how do we make this
 

3579
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,549
the legged robot how do we make this
legged robot conscious

3580
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:10,559
legged robot conscious
 

3581
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:11,510
legged robot conscious
so

3582
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:11,520
so
 

3583
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,270
so
there's two things and maybe you can

3584
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:13,280
there's two things and maybe you can
 

3585
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,309
there's two things and maybe you can
tell me if they're neighboring ideas

3586
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
tell me if they're neighboring ideas
 

3587
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,789
tell me if they're neighboring ideas
one is actually make it conscious

3588
01:01:18,789 --> 01:01:18,799
one is actually make it conscious
 

3589
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,470
one is actually make it conscious
and the other is make it appear

3590
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
and the other is make it appear
 

3591
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,549
and the other is make it appear
conscious to others

3592
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
conscious to others
 

3593
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,270
conscious to others
are those related

3594
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:25,280
are those related
 

3595
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,349
are those related
uh let's ask from the other direction

3596
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:27,359
uh let's ask from the other direction
 

3597
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,349
uh let's ask from the other direction
what would it take to make you not

3598
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:29,359
what would it take to make you not
 

3599
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,109
what would it take to make you not
conscious

3600
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:31,119
conscious
 

3601
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,150
conscious
so

3602
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
so
 

3603
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,670
so
when you are thinking about how you

3604
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:33,680
when you are thinking about how you
 

3605
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,109
when you are thinking about how you
perceive the world

3606
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:35,119
perceive the world
 

3607
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,270
perceive the world
can you decide to

3608
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:37,280
can you decide to
 

3609
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,750
can you decide to
switch from looking at qualia

3610
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:39,760
switch from looking at qualia
 

3611
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,950
switch from looking at qualia
to looking at representational states

3612
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:42,960
to looking at representational states
 

3613
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,190
to looking at representational states
and it turns out you can yeah there is a

3614
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:45,200
and it turns out you can yeah there is a
 

3615
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,430
and it turns out you can yeah there is a
particular way in which you can

3616
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:47,440
particular way in which you can
 

3617
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,190
particular way in which you can
look at the world and recognize its

3618
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:49,200
look at the world and recognize its
 

3619
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,349
look at the world and recognize its
machine nature including your own

3620
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:51,359
machine nature including your own
 

3621
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,190
machine nature including your own
and in that state you don't have that

3622
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:53,200
and in that state you don't have that
 

3623
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,829
and in that state you don't have that
conscious experience in this way anymore

3624
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:55,839
conscious experience in this way anymore
 

3625
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,190
conscious experience in this way anymore
it becomes

3626
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:57,200
it becomes
 

3627
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,069
it becomes
apparent as a representation everything

3628
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079
apparent as a representation everything
 

3629
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,510
apparent as a representation everything
becomes opaque

3630
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:01,520
becomes opaque
 

3631
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,430
becomes opaque
and i think this thing that you

3632
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:03,440
and i think this thing that you
 

3633
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,270
and i think this thing that you
recognize everything as a representation

3634
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:05,280
recognize everything as a representation
 

3635
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,870
recognize everything as a representation
this is typically what we mean with

3636
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:06,880
this is typically what we mean with
 

3637
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,029
this is typically what we mean with
enlightenment states

3638
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:09,039
enlightenment states
 

3639
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,270
enlightenment states
and yeah you can't have a motivational

3640
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,280
and yeah you can't have a motivational
 

3641
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,750
and yeah you can't have a motivational
level but it you can also do this on the

3642
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:13,760
level but it you can also do this on the
 

3643
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,430
level but it you can also do this on the
experiential level and the perceptual

3644
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
experiential level and the perceptual
 

3645
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,589
experiential level and the perceptual
level see but then i can come back to a

3646
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:17,599
level see but then i can come back to a
 

3647
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,309
level see but then i can come back to a
conscious state

3648
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:20,319
conscious state
 

3649
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:23,670
conscious state
okay i particularly

3650
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:23,680
okay i particularly
 

3651
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,750
okay i particularly
i'm referring to the

3652
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:25,760
i'm referring to the
 

3653
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:28,470
i'm referring to the
social aspect that the demonstration of

3654
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
social aspect that the demonstration of
 

3655
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,069
social aspect that the demonstration of
consciousness

3656
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:30,079
consciousness
 

3657
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,230
consciousness
is a really nice thing at a party when

3658
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
is a really nice thing at a party when
 

3659
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,950
is a really nice thing at a party when
you're trying to meet a new person

3660
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
you're trying to meet a new person
 

3661
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,430
you're trying to meet a new person
it's it's a nice thing to to to know

3662
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:37,440
it's it's a nice thing to to to know
 

3663
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,710
it's it's a nice thing to to to know
that they're conscious and they can um

3664
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:40,720
that they're conscious and they can um
 

3665
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:41,990
that they're conscious and they can um
how i don't know how fundamental

3666
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:42,000
how i don't know how fundamental
 

3667
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,829
how i don't know how fundamental
consciousness is in human interaction

3668
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:43,839
consciousness is in human interaction
 

3669
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,990
consciousness is in human interaction
but it seems like to be at least

3670
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:46,000
but it seems like to be at least
 

3671
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,589
but it seems like to be at least
uh an important part and i i asked that

3672
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:49,599
uh an important part and i i asked that
 

3673
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,670
uh an important part and i i asked that
in the same kind of way

3674
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:51,680
in the same kind of way
 

3675
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,270
in the same kind of way
for robots

3676
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:53,280
for robots
 

3677
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,349
for robots
you know in order to create a rich

3678
01:02:55,349 --> 01:02:55,359
you know in order to create a rich
 

3679
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,470
you know in order to create a rich
compelling human robot interaction it

3680
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:58,480
compelling human robot interaction it
 

3681
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,069
compelling human robot interaction it
feels like there needs to be elements of

3682
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:00,079
feels like there needs to be elements of
 

3683
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,710
feels like there needs to be elements of
consciousness within that interaction

3684
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:02,720
consciousness within that interaction
 

3685
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,870
consciousness within that interaction
my cat is obviously conscious

3686
01:03:04,870 --> 01:03:04,880
my cat is obviously conscious
 

3687
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,589
my cat is obviously conscious
and

3688
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:05,599
and
 

3689
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,670
and
so my cat can do this party trick she

3690
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:07,680
so my cat can do this party trick she
 

3691
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,670
so my cat can do this party trick she
also knows that i am conscious be able

3692
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:09,680
also knows that i am conscious be able
 

3693
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,750
also knows that i am conscious be able
to have feedback about the fact that we

3694
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:11,760
to have feedback about the fact that we
 

3695
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,829
to have feedback about the fact that we
are both acting on models of our own

3696
01:03:13,829 --> 01:03:13,839
are both acting on models of our own
 

3697
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,630
are both acting on models of our own
awareness the question is how hard is it

3698
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640
awareness the question is how hard is it
 

3699
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,670
awareness the question is how hard is it
for

3700
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:17,680
for
 

3701
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,589
for
uh the robot

3702
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:19,599
uh the robot
 

3703
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,349
uh the robot
artificially created robot to achieve

3704
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
artificially created robot to achieve
 

3705
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,589
artificially created robot to achieve
cat level and

3706
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:23,599
cat level and
 

3707
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,230
cat level and
party tricks yes so the issue for me is

3708
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:26,240
party tricks yes so the issue for me is
 

3709
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,150
party tricks yes so the issue for me is
currently not so much on how to build a

3710
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:28,160
currently not so much on how to build a
 

3711
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,710
currently not so much on how to build a
system that creates a story about a

3712
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:30,720
system that creates a story about a
 

3713
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,190
system that creates a story about a
robot that lives in the world but to

3714
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:33,200
robot that lives in the world but to
 

3715
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,029
robot that lives in the world but to
make an adequate representation of the

3716
01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:35,039
make an adequate representation of the
 

3717
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:36,470
make an adequate representation of the
world

3718
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:36,480
world
 

3719
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,109
world
and the model model that you and me have

3720
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:39,119
and the model model that you and me have
 

3721
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,910
and the model model that you and me have
is a unified one it's verb one where you

3722
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:41,920
is a unified one it's verb one where you
 

3723
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,150
is a unified one it's verb one where you
basically make sense of everything that

3724
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
basically make sense of everything that
 

3725
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,829
basically make sense of everything that
you can perceive every feature in the

3726
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
you can perceive every feature in the
 

3727
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,230
you can perceive every feature in the
world that enters your perception can be

3728
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
world that enters your perception can be
 

3729
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,470
world that enters your perception can be
relationally mapped to a unified model

3730
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
relationally mapped to a unified model
 

3731
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,670
relationally mapped to a unified model
of everything

3732
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:51,680
of everything
 

3733
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,589
of everything
and we don't have an ai that is able to

3734
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:53,599
and we don't have an ai that is able to
 

3735
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,150
and we don't have an ai that is able to
construct such a unified model yet

3736
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
construct such a unified model yet
 

3737
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,990
construct such a unified model yet
so you need that unified model to do the

3738
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,000
so you need that unified model to do the
 

3739
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,710
so you need that unified model to do the
party trick yes i think that uh you it

3740
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:00,720
party trick yes i think that uh you it
 

3741
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,549
party trick yes i think that uh you it
doesn't make sense if this thing is

3742
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:02,559
doesn't make sense if this thing is
 

3743
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,230
doesn't make sense if this thing is
conscious but not in the same universe

3744
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:04,240
conscious but not in the same universe
 

3745
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,750
conscious but not in the same universe
as you because you could not relate to

3746
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:05,760
as you because you could not relate to
 

3747
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,789
as you because you could not relate to
each other

3748
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:06,799
each other
 

3749
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,029
each other
so what's the process would you say of

3750
01:04:09,029 --> 01:04:09,039
so what's the process would you say of
 

3751
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:11,910
so what's the process would you say of
engineering consciousness in the machine

3752
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:11,920
engineering consciousness in the machine
 

3753
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,549
engineering consciousness in the machine
like what are the ideas here

3754
01:04:14,549 --> 01:04:14,559
like what are the ideas here
 

3755
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,870
like what are the ideas here
so uh you probably want to have some

3756
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:16,880
so uh you probably want to have some
 

3757
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,109
so uh you probably want to have some
kind of perceptual system this

3758
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:19,119
kind of perceptual system this
 

3759
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,190
kind of perceptual system this
perceptual system is a processing agent

3760
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,200
perceptual system is a processing agent
 

3761
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,990
perceptual system is a processing agent
that is able to track sensory data and

3762
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,000
that is able to track sensory data and
 

3763
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,390
that is able to track sensory data and
predict the next frame and the sensory

3764
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:26,400
predict the next frame and the sensory
 

3765
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,589
predict the next frame and the sensory
data from the

3766
01:04:27,589 --> 01:04:27,599
data from the
 

3767
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,910
data from the
previous frames of the sensory data in

3768
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:29,920
previous frames of the sensory data in
 

3769
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,910
previous frames of the sensory data in
the current state of the system so the

3770
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
the current state of the system so the
 

3771
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,829
the current state of the system so the
current state of the system is

3772
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:33,839
current state of the system is
 

3773
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,829
current state of the system is
perception instrumental to predicting

3774
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:35,839
perception instrumental to predicting
 

3775
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,510
perception instrumental to predicting
what happens next

3776
01:04:37,510 --> 01:04:37,520
what happens next
 

3777
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:39,109
what happens next
and this means you build lots and lots

3778
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:39,119
and this means you build lots and lots
 

3779
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:40,789
and this means you build lots and lots
of functions that take all the blips

3780
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:40,799
of functions that take all the blips
 

3781
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:42,789
of functions that take all the blips
that you feel on your skin and that you

3782
01:04:42,789 --> 01:04:42,799
that you feel on your skin and that you
 

3783
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,510
that you feel on your skin and that you
see on your retina or that you hear

3784
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:45,520
see on your retina or that you hear
 

3785
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,230
see on your retina or that you hear
and

3786
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:46,240
and
 

3787
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,990
and
puts them into a set of relationships

3788
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
puts them into a set of relationships
 

3789
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,230
puts them into a set of relationships
that allows you to predict what kind of

3790
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:50,240
that allows you to predict what kind of
 

3791
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,069
that allows you to predict what kind of
sensory data what kind of sensor of

3792
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:52,079
sensory data what kind of sensor of
 

3793
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,069
sensory data what kind of sensor of
blips your vector of blips you're going

3794
01:04:54,069 --> 01:04:54,079
blips your vector of blips you're going
 

3795
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,230
blips your vector of blips you're going
to perceive in the next frame right this

3796
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,240
to perceive in the next frame right this
 

3797
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,309
to perceive in the next frame right this
is tuned and it's

3798
01:04:58,309 --> 01:04:58,319
is tuned and it's
 

3799
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,990
is tuned and it's
constantly tuned until it gets as

3800
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000
constantly tuned until it gets as
 

3801
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,829
constantly tuned until it gets as
accurate as it can

3802
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:01,839
accurate as it can
 

3803
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:03,829
accurate as it can
you build a very accurate prediction

3804
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:03,839
you build a very accurate prediction
 

3805
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:05,109
you build a very accurate prediction
mechanism

3806
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:05,119
mechanism
 

3807
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,150
mechanism
that is step one of the perception so

3808
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:08,160
that is step one of the perception so
 

3809
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,069
that is step one of the perception so
first you predict then you perceive and

3810
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:10,079
first you predict then you perceive and
 

3811
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,910
first you predict then you perceive and
see the error in your prediction and you

3812
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:11,920
see the error in your prediction and you
 

3813
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,349
see the error in your prediction and you
have to do two things to make that

3814
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:13,359
have to do two things to make that
 

3815
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,190
have to do two things to make that
happen one is you have to build a

3816
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,200
happen one is you have to build a
 

3817
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,029
happen one is you have to build a
network of relationships that are

3818
01:05:17,029 --> 01:05:17,039
network of relationships that are
 

3819
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,390
network of relationships that are
constraints

3820
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,400
constraints
 

3821
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,510
constraints
that

3822
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:19,520
that
 

3823
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,029
that
take all the variants in the world to

3824
01:05:21,029 --> 01:05:21,039
take all the variants in the world to
 

3825
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,190
take all the variants in the world to
put each of the variances into a

3826
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:23,200
put each of the variances into a
 

3827
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,990
put each of the variances into a
variable variable that is connected with

3828
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,000
variable variable that is connected with
 

3829
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,069
variable variable that is connected with
relationships to other variables and

3830
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:28,079
relationships to other variables and
 

3831
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,589
relationships to other variables and
these relationships are computable

3832
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:29,599
these relationships are computable
 

3833
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,190
these relationships are computable
functions that constrain each other so

3834
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
functions that constrain each other so
 

3835
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,190
functions that constrain each other so
when you see a nose that points a

3836
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:33,200
when you see a nose that points a
 

3837
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,109
when you see a nose that points a
certain direction in space you have a

3838
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:35,119
certain direction in space you have a
 

3839
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,470
certain direction in space you have a
constraint that says there should be a

3840
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,480
constraint that says there should be a
 

3841
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,950
constraint that says there should be a
face nearby that has the same direction

3842
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
face nearby that has the same direction
 

3843
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,470
face nearby that has the same direction
right and if that is not the case you

3844
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,480
right and if that is not the case you
 

3845
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,829
right and if that is not the case you
have some kind of contradiction that you

3846
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:41,839
have some kind of contradiction that you
 

3847
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:43,270
have some kind of contradiction that you
need to resolve because it's probably

3848
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:43,280
need to resolve because it's probably
 

3849
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,630
need to resolve because it's probably
not a nose what you're looking at it

3850
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
not a nose what you're looking at it
 

3851
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,870
not a nose what you're looking at it
just looks like one so you have to

3852
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:46,880
just looks like one so you have to
 

3853
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,190
just looks like one so you have to
reinterpret the data and until you get

3854
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
reinterpret the data and until you get
 

3855
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,390
reinterpret the data and until you get
to a point where your model converges

3856
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:52,400
to a point where your model converges
 

3857
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,549
to a point where your model converges
and this process of making the sensory

3858
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:54,559
and this process of making the sensory
 

3859
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,789
and this process of making the sensory
data fit into your model structure is

3860
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:56,799
data fit into your model structure is
 

3861
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,589
data fit into your model structure is
what prg calls

3862
01:05:59,589 --> 01:05:59,599
what prg calls
 

3863
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,470
what prg calls
the assimilation and accommodation is

3864
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:02,480
the assimilation and accommodation is
 

3865
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,549
the assimilation and accommodation is
the change of the models where you

3866
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:04,559
the change of the models where you
 

3867
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:05,910
the change of the models where you
change your model such a way that you

3868
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:05,920
change your model such a way that you
 

3869
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,069
change your model such a way that you
can assimilate everything

3870
01:06:08,069 --> 01:06:08,079
can assimilate everything
 

3871
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,750
can assimilate everything
so you're you're talking about building

3872
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:09,760
so you're you're talking about building
 

3873
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,230
so you're you're talking about building
a hell of an awesome perception system

3874
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:12,240
a hell of an awesome perception system
 

3875
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,069
a hell of an awesome perception system
that's able to do prediction and

3876
01:06:14,069 --> 01:06:14,079
that's able to do prediction and
 

3877
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,910
that's able to do prediction and
perception and correct and improvement

3878
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:15,920
perception and correct and improvement
 

3879
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,150
perception and correct and improvement
wait just uh if you had to wait there's

3880
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:18,160
wait just uh if you had to wait there's
 

3881
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,470
wait just uh if you had to wait there's
more yes there's more so the first thing

3882
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:20,480
more yes there's more so the first thing
 

3883
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,069
more yes there's more so the first thing
that we want to do is we want to

3884
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:22,079
that we want to do is we want to
 

3885
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,309
that we want to do is we want to
minimize the contradictions in the model

3886
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:24,319
minimize the contradictions in the model
 

3887
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,390
minimize the contradictions in the model
yes and of course it's very easy to make

3888
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
yes and of course it's very easy to make
 

3889
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,510
yes and of course it's very easy to make
a model in which you minimize the

3890
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:27,520
a model in which you minimize the
 

3891
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,349
a model in which you minimize the
contradictions just by allowing that it

3892
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:29,359
contradictions just by allowing that it
 

3893
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,270
contradictions just by allowing that it
can be in many many possible states

3894
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:31,280
can be in many many possible states
 

3895
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,349
can be in many many possible states
right so if you increase degrees of

3896
01:06:33,349 --> 01:06:33,359
right so if you increase degrees of
 

3897
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:34,630
right so if you increase degrees of
freedom you will have fewer

3898
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:34,640
freedom you will have fewer
 

3899
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,630
freedom you will have fewer
contradictions but you also want to

3900
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:36,640
contradictions but you also want to
 

3901
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,150
contradictions but you also want to
reduce the degrees of freedom because

3902
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:38,160
reduce the degrees of freedom because
 

3903
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,230
reduce the degrees of freedom because
degrees of freedom mean uncertainty

3904
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:40,240
degrees of freedom mean uncertainty
 

3905
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,829
degrees of freedom mean uncertainty
you want your model to reduce

3906
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:41,839
you want your model to reduce
 

3907
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,309
you want your model to reduce
uncertainty as much as possible

3908
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:44,319
uncertainty as much as possible
 

3909
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,710
uncertainty as much as possible
but reducing uncertainty is expensive so

3910
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:46,720
but reducing uncertainty is expensive so
 

3911
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,390
but reducing uncertainty is expensive so
you have to have a trade-off between

3912
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:48,400
you have to have a trade-off between
 

3913
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,430
you have to have a trade-off between
minimizing contradictions and reducing

3914
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:51,440
minimizing contradictions and reducing
 

3915
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,589
minimizing contradictions and reducing
uncertainty and you have only finite

3916
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:53,599
uncertainty and you have only finite
 

3917
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:56,470
uncertainty and you have only finite
amount of compute and experimental time

3918
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:56,480
amount of compute and experimental time
 

3919
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,990
amount of compute and experimental time
and effort available to reduce

3920
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
and effort available to reduce
 

3921
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,390
and effort available to reduce
uncertainty in the world so you need to

3922
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:00,400
uncertainty in the world so you need to
 

3923
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,710
uncertainty in the world so you need to
assign value to what you observe

3924
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:02,720
assign value to what you observe
 

3925
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,230
assign value to what you observe
so you need some kind of motivational

3926
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
so you need some kind of motivational
 

3927
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,789
so you need some kind of motivational
system that is estimating what you

3928
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:06,799
system that is estimating what you
 

3929
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:08,309
system that is estimating what you
should be looking at and what you should

3930
01:07:08,309 --> 01:07:08,319
should be looking at and what you should
 

3931
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,750
should be looking at and what you should
be thinking about it how you should be

3932
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:09,760
be thinking about it how you should be
 

3933
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,510
be thinking about it how you should be
applying your resources to model what

3934
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:11,520
applying your resources to model what
 

3935
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,710
applying your resources to model what
that is

3936
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
that is
 

3937
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,789
that is
right so you need to have something like

3938
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:14,799
right so you need to have something like
 

3939
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,470
right so you need to have something like
uh convergence links that tell you how

3940
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:16,480
uh convergence links that tell you how
 

3941
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,750
uh convergence links that tell you how
to get from the present state of the

3942
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:17,760
to get from the present state of the
 

3943
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,589
to get from the present state of the
model to the next one you need to have

3944
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:19,599
model to the next one you need to have
 

3945
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,430
model to the next one you need to have
these compatibility links that tell you

3946
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:21,440
these compatibility links that tell you
 

3947
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,750
these compatibility links that tell you
which constraints exist and which

3948
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:23,760
which constraints exist and which
 

3949
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,470
which constraints exist and which
constraint violations exist and you need

3950
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:26,480
constraint violations exist and you need
 

3951
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,950
constraint violations exist and you need
to have some kind of motivational system

3952
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:28,960
to have some kind of motivational system
 

3953
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,710
to have some kind of motivational system
that tells you what to pay attention to

3954
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:30,720
that tells you what to pay attention to
 

3955
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,309
that tells you what to pay attention to
so now we have a second agent next to

3956
01:07:32,309 --> 01:07:32,319
so now we have a second agent next to
 

3957
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,270
so now we have a second agent next to
the perceptual age we have a

3958
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,280
the perceptual age we have a
 

3959
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,870
the perceptual age we have a
motivational agent

3960
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:34,880
motivational agent
 

3961
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,029
motivational agent
this is a cybernetic system that is

3962
01:07:37,029 --> 01:07:37,039
this is a cybernetic system that is
 

3963
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,029
this is a cybernetic system that is
modeling what the system needs what's

3964
01:07:39,029 --> 01:07:39,039
modeling what the system needs what's
 

3965
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:40,789
modeling what the system needs what's
important for the system and that

3966
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:40,799
important for the system and that
 

3967
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,309
important for the system and that
interacts with the perceptual system to

3968
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:42,319
interacts with the perceptual system to
 

3969
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:44,549
interacts with the perceptual system to
maximize the expected reward

3970
01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:44,559
maximize the expected reward
 

3971
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,069
maximize the expected reward
and you're saying a motivational system

3972
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
and you're saying a motivational system
 

3973
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,710
and you're saying a motivational system
is some kind of

3974
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:48,720
is some kind of
 

3975
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:51,029
is some kind of
like what is it a higher level narrative

3976
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:51,039
like what is it a higher level narrative
 

3977
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,029
like what is it a higher level narrative
over some lower level no it's just your

3978
01:07:53,029 --> 01:07:53,039
over some lower level no it's just your
 

3979
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,029
over some lower level no it's just your
brainstem stuff the limbic system stuff

3980
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:55,039
brainstem stuff the limbic system stuff
 

3981
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,029
brainstem stuff the limbic system stuff
that tells you okay now you should get

3982
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:57,039
that tells you okay now you should get
 

3983
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,230
that tells you okay now you should get
something to eat because i've just

3984
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:58,240
something to eat because i've just
 

3985
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,069
something to eat because i've just
measured your dual blood sugar like

3986
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:00,079
measured your dual blood sugar like
 

3987
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,430
measured your dual blood sugar like
motivational system like the lower

3988
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:01,440
motivational system like the lower
 

3989
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,150
motivational system like the lower
levels yes like hungry yes but there's

3990
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,160
levels yes like hungry yes but there's
 

3991
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,990
levels yes like hungry yes but there's
basically a physiological needs and some

3992
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,000
basically a physiological needs and some
 

3993
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,510
basically a physiological needs and some
cognitive needs and some social needs

3994
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:07,520
cognitive needs and some social needs
 

3995
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,870
cognitive needs and some social needs
and they all interact and they're all

3996
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:08,880
and they all interact and they're all
 

3997
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,630
and they all interact and they're all
implemented at different parts in your

3998
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:10,640
implemented at different parts in your
 

3999
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,390
implemented at different parts in your
nervous system as the motivational

4000
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:12,400
nervous system as the motivational
 

4001
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,829
nervous system as the motivational
system but they're basically cybernetic

4002
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:13,839
system but they're basically cybernetic
 

4003
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:16,309
system but they're basically cybernetic
feedback loops it's not that complicated

4004
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:16,319
feedback loops it's not that complicated
 

4005
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,229
feedback loops it's not that complicated
it's just a lot of code

4006
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
it's just a lot of code
 

4007
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:19,749
it's just a lot of code
and

4008
01:08:19,749 --> 01:08:19,759
and
 

4009
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:21,349
and
so you now have a motivational agent

4010
01:08:21,349 --> 01:08:21,359
so you now have a motivational agent
 

4011
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,189
so you now have a motivational agent
that makes your robot go for the ball or

4012
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:23,199
that makes your robot go for the ball or
 

4013
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,829
that makes your robot go for the ball or
that makes your worm go to eat

4014
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
that makes your worm go to eat
 

4015
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,229
that makes your worm go to eat
food and so on and you have the

4016
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:28,239
food and so on and you have the
 

4017
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,910
food and so on and you have the
perceptual system that lets it predict

4018
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:29,920
perceptual system that lets it predict
 

4019
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,590
perceptual system that lets it predict
that environment so it's able to solve

4020
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:31,600
that environment so it's able to solve
 

4021
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,590
that environment so it's able to solve
that control problem to some degree

4022
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:33,600
that control problem to some degree
 

4023
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,269
that control problem to some degree
and now what we learned is that it's

4024
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:35,279
and now what we learned is that it's
 

4025
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,870
and now what we learned is that it's
very hard to build a machine learning

4026
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:36,880
very hard to build a machine learning
 

4027
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,470
very hard to build a machine learning
system that looks at all the data

4028
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:38,480
system that looks at all the data
 

4029
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,630
system that looks at all the data
simultaneously to see what kind of

4030
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:40,640
simultaneously to see what kind of
 

4031
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,189
simultaneously to see what kind of
relationships could exist between them

4032
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:43,199
relationships could exist between them
 

4033
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:44,789
relationships could exist between them
so you need to selectively model the

4034
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:44,799
so you need to selectively model the
 

4035
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:47,269
so you need to selectively model the
world you need to figure out where can i

4036
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:47,279
world you need to figure out where can i
 

4037
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,789
world you need to figure out where can i
make the biggest difference if i would

4038
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:48,799
make the biggest difference if i would
 

4039
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,950
make the biggest difference if i would
put the following things together

4040
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:50,960
put the following things together
 

4041
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,709
put the following things together
sometimes you find a gradient for that

4042
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:52,719
sometimes you find a gradient for that
 

4043
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,470
sometimes you find a gradient for that
right when you have a gradient you don't

4044
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:54,480
right when you have a gradient you don't
 

4045
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,550
right when you have a gradient you don't
need to remember where you came from you

4046
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
need to remember where you came from you
 

4047
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,829
need to remember where you came from you
just follow the gradient until it

4048
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:57,839
just follow the gradient until it
 

4049
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,990
just follow the gradient until it
doesn't get any better but if you have a

4050
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:00,000
doesn't get any better but if you have a
 

4051
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,269
doesn't get any better but if you have a
word where the problems are

discontinuous and the search spaces are
 

4055
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,910
discontinuous and the search spaces are
discontinuous you need to retain memory

4056
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:05,920
discontinuous you need to retain memory
 

4057
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,669
discontinuous you need to retain memory
of what you explored and you need to

4058
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:07,679
of what you explored and you need to
 

4059
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,470
of what you explored and you need to
construct a plan of what to explore next

4060
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:10,480
construct a plan of what to explore next
 

4061
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,950
construct a plan of what to explore next
and this thing that means that you have

4062
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:12,960
and this thing that means that you have
 

4063
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,630
and this thing that means that you have

is required for consciousness and
 

4077
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:32,550
is required for consciousness and
consciousness it is its control model

consciousness it is its control model
 

4079
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,470
consciousness it is its control model
so it's the index memories that this

4080
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
so it's the index memories that this
 

4081
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,110
so it's the index memories that this
thing retains when it manipulates the

4082
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:37,120
thing retains when it manipulates the
 

4083
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,110
thing retains when it manipulates the
perceptual representations

maximize the value and minimize the
 

4089
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,709
maximize the value and minimize the

4090
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:44,719
conflicts and it to increase coherence
 

4091
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,550

so the purpose of consciousness is to
 

4093
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,390
so the purpose of consciousness is to
create coherence in your perception

4094
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:48,400
create coherence in your perception
 

4095

to look for alternatives and these index
 

4115
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,270
to look for alternatives and these index
memories that you can recall that is

4116
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:13,280
memories that you can recall that is
 

4117
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,830
memories that you can recall that is
what you perceive as your stream of

4118
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:14,840
what you perceive as your stream of
 

4119
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,110
what you perceive as your stream of
consciousness and being able to recall

4120
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:17,120
consciousness and being able to recall
 

4121
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,550
consciousness and being able to recall
these memories this is what makes you

4122
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
these memories this is what makes you
 

4123
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,630
these memories this is what makes you
conscious if you could not remember what

4124
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:20,640
conscious if you could not remember what
 

4125
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,070
conscious if you could not remember what
you paid attention to you wouldn't be

4126
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:22,080
you paid attention to you wouldn't be
 

4127
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:26,070
you paid attention to you wouldn't be
conscious

4128
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:26,080

 

4129
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,830

so consciousness is the index in the

4130
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:27,840
so consciousness is the index in the
 

4131
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,870
so consciousness is the index in the
memory database okay

4132
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:30,880
memory database okay
 

4133
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,550
memory database okay
uh but

4134
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:32,560
uh but
 

4135
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,870
uh but
let me sneak up to the questions of

4136
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:34,880
let me sneak up to the questions of
 

4137
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,110
let me sneak up to the questions of
consciousness a little further

4138
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,120
consciousness a little further
 

4139
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,669
consciousness a little further
so we usually

4140
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:39,679
so we usually
 

4141
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,630
so we usually
relate suffering to consciousness

4142
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:42,640
relate suffering to consciousness
 

4143
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:46,149
relate suffering to consciousness
so the capacity to suffer

4144
01:10:46,149 --> 01:10:46,159

 

4145
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,070

i think to me that's a really strong

4146
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:48,080
i think to me that's a really strong
 

4147
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,669
i think to me that's a really strong
sign of consciousness

4148
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:49,679
sign of consciousness
 

4149
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,470
sign of consciousness
is a thing that can suffer

4150
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:52,480
is a thing that can suffer
 

4151
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,110
is a thing that can suffer
how how is that useful

4152
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:55,120
how how is that useful
 

4153
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,110
how how is that useful
suffering

4154
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:57,120
suffering
 

4155
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,110
suffering
and like in your model what you just

4156
01:10:59,110 --> 01:10:59,120
and like in your model what you just
 

4157
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,590
and like in your model what you just
described which is indexing of memories

4158
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,600
described which is indexing of memories
 

4159
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,630
described which is indexing of memories
and

4160
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:02,640
and
 

4161
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,070
and
what is the coherence with the

4162
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
what is the coherence with the
 

4163
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,830
what is the coherence with the
perception

4164
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:05,840
perception
 

4165
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,270
perception
uh with this predictive thing that's

4166
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,280
uh with this predictive thing that's
 

4167
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,270
uh with this predictive thing that's
going on the perception

4168
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:09,280
going on the perception
 

4169
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,189
going on the perception
how how does suffering relate to any of

4170
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:11,199
how how does suffering relate to any of
 

4171
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:12,709
how how does suffering relate to any of
that

4172
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:12,719
that
 

4173
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,229
that
you know the higher level suffering that

4174
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:14,239
you know the higher level suffering that
 

4175
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,470
you know the higher level suffering that
humans do

4176
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:16,480
humans do
 

4177
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,750
humans do
basically pain is a reinforcement signal

4178
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:19,760
basically pain is a reinforcement signal
 

4179
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,110
basically pain is a reinforcement signal
it pain

4180
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,120
it pain
 

4181
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,350
it pain
is a signal that one part of your brain

4182
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:23,360
is a signal that one part of your brain
 

4183
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,430
is a signal that one part of your brain
sends to another part of your brain or

4184
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:25,440
sends to another part of your brain or
 

4185
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,830
sends to another part of your brain or
an abstract sense part of your mind

4186
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
an abstract sense part of your mind
 

4187
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,830
an abstract sense part of your mind
sends to another part of the mind to

4188
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:29,840
sends to another part of the mind to
 

4189
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,910
sends to another part of the mind to
regulate its behavior to tell it the

4190
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:31,920
regulate its behavior to tell it the
 

4191
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,950
regulate its behavior to tell it the
behavior that you're currently

4192
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:32,960
behavior that you're currently
 

4193
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,870
behavior that you're currently
exhibiting should be improved

4194
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:34,880
exhibiting should be improved
 

4195
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,030
exhibiting should be improved
and this is the signal that i tell you

4196
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,040
and this is the signal that i tell you
 

4197
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:37,990
and this is the signal that i tell you
uh

4198
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:38,000
uh
 

4199
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,830
uh
to move away from what you're currently

4200
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:39,840
to move away from what you're currently
 

4201
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,750
to move away from what you're currently
doing and push into a different

4202
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:41,760
doing and push into a different
 

4203
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,630
doing and push into a different
direction so pain gives you a

4204
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:44,640
direction so pain gives you a
 

4205
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,630
direction so pain gives you a
part of you an impulse to do something

4206
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:46,640
part of you an impulse to do something
 

4207
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:47,830
part of you an impulse to do something
differently

4208
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:47,840
differently
 

4209
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,229
differently
but sometimes this doesn't work because

4210
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:50,239
but sometimes this doesn't work because
 

4211
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,229
but sometimes this doesn't work because
for the training part of your brain is

4212
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:52,239
for the training part of your brain is
 

4213
01:11:52,239 --> 01:11:54,790
for the training part of your brain is
talking to the wrong region or because

4214
01:11:54,790 --> 01:11:54,800
talking to the wrong region or because
 

4215
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,070
talking to the wrong region or because
it has the wrong model of the

4216
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:56,080
it has the wrong model of the
 

4217
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,510
it has the wrong model of the
relationships in the world maybe you're

4218
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:57,520
relationships in the world maybe you're
 

4219
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,709
relationships in the world maybe you're
mismodeling yourself or you're

4220
01:11:58,709 --> 01:11:58,719
mismodeling yourself or you're
 

4221
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,790
mismodeling yourself or you're
mismodding the relationship of yourself

4222
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:00,800
mismodding the relationship of yourself
 

4223
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,229
mismodding the relationship of yourself
to the world or you're mismodeling the

4224
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:02,239
to the world or you're mismodeling the
 

4225
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:03,990
to the world or you're mismodeling the
dynamics of the world so you're trying

4226
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,000
dynamics of the world so you're trying
 

4227
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,669
dynamics of the world so you're trying
to improve something that cannot be

4228
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:05,679
to improve something that cannot be
 

4229
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,149
to improve something that cannot be
improved by generating more pain but the

4230
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:08,159
improved by generating more pain but the
 

4231
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:10,310
improved by generating more pain but the
system doesn't have any alternative

4232
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:10,320
system doesn't have any alternative
 

4233
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,550
system doesn't have any alternative
so the uh it doesn't get better what do

4234
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:12,560
so the uh it doesn't get better what do
 

4235
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,149
so the uh it doesn't get better what do
you do if something doesn't get better

4236
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:14,159
you do if something doesn't get better
 

4237
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,910
you do if something doesn't get better
and you want it to get better you

4238
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:15,920
and you want it to get better you
 

4239
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,990
and you want it to get better you
increase the strength of the signal and

4240
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:18,000
increase the strength of the signal and
 

4241
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,750
increase the strength of the signal and
then the signal becomes chronic when it

4242
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:19,760
then the signal becomes chronic when it
 

4243
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,750
then the signal becomes chronic when it
becomes permanent without a change

4244
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:21,760
becomes permanent without a change
 

4245
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,229
becomes permanent without a change
inside this is what we call suffering

4246
01:12:24,229 --> 01:12:24,239
inside this is what we call suffering
 

4247
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,630
inside this is what we call suffering
and the purpose of consciousness is to

4248
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:26,640
and the purpose of consciousness is to
 

4249
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,550
and the purpose of consciousness is to
deal with contradictions with things

4250
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:28,560
deal with contradictions with things
 

4251
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,229
deal with contradictions with things
that cannot be resolved

4252
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:30,239
that cannot be resolved
 

4253
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:32,149
that cannot be resolved
the purpose of consciousness i think is

4254
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:32,159
the purpose of consciousness i think is
 

4255
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,950
the purpose of consciousness i think is
similar to a conductor in an orchestra

4256
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
similar to a conductor in an orchestra
 

4257
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,110
similar to a conductor in an orchestra
when everything works well the orchestra

4258
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:37,120
when everything works well the orchestra
 

4259
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,790
when everything works well the orchestra
doesn't need much of a conductor as long

4260
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
doesn't need much of a conductor as long
 

4261
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,030
doesn't need much of a conductor as long
as it's coherent but when there is a

4262
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,040
as it's coherent but when there is a
 

4263
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,870
as it's coherent but when there is a
lack of coherence or something is

4264
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:42,880
lack of coherence or something is
 

4265
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,030
lack of coherence or something is
consistently producing disharmony and

4266
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:45,040
consistently producing disharmony and
 

4267
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,430
consistently producing disharmony and
mismatches then the conductor becomes

4268
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,440
mismatches then the conductor becomes
 

4269
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,990
mismatches then the conductor becomes
alert and interacts with it so suffering

4270
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:50,000
alert and interacts with it so suffering
 

4271
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,430
alert and interacts with it so suffering
attracts the activity of our

4272
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:51,440
attracts the activity of our
 

4273
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,550
attracts the activity of our
consciousness

4274
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
consciousness
 

4275
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,870
consciousness
and the purpose of that is ideally that

4276
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:54,880
and the purpose of that is ideally that
 

4277
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,189
and the purpose of that is ideally that
we bring new layers online new layers of

4278
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:57,199
we bring new layers online new layers of
 

4279
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,630
we bring new layers online new layers of
modeling that

4280
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:58,640
modeling that
 

4281
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,189
modeling that
are able to create a model of the

4282
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:01,199
are able to create a model of the
 

4283
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,390
are able to create a model of the
dysregulation so we can deal with it

4284
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
dysregulation so we can deal with it
 

4285
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,790
dysregulation so we can deal with it
and this means that we typically get

4286
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:06,800
and this means that we typically get
 

4287
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,470
and this means that we typically get
higher level consciousness so to speak

4288
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:08,480
higher level consciousness so to speak
 

4289
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,070
higher level consciousness so to speak
right we get some consciousness above

4290
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,080
right we get some consciousness above
 

4291
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,910
right we get some consciousness above
our pay grade maybe if we have some

4292
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:11,920
our pay grade maybe if we have some
 

4293
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,669
our pay grade maybe if we have some
suffering early in our life most of the

4294
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:13,679
suffering early in our life most of the
 

4295
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,750
suffering early in our life most of the
interesting people had trauma early on

4296
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:15,760
interesting people had trauma early on
 

4297
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,390
interesting people had trauma early on
in their childhood and trauma means that

4298
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:18,400
in their childhood and trauma means that
 

4299
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,270
in their childhood and trauma means that
you are suffering an injury for which

4300
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:21,280
you are suffering an injury for which
 

4301
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,430
you are suffering an injury for which
the system is not prepared which it

4302
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:23,440
the system is not prepared which it
 

4303
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,870
the system is not prepared which it
cannot deal with which it cannot

4304
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:24,880
cannot deal with which it cannot
 

4305
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,830
cannot deal with which it cannot
insulate itself from so something breaks

4306
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
insulate itself from so something breaks
 

4307
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,430
insulate itself from so something breaks
and this means that the behavior of the

4308
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:29,440
and this means that the behavior of the
 

4309
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,630
and this means that the behavior of the
system is permanently

4310
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:32,640
system is permanently
 

4311
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,790
system is permanently
disturbed in the way that

4312
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:34,800
disturbed in the way that
 

4313
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,550
disturbed in the way that
some mismatch exists now in the

4314
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,560
some mismatch exists now in the
 

4315
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,550
some mismatch exists now in the
regulation that just by following your

4316
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:38,560
regulation that just by following your
 

4317
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,630
regulation that just by following your
impulses by following the pain in the

4318
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:40,640
impulses by following the pain in the
 

4319
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,310
impulses by following the pain in the
direction which it hurts the situation

4320
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:42,320
direction which it hurts the situation
 

4321
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:44,310
direction which it hurts the situation
doesn't improve but get worse

4322
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:44,320
doesn't improve but get worse
 

4323
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,149
doesn't improve but get worse
and so what needs to happen is that you

4324
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:46,159
and so what needs to happen is that you
 

4325
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:47,270
and so what needs to happen is that you
grow up

4326
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:47,280
grow up
 

4327
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,189
grow up
yeah that and that's part that has grown

4328
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:49,199
yeah that and that's part that has grown
 

4329
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,750
yeah that and that's part that has grown
up is able to deal with the part that is

4330
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:51,760
up is able to deal with the part that is
 

4331
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,750
up is able to deal with the part that is
stuck in this earlier phase yeah so it

4332
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:53,760
stuck in this earlier phase yeah so it
 

4333
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,390
stuck in this earlier phase yeah so it
leads to growth adding extra layers to

4334
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:56,400
leads to growth adding extra layers to
 

4335
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,110
leads to growth adding extra layers to
okay to your cognition uh

4336
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,120
okay to your cognition uh
 

4337
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,709
okay to your cognition uh
let me ask you then because i got to

4338
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719
let me ask you then because i got to
 

4339
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,030
let me ask you then because i got to
stick on suffering uh the ethics of the

4340
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,040
stick on suffering uh the ethics of the
 

4341
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,350
stick on suffering uh the ethics of the
whole thing

4342
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:05,360
whole thing
 

4343
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,270
whole thing
so not our consciousness but the

4344
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:07,280
so not our consciousness but the
 

4345
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,070
so not our consciousness but the
consciousness of others you've uh

4346
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080
consciousness of others you've uh
 

4347
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,270
consciousness of others you've uh
uh tweeted one of my biggest fears

4348
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:13,280
uh tweeted one of my biggest fears
 

4349
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,229
uh tweeted one of my biggest fears
is that insects could be conscious the

4350
01:14:16,229 --> 01:14:16,239
is that insects could be conscious the
 

4351
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:17,910
is that insects could be conscious the
amount of suffering on earth would be

4352
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:17,920
amount of suffering on earth would be
 

4353
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,229
amount of suffering on earth would be
unthinkable

4354
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
unthinkable
 

4355
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,910
unthinkable
so

4356
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:21,920
so
 

4357
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,669
so
when we think of other conscious beings

4358
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:25,679
when we think of other conscious beings
 

4359
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:26,830
when we think of other conscious beings
is

4360
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:26,840
is
 

4361
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,149
is
suffering a property of consciousness

4362
01:14:30,149 --> 01:14:30,159
suffering a property of consciousness
 

4363
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:32,550
suffering a property of consciousness
that we're most concerned about

4364
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:32,560
that we're most concerned about
 

4365
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,709
that we're most concerned about
so

4366
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:36,719

 

4367
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,070

i'm still thinking about robots

4368
01:14:40,070 --> 01:14:40,080
i'm still thinking about robots
 

4369
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,310
i'm still thinking about robots
how to make sense of other non-human

4370
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:42,320
how to make sense of other non-human
 

4371
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,470
how to make sense of other non-human
things

4372
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:44,480
things
 

4373
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,470
things
that appear to have

4374
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:46,480
that appear to have
 

4375
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,550
that appear to have
the depth of experience that humans have

4376
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:50,560
the depth of experience that humans have
 

4377
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,149
the depth of experience that humans have
and to me

4378
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:52,159
and to me
 

4379
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,189
and to me
that means consciousness and the darkest

4380
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:55,199
that means consciousness and the darkest
 

4381
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,270
that means consciousness and the darkest
side of that which is suffering

4382
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:57,280
side of that which is suffering
 

4383
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,149
side of that which is suffering
the capacity to suffer

4384
01:15:00,149 --> 01:15:00,159
the capacity to suffer
 

4385
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,310
the capacity to suffer
and so i start thinking

4386
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:02,320
and so i start thinking
 

4387
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,070
and so i start thinking
how much responsibility do we have for

4388
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:04,080
how much responsibility do we have for
 

4389
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,630
how much responsibility do we have for
those other conscious beings

4390
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:06,640
those other conscious beings
 

4391
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,550
those other conscious beings
that's where the um

4392
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:08,560
that's where the um
 

4393
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,870
that's where the um
the definition of consciousness

4394
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
the definition of consciousness
 

4395
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,750
the definition of consciousness
becomes most urgent like having to come

4396
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:13,760
becomes most urgent like having to come
 

4397
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,030
becomes most urgent like having to come
up with a definition of consciousness

4398
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,040
up with a definition of consciousness
 

4399
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,870
up with a definition of consciousness
becomes most urgent

4400
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:16,880
becomes most urgent
 

4401
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,470
becomes most urgent

consciousness but
 

4427
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,870
consciousness but
these are the things that matter to me

these are the things that matter to me
 

4429

these are the things that matter to me
if they suffer or not and these are the

4430
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:50,719
if they suffer or not and these are the
 

4431
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,870
if they suffer or not and these are the
things that don't matter yeah but when

4432
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:52,880
things that don't matter yeah but when
 

4433
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,669
things that don't matter yeah but when
one of his commanders failed him he uh

4434
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679
one of his commanders failed him he uh
 

4435
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,910
one of his commanders failed him he uh
broke his spine and let him die

4436
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:57,920
broke his spine and let him die
 

4437
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,630
broke his spine and let him die
in a horrible way and uh so

4438
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:00,640
in a horrible way and uh so
 

4439
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,470
in a horrible way and uh so
in some sense i think he was indifferent

4440
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,480
in some sense i think he was indifferent
 

4441
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,750
in some sense i think he was indifferent
to suffering

4442
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:03,760
to suffering
 

4443
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,669
to suffering
or he was not different in the sense

4444
01:16:05,669 --> 01:16:05,679
or he was not different in the sense
 

4445
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:06,870
or he was not different in the sense
that he didn't

4446
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:06,880
that he didn't
 

4447
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,709
that he didn't
see it as useful if he inflicted

4448
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719
see it as useful if he inflicted
 

4449
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,310
see it as useful if he inflicted
suffering

4450
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:10,320
suffering
 

4451
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,110
suffering
but he did not see it as something that

4452
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:13,120
but he did not see it as something that
 

4453
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,350
but he did not see it as something that
had to be avoided that was not the goal

4454
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,360
had to be avoided that was not the goal
 

4455
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,709
had to be avoided that was not the goal
the question was how can i use suffering

4456
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:18,719
the question was how can i use suffering
 

4457
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:20,550
the question was how can i use suffering
and the infliction of suffering to reach

4458
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:20,560
and the infliction of suffering to reach
 

4459
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,830
and the infliction of suffering to reach
my goals from his perspective

4460
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:23,840
my goals from his perspective
 

4461
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,830
my goals from his perspective
i i see so like different societies

4462
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:25,840
i i see so like different societies
 

4463
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,229
i i see so like different societies
throughout history put different value

4464
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
throughout history put different value
 

4465
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,830
throughout history put different value
on

4466
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:29,840
on
 

4467
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,510
on
different individuals different psyches

4468
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:31,520
different individuals different psyches
 

4469
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,510
different individuals different psyches
but also even the uh the objective of

4470
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:33,520
but also even the uh the objective of
 

4471
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,390
but also even the uh the objective of
avoiding suffering like some society is

4472
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:36,400
avoiding suffering like some society is
 

4473
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,430
avoiding suffering like some society is
probably

4474
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:37,440
probably
 

4475
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,950
probably
i mean this is where like religious

4476
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960
i mean this is where like religious
 

4477
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,709
i mean this is where like religious
belief really helps

4478
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:40,719
belief really helps
 

4479
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,669
belief really helps
that that afterlife

4480
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:43,679
that that afterlife
 

4481
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,510
that that afterlife
that doesn't matter that you suffer or

4482
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:45,520
that doesn't matter that you suffer or
 

4483
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,470
that doesn't matter that you suffer or
die what matters is you suffer honorably

4484
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
die what matters is you suffer honorably
 

4485
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,270
die what matters is you suffer honorably
right

4486
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:49,280
right
 

4487
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,149
right
so that you enter the afterlife

4488
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:52,159
so that you enter the afterlife
 

4489
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,830
so that you enter the afterlife
it seems to be superstitious to me

4490
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:53,840
it seems to be superstitious to me
 

4491
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,590
it seems to be superstitious to me
basically beliefs that

4492
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:55,600
basically beliefs that
 

4493
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,550
basically beliefs that
assert things uh for which no evidence

4494
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:58,560
assert things uh for which no evidence
 

4495
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,990
assert things uh for which no evidence
exists

are incompatible with sound epistemology
 

4499
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,590

and i don't think that religion has to

4500
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:03,600
and i don't think that religion has to
 

4501
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,430
and i don't think that religion has to
be superstitious otherwise it should be

4502
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:05,440
be superstitious otherwise it should be
 

4503
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,110
be superstitious otherwise it should be

world we have zero evidence for anything
so that's not the case

4510
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:13,360
so that's not the case
 

4511
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,189
so that's not the case
there are limits to what languages can

we

and so on we can
begin to realize that our intuitions

begin to realize that our intuitions
 

4529

begin to realize that our intuitions

that we are able to learn about the

01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,470
some of them post structuralist and so
on and i'm mostly not interested in it

true and that we can often get to a

true and that we can often get to a
 

4689
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,229
true and that we can often get to a
different interpretation by the world by

4690
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:24,239
different interpretation by the world by
 

4691
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,310
different interpretation by the world by
using a different ontology that is

4692
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,320
using a different ontology that is
 

4693
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,830
using a different ontology that is
different separation of the world into

but the idea that this makes the world a

but the idea that this makes the world a

that are arbitrary i think is wrong
 

4703
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:39,030
that are arbitrary i think is wrong
and the people that are engaging in this

4704
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:39,040
and the people that are engaging in this
 

4705
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,990
and the people that are engaging in this
type of philosophy are working in in an

out of this so this idea that truth is

4712
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:47,600
out of this so this idea that truth is
 

4713
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,350
out of this so this idea that truth is
relative is not something that has in

relative is not something that has in
 

4715
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:51,990
relative is not something that has in
some sense informed physics or theory of

some sense informed physics or theory of
 

4717
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,590
some sense informed physics or theory of

between those there is no meaningful

there's nothing wrong i think with uh

there's nothing wrong i think with uh
 

4769
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,430
there's nothing wrong i think with uh
developing a philosophy around this but

4770
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:49,440
developing a philosophy around this but
 

4771
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,470
developing a philosophy around this but
to develop norms around the idea that

4772

to develop norms around the idea that
 

4773

to develop norms around the idea that
truth is something that is completely

4778
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,400
scientific project
 

4779
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,189
scientific project
and i think if the uh if the academia

4780
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:01,199
and i think if the uh if the academia
 

4781
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,750
and i think if the uh if the academia
has no defense against the ideological

4782
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:03,760
has no defense against the ideological
 

4783

you have the truth and nobody else but
 

4829
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,629
you have the truth and nobody else but
what is creating the certainty it's very

4830
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:50,639
what is creating the certainty it's very
 

4831
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:52,950
what is creating the certainty it's very
interesting to look at the type of model

4832
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:52,960
interesting to look at the type of model
 

4833
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,870
interesting to look at the type of model
that is being produced is it basically

4834
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:54,880
that is being produced is it basically
 

4835
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,189
that is being produced is it basically
just to draw a strong prior and you tell

4836
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:57,199
just to draw a strong prior and you tell
 

4837
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,270
just to draw a strong prior and you tell
people oh this idea that you consider to

4838
01:22:59,270 --> 01:22:59,280
people oh this idea that you consider to
 

4839
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:00,950
people oh this idea that you consider to
be very true the evidence for this is

4840
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:00,960
be very true the evidence for this is
 

4841
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,550
be very true the evidence for this is
actually just much weaker than you

4842
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,560
actually just much weaker than you
 

4843
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,470
actually just much weaker than you
thought and look here at some studies no

4844
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,480

this is not how it works it's usually

normative which means
some thoughts are unthinkable because

into a certain mode of thought this
removes agency over your own thoughts

4864
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
removes agency over your own thoughts

removes agency over your own thoughts
it's very ugly to me it's basically not

4866
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:30,000
it's very ugly to me it's basically not
 

4867
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,030
it's very ugly to me it's basically not
just a process of domestication but it's

4868
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:33,040
just a process of domestication but it's
 

4869
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,550
just a process of domestication but it's
actually an intellectual

4870
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:34,560
actually an intellectual
 

4871
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,870
actually an intellectual
castration that happens it's an

4872
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:36,880
castration that happens it's an
 

4873
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,430
castration that happens it's an
inability to think creatively and to

4874
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:39,440
inability to think creatively and to
 

4875
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,270
inability to think creatively and to
bring forth new thoughts

4876
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:43,280

 

4877
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,990

can i ask you about

4878
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,000
can i ask you about
 

4879
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,470
can i ask you about
substances chemical substances that

4880
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:48,480
substances chemical substances that
 

4881
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:51,669
substances chemical substances that
affect the video game

the dream world
 

4885
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,110
the dream world
so psychedelics

4886
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:55,120
so psychedelics
 

4887
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,110
so psychedelics
that increasingly have been getting a

4888
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:57,120
that increasingly have been getting a
 

4889
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,110
that increasingly have been getting a
lot of research done on them so in

lot of research done on them so in
 

4891
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,870
lot of research done on them so in
general psychedelics

4892
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:00,880
general psychedelics
 

4893
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,350
general psychedelics
psilocybin mdma but also really

01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:03,360
psilocybin mdma but also really
 

4895
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,550
psilocybin mdma but also really
interesting one

01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:04,560
interesting one
 

4897
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:07,590
interesting one
the big one which is dmt

the big one which is dmt
 

4899
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,070
the big one which is dmt
what and where are the places that these

01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:10,080
what and where are the places that these
 

4901
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,149
what and where are the places that these
substances take

4902
01:24:12,149 --> 01:24:12,159
substances take
 

4903
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:13,430
substances take
the mind

4904
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:13,440
the mind
 

4905
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,550
the mind
that is operating in the dream world

4906
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:16,560
that is operating in the dream world
 

4907
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,910
that is operating in the dream world
do you have an interesting sense how

4908
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
do you have an interesting sense how
 

4909
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:18,709
do you have an interesting sense how
this

4910
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:18,719
this
 

4911
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,229
this
throws a wrinkle

4912
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:20,239
throws a wrinkle
 

4913
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,149
throws a wrinkle
into the prediction model

4914
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:22,159
into the prediction model
 

4915
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,790
into the prediction model
is it just some weird little quirk or is

4916
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
is it just some weird little quirk or is
 

4917
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,830
is it just some weird little quirk or is
there

4918
01:24:25,830 --> 01:24:25,840
there
 

4919
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,830
there
is there some fundamental expansion of

4920
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:27,840
is there some fundamental expansion of
 

4921
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,510
is there some fundamental expansion of
the mind going on

4922
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:31,520

 

4923
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,350

i suspect that a way to look at

4924
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:33,360
i suspect that a way to look at
 

4925
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,350
i suspect that a way to look at
psychedelics is that they induce

4926
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:35,360
psychedelics is that they induce
 

4927
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,189
psychedelics is that they induce
particular types of lucid dreaming

4928
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:37,199
particular types of lucid dreaming
 

4929
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,470
particular types of lucid dreaming
states

4930
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,480
states
 

4931
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,310
states
so it's a state in which

4932
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:40,320
so it's a state in which
 

4933
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,709
so it's a state in which
certain connections are being

4934
01:24:42,709 --> 01:24:42,719
certain connections are being
 

4935
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:44,470
certain connections are being
severed in your mind when no longer

4936
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
severed in your mind when no longer
 

4937
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,590
severed in your mind when no longer
active your mind basically gets free to

4938
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:47,600
active your mind basically gets free to
 

4939
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,189
active your mind basically gets free to
move in a certain direction because some

4940
01:24:49,189 --> 01:24:49,199
move in a certain direction because some
 

4941
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:50,950
move in a certain direction because some
inhibition some particular inhibition

4942
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:50,960
inhibition some particular inhibition
 

4943
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,629
inhibition some particular inhibition
doesn't work anymore

4944
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:52,639
doesn't work anymore
 

4945
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:54,629
doesn't work anymore
and as a result you might stop having

4946
01:24:54,629 --> 01:24:54,639
and as a result you might stop having
 

4947
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:57,030
and as a result you might stop having
yourself or you might

4948
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:57,040
yourself or you might
 

4949
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,030
yourself or you might
stop perceiving the world as

4950
01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,040
stop perceiving the world as
 

4951
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,790
stop perceiving the world as
three-dimensional

4952
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:00,800
three-dimensional
 

4953
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,990
three-dimensional
and

4954
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:02,000
and
 

4955
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,390
and
you can explore that state

4956
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:04,400
you can explore that state
 

4957
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,790
you can explore that state
and i suppose that for every state that

4958
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
and i suppose that for every state that
 

4959
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,310
and i suppose that for every state that
can be induced with psychedelics there

4960
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:08,320
can be induced with psychedelics there
 

4961
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,669
can be induced with psychedelics there
are people that are naturally in that

4962
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:09,679
are people that are naturally in that
 

4963
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:10,950
are people that are naturally in that
state

4964
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
state
 

4965
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,669
state
so

4966
01:25:11,669 --> 01:25:11,679
so
 

4967
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:13,270
so
sometimes psychedelics that shift you

4968
01:25:13,270 --> 01:25:13,280
sometimes psychedelics that shift you
 

4969
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,950
sometimes psychedelics that shift you
through a range of possible mental

4970
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:14,960
through a range of possible mental
 

4971
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,110
through a range of possible mental
states and they can also shift you out

4972
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:17,120
states and they can also shift you out
 

4973
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,790
states and they can also shift you out
of the range of permissible mental

4974
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:18,800
of the range of permissible mental
 

4975
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,310
of the range of permissible mental
states that is where you can make

4976
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:20,320
states that is where you can make
 

4977
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,550
states that is where you can make
predictive models of reality

4978
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:22,560
predictive models of reality
 

4979
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,189
predictive models of reality
and what i observe in people that use

4980
01:25:25,189 --> 01:25:25,199
and what i observe in people that use
 

4981
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,470
and what i observe in people that use
psychedelics

4982
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:26,480
psychedelics
 

4983
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,070
psychedelics
a lot is that they tend to be over

4984
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,080
a lot is that they tend to be over
 

4985
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,510
a lot is that they tend to be over
fitting

4986
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:29,520
fitting
 

4987
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,350
fitting
overfitting means that you are

4988
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:33,360

 

4989
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,350

using more bits for modeling the

4990
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:35,360
using more bits for modeling the
 

4991
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,990
using more bits for modeling the
dynamics of a function than you should

4992
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:38,000
dynamics of a function than you should
 

4993
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,550
dynamics of a function than you should
and so you can fit your curve to

4994
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
and so you can fit your curve to
 

4995
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:42,709
and so you can fit your curve to
extremely detailed things in the past

4996
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
extremely detailed things in the past
 

4997
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,390
extremely detailed things in the past
but this model is no longer predictive

4998
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:44,400
but this model is no longer predictive
 

4999
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,070
but this model is no longer predictive
for the future

5000
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,080
for the future
 

5001
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,510
for the future
what is it about psychedelics that

5002
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:47,520
what is it about psychedelics that
 

5003
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,510
what is it about psychedelics that
forces that

5004
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,520
forces that
 

5005
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,110
forces that
i thought it would be the opposite i

5006
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,120
i thought it would be the opposite i
 

5007
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,229
i thought it would be the opposite i
thought i thought

5008
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:52,239
thought i thought
 

5009
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:55,270
thought i thought
uh that it's a it's a good mechanism for

5010
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:55,280
uh that it's a it's a good mechanism for
 

5011
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,950
uh that it's a it's a good mechanism for
uh

5012
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:56,960
uh
 

5013
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,270
uh
uh for generalization for regularization

5014
01:25:59,270 --> 01:25:59,280
uh for generalization for regularization
 

5015
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,430
uh for generalization for regularization
so it feels like

5016
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,440
so it feels like
 

5017
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,350
so it feels like
psychedelics expansion of the mind like

5018
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:03,360
psychedelics expansion of the mind like
 

5019
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,590
psychedelics expansion of the mind like
taking you outside of like forcing your

5020
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:05,600
taking you outside of like forcing your
 

5021
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,350
taking you outside of like forcing your
model to be

5022
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,360
model to be
 

5023
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,189
model to be
uh non-predictive is a good thing

5024
01:26:11,189 --> 01:26:11,199
uh non-predictive is a good thing
 

5025
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,310
uh non-predictive is a good thing
meaning like

5026
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:12,320
meaning like
 

5027
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,270
meaning like
uh it's almost like okay what i would uh

5028
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,280
uh it's almost like okay what i would uh
 

5029
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:16,870
uh it's almost like okay what i would uh
say psychedelics are akin to is

5030
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:16,880
say psychedelics are akin to is
 

5031
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,550
say psychedelics are akin to is
traveling to a totally different

5032
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560
traveling to a totally different
 

5033
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:19,750
traveling to a totally different
environment

5034
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:19,760
environment
 

5035
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,590
environment
like going if you've never been to like

5036
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:21,600
like going if you've never been to like
 

5037
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,030
like going if you've never been to like
india or something like that from the

5038
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,040
india or something like that from the
 

5039
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,229
india or something like that from the
united states

5040
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:24,239
united states
 

5041
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,750
united states
very different set of people different

5042
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,760
very different set of people different
 

5043
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,870
very different set of people different
culture different food different roads

5044
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:28,880
culture different food different roads
 

5045
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:29,669
culture different food different roads
and

5046
01:26:29,669 --> 01:26:29,679
and
 

5047
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,430
and
values and all those kinds of things

5048
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:31,440
values and all those kinds of things
 

5049
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,430
values and all those kinds of things
yeah so psychedelics can for instance

5050
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:33,440
yeah so psychedelics can for instance
 

5051
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:35,430
yeah so psychedelics can for instance
teleport people into

5052
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:35,440
teleport people into
 

5053
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,990
teleport people into
a universe that is uh hyperbolic which

5054
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:38,000
a universe that is uh hyperbolic which
 

5055
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,550
a universe that is uh hyperbolic which
means that if you imagine a room that

5056
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:40,560
means that if you imagine a room that
 

5057
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,189
means that if you imagine a room that
you are in you can turn around 360

5058
01:26:43,189 --> 01:26:43,199
you are in you can turn around 360
 

5059
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:44,629
you are in you can turn around 360
degrees and you didn't go full circle

5060
01:26:44,629 --> 01:26:44,639
degrees and you didn't go full circle
 

5061
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:46,790
degrees and you didn't go full circle
you need to go 720 degrees to go full

5062
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:46,800
you need to go 720 degrees to go full
 

5063
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,510
you need to go 720 degrees to go full
circle exactly so the things that people

5064
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:49,520
circle exactly so the things that people
 

5065
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,590
circle exactly so the things that people
learn in that state cannot be easily

5066
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:51,600
learn in that state cannot be easily
 

5067
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,350
learn in that state cannot be easily
transferred in this universe that we are

5068
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:53,360
transferred in this universe that we are
 

5069
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,149
transferred in this universe that we are
in

5070
01:26:54,149 --> 01:26:54,159
in
 

5071
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,830
in
it could be that if they're able to

5072
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:55,840
it could be that if they're able to
 

5073
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:57,669
it could be that if they're able to
abstract and understand what happened to

5074
01:26:57,669 --> 01:26:57,679
abstract and understand what happened to
 

5075
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,229
abstract and understand what happened to
them that they understand that some part

5076
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:00,239
them that they understand that some part
 

5077
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,149
them that they understand that some part
of their spatial cognition

5078
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:02,159
of their spatial cognition
 

5079
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:04,550
of their spatial cognition
has been desynchronized and has found a

5080
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:04,560
has been desynchronized and has found a
 

5081
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:05,910
has been desynchronized and has found a
different synchronization and this

5082
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
different synchronization and this
 

5083
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,430
different synchronization and this
different synchronization happens to be

5084
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:07,440
different synchronization happens to be
 

5085
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,270
different synchronization happens to be
a hyperbolic one right so you learn

5086
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,280
a hyperbolic one right so you learn
 

5087
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,870
a hyperbolic one right so you learn
something interesting about your brain

5088
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:10,880
something interesting about your brain
 

5089
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,149
something interesting about your brain
it's difficult to understand what

5090
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:12,159
it's difficult to understand what
 

5091
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:14,070
it's difficult to understand what
exactly happened but we get a pretty

5092
01:27:14,070 --> 01:27:14,080
exactly happened but we get a pretty
 

5093
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,990
exactly happened but we get a pretty
good idea once we understand how the

5094
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:16,000
good idea once we understand how the
 

5095
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,990
good idea once we understand how the
brain is representing geometry yeah but

5096
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,000
brain is representing geometry yeah but
 

5097
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,390
brain is representing geometry yeah but
doesn't give you a fresh perspective on

5098
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,400
doesn't give you a fresh perspective on
 

5099
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:25,990
doesn't give you a fresh perspective on
the physical reality

5100
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,000

 

5101
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,750

who's making that sound

5102
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:27,760
who's making that sound
 

5103
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,870
who's making that sound
is inside my head or is it external

5104
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:30,880
is inside my head or is it external
 

5105
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,790
is inside my head or is it external
well there is no sound outside of your

5106
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:32,800
well there is no sound outside of your
 

5107
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,229
well there is no sound outside of your
mind but uh it's making sense

5108
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:36,239
mind but uh it's making sense
 

5109
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:39,350
mind but uh it's making sense
often on my nine physics

5110
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:39,360
often on my nine physics
 

5111
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,350
often on my nine physics
uh yeah in the physical reality there's

5112
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:41,360
uh yeah in the physical reality there's
 

5113
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,790
uh yeah in the physical reality there's
uh there's sound waves

5114
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:44,800

 

5115
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,950

traveling through air okay

5116
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:46,960
traveling through air okay
 

5117
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,709
traveling through air okay
that's our model of what happened

5118
01:27:48,709 --> 01:27:48,719
that's our model of what happened
 

5119
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,110
that's our model of what happened
tomorrow what happened right

5120
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:51,120
tomorrow what happened right
 

5121
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,510
tomorrow what happened right
uh

5122
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:53,520
uh
 

5123
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:55,990
uh
that doesn't uh don't psychedelics give

5124
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:56,000
that doesn't uh don't psychedelics give
 

5125
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,990
that doesn't uh don't psychedelics give
you a fresh perspective on this physical

5126
01:27:57,990 --> 01:27:58,000
you a fresh perspective on this physical
 

5127
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,950
you a fresh perspective on this physical
reality like uh not this physical

5128
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:00,960
reality like uh not this physical
 

5129
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,800
reality like uh not this physical
reality but this this more um

5130
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:04,810
reality but this this more um
 

5131
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:06,149
reality but this this more um

01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,310
[Applause]
what do you call the dream world

5134
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:08,320
what do you call the dream world
 

5135
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,310
what do you call the dream world
that's mapped directly to purpose of

5136
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
that's mapped directly to purpose of
 

5137
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,229
that's mapped directly to purpose of
dreaming at night i think is yeah

5138
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:12,239
dreaming at night i think is yeah
 

5139
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:14,950
dreaming at night i think is yeah
theater augmentation well exactly so

5140
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:14,960
theater augmentation well exactly so
 

5141
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,790
theater augmentation well exactly so
that's very different that's a very

5142
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:16,800
that's very different that's a very
 

5143
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:19,430
that's very different that's a very
similar just change parameters uh about

5144
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:19,440
similar just change parameters uh about
 

5145
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:21,510
similar just change parameters uh about
the things that you have learned

5146
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:21,520
the things that you have learned
 

5147
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,990
the things that you have learned
and uh for instance when you are young

5148
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
and uh for instance when you are young
 

5149
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,430
and uh for instance when you are young
you have seen things from certain

5150
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:25,440
you have seen things from certain
 

5151
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,510
you have seen things from certain
perspectives but not from others so your

5152
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:27,520
perspectives but not from others so your
 

5153
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,669
perspectives but not from others so your
brain is generating new perspectives of

5154
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:29,679
brain is generating new perspectives of
 

5155
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,669
brain is generating new perspectives of
objects that you already know which

5156
01:28:31,669 --> 01:28:31,679
objects that you already know which
 

5157
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:33,750
objects that you already know which
means they can learn to recognize them

5158
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:33,760
means they can learn to recognize them
 

5159
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,350
means they can learn to recognize them
later from different perspectives and i

5160
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:35,360
later from different perspectives and i
 

5161
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,590
later from different perspectives and i
suspect that's the reason why many of us

5162
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:37,600
suspect that's the reason why many of us
 

5163
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,110
suspect that's the reason why many of us
remember to have flying dreams as

5164
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:39,120
remember to have flying dreams as
 

5165
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:40,629
remember to have flying dreams as
children because it's just different

5166
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:40,639
children because it's just different
 

5167
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:41,830
children because it's just different
perspectives of the world that we

5168
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:41,840
perspectives of the world that we
 

5169
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,550
perspectives of the world that we
already know and that it it starts to

5170
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:44,560
already know and that it it starts to
 

5171
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,070
already know and that it it starts to
generate these

5172
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,080
generate these
 

5173
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,229
generate these
different perspective changes and then

5174
01:28:48,229 --> 01:28:48,239
different perspective changes and then
 

5175
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,149
different perspective changes and then
it fluidly turns this into a flying

5176
01:28:50,149 --> 01:28:50,159
it fluidly turns this into a flying
 

5177
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,990
it fluidly turns this into a flying
dream to make sense of what's happening

5178
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:52,000
dream to make sense of what's happening
 

5179
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,590
dream to make sense of what's happening
right so you fill in the gaps and

5180
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:53,600
right so you fill in the gaps and
 

5181
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,750
right so you fill in the gaps and
suddenly you see yourself flying

5182
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:55,760
suddenly you see yourself flying
 

5183
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,550
suddenly you see yourself flying
and

5184
01:28:56,550 --> 01:28:56,560
and
 

5185
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,229
and
similar things can happen with semantic

5186
01:28:58,229 --> 01:28:58,239
similar things can happen with semantic
 

5187
01:28:58,239 --> 01:28:59,910
similar things can happen with semantic
relationships so it's not just spatial

5188
01:28:59,910 --> 01:28:59,920
relationships so it's not just spatial
 

5189
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:02,070
relationships so it's not just spatial
relationships but it can also be the

01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,080
relationships but it can also be the
 

5191
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,590
relationships but it can also be the
relationships between ideas that are

5192
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:03,600
relationships between ideas that are
 

5193
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,110
relationships between ideas that are
being changed

5194
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:05,120
being changed
 

5195
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,950
being changed
and it seems that the mechanisms that

5196
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:06,960
and it seems that the mechanisms that
 

5197
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,430
and it seems that the mechanisms that
make that happen during dreaming

5198
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:09,440
make that happen during dreaming
 

5199
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:12,870
make that happen during dreaming
um are interacting with these same

5200
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:12,880
um are interacting with these same
 

5201
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,149
um are interacting with these same
receptors

5202
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:14,159
receptors
 

5203
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:15,669
receptors
that are being stimulated by

5204
01:29:15,669 --> 01:29:15,679
that are being stimulated by
 

5205
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:17,189
that are being stimulated by
psychedelics

5206
01:29:17,189 --> 01:29:17,199
psychedelics
 

5207
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,669
psychedelics
so uh i suspect that there is a thing

5208
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:19,679
so uh i suspect that there is a thing
 

5209
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:21,910
so uh i suspect that there is a thing
that i haven't read really about

5210
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:21,920
that i haven't read really about
 

5211
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,750
that i haven't read really about
the way in which dreams are induced in

5212
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:23,760
the way in which dreams are induced in
 

5213
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,310
the way in which dreams are induced in
the brain it's not just that the

5214
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:26,320
the brain it's not just that the
 

5215
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,390
the brain it's not just that the
activity of the brain gets tuned down

5216
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:28,400
activity of the brain gets tuned down
 

5217
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,149
activity of the brain gets tuned down
because you are somehow your eyes are

5218
01:29:30,149 --> 01:29:30,159
because you are somehow your eyes are
 

5219
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:31,990
because you are somehow your eyes are
closed and you no longer get enough data

5220
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:32,000
closed and you no longer get enough data
 

5221
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,110
closed and you no longer get enough data
from your eyes but there is a particular

5222
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:35,120
from your eyes but there is a particular
 

5223
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,590
from your eyes but there is a particular
type of neurotransmitter that is

5224
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600
type of neurotransmitter that is
 

5225
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,590
type of neurotransmitter that is
saturating your brain during these

5226
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:39,600
saturating your brain during these
 

5227
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:41,430
saturating your brain during these
phases during the rm phases and you

5228
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:41,440
phases during the rm phases and you
 

5229
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,870
phases during the rm phases and you
produce

5230
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:42,880
produce
 

5231
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,629
produce
controlled hallucinations

5232
01:29:44,629 --> 01:29:44,639
controlled hallucinations
 

5233
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:47,110
controlled hallucinations
and psychedelics are linking into these

5234
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:47,120
and psychedelics are linking into these
 

5235
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,550
and psychedelics are linking into these
mechanisms

5236
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:48,560
mechanisms
 

5237
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,750
mechanisms
i suspect

5238
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:49,760
i suspect
 

5239
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,030
i suspect
so there's an

5240
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:51,040
so there's an
 

5241
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,790
so there's an
another trickier form of data

5242
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:52,800
another trickier form of data
 

5243
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,030
another trickier form of data
augmentation yes

5244
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:55,040
augmentation yes
 

5245
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,750
augmentation yes
but uh it's also data augmentation that

5246
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:57,760
but uh it's also data augmentation that
 

5247
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,669
but uh it's also data augmentation that
can happen outside of the specification

5248
01:29:59,669 --> 01:29:59,679
can happen outside of the specification
 

5249
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,430
can happen outside of the specification
that your brain is tuned to so basically

5250
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:01,440
that your brain is tuned to so basically
 

5251
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,510
that your brain is tuned to so basically
people are overclocking their brains and

5252
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
people are overclocking their brains and
 

5253
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:04,310
people are overclocking their brains and
that

5254
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:04,320
that
 

5255
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,629
that
that produces states that are

5256
01:30:06,629 --> 01:30:06,639
that produces states that are
 

5257
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,189
that produces states that are
subjectively extremely interesting

5258
01:30:09,189 --> 01:30:09,199
subjectively extremely interesting
 

5259
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,830
subjectively extremely interesting
yeah i just but from the outset very

5260
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:11,840
yeah i just but from the outset very
 

5261
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,590
yeah i just but from the outset very
suspicious so

5262
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:13,600
suspicious so
 

5263
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,510
suspicious so
i think i'm over applying the metaphor

5264
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:15,520
i think i'm over applying the metaphor
 

5265
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,910
i think i'm over applying the metaphor
of a neural network in my own mind

5266
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:17,920
of a neural network in my own mind
 

5267
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,510
of a neural network in my own mind
which

5268
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:19,520
which
 

5269
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,950
which
i just think that doesn't lead to

5270
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:20,960
i just think that doesn't lead to
 

5271
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,390
i just think that doesn't lead to
overfitting right but

5272
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:24,400
overfitting right but
 

5273
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,990
overfitting right but
but you were just sort of anecdotally

5274
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:26,000
but you were just sort of anecdotally
 

5275
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,669
but you were just sort of anecdotally
saying my experiences with people that

5276
01:30:27,669 --> 01:30:27,679
saying my experiences with people that
 

5277
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:29,669
saying my experiences with people that
have no psychedelics or that that kind

5278
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:29,679
have no psychedelics or that that kind
 

5279
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:31,430
have no psychedelics or that that kind
of quality i think it typically happens

5280
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:31,440
of quality i think it typically happens

so if you look at people like uh timothy

5282
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:33,520
so if you look at people like uh timothy

01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:44,950
believed he writes in these manifestos
that in the future science and art will

5294
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:44,960
that in the future science and art will
 

5295
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,470
that in the future science and art will
only be done on psychedelics because

5296
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:46,480
only be done on psychedelics because
 

5297
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:48,149
only be done on psychedelics because
it's so much more efficient and so much

5298
01:30:48,149 --> 01:30:48,159
it's so much more efficient and so much
 

5299
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:50,390
it's so much more efficient and so much
better and he gave

5300
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:50,400
better and he gave
 

5301
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,870
better and he gave
lsd to children in this community of a

5302
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:52,880
lsd to children in this community of a

few thousand people that he had near san

5304
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:55,040
few thousand people that he had near san
 

5305
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:57,350
few thousand people that he had near san
francisco and

francisco and
 

5307
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:59,510
francisco and
basically he was losing touch

5308
01:30:59,510 --> 01:30:59,520
basically he was losing touch
 

5309
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,590
basically he was losing touch
with reality he did not understand the

5310
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:01,600
with reality he did not understand the
 

5311
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,430
with reality he did not understand the
effects that the things that he was

5312
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:03,440
effects that the things that he was
 

5313
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,750
effects that the things that he was
doing would have on the reception of

5314
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:05,760
doing would have on the reception of
 

5315
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,470
doing would have on the reception of
psychedelics by society because he was

5316
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:08,480
psychedelics by society because he was
 

5317
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,229
psychedelics by society because he was
unable to think critically about what

5318
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:10,239
unable to think critically about what
 

5319
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:11,669
unable to think critically about what
happened what happened was that he got

5320
01:31:11,669 --> 01:31:11,679
happened what happened was that he got
 

5321
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:14,550
happened what happened was that he got
in an euphoric state that euphoric state

5322
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:14,560
in an euphoric state that euphoric state
 

5323
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,629
in an euphoric state that euphoric state
happened because he was overfitting he

5324
01:31:16,629 --> 01:31:16,639
happened because he was overfitting he
 

5325
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:19,590
happened because he was overfitting he
was taking this sense of euphoria and

5326
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600
was taking this sense of euphoria and
 

5327
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,990
was taking this sense of euphoria and
translating it into a model of actual

5328
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:22,000
translating it into a model of actual
 

5329
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,990
translating it into a model of actual
success in the world right he was

5330
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:24,000
success in the world right he was
 

5331
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,430
success in the world right he was
feeling better

5332
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:25,440
feeling better
 

5333
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,830
feeling better
limitations had disappeared that he exp

01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:27,840
limitations had disappeared that he exp
 

5335
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,990
limitations had disappeared that he exp

get superpowers i understand what you

5338
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:31,280
get superpowers i understand what you
 

5339
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,750
get superpowers i understand what you
mean by overfitting now

5340
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:33,760
mean by overfitting now
 

5341
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,669
mean by overfitting now
there's a lot of interpretation to the

5342
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:35,679
there's a lot of interpretation to the
 

5343
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:38,229
there's a lot of interpretation to the
term overfitting in this case but i i

5344
01:31:38,229 --> 01:31:38,239
term overfitting in this case but i i
 

5345
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:40,550
term overfitting in this case but i i
got you so he was getting

5346
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:40,560
got you so he was getting
 

5347
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,790
got you so he was getting
he was getting uh positive rewards from

5348
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:42,800
he was getting uh positive rewards from
 

5349
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,709
he was getting uh positive rewards from
a lot of actions this year but not just

5350
01:31:44,709 --> 01:31:44,719
a lot of actions this year but not just
 

5351
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,149
a lot of actions this year but not just
this so if you take for instance john

5352
01:31:46,149 --> 01:31:46,159
this so if you take for instance john
 

5353
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:48,790
this so if you take for instance john
lilly who um was studying dolphin

5354
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:48,800
lilly who um was studying dolphin
 

5355
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,070
lilly who um was studying dolphin
languages and aliens and so on yeah a

5356
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:52,080
languages and aliens and so on yeah a
 

5357
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,669
languages and aliens and so on yeah a
lot of people that use psychedelics

5358
01:31:53,669 --> 01:31:53,679
lot of people that use psychedelics
 

5359
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,830
lot of people that use psychedelics
became very loopy

5360
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:55,840
became very loopy
 

5361
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:58,550
became very loopy
and the typical thing that you notice

5362
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:58,560
and the typical thing that you notice
 

5363
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,070
and the typical thing that you notice
when people are in psychedelics is that

5364
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,080
when people are in psychedelics is that
 

5365
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,750
when people are in psychedelics is that
they are in a state where they feel that

5366
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
they are in a state where they feel that
 

5367
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,590
they are in a state where they feel that
everything can be explained now

5368
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:03,600
everything can be explained now
 

5369
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,350
everything can be explained now
everything is clear everything is

5370
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:05,360
everything is clear everything is
 

5371
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,550
everything is clear everything is
obvious yeah and uh sometimes they have

5372
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:08,560
obvious yeah and uh sometimes they have
 

5373
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,870
obvious yeah and uh sometimes they have
indeed discovered a useful connection

5374
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:10,880
indeed discovered a useful connection
 

5375
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,709
indeed discovered a useful connection
but not always very often these

5376
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:12,719
but not always very often these
 

5377
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:15,510
but not always very often these
connections are over interpretations i

5378
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:15,520
connections are over interpretations i
 

5379
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:16,790
connections are over interpretations i
wonder

5380
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:16,800
wonder
 

5381
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,870
wonder
you know there's a question of uh

5382
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:18,880
you know there's a question of uh
 

5383
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,030
you know there's a question of uh
correlation versus causation

5384
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,040
correlation versus causation
 

5385
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,390
correlation versus causation
and also i wonder if it's the

5386
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:22,400
and also i wonder if it's the
 

5387
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,430
and also i wonder if it's the
psychedelics or if it's more the social

5388
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:25,440
psychedelics or if it's more the social
 

5389
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,229
psychedelics or if it's more the social
like being the outsider

5390
01:32:28,229 --> 01:32:28,239
like being the outsider
 

5391
01:32:28,239 --> 01:32:30,470
like being the outsider
uh and having a strong community

5392
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,480
uh and having a strong community
 

5393
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,310
uh and having a strong community
of outside and being having a leadership

5394
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:32,320
of outside and being having a leadership
 

5395
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:34,470
of outside and being having a leadership
position in an outside occult-like

5396
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:34,480
position in an outside occult-like
 

5397
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,550
position in an outside occult-like
community that could have a much

5398
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:36,560
community that could have a much
 

5399
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,550
community that could have a much
stronger effect of overfitting than do

5400
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:38,560
stronger effect of overfitting than do
 

5401
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,310
stronger effect of overfitting than do
psychedelics themselves the actual

5402
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:40,320
psychedelics themselves the actual
 

5403
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,510
psychedelics themselves the actual
substances

5404
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:41,520
substances
 

5405
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:43,590
substances
because it's a counter culture thing so

5406
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:43,600
because it's a counter culture thing so
 

5407
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,270
because it's a counter culture thing so
it could be that as opposed to the

5408
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:45,280
it could be that as opposed to the
 

5409
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,430
it could be that as opposed to the
actual substance if you're a boring

5410
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:47,440
actual substance if you're a boring
 

5411
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,149
actual substance if you're a boring
person who wears a suit and tie and

01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:50,159
person who wears a suit and tie and

works at a bank
 

5415
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:53,590
works at a bank
and takes psychedelics that could be a

5416
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:53,600
and takes psychedelics that could be a
 

5417
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,550
and takes psychedelics that could be a
very different effect of psychedelics on

5418
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:56,560
very different effect of psychedelics on
 

5419
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:59,110
very different effect of psychedelics on
on your mind it i'm just sort of raising

5420
01:32:59,110 --> 01:32:59,120
on your mind it i'm just sort of raising
 

5421
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,430
on your mind it i'm just sort of raising
the point that the people you referenced

5422
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:01,440
the point that the people you referenced
 

5423
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,910
the point that the people you referenced
are already weirdos i'm not sure exactly

5424
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:03,920
are already weirdos i'm not sure exactly
 

5425
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,669
are already weirdos i'm not sure exactly
oh no not necessarily a lot of the

5426
01:33:05,669 --> 01:33:05,679
oh no not necessarily a lot of the
 

5427
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:07,990
oh no not necessarily a lot of the
people that uh tell me that they use

5428
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:08,000
people that uh tell me that they use
 

5429
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,870
people that uh tell me that they use
psychedelics in a useful way

5430
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:10,880
psychedelics in a useful way
 

5431
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:13,430
psychedelics in a useful way
started out as squares and were

5432
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:13,440
started out as squares and were
 

5433
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:14,950
started out as squares and were
liberating themselves because they were

5434
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:14,960
liberating themselves because they were
 

5435
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,910
liberating themselves because they were
stuck

5436
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:15,920
stuck
 

5437
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,430
stuck
they were basically stuck in local

5438
01:33:17,430 --> 01:33:17,440
they were basically stuck in local
 

5439
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,270
they were basically stuck in local
optimum of their own self model of their

5440
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:19,280
optimum of their own self model of their
 

5441
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,510
optimum of their own self model of their
relationship to the world and suddenly

5442
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:21,520
relationship to the world and suddenly
 

5443
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:23,270
relationship to the world and suddenly
they had data augmentation they

5444
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:23,280
they had data augmentation they
 

5445
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,750
they had data augmentation they
basically saw as an experience the space

5446
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:25,760
basically saw as an experience the space
 

5447
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,590
basically saw as an experience the space
of possibilities they experienced what

5448
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:27,600
of possibilities they experienced what
 

5449
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,430
of possibilities they experienced what
it would be like to be another person

5450
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:29,440
it would be like to be another person
 

5451
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,350
it would be like to be another person
yeah and they took uh

5452
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:31,360
yeah and they took uh
 

5453
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,110
yeah and they took uh
important lessons from that experience

5454
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:33,120
important lessons from that experience
 

5455
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:36,629
important lessons from that experience
back home

5456
01:33:36,629 --> 01:33:36,639

 

5457
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:39,030

yeah i mean uh i love the the the

5458
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,040
yeah i mean uh i love the the the
 

5459
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,870
yeah i mean uh i love the the the
metaphor of data augmentation because

5460
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:40,880
metaphor of data augmentation because
 

5461
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:42,550
metaphor of data augmentation because
that's uh

5462
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:42,560
that's uh
 

5463
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,110
that's uh
been the the primary driver of

5464
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:45,120
been the the primary driver of
 

5465
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,270
been the the primary driver of
self-supervised learning in the vision

5466
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:47,280
self-supervised learning in the vision
 

5467
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,270
self-supervised learning in the vision
computer vision domain is data

5468
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:49,280
computer vision domain is data
 

5469
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,310
computer vision domain is data
augmentation so it's funny to think of

5470
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,320
augmentation so it's funny to think of
 

5471
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,110
augmentation so it's funny to think of
data augment like like chemically

5472
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,120
data augment like like chemically
 

5473
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,390
data augment like like chemically
induced

5474
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:56,400
induced
 

5475
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,110
induced
data augmentation in the human mind

5476
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
data augmentation in the human mind
 

5477
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,870
data augmentation in the human mind
there's also a very interesting effect

5478
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:00,880
there's also a very interesting effect
 

5479
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:02,470
there's also a very interesting effect
that i uh

5480
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:02,480
that i uh
 

5481
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,590
that i uh
noticed i've i know uh several people

5482
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:05,600
noticed i've i know uh several people
 

5483
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,070
noticed i've i know uh several people
who are sphere to me that

5484
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:08,080
who are sphere to me that
 

5485
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:11,590
who are sphere to me that
lsd has cured their migraines so

5486
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:11,600
lsd has cured their migraines so
 

5487
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,030
lsd has cured their migraines so
severe cluster eight headaches or

5488
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,040
severe cluster eight headaches or
 

5489
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,430
severe cluster eight headaches or
migraines that didn't respond to

5490
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:15,440
migraines that didn't respond to
 

5491
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:18,070
migraines that didn't respond to
standard medication that disappeared

5492
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
standard medication that disappeared
 

5493
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,750
standard medication that disappeared
after a single dose and i don't

5494
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:19,760
after a single dose and i don't
 

5495
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,149
after a single dose and i don't
recommend anybody doing this especially

5496
01:34:22,149 --> 01:34:22,159
recommend anybody doing this especially
 

5497
01:34:22,159 --> 01:34:24,629
recommend anybody doing this especially
not in the us where it's illegal uh and

5498
01:34:24,629 --> 01:34:24,639
not in the us where it's illegal uh and
 

5499
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:26,550
not in the us where it's illegal uh and
there are no studies on this for that

5500
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:26,560
there are no studies on this for that
 

5501
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,030
there are no studies on this for that
reason but uh it seems that uh

5502
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:29,040
reason but uh it seems that uh
 

5503
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:32,950
reason but uh it seems that uh
anecdotally that it basically can reset

5504
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:32,960
anecdotally that it basically can reset
 

5505
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,709
anecdotally that it basically can reset
the serotonergic system so it's

5506
01:34:34,709 --> 01:34:34,719
the serotonergic system so it's
 

5507
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,390
the serotonergic system so it's
basically

5508
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:36,400
basically
 

5509
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:37,990
basically
pushing them outside of their normal

5510
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,000
pushing them outside of their normal
 

5511
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,310
pushing them outside of their normal
boundaries and as a result it needs to

5512
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:40,320
boundaries and as a result it needs to
 

5513
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,310
boundaries and as a result it needs to
find a new equilibrium and in some

5514
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:42,320
find a new equilibrium and in some
 

5515
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:44,550
find a new equilibrium and in some
people that equilibrium is better but it

5516
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:44,560
people that equilibrium is better but it
 

5517
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:46,149
people that equilibrium is better but it
also follows that in other people it

5518
01:34:46,149 --> 01:34:46,159
also follows that in other people it
 

5519
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:48,790
also follows that in other people it
might be worse so if you have a brain

5520
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:48,800
might be worse so if you have a brain
 

5521
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,950
might be worse so if you have a brain
that is already teetering on the

5522
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:50,960
that is already teetering on the
 

5523
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,790
that is already teetering on the
boundary to psychosis

5524
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:52,800
boundary to psychosis
 

5525
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,629
boundary to psychosis
it can be permanently pushed over that

5526
01:34:54,629 --> 01:34:54,639
it can be permanently pushed over that
 

5527
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,470
it can be permanently pushed over that
boundary well that's why you have to do

5528
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:56,480
boundary well that's why you have to do
 

5529
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,830
boundary well that's why you have to do
good science which they're starting to

5530
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:57,840
good science which they're starting to
 

5531
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,590
good science which they're starting to
do on all these different substances of

5532
01:34:59,590 --> 01:34:59,600
do on all these different substances of
 

5533
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,790
do on all these different substances of
how well it actually works for the

5534
01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:00,800
how well it actually works for the
 

5535
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,030
how well it actually works for the
different conditions like mdma seems to

5536
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,040
different conditions like mdma seems to
 

5537
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,550
different conditions like mdma seems to
help with ptsd

5538
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:04,560
help with ptsd
 

5539
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,870
help with ptsd
uh same with psilocybin

5540
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:06,880
uh same with psilocybin
 

5541
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:08,550
uh same with psilocybin
that you know you need to do good

5542
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:08,560
that you know you need to do good
 

5543
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,709
that you know you need to do good
science meaning large studies of large

5544
01:35:10,709 --> 01:35:10,719
science meaning large studies of large
 

5545
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:12,950
science meaning large studies of large
and yeah so based on the existing

5546
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:12,960
and yeah so based on the existing
 

5547
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,310
and yeah so based on the existing
studies with mdma it seems that

5548
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:16,320
studies with mdma it seems that
 

5549
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,149
studies with mdma it seems that
if you look at rick doblin's work and

5550
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:18,159
if you look at rick doblin's work and
 

5551
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:19,830
if you look at rick doblin's work and
what he has published about this and

5552
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:19,840
what he has published about this and
 

5553
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,270
what he has published about this and
talks about

5554
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:21,280
talks about
 

5555
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,109
talks about
mdma seems to be a psychologically

5556
01:35:23,109 --> 01:35:23,119
mdma seems to be a psychologically
 

5557
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:24,950
mdma seems to be a psychologically
relatively safe drug but it's

5558
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:24,960
relatively safe drug but it's
 

5559
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,990
relatively safe drug but it's
physiologically not very safe that is uh

5560
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,000
physiologically not very safe that is uh
 

5561
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,550
physiologically not very safe that is uh
there is a neurotoxicity if you would

5562
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:30,560
there is a neurotoxicity if you would
 

5563
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,430
there is a neurotoxicity if you would
use two large dose and if you uh combine

5564
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:33,440
use two large dose and if you uh combine
 

5565
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,510
use two large dose and if you uh combine
this with alcohol which a lot of kids do

5566
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:35,520
this with alcohol which a lot of kids do
 

5567
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,750
this with alcohol which a lot of kids do
in uh party settings during raves and so

5568
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
in uh party settings during raves and so
 

5569
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,709
in uh party settings during raves and so
on it's very hepatotoxic so basically

5570
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:40,719
on it's very hepatotoxic so basically
 

5571
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:43,350
on it's very hepatotoxic so basically
you can kill your liver and this means

5572
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:43,360
you can kill your liver and this means
 

5573
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,950
you can kill your liver and this means
that it's probably something that is

5574
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:44,960
that it's probably something that is
 

5575
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,950
that it's probably something that is
best and most productively used in

5576
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:46,960
best and most productively used in
 

5577
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,310
best and most productively used in
clinical setting

5578
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:48,320
clinical setting
 

5579
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,669
clinical setting
by people who really know what they're

5580
01:35:49,669 --> 01:35:49,679
by people who really know what they're
 

5581
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,470
by people who really know what they're
doing and i suspect that's also true for

5582
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:52,480
doing and i suspect that's also true for
 

5583
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,470
doing and i suspect that's also true for
the other psychedelics that is

5584
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:54,480
the other psychedelics that is
 

5585
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,149
the other psychedelics that is
uh while the other second eggs are

5586
01:35:56,149 --> 01:35:56,159
uh while the other second eggs are
 

5587
01:35:56,159 --> 01:35:59,430
uh while the other second eggs are
probably not as toxic as say alcohol

5588
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
probably not as toxic as say alcohol
 

5589
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,750
probably not as toxic as say alcohol
the effects on niseki can be much more

5590
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:01,760
the effects on niseki can be much more
 

5591
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,430
the effects on niseki can be much more
profound and lasting

5592
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:03,440
profound and lasting
 

5593
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,310
profound and lasting
yeah well as far as i know psilocybin so

5594
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:06,320
yeah well as far as i know psilocybin so
 

5595
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:09,030
yeah well as far as i know psilocybin so
mushrooms magic mushrooms

5596
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,040
mushrooms magic mushrooms
 

5597
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,950
mushrooms magic mushrooms
as far as i know in terms of the studies

5598
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:10,960
as far as i know in terms of the studies
 

5599
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,590
as far as i know in terms of the studies
they're running i think have no over

5600
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:13,600
they're running i think have no over
 

5601
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,270
they're running i think have no over
like they're allowed to do what they're

5602
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:15,280
like they're allowed to do what they're
 

5603
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,910
like they're allowed to do what they're
calling heroic doses so that one does

5604
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:17,920
calling heroic doses so that one does
 

5605
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,430
calling heroic doses so that one does
not have a toxicity so they could do

5606
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:19,440
not have a toxicity so they could do
 

5607
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,590
not have a toxicity so they could do
like huge doses in a clinical setting

5608
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:21,600
like huge doses in a clinical setting
 

5609
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,430
like huge doses in a clinical setting
when they're doing study on psilocybin

5610
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:23,440
when they're doing study on psilocybin
 

5611
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,109
when they're doing study on psilocybin
which is kind of fun

5612
01:36:25,109 --> 01:36:25,119
which is kind of fun
 

5613
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:26,390
which is kind of fun
yeah it seems that most of the

5614
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:26,400
yeah it seems that most of the
 

5615
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,149
yeah it seems that most of the
psychedelics work in extremely small

5616
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:28,159
psychedelics work in extremely small
 

5617
01:36:28,159 --> 01:36:29,189
psychedelics work in extremely small
doses

5618
01:36:29,189 --> 01:36:29,199
doses
 

5619
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:31,590
doses
which means that the effect on the rest

5620
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:31,600
which means that the effect on the rest
 

5621
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:34,709
which means that the effect on the rest
of the body is relatively low and mdma

5622
01:36:34,709 --> 01:36:34,719
of the body is relatively low and mdma
 

5623
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:36,870
of the body is relatively low and mdma
is probably the exception maybe ketamine

5624
01:36:36,870 --> 01:36:36,880
is probably the exception maybe ketamine
 

5625
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,310
is probably the exception maybe ketamine
can be dangerous and larger doses

5626
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:38,320
can be dangerous and larger doses
 

5627
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,510
can be dangerous and larger doses
because it can

5628
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:39,520
because it can
 

5629
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,149
because it can
depress breathing and so on but

5630
01:36:42,149 --> 01:36:42,159
depress breathing and so on but
 

5631
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:42,950
depress breathing and so on but
the

5632
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:42,960
the
 

5633
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,270
the
lsd and psilocybin work in very very

5634
01:36:45,270 --> 01:36:45,280
lsd and psilocybin work in very very
 

5635
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:46,950
lsd and psilocybin work in very very
small doses at least the active part of

5636
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:46,960
small doses at least the active part of
 

5637
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:47,750
small doses at least the active part of
them

5638
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:47,760
them
 

5639
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,550
them
of um lsd is only the active part

5640
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:50,560
of um lsd is only the active part
 

5641
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,750
of um lsd is only the active part
and the but the effect that you it can

5642
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:53,760
and the but the effect that you it can
 

5643
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,070
and the but the effect that you it can
have on your mental wiring can be very

5644
01:36:56,070 --> 01:36:56,080
have on your mental wiring can be very
 

5645
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:57,830
have on your mental wiring can be very
dangerous i think

5646
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:57,840
dangerous i think
 

5647
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:00,550
dangerous i think
let's talk about ai a little bit

5648
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:00,560
let's talk about ai a little bit
 

5649
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:02,070
let's talk about ai a little bit
what are your thoughts

5650
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:02,080
what are your thoughts
 

5651
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,390
what are your thoughts
about gpt3 and

5652
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:04,400
about gpt3 and

it came out quite a bit ago but i wanted

5658
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,000
it came out quite a bit ago but i wanted
 

5659
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,550
it came out quite a bit ago but i wanted
to get your thoughts on it yeah

5660
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:14,560
to get your thoughts on it yeah
 

5661
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,070
to get your thoughts on it yeah
in the 90s i was in new zealand and

5662
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:18,080
in the 90s i was in new zealand and
 

5663
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,030
in the 90s i was in new zealand and
i had an amazing professor ian witton

5664
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,040
i had an amazing professor ian witton
 

5665
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,070
i had an amazing professor ian witton
who realized there was ward in class and

5666
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:24,080
who realized there was ward in class and
 

5667
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,990
who realized there was ward in class and
put me in his lab and he gave me the

5668
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:26,000
put me in his lab and he gave me the
 

5669
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,709
put me in his lab and he gave me the
task to discover grammatical structure

5670
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:28,719
task to discover grammatical structure
 

5671
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,350
task to discover grammatical structure
in an unknown language

5672
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:31,360
in an unknown language
 

5673
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,030
in an unknown language
and the unknown language that i picked

5674
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:33,040
and the unknown language that i picked
 

5675
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,790
and the unknown language that i picked
was english because it was the easiest

5676
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,800
was english because it was the easiest
 

5677
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,910
was english because it was the easiest
one to find corpus four construct one

5678
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:37,920
one to find corpus four construct one
 

5679
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,709
one to find corpus four construct one
and he gave me the largest computer at

5680
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:40,719
and he gave me the largest computer at
 

5681
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,310
and he gave me the largest computer at
the whole university it had two

5682
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:42,320
the whole university it had two
 

5683
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,310
the whole university it had two
gigabytes of ram which was amazing and i

5684
01:37:44,310 --> 01:37:44,320
gigabytes of ram which was amazing and i
 

5685
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,750
gigabytes of ram which was amazing and i
wrote everything in c with some

5686
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:45,760
wrote everything in c with some
 

5687
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,669

in-memory compression to do statistics

5688
01:37:47,669 --> 01:37:47,679
in-memory compression to do statistics
 

5689
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:49,270
in-memory compression to do statistics
over the language

5690
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:49,280
over the language
 

5691
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,550
over the language
and

5692
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:50,560
and
 

5693
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,910
and
first would

5694
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:51,920
first would
 

5695
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,830
first would
create a dictionary of all the words

5696
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:53,840
create a dictionary of all the words
 

5697
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,149
create a dictionary of all the words
which basically tokenizes everything and

5698
01:37:56,149 --> 01:37:56,159
which basically tokenizes everything and
 

5699
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:57,910
which basically tokenizes everything and
compresses things so they don't need to

5700
01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:57,920
compresses things so they don't need to
 

5701
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,629
compresses things so they don't need to
store the whole world but just

5702
01:38:00,629 --> 01:38:00,639
store the whole world but just
 

5703
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,149
store the whole world but just
a code for every word and then i was um

5704
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:04,159
a code for every word and then i was um
 

5705
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:06,070
a code for every word and then i was um
taking this all apart in sentences and i

5706
01:38:06,070 --> 01:38:06,080
taking this all apart in sentences and i
 

5707
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:07,510
taking this all apart in sentences and i
was trying to

5708
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:07,520
was trying to
 

5709
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:09,669
was trying to
find all the relationships between all

5710
01:38:09,669 --> 01:38:09,679
find all the relationships between all
 

5711
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:11,030
find all the relationships between all
the words in the sentences and do

5712
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:11,040
the words in the sentences and do
 

5713
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,870
the words in the sentences and do
statistics over them

5714
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:12,880
statistics over them
 

5715
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:16,390
statistics over them
and that proved to be impossible because

5716
01:38:16,390 --> 01:38:16,400
and that proved to be impossible because
 

5717
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,229
and that proved to be impossible because
the complexity is just too large so if

5718
01:38:18,229 --> 01:38:18,239
the complexity is just too large so if
 

5719
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,310
the complexity is just too large so if
you want to discover the relationship

5720
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:20,320
you want to discover the relationship
 

5721
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,070
you want to discover the relationship
between an article and a noun and there

5722
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:22,080
between an article and a noun and there
 

5723
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,910
between an article and a noun and there
are three adjectives in between you

5724
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:23,920
are three adjectives in between you
 

5725
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,830
are three adjectives in between you
cannot do engram statistics and look at

5726
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:25,840
cannot do engram statistics and look at
 

5727
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,070
cannot do engram statistics and look at
all the possibilities that can exist at

5728
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:28,080
all the possibilities that can exist at
 

5729
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,669
all the possibilities that can exist at
least not with the resources that we had

5730
01:38:29,669 --> 01:38:29,679
least not with the resources that we had
 

5731
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:30,709
least not with the resources that we had
back then

5732
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
back then
 

5733
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,550
back then
so i realized i need to make some

5734
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:32,560
so i realized i need to make some
 

5735
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,149
so i realized i need to make some
statistics over what i need to make

5736
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:34,159
statistics over what i need to make
 

5737
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,629
statistics over what i need to make
statistics over so i wrote something

5738
01:38:36,629 --> 01:38:36,639
statistics over so i wrote something
 

5739
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:38,550
statistics over so i wrote something
that was pretty much a hack

5740
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:38,560
that was pretty much a hack
 

5741
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,350
that was pretty much a hack
that did this for um at least first

5742
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:41,360
that did this for um at least first
 

5743
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,950
that did this for um at least first
order relationships and i came up with

5744
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:42,960
order relationships and i came up with
 

5745
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,950
order relationships and i came up with
some kind of mutual information graph

5746
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:44,960
some kind of mutual information graph
 

5747
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,430
some kind of mutual information graph
that was indeed discovering uh something

5748
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,440
that was indeed discovering uh something
 

5749
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,030
that was indeed discovering uh something
that looks exactly like the grammatical

5750
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:49,040
that looks exactly like the grammatical
 

5751
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,030
that looks exactly like the grammatical
structure of the sentence just by trying

5752
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:51,040
structure of the sentence just by trying
 

5753
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,109
structure of the sentence just by trying
to encode the sentence in such a way

5754
01:38:53,109 --> 01:38:53,119
to encode the sentence in such a way
 

5755
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:54,870
to encode the sentence in such a way
that the words would be written in the

5756
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:54,880
that the words would be written in the
 

5757
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,470
that the words would be written in the
optimal order

5758
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:56,480
optimal order
 

5759
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,189
optimal order
inside of the model and

5760
01:38:59,189 --> 01:38:59,199
inside of the model and
 

5761
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,830
inside of the model and
what i also found is that if we would be

5762
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:01,840
what i also found is that if we would be
 

5763
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,750
what i also found is that if we would be
able to increase the resolution of that

5764
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:03,760
able to increase the resolution of that
 

5765
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:05,350
able to increase the resolution of that
and

5766
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:05,360
and
 

5767
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,189
and
not just use this model to reproduce

5768
01:39:07,189 --> 01:39:07,199
not just use this model to reproduce
 

5769
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,270
not just use this model to reproduce
grammatically correct sentences we would

5770
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:09,280
grammatically correct sentences we would
 

5771
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,030
grammatically correct sentences we would
also be able to correct stylistically

5772
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:11,040
also be able to correct stylistically
 

5773
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,030
also be able to correct stylistically
correct sentences by just having more

5774
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:13,040
correct sentences by just having more
 

5775
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,270
correct sentences by just having more
bits in these relationships and if we

5776
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,280
bits in these relationships and if we
 

5777
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,709
bits in these relationships and if we
wanted to have meaning we would have to

5778
01:39:16,709 --> 01:39:16,719
wanted to have meaning we would have to
 

5779
01:39:16,719 --> 01:39:18,629
wanted to have meaning we would have to
go much higher order

5780
01:39:18,629 --> 01:39:18,639
go much higher order
 

5781
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:20,229
go much higher order
and i didn't know how to make higher

5782
01:39:20,229 --> 01:39:20,239
and i didn't know how to make higher
 

5783
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,470
and i didn't know how to make higher
order models back then without spending

5784
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:22,480
order models back then without spending
 

5785
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:24,229
order models back then without spending
way more years in research on how to

5786
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
way more years in research on how to
 

5787
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,229
way more years in research on how to
make the statistics over what we need to

5788
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:26,239
make the statistics over what we need to
 

5789
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:28,550

make statistics over
and

5792
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:29,280
and
 

5793
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,870
and
this thing that we cannot look at the

5794
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:30,880
this thing that we cannot look at the
 

5795
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,550
this thing that we cannot look at the
relationships between all the bits in

are hierarchies of filters
 

5811
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,310
are hierarchies of filters
that exploit the fact that neighboring

01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:49,840
pixels in images are usually
 

5815
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,149
pixels in images are usually
semantically related and distance pixels

5821
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:57,590
related
so you can just by grouping the pixels

5822
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:57,600
so you can just by grouping the pixels
 

5823
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:58,950
so you can just by grouping the pixels
that are next to each other

5824
01:39:58,950 --> 01:39:58,960
that are next to each other
 

5825
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,030
that are next to each other
hierarchically together reconstruct the

01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:01,040
hierarchically together reconstruct the
 

5827
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,709
hierarchically together reconstruct the
shape of objects

5828
01:40:02,709 --> 01:40:02,719
shape of objects
 

5829
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,870
shape of objects
and this is an important prior that we

5830
01:40:04,870 --> 01:40:04,880
and this is an important prior that we
 

5831
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,790
and this is an important prior that we
built into these models so they can

5832
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:06,800
built into these models so they can
 

5833
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,109
built into these models so they can
converge quickly but this doesn't work

5834
01:40:09,109 --> 01:40:09,119
converge quickly but this doesn't work
 

5835
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:11,430
converge quickly but this doesn't work
in language for the reason that adjacent

5836
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:11,440
in language for the reason that adjacent
 

5837
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:14,070
in language for the reason that adjacent
words are often but not always related

5838
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:14,080
words are often but not always related
 

5839
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:16,310
words are often but not always related
and distant words are sometimes related

5840
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:16,320
and distant words are sometimes related
 

5841
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,030
and distant words are sometimes related
while the words in between are not

5842
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:19,040
while the words in between are not
 

5843
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:21,109
while the words in between are not
right so how can you learn the topology

5844
01:40:21,109 --> 01:40:21,119
right so how can you learn the topology
 

5845
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:22,550
right so how can you learn the topology
of language

5846
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:22,560
of language
 

5847
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,870
of language
and i think for for this reason that

5848
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:24,880
and i think for for this reason that
 

5849
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,669
and i think for for this reason that
this difficulty existed the transformer

5850
01:40:27,669 --> 01:40:27,679
this difficulty existed the transformer
 

5851
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:29,910
this difficulty existed the transformer
was invented in

5852
01:40:29,910 --> 01:40:29,920
was invented in
 

5853
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,510
was invented in
natural language processing not in

5854
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:31,520
natural language processing not in
 

5855
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,709
natural language processing not in
vision

5856
01:40:32,709 --> 01:40:32,719
vision
 

5857
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:35,270
vision
and what the transformer is doing it's a

5858
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:35,280
and what the transformer is doing it's a
 

5859
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,430
and what the transformer is doing it's a
hierarchy of layers where every layer

5860
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:37,440
hierarchy of layers where every layer
 

5861
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,910
hierarchy of layers where every layer
learns what to pay attention to in the

5862
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:39,920
learns what to pay attention to in the
 

5863
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,109
learns what to pay attention to in the
given context in the previous layer

5864
01:40:43,109 --> 01:40:43,119
given context in the previous layer
 

5865
01:40:43,119 --> 01:40:46,149
given context in the previous layer
so what to make the statistics over

5866
01:40:46,149 --> 01:40:46,159
so what to make the statistics over
 

5867
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:48,629
so what to make the statistics over
and the context is

5868
01:40:48,629 --> 01:40:48,639
and the context is
 

5869
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,790
and the context is
significantly larger than the adjacent

5870
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:50,800
significantly larger than the adjacent
 

5871
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,990
significantly larger than the adjacent
word yes so the context that this um

5872
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,000
word yes so the context that this um
 

5873
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,470
word yes so the context that this um
that gpt3 has been using the transformer

5874
01:40:56,470 --> 01:40:56,480
that gpt3 has been using the transformer
 

5875
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,830
that gpt3 has been using the transformer
itself is from 2017 and it's uh wasn't

5876
01:40:59,830 --> 01:40:59,840
itself is from 2017 and it's uh wasn't
 

5877
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:02,070
itself is from 2017 and it's uh wasn't
using that large of a context

5878
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:02,080
using that large of a context
 

5879
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,950
using that large of a context
openai has basically scaled up this idea

5880
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:04,960
openai has basically scaled up this idea
 

5881
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,109
openai has basically scaled up this idea
as far as they could at the time and the

5882
01:41:07,109 --> 01:41:07,119
as far as they could at the time and the
 

5883
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:08,470
as far as they could at the time and the
context is

5884
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:08,480
context is
 

5885
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,390
context is
about 2048

5886
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,400
about 2048
 

5887
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,270
about 2048
symbols tokens in the language these

5888
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:13,280
symbols tokens in the language these
 

5889
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,590
symbols tokens in the language these
symbols are not characters but they take

5890
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:15,600
symbols are not characters but they take
 

5891
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,669
symbols are not characters but they take
the words and project them into a vector

5892
01:41:17,669 --> 01:41:17,679
the words and project them into a vector
 

5893
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:18,629
the words and project them into a vector
space

5894
01:41:18,629 --> 01:41:18,639
space
 

5895
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:19,669
space
where

5896
01:41:19,669 --> 01:41:19,679
where
 

5897
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,030
where
words that are statistically

5898
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:21,040
words that are statistically
 

5899
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:23,109
words that are statistically
co-occurring a lot are neighbors already

5900
01:41:23,109 --> 01:41:23,119
co-occurring a lot are neighbors already
 

5901
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,950
co-occurring a lot are neighbors already
so it's already a simplification of the

5902
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:24,960
so it's already a simplification of the
 

5903
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,470
so it's already a simplification of the
problem a little bit

5904
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:26,480
problem a little bit
 

5905
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,550
problem a little bit
and so every word is basically a set of

5906
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:28,560
and so every word is basically a set of
 

5907
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,030
and so every word is basically a set of
coordinates in a high dimensional space

5908
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:31,040
coordinates in a high dimensional space
 

5909
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,270
coordinates in a high dimensional space
and then they use some kind of trick to

5910
01:41:33,270 --> 01:41:33,280
and then they use some kind of trick to
 

5911
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:35,510
and then they use some kind of trick to
also encode the order of the words in a

5912
01:41:35,510 --> 01:41:35,520
also encode the order of the words in a
 

5913
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,149
also encode the order of the words in a
sentence or in the not just sentence but

5914
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:38,159
sentence or in the not just sentence but
 

5915
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:41,430
sentence or in the not just sentence but
2048 tokens is about couple pages of

5916
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:41,440
2048 tokens is about couple pages of
 

5917
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,510
2048 tokens is about couple pages of
text or two and a half pages of text

5918
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:43,520
text or two and a half pages of text
 

5919
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,430
text or two and a half pages of text
and so they managed to do pretty

5920
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:45,440
and so they managed to do pretty
 

5921
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,669
and so they managed to do pretty
exhaustive statistics over the potential

5922
01:41:47,669 --> 01:41:47,679
exhaustive statistics over the potential
 

5923
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,030
exhaustive statistics over the potential
relationships

5924
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:49,040
relationships
 

5925
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:50,950
relationships
between two pages of text which is

5926
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:50,960
between two pages of text which is
 

5927
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,030
between two pages of text which is
tremendous right i was just using a

5928
01:41:53,030 --> 01:41:53,040
tremendous right i was just using a
 

5929
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,950
tremendous right i was just using a
single sentence back then

5930
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:54,960
single sentence back then
 

5931
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:55,830
single sentence back then
and

5932
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
and
 

5933
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,790
and
i was

5934
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:56,800
i was
 

5935
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:57,990
i was
only looking for first order

5936
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:58,000
only looking for first order
 

5937
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,990
only looking for first order
relationships and there were really

5938
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:00,000
relationships and there were really
 

5939
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,990
relationships and there were really
looking for much much higher level

5940
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:02,000
looking for much much higher level
 

5941
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,229
looking for much much higher level
relationships and what they discover

5942
01:42:04,229 --> 01:42:04,239
relationships and what they discover
 

5943
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:05,830
relationships and what they discover
after they fed this with an enormous

5944
01:42:05,830 --> 01:42:05,840
after they fed this with an enormous
 

5945
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:07,669
after they fed this with an enormous
amount of treatment in their pretty much

5946
01:42:07,669 --> 01:42:07,679
amount of treatment in their pretty much
 

5947
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,310
amount of treatment in their pretty much
the written internet or a subset of it

5948
01:42:10,310 --> 01:42:10,320
the written internet or a subset of it
 

5949
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,870
the written internet or a subset of it
that had some quality but

5950
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:12,880
that had some quality but
 

5951
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:15,109
that had some quality but
substantial portion of the common draw

5952
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:15,119
substantial portion of the common draw
 

5953
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,109
substantial portion of the common draw
that uh they're not only able to

5954
01:42:17,109 --> 01:42:17,119
that uh they're not only able to
 

5955
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:19,189
that uh they're not only able to
reproduce style but they're also able to

5956
01:42:19,189 --> 01:42:19,199
reproduce style but they're also able to
 

5957
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,669
reproduce style but they're also able to
reproduce some pretty detailed semantics

5958
01:42:21,669 --> 01:42:21,679
reproduce some pretty detailed semantics
 

5959
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:24,310
reproduce some pretty detailed semantics
like being able to um add three digit

5960
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:24,320
like being able to um add three digit
 

5961
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,229
like being able to um add three digit
numbers and multiply two digit numbers

5962
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:26,239
numbers and multiply two digit numbers
 

5963
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,229
numbers and multiply two digit numbers
or to translate between programming

5964
01:42:28,229 --> 01:42:28,239
or to translate between programming
 

5965
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:30,149
or to translate between programming
languages and things like that

5966
01:42:30,149 --> 01:42:30,159
languages and things like that
 

5967
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:32,950
languages and things like that
so the results that gbt3 got i think

5968
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:32,960
so the results that gbt3 got i think
 

5969
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,950
so the results that gbt3 got i think
were amazing by the way um

5970
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:36,960
were amazing by the way um
 

5971
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,790
were amazing by the way um
i actually didn't check carefully it's

5972
01:42:38,790 --> 01:42:38,800
i actually didn't check carefully it's
 

5973
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,470
i actually didn't check carefully it's
funny you just mentioned

5974
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:40,480
funny you just mentioned
 

5975
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,990
funny you just mentioned
how you coupled semantics to the

5976
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,000
how you coupled semantics to the
 

5977
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,830
how you coupled semantics to the
multiplication is it able to do some

5978
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:43,840
multiplication is it able to do some
 

5979
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:46,070
multiplication is it able to do some
basic math on two uh uh two digit

5980
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:46,080
basic math on two uh uh two digit
 

5981
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,830
basic math on two uh uh two digit
numbers yes

5982
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:47,840
numbers yes
 

5983
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,669
numbers yes
okay interesting i thought

5984
01:42:49,669 --> 01:42:49,679
okay interesting i thought
 

5985
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,590
okay interesting i thought
i thought there's a lot of

5986
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:51,600
i thought there's a lot of
 

5987
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,070
i thought there's a lot of
failure cases yeah but basically it

5988
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,080
failure cases yeah but basically it
 

5989
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,070
failure cases yeah but basically it
fails if you take larger digit numbers

5990
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:56,080
fails if you take larger digit numbers
 

5991
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,790
fails if you take larger digit numbers
so four digit numbers and so on uh makes

5992
01:42:58,790 --> 01:42:58,800
so four digit numbers and so on uh makes
 

5993
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,870
so four digit numbers and so on uh makes
carrying mistakes and so on and if you

5994
01:43:00,870 --> 01:43:00,880
carrying mistakes and so on and if you
 

5995
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,950
carrying mistakes and so on and if you
take large larger numbers you don't get

5996
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:02,960
take large larger numbers you don't get
 

5997
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:04,870
take large larger numbers you don't get
useful results at all

and
 

6001
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,270
and
this could be

6002
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:07,280
this could be
 

6003
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:09,350
this could be
an issue of the training set

6004
01:43:09,350 --> 01:43:09,360
an issue of the training set

at doing three-digit numbers either yeah

6012
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:19,760
at doing three-digit numbers either yeah
 

6013
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,350
at doing three-digit numbers either yeah
they're not you're not writing a lot

6014
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:21,360
they're not you're not writing a lot
 

6015
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,109
they're not you're not writing a lot
about it yeah and

6016
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:23,119
about it yeah and
 

6017
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:24,310
about it yeah and
the other thing is that the loss

6018
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,320
the other thing is that the loss
 

6019
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,830
the other thing is that the loss
function that is being used is only

6020
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:25,840
function that is being used is only
 

6021
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,750
function that is being used is only
minimizing surprises so it's predicting

6022
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:27,760
minimizing surprises so it's predicting
 

6023
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,750
minimizing surprises so it's predicting
what comes next in the typical text it's

6024
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:29,760
what comes next in the typical text it's
 

6025
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,910
what comes next in the typical text it's
not trying to go for causal closure

6026
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:31,920
not trying to go for causal closure
 

6027
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,629
not trying to go for causal closure
first as we do yeah

6028
01:43:34,629 --> 01:43:34,639
first as we do yeah
 

6029
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,430
first as we do yeah
and but the fact that that kind of

6030
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:37,440
and but the fact that that kind of
 

6031
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,510
and but the fact that that kind of
prediction works

6032
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:39,520
prediction works
 

6033
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,149
prediction works
to generate text that's semantically

6034
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:42,159
to generate text that's semantically
 

6035
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:44,070
to generate text that's semantically
rich and consistent

6036
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,080
rich and consistent
 

6037
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,149
rich and consistent
is interesting yeah so yeah so it's

6038
01:43:46,149 --> 01:43:46,159
is interesting yeah so yeah so it's
 

6039
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,629
is interesting yeah so yeah so it's
amazing that it's able to uh

6040
01:43:48,629 --> 01:43:48,639
amazing that it's able to uh
 

6041
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,870
amazing that it's able to uh
generate symmetrically consistent text

6042
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:50,880
generate symmetrically consistent text
 

6043
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,390
generate symmetrically consistent text
it's not consistent so the problem is

6044
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:52,400
it's not consistent so the problem is
 

6045
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,550
it's not consistent so the problem is
that it loses coherence at some point

6046
01:43:54,550 --> 01:43:54,560
that it loses coherence at some point
 

6047
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,030
that it loses coherence at some point
but it's also i think not correct to say

6048
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,040
but it's also i think not correct to say
 

6049
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:59,830
but it's also i think not correct to say
that gptc3 is unable to deal with

6050
01:43:59,830 --> 01:43:59,840
that gptc3 is unable to deal with
 

6051
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:02,229
that gptc3 is unable to deal with
semantics at all because you ask it to

6052
01:44:02,229 --> 01:44:02,239
semantics at all because you ask it to
 

6053
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:04,550
semantics at all because you ask it to
perform certain transformations in text

6054
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:04,560
perform certain transformations in text
 

6055
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:06,310
perform certain transformations in text
and it performs this transformation and

6056
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:06,320
and it performs this transformation and
 

6057
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,950
and it performs this transformation and
text and the kind of additions that it's

6058
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:08,960
text and the kind of additions that it's
 

6059
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,629
text and the kind of additions that it's
able to perform are

6060
01:44:10,629 --> 01:44:10,639
able to perform are
 

6061
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:13,189
able to perform are
transformations and text right and

6062
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:13,199
transformations and text right and
 

6063
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:15,350
transformations and text right and
there are proper semantics involved you

6064
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:15,360
there are proper semantics involved you
 

6065
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,510
there are proper semantics involved you
can also do more there was a paper that

6066
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:17,520
can also do more there was a paper that
 

6067
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:19,510
can also do more there was a paper that
was generating

6068
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:19,520
was generating
 

6069
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,870
was generating
lots and lots of mathematically correct

6070
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:22,880
lots and lots of mathematically correct
 

6071
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,070
lots and lots of mathematically correct
text

6072
01:44:24,070 --> 01:44:24,080
text
 

6073
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,310
text
and was feeding this into a transformer

6074
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:26,320
and was feeding this into a transformer
 

6075
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:29,430
and was feeding this into a transformer
and as a result it was able to learn how

6076
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:29,440
and as a result it was able to learn how
 

6077
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,070
and as a result it was able to learn how
to do differentiation integration in

6078
01:44:32,070 --> 01:44:32,080
to do differentiation integration in
 

6079
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,750
to do differentiation integration in
race that according to the authors

6080
01:44:33,750 --> 01:44:33,760
race that according to the authors
 

6081
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,270
race that according to the authors
mathematica could not

6082
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:37,280

 

6083
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:38,470

to which some of the people in

6084
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:38,480
to which some of the people in
 

6085
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,629
to which some of the people in
mathematica responded that uh they were

6086
01:44:40,629 --> 01:44:40,639
mathematica responded that uh they were
 

6087
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,470
mathematica responded that uh they were
not using the mathematica in the right

6088
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:42,480
not using the mathematica in the right
 

6089
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,149
not using the mathematica in the right
way and so on i have not really followed

6090
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
way and so on i have not really followed
 

6091
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,390
way and so on i have not really followed
the this resolution of this conflict

6092
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:46,400
the this resolution of this conflict
 

6093
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,790
the this resolution of this conflict
this this part as a small tangent i

6094
01:44:48,790 --> 01:44:48,800
this this part as a small tangent i
 

6095
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:50,950
this this part as a small tangent i
really don't like in machine learning

6096
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:50,960
really don't like in machine learning
 

6097
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:52,310
really don't like in machine learning
papers which

6098
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:52,320
papers which
 

6099
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,070
papers which
they often

6100
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,080
they often
 

6101
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,430
they often
do um

6102
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:55,440
do um
 

6103
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,510
do um
anecdotal evidence they'll find like one

6104
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:57,520
anecdotal evidence they'll find like one
 

6105
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,669
anecdotal evidence they'll find like one
example in some kind of specific use of

6106
01:44:59,669 --> 01:44:59,679
example in some kind of specific use of
 

6107
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:01,830
example in some kind of specific use of
mathematica and demonstrate look here's

6108
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:01,840
mathematica and demonstrate look here's
 

6109
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:04,149
mathematica and demonstrate look here's
they'll show successes and failures but

6110
01:45:04,149 --> 01:45:04,159
they'll show successes and failures but
 

6111
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:06,310
they'll show successes and failures but
they won't have a very clear

6112
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:06,320
they won't have a very clear
 

6113
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,709
they won't have a very clear
representation of how many cases this

6114
01:45:08,709 --> 01:45:08,719
representation of how many cases this
 

6115
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:10,390
representation of how many cases this
actually represents yes but i think as a

6116
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:10,400
actually represents yes but i think as a
 

6117
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,550
actually represents yes but i think as a
first paper this is a pretty good start

6118
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:12,560
first paper this is a pretty good start
 

6119
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:17,270
first paper this is a pretty good start
and yeah so uh the whole message is that

6120
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:17,280
and yeah so uh the whole message is that
 

6121
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,350
and yeah so uh the whole message is that
the authors could get better results

6122
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:19,360
the authors could get better results
 

6123
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,790
the authors could get better results
from this in their

6124
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:20,800
from this in their
 

6125
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,030
from this in their
experiments than they could get from the

6126
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:23,040
experiments than they could get from the
 

6127
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:24,470
experiments than they could get from the
vein which they were using computer

6128
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
vein which they were using computer
 

6129
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,590
vein which they were using computer
ultra systems which means uh that was

6130
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:27,600
ultra systems which means uh that was
 

6131
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:30,470
ultra systems which means uh that was
not nothing yeah and uh it's able to

6132
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:30,480
not nothing yeah and uh it's able to
 

6133
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,390
not nothing yeah and uh it's able to
perform substantially better uh than

6134
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:32,400
perform substantially better uh than
 

6135
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,590
perform substantially better uh than
gptsv can based on a much larger amount

6136
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:35,600
gptsv can based on a much larger amount
 

6137
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,830
gptsv can based on a much larger amount
of training data using the same

6138
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:37,840
of training data using the same
 

6139
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,830
of training data using the same
underlying algorithm well let me let me

6140
01:45:39,830 --> 01:45:39,840
underlying algorithm well let me let me
 

6141
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,790
underlying algorithm well let me let me
ask

6142
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:40,800
ask
 

6143
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,870
ask
again so i'm using your tweets as if

6144
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:42,880
again so i'm using your tweets as if
 

6145
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:46,950
again so i'm using your tweets as if
this is like plato right

6146
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:46,960

 

6147
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,310

as if this is

6148
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:48,320
as if this is
 

6149
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,629
as if this is
well thought out novels that you've

6150
01:45:50,629 --> 01:45:50,639
well thought out novels that you've
 

6151
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:51,430
well thought out novels that you've
written

6152
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:51,440
written
 

6153
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:55,189
written
uh you tweeted gpt4 is listening to us

6154
01:45:55,189 --> 01:45:55,199
uh you tweeted gpt4 is listening to us
 

6155
01:45:55,199 --> 01:45:56,950
uh you tweeted gpt4 is listening to us
now

6156
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:56,960
now
 

6157
01:45:56,960 --> 01:45:58,629
now
um

6158
01:45:58,629 --> 01:45:58,639
um
 

6159
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:00,790
um
this is one way of asking what are the

6160
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:00,800
this is one way of asking what are the
 

6161
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:03,030
this is one way of asking what are the
limitations of gpt-3

6162
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:03,040
limitations of gpt-3
 

6163
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,510
limitations of gpt-3
when it scales so what do you think will

6164
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:05,520
when it scales so what do you think will
 

6165
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:09,430
when it scales so what do you think will
be the capabilities of gpt-4 gpt-5 and

6166
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:09,440
be the capabilities of gpt-4 gpt-5 and
 

6167
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:11,189
be the capabilities of gpt-4 gpt-5 and
so on what are the limits of this

6168
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:11,199
so on what are the limits of this
 

6169
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:13,590
so on what are the limits of this
approach so uh obviously when we are

6170
01:46:13,590 --> 01:46:13,600
approach so uh obviously when we are
 

6171
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,350
approach so uh obviously when we are
writing things right now uh everything

6172
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:15,360
writing things right now uh everything
 

6173
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,950
writing things right now uh everything
that we are writing now is going to be

6174
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:16,960
that we are writing now is going to be
 

6175
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,030
that we are writing now is going to be
training data for the next generation of

6176
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:19,040
training data for the next generation of
 

6177
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,030
training data for the next generation of
machine learning models so yes of course

6178
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:21,040
machine learning models so yes of course
 

6179
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:24,149
machine learning models so yes of course
tbt4 is listening to us and i think the

6180
01:46:24,149 --> 01:46:24,159
tbt4 is listening to us and i think the
 

6181
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:25,669
tbt4 is listening to us and i think the
tweet is already a little bit older and

6182
01:46:25,669 --> 01:46:25,679
tweet is already a little bit older and
 

6183
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:28,790
tweet is already a little bit older and
the we now have wu dao and we have a

6184
01:46:28,790 --> 01:46:28,800
the we now have wu dao and we have a
 

6185
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,950
the we now have wu dao and we have a
number of other systems that basically

6186
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:30,960
number of other systems that basically
 

6187
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,669
number of other systems that basically
are placeholders for gpt4 don't know

6188
01:46:33,669 --> 01:46:33,679
are placeholders for gpt4 don't know
 

6189
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:35,990
are placeholders for gpt4 don't know
what open ais plans are in the card i

6190
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,000
what open ais plans are in the card i
 

6191
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,590
what open ais plans are in the card i
read that tweet

6192
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:37,600
read that tweet
 

6193
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:41,109
read that tweet
in several ways so one is obviously

6194
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:41,119
in several ways so one is obviously
 

6195
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,709
in several ways so one is obviously
everything you put on the internet is

6196
01:46:42,709 --> 01:46:42,719
everything you put on the internet is
 

6197
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,629
everything you put on the internet is
used as training data

6198
01:46:44,629 --> 01:46:44,639
used as training data
 

6199
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:45,510
used as training data
but

6200
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:45,520
but
 

6201
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,070
but
in the second way i read it is

6202
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:48,080
in the second way i read it is
 

6203
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,590
in the second way i read it is
in a uh

6204
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:49,600
in a uh
 

6205
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,510
in a uh
we talked about agency

6206
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:51,520
we talked about agency
 

6207
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,830
we talked about agency
i read it as almost like gpt4 is

6208
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:53,840
i read it as almost like gpt4 is
 

6209
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,350
i read it as almost like gpt4 is
intelligent enough

6210
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:55,360
intelligent enough
 

6211
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,149
intelligent enough
to be choosing to listen

6212
01:46:58,149 --> 01:46:58,159
to be choosing to listen
 

6213
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:00,310
to be choosing to listen
so not only like did a programmer tell

6214
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:00,320
so not only like did a programmer tell
 

6215
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,709
so not only like did a programmer tell
it to collect this data and use it for

6216
01:47:02,709 --> 01:47:02,719
it to collect this data and use it for
 

6217
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:04,790
it to collect this data and use it for
training i almost

6218
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:04,800
training i almost
 

6219
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,950
training i almost
saw the humorous angle which is like it

6220
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:06,960
saw the humorous angle which is like it
 

6221
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:08,390
saw the humorous angle which is like it
has achieved agi

6222
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:08,400
has achieved agi
 

6223
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,870
has achieved agi
kind of thing well the thing is um could

6224
01:47:10,870 --> 01:47:10,880
kind of thing well the thing is um could
 

6225
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:13,140
kind of thing well the thing is um could
we be already be living in gpt5

6226
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:13,150
we be already be living in gpt5
 

6227
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:15,030
we be already be living in gpt5
[Laughter]

6228
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:15,040
[Laughter]
 

6229
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:18,390
[Laughter]
so gpt4 is listening and dpt5 actually

6230
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:18,400
so gpt4 is listening and dpt5 actually
 

6231
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,229
so gpt4 is listening and dpt5 actually
constructed the entirety of the

ai is to extend the transformer to be

6238
01:47:26,629 --> 01:47:26,639
ai is to extend the transformer to be
 

6239
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,430
ai is to extend the transformer to be
able to deal with video

6240
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:29,440
able to deal with video
 

6241
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,510
able to deal with video
and uh there are very promising

6242
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:31,520
and uh there are very promising
 

6243
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,669
and uh there are very promising
extensions where there is a work by

6244
01:47:33,669 --> 01:47:33,679
extensions where there is a work by

google that is called perceiver

6246
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:36,480
google that is called perceiver
 

6247
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,070
google that is called perceiver
and that is

6248
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,080
and that is
 

6249
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,750
and that is
overcoming some of the limitations of

6250
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:39,760
overcoming some of the limitations of
 

6251
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,750
overcoming some of the limitations of
the transformer by letting it learn the

01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:41,760
the transformer by letting it learn the
 

6253
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,750
the transformer by letting it learn the

video input
and there is more to be done so i one of

6272
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:03,119
and there is more to be done so i one of
 

6273
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:06,149
and there is more to be done so i one of
the limitations of gpt three is that

6274
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:06,159
the limitations of gpt three is that
 

6275
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:08,550
the limitations of gpt three is that
it's uh amnesiac so it forgets

not just during learning
 

6283
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,470
not just during learning
do you think that's fixable

6284
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:16,480
do you think that's fixable
 

6285
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,550
do you think that's fixable
within the space of deep learning

6286
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:18,560
within the space of deep learning
 

6287
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,390
within the space of deep learning
can you just make a bigger bigger bigger

6288
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:20,400
can you just make a bigger bigger bigger
 

6289
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,430
can you just make a bigger bigger bigger
input no uh i don't think that our own

6290
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:23,440
input no uh i don't think that our own
 

6291
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,510

uh working memory is infinitely large

6292
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:25,520
uh working memory is infinitely large
 

6293
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,030
uh working memory is infinitely large
it's probably also just a few thousand

6294
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:27,040
it's probably also just a few thousand
 

6295
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:27,910
it's probably also just a few thousand
bits

6296
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:27,920
bits
 

6297
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,550
bits
but uh what you can do is you can

6298
01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:30,560
but uh what you can do is you can
 

6299
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:32,470
but uh what you can do is you can
structure this working memory so instead

6300
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:32,480
structure this working memory so instead
 

6301
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,510
structure this working memory so instead
of just

6302
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:33,520
of just
 

6303
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:35,510
of just
force feeding this thing a certain thing

6304
01:48:35,510 --> 01:48:35,520
force feeding this thing a certain thing
 

6305
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,430
force feeding this thing a certain thing
that it has to focus on and it's not

6306
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:37,440
that it has to focus on and it's not
 

6307
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,510
that it has to focus on and it's not
allowed to focus on anything else with

allowed to focus on anything else with
its network

6310
01:48:41,030 --> 01:48:41,040
its network
 

6311
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:42,950
its network
you allow it to construct its own

6312
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:42,960
you allow it to construct its own
 

6313
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,189
you allow it to construct its own
working memory as we do right when we

01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:48,149
are reading a book
it's not that we are focusing our

6318
01:48:48,149 --> 01:48:48,159
it's not that we are focusing our
 

6319
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:49,990
it's not that we are focusing our
attention in such a way that we can only

6320
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:50,000
attention in such a way that we can only
 

6321
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,229
attention in such a way that we can only
remember the current page

6322
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:52,239
remember the current page
 

6323
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,550
remember the current page
we will also try to remember other pages

6324
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:54,560
we will also try to remember other pages
 

6325
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,550
we will also try to remember other pages
and try to undo what we learned from

6326
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,560
and try to undo what we learned from
 

6327
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,470
and try to undo what we learned from
them or modify what we learned from them

6328
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:58,480
them or modify what we learned from them
 

6329
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,229
them or modify what we learned from them
we might get up and take another book

6330
01:49:00,229 --> 01:49:00,239
we might get up and take another book
 

6331
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:01,910
we might get up and take another book
from the shelf we might go out and ask

6332
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:01,920
from the shelf we might go out and ask
 

6333
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,149
from the shelf we might go out and ask
somebody and we can

6334
01:49:04,149 --> 01:49:04,159
somebody and we can
 

6335
01:49:04,159 --> 01:49:06,149
somebody and we can
edit our working memory in any way that

6336
01:49:06,149 --> 01:49:06,159
edit our working memory in any way that
 

6337
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,629
edit our working memory in any way that
is useful to put a context together

6338
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:08,639
is useful to put a context together
 

6339
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:10,950
is useful to put a context together
allows us to draw the right inferences

01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:10,960
allows us to draw the right inferences
 

6341
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,950
allows us to draw the right inferences
and to learn the right things

6342
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:12,960
and to learn the right things

this in some sense by building systems

6358
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:32,159
this in some sense by building systems
 

6359
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,750
this in some sense by building systems
that are larger and faster so they can

01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:33,760
that are larger and faster so they can
 

6361
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,229
that are larger and faster so they can
use dramatically larger resources and

6362
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:36,239
use dramatically larger resources and
 

6363
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:37,589
use dramatically larger resources and
human beings can do and much more

6364
01:49:37,589 --> 01:49:37,599
human beings can do and much more
 

6365
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:39,830

01:49:42,229 --> 01:49:42,239
some sense are already very superhuman
 

6369
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:43,990
some sense are already very superhuman
and in other ways are laughingly

and in other ways are laughingly
 

6371
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,430

so do you think uh sort of

6374
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:47,440
so do you think uh sort of
 

6375
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:50,229
so do you think uh sort of
making um the systems like what would

01:49:50,229 --> 01:49:50,239
making um the systems like what would
 

6377
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:53,189
making um the systems like what would
you say multi-resolutional so like

6378
01:49:53,189 --> 01:49:53,199
you say multi-resolutional so like
 

6379
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:55,030
you say multi-resolutional so like
some

6380

01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:57,030
some
uh some of the language models are

6382
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:57,040
uh some of the language models are
 

6383
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,790
uh some of the language models are
focused on

focused on
 

6385
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:02,070
focused on
two pages some are focused on

01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:02,080
two pages some are focused on
 

6387
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:05,270
two pages some are focused on
uh two books some are focused on

6388
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:05,280
uh two books some are focused on
 

6389
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,430
uh two books some are focused on
two years of reading some are focused on

6390
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:07,440
two years of reading some are focused on
 

6391
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,830
two years of reading some are focused on
a lifetime like so it's like stacks of

6392
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:09,840
a lifetime like so it's like stacks of
 

6393
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,149
a lifetime like so it's like stacks of
it's the gpt3s all the way down you want

6394
01:50:12,149 --> 01:50:12,159
it's the gpt3s all the way down you want
 

6395
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:14,550
it's the gpt3s all the way down you want
to have gaps in between them so it's not

6396
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:14,560
to have gaps in between them so it's not
 

6397
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,350
to have gaps in between them so it's not
necessarily two years there's no gaps it

6398
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:17,360
necessarily two years there's no gaps it
 

6399
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,589
necessarily two years there's no gaps it
stinks out of two years or out of twenty

stinks out of two years or out of twenty
 

6401

billion years yeah where you are just

01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:22,800
billion years yeah where you are just
 

6405
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,470
billion years yeah where you are just
selecting those bits

selecting those bits

01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:26,629
selecting those bits
that are predicted to be the most useful

that are predicted to be the most useful
 

6409
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:28,950
that are predicted to be the most useful
ones to understand what you're currently

01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:28,960
ones to understand what you're currently
 

6411
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,030
ones to understand what you're currently
doing and this prediction itself

doing and this prediction itself
 

6413
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,950
doing and this prediction itself
requires a very complicated model that's

requires a very complicated model that's

01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,310
requires a very complicated model that's

making it's not just that you are trying
 

6419
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:37,910
making it's not just that you are trying
to understand the relationships between

to understand the relationships between
 

6421
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,830
to understand the relationships between

over

6426
01:50:42,390 --> 01:50:42,400
over
 

6427
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,310
over
i wonder what that

6428
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:44,320
i wonder what that
 

6429
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,470
i wonder what that
thing looks like with the architecture

6430
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:46,480
thing looks like with the architecture
 

6431
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,229
thing looks like with the architecture
for that for the thing that's able to

6432
01:50:48,229 --> 01:50:48,239
for that for the thing that's able to
 

6433
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,550
for that for the thing that's able to
have that kind of model that i think it

6434
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:50,560
have that kind of model that i think it
 

6435
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,790
have that kind of model that i think it
needs more degrees of freedom than the

6436
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:52,800
needs more degrees of freedom than the
 

6437
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,350
needs more degrees of freedom than the
current models have so it starts out

6438
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:55,360
current models have so it starts out
 

6439
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:56,870
current models have so it starts out
with the fact that you

6440
01:50:56,870 --> 01:50:56,880
with the fact that you
 

6441
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,470
with the fact that you
possibly don't just want to have a feed

6442
01:50:58,470 --> 01:50:58,480
possibly don't just want to have a feed
 

6443
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:01,030
possibly don't just want to have a feed
forward model but you want it to be

6444
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:01,040
forward model but you want it to be
 

6445
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,629
forward model but you want it to be
fully recurrent

6446
01:51:02,629 --> 01:51:02,639
fully recurrent
 

6447
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:04,629
fully recurrent
and to make it fully recurrent you

6448
01:51:04,629 --> 01:51:04,639
and to make it fully recurrent you
 

6449
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:06,070
and to make it fully recurrent you
probably need to loop it back into

6450
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:06,080
probably need to loop it back into
 

6451
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,149
probably need to loop it back into
itself and allow it to skip connections

6452
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:08,159
itself and allow it to skip connections
 

6453
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:09,669
itself and allow it to skip connections
once you do this

6454
01:51:09,669 --> 01:51:09,679
once you do this
 

6455
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:11,589
once you do this
right when you are predicting the next

6456
01:51:11,589 --> 01:51:11,599
right when you are predicting the next
 

6457
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:13,830
right when you are predicting the next
frame and your internal next frame

6458

and you
 

6463
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,830
and you
are able to skip connection it means

6464
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:17,840
are able to skip connection it means
 

6465
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:21,270
are able to skip connection it means
that signals can travel from the output

6477
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:35,109
network sometimes it can and sometimes
it cannot so it it can still be a neural

6478
01:51:35,109 --> 01:51:35,119
it cannot so it it can still be a neural
 

6479
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:36,790
it cannot so it it can still be a neural
network but not a fully differentiable

6480
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:36,800
network but not a fully differentiable
 

6481
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,109
network but not a fully differentiable
one and when you want to deal with

6482
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:39,119
one and when you want to deal with
 

6483
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:41,510
one and when you want to deal with
non-differentiable ones you need to have

6484
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:41,520
non-differentiable ones you need to have
 

6485
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,990
non-differentiable ones you need to have
an attention system that is discrete and

6486
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:44,000
an attention system that is discrete and
 

6487
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,510
an attention system that is discrete and
dual dimensional and can perform

6488
01:51:45,510 --> 01:51:45,520
dual dimensional and can perform
 

6489
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,030
dual dimensional and can perform
grammatical operations you need to be

6490
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:47,040
grammatical operations you need to be
 

6491
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:49,350
grammatical operations you need to be
able to perform program synthesis you

6492
01:51:49,350 --> 01:51:49,360
able to perform program synthesis you
 

6493
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,589
able to perform program synthesis you
need to be able to backtrack in this

6494
01:51:51,589 --> 01:51:51,599
need to be able to backtrack in this
 

6495
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:53,430
need to be able to backtrack in this
operations that you perform on this

6496
01:51:53,430 --> 01:51:53,440
operations that you perform on this
 

6497
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,270
operations that you perform on this
thing this thing needs a model of what

6498
01:51:55,270 --> 01:51:55,280
thing this thing needs a model of what
 

6499
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,510
thing this thing needs a model of what
it's currently doing and i think this is

6500
01:51:57,510 --> 01:51:57,520
it's currently doing and i think this is
 

6501
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,950
it's currently doing and i think this is
exactly the purpose of our own

6502
01:51:58,950 --> 01:51:58,960
exactly the purpose of our own
 

6503
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,189
exactly the purpose of our own
consciousness

6504
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:01,199
consciousness
 

6505
01:52:01,199 --> 01:52:03,910
consciousness
yeah the program things that triculo

6506
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:03,920
yeah the program things that triculo
 

6507
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,350
yeah the program things that triculo
networks

6508
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:05,360
networks
 

6509
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:08,229
networks
so let me ask you it's not quite program

6510
01:52:08,229 --> 01:52:08,239
so let me ask you it's not quite program
 

6511
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:10,950
so let me ask you it's not quite program
synthesis but uh the application of

6512
01:52:10,950 --> 01:52:10,960
synthesis but uh the application of
 

6513
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,830
synthesis but uh the application of
these language models to generation

6514
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:13,840
these language models to generation
 

6515
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,669
these language models to generation
to program synthesis but generation of

6516
01:52:15,669 --> 01:52:15,679
to program synthesis but generation of
 

6517
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:17,910
to program synthesis but generation of
programs so if you look at github open

6518
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:17,920
programs so if you look at github open
 

6519
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,109
programs so if you look at github open
pilot

6520
01:52:19,109 --> 01:52:19,119
pilot
 

6521
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:21,350
pilot
which is based on openai's codex i don't

6522
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:21,360
which is based on openai's codex i don't
 

6523
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:22,709
which is based on openai's codex i don't
know if you got a chance to look at it

6524
01:52:22,709 --> 01:52:22,719
know if you got a chance to look at it
 

6525
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:23,830
know if you got a chance to look at it
but it's

6526
01:52:23,830 --> 01:52:23,840
but it's
 

6527
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:26,229
but it's
the system that's able to generate code

6528
01:52:26,229 --> 01:52:26,239
the system that's able to generate code
 

6529
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:28,629
the system that's able to generate code
once you uh prompt it with

6530
01:52:28,629 --> 01:52:28,639
once you uh prompt it with
 

6531
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:31,430
once you uh prompt it with
what is it like the header of a function

6532
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:31,440
what is it like the header of a function
 

6533
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,589
what is it like the header of a function
with some comments and it seems to do an

6534
01:52:33,589 --> 01:52:33,599
with some comments and it seems to do an
 

6535
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,990
with some comments and it seems to do an
incredibly good job

6536
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:36,000
incredibly good job
 

6537
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:36,950
incredibly good job
or

6538
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:36,960
or
 

6539
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,350
or
not a perfect job is very important but

6540
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:39,360
not a perfect job is very important but
 

6541
01:52:39,360 --> 01:52:41,350
not a perfect job is very important but
an incredibly good job of generating

6542
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,360
an incredibly good job of generating
 

6543
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,030
an incredibly good job of generating
functions

6544
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:43,040
functions
 

6545
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,030
functions
what do you make of that are you is this

6546
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:45,040
what do you make of that are you is this
 

6547
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:47,589
what do you make of that are you is this
exciting or is this just a party trick a

6548
01:52:47,589 --> 01:52:47,599
exciting or is this just a party trick a
 

6549
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:48,870
exciting or is this just a party trick a
demo

6550
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:48,880
demo
 

6551
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:51,750
demo
or is this revolutionary

6552
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:51,760
or is this revolutionary
 

6553
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,270
or is this revolutionary
i haven't worked with it yet so it's

6554
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:53,280
i haven't worked with it yet so it's
 

6555
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:56,149
i haven't worked with it yet so it's
difficult for me to judge it but i would

6556
01:52:56,149 --> 01:52:56,159
difficult for me to judge it but i would
 

6557
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:58,070
difficult for me to judge it but i would
not be surprised if it turns out to be

6558
01:52:58,070 --> 01:52:58,080
not be surprised if it turns out to be
 

6559
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:00,149
not be surprised if it turns out to be
revolutionary that's because the

6560
01:53:00,149 --> 01:53:00,159
revolutionary that's because the
 

6561
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:01,990
revolutionary that's because the
majority of programming tasks that are

6562
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:02,000
majority of programming tasks that are
 

6563
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,229
majority of programming tasks that are
being done in the industry right now are

6564
01:53:04,229 --> 01:53:04,239
being done in the industry right now are
 

6565
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:05,589
being done in the industry right now are
not creative

6566
01:53:05,589 --> 01:53:05,599
not creative
 

6567
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:07,270
not creative
yeah people are writing code that other

6568
01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:07,280
yeah people are writing code that other
 

6569
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,950
yeah people are writing code that other
people have written or they're putting

6570
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:08,960
people have written or they're putting
 

6571
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,790
people have written or they're putting
things together from code fragments that

6572
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:10,800
things together from code fragments that
 

6573
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:12,870
things together from code fragments that
others have had and a lot of the work

6574
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:12,880
others have had and a lot of the work
 

6575
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,109
others have had and a lot of the work
that program has done practice is to

6576
01:53:15,109 --> 01:53:15,119
that program has done practice is to
 

6577
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:17,750
that program has done practice is to
figure out how to overcome the gaps in

6578
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:17,760
figure out how to overcome the gaps in
 

6579
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,589
figure out how to overcome the gaps in
their current knowledge and

6580
01:53:19,589 --> 01:53:19,599
their current knowledge and
 

6581
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:20,950
their current knowledge and
the things that people have already done

6582
01:53:20,950 --> 01:53:20,960
the things that people have already done
 

6583
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,189
the things that people have already done
how to copy and paste from stuck over

6584
01:53:23,189 --> 01:53:23,199
how to copy and paste from stuck over
 

6585
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:25,510
how to copy and paste from stuck over
that's right and so of course we can

6586
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:25,520
that's right and so of course we can
 

6587
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,270
that's right and so of course we can
automate that yeah

6588
01:53:27,270 --> 01:53:27,280
automate that yeah
 

6589
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,589
automate that yeah
to uh make it much faster to copy and

6590
01:53:29,589 --> 01:53:29,599
to uh make it much faster to copy and
 

6591
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:31,350
to uh make it much faster to copy and
paste from stack overflow yes but it's

6592
01:53:31,350 --> 01:53:31,360
paste from stack overflow yes but it's
 

6593
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:33,270
paste from stack overflow yes but it's
not just copying and pasting it's also

6594
01:53:33,270 --> 01:53:33,280
not just copying and pasting it's also
 

6595
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:34,950
not just copying and pasting it's also
basically learning which parts you need

6596
01:53:34,950 --> 01:53:34,960
basically learning which parts you need
 

6597
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,470
basically learning which parts you need
to modify

6598
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:36,480
to modify
 

6599
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,149
to modify
to make them fit together

6600
01:53:38,149 --> 01:53:38,159
to make them fit together
 

6601
01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:38,950
to make them fit together
yeah

6602
01:53:38,950 --> 01:53:38,960
yeah
 

6603
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:41,189
yeah
uh like literally sometimes as simple as

6604
01:53:41,189 --> 01:53:41,199
uh like literally sometimes as simple as
 

6605
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:43,270
uh like literally sometimes as simple as
just changing the variable names

6606
01:53:43,270 --> 01:53:43,280
just changing the variable names
 

6607
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:44,950
just changing the variable names
so it fits into the rest of your code

6608
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:44,960
so it fits into the rest of your code
 

6609
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:46,310
so it fits into the rest of your code
yes but this requires that you

6610
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:46,320
yes but this requires that you
 

6611
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:47,750
yes but this requires that you
understand the semantics of what you're

6612
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:47,760
understand the semantics of what you're
 

6613
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,510
understand the semantics of what you're
doing to some degree yeah

6614
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:49,520
doing to some degree yeah
 

6615
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,790
doing to some degree yeah
and you can automate some of those

6616
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:50,800
and you can automate some of those
 

6617
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,310
and you can automate some of those
things yes the the thing that makes

6618
01:53:52,310 --> 01:53:52,320
things yes the the thing that makes
 

6619
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:55,270
things yes the the thing that makes
people nervous of course is that

6620
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:55,280
people nervous of course is that
 

6621
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,750
people nervous of course is that
a little bit wrong in a program

6622
01:53:57,750 --> 01:53:57,760
a little bit wrong in a program
 

6623
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,589
a little bit wrong in a program
can have a dramatic effect on the actual

6624
01:54:01,589 --> 01:54:01,599
can have a dramatic effect on the actual
 

6625
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:03,830
can have a dramatic effect on the actual
final operation of that program so it's

6626
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:03,840
final operation of that program so it's
 

6627
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,270
final operation of that program so it's
one little error

6628
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:05,280
one little error
 

6629
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,589
one little error
which in in the space of language it

6630
01:54:07,589 --> 01:54:07,599
which in in the space of language it
 

6631
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:09,350
which in in the space of language it
doesn't really matter but in the space

6632
01:54:09,350 --> 01:54:09,360
doesn't really matter but in the space
 

6633
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:10,709
doesn't really matter but in the space
of programs

6634
01:54:10,709 --> 01:54:10,719
of programs
 

6635
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:13,270
of programs
can matter a lot yes but this is already

6636
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:13,280
can matter a lot yes but this is already
 

6637
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,189
can matter a lot yes but this is already
what is happening when humans program

6638
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:15,199
what is happening when humans program
 

6639
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:18,149
what is happening when humans program
code yeah this is so we have a

6640
01:54:18,149 --> 01:54:18,159
code yeah this is so we have a
 

6641
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,149
code yeah this is so we have a
technology to deal with this

6642
01:54:20,149 --> 01:54:20,159
technology to deal with this
 

6643
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:22,709
technology to deal with this
somehow it becomes scarier

6644
01:54:22,709 --> 01:54:22,719
somehow it becomes scarier
 

6645
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:24,709
somehow it becomes scarier
when you know that a program generated

6646
01:54:24,709 --> 01:54:24,719
when you know that a program generated
 

6647
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:26,310
when you know that a program generated
code that's running a nuclear power

6648
01:54:26,310 --> 01:54:26,320
code that's running a nuclear power
 

6649
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:27,830
code that's running a nuclear power
plant

6650
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:27,840
plant
 

6651
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,149
plant
it becomes scarier you know humans have

6652
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:30,159
it becomes scarier you know humans have
 

6653
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:31,350
it becomes scarier you know humans have
errors too

6654
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:31,360
errors too
 

6655
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:32,870
errors too
exactly but

6656
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:32,880
exactly but
 

6657
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,109
exactly but
it's scarier when a program is doing it

6658
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,119
it's scarier when a program is doing it
 

6659
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:37,589
it's scarier when a program is doing it
because

6660
01:54:37,589 --> 01:54:37,599
because
 

6661
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:41,189
because
why why i mean there's a

6662
01:54:41,189 --> 01:54:41,199
why why i mean there's a
 

6663
01:54:41,199 --> 01:54:43,589
why why i mean there's a
there's a fear that a program

6664
01:54:43,589 --> 01:54:43,599
there's a fear that a program
 

6665
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:46,709
there's a fear that a program
like a program may not be

6666
01:54:46,709 --> 01:54:46,719
like a program may not be
 

6667
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:49,350
like a program may not be
as good as humans to know when stuff is

6668
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,360
as good as humans to know when stuff is
 

6669
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:53,270
as good as humans to know when stuff is
important to not mess up

6670
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:53,280

 

6671
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:55,910

like

6672
01:54:55,910 --> 01:54:55,920

 

6673
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,270

there's a misalignment of priorities

6674
01:54:59,270 --> 01:54:59,280
there's a misalignment of priorities
 

6675
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,510
there's a misalignment of priorities
of values that's potential that maybe

6676
01:55:01,510 --> 01:55:01,520
of values that's potential that maybe
 

6677
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,350
of values that's potential that maybe
that's the source of the worry

6678
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:03,360
that's the source of the worry
 

6679
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:06,310
that's the source of the worry
i mean okay if i give you code generated

6680
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:06,320
i mean okay if i give you code generated
 

6681
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,229
i mean okay if i give you code generated
by

6682

uh
github open pilot and code generated by

01:55:11,589 --> 01:55:11,599
github open pilot and code generated by
 

6687

use use one of these which which how do

6690
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:17,360
use use one of these which which how do
 

6691
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:19,589
use use one of these which which how do
you select today and in the next 10

6692
01:55:19,589 --> 01:55:19,599
you select today and in the next 10
 

6693
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:22,149
you select today and in the next 10
years which code to use wouldn't you

6694
01:55:22,149 --> 01:55:22,159
years which code to use wouldn't you
 

6695
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:25,189
years which code to use wouldn't you
still be comfortable with the human

6696
01:55:25,189 --> 01:55:25,199
still be comfortable with the human
 

6697
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:27,669
still be comfortable with the human
at the moment when you go to stanford to

6698
01:55:27,669 --> 01:55:27,679
at the moment when you go to stanford to
 

6699
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:29,510
at the moment when you go to stanford to
get an mri

6700
01:55:29,510 --> 01:55:29,520
get an mri
 

6701
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:31,910
get an mri
they will write a bill to the insurance

6702
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:31,920
they will write a bill to the insurance
 

6703
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:34,470
they will write a bill to the insurance
over twenty thousand dollars

6704
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:34,480
over twenty thousand dollars
 

6705
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:37,030
over twenty thousand dollars
and of this maybe half of that gets paid

6706
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:37,040
and of this maybe half of that gets paid
 

6707
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:39,109
and of this maybe half of that gets paid
by the insurance and the quarter gets

6708
01:55:39,109 --> 01:55:39,119
by the insurance and the quarter gets
 

6709
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:41,589
by the insurance and the quarter gets
paid by you yeah and the mri cost them

6710
01:55:41,589 --> 01:55:41,599
paid by you yeah and the mri cost them
 

6711
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:43,750
paid by you yeah and the mri cost them
six hundred dollars to make maybe

6712
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:43,760
six hundred dollars to make maybe
 

6713
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:44,870
six hundred dollars to make maybe
probably less

6714
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:44,880
probably less
 

6715
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:45,910
probably less
and

6716
01:55:45,910 --> 01:55:45,920
and
 

6717
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:47,750
and
what are the values of the person that

6718
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:47,760
what are the values of the person that
 

6719
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,750
what are the values of the person that
writes the software and deploys this

6720
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:49,760
writes the software and deploys this
 

6721
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,990
writes the software and deploys this
process

6722
01:55:51,990 --> 01:55:52,000
process
 

6723
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,910
process
it's very difficult for me to say

6724
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:53,920
it's very difficult for me to say
 

6725
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:56,070
it's very difficult for me to say
whether i trust people

6726
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:56,080
whether i trust people
 

6727
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,070
whether i trust people
i think that what happens there is a

6728
01:55:58,070 --> 01:55:58,080
i think that what happens there is a
 

6729
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:01,510
i think that what happens there is a
mixture of proper anglo-saxon protestant

6730
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:01,520
mixture of proper anglo-saxon protestant
 

6731
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:03,589
mixture of proper anglo-saxon protestant
values where somebody is trying to serve

6732
01:56:03,589 --> 01:56:03,599
values where somebody is trying to serve
 

6733
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:05,430
values where somebody is trying to serve
an abstract greater whole and organized

6734
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:05,440
an abstract greater whole and organized
 

6735
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:08,149
an abstract greater whole and organized
crime well that's a very harsh you're

6736
01:56:08,149 --> 01:56:08,159
crime well that's a very harsh you're
 

6737
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:10,870
crime well that's a very harsh you're
you're um

6738
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:10,880

 

6739
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,629

i think

6740
01:56:12,629 --> 01:56:12,639
i think
 

6741
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:15,669
i think
that's a harsh view of humanity there's

6742
01:56:15,669 --> 01:56:15,679
that's a harsh view of humanity there's
 

6743
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:18,629
that's a harsh view of humanity there's
a lot of bad people whether incompetent

6744
01:56:18,629 --> 01:56:18,639
a lot of bad people whether incompetent
 

6745
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:21,589
a lot of bad people whether incompetent
or just malevolent in this world yes

6746
01:56:21,589 --> 01:56:21,599
or just malevolent in this world yes
 

6747
01:56:21,599 --> 01:56:24,709
or just malevolent in this world yes
but it feels like the more

6748
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:24,719
but it feels like the more
 

6749
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:27,189
but it feels like the more
malevolent you so the more damage you do

6750
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:27,199
malevolent you so the more damage you do
 

6751
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:29,109
malevolent you so the more damage you do
to the world

6752
01:56:29,109 --> 01:56:29,119
to the world
 

6753
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:31,189
to the world
uh the more resistance you have in your

6754
01:56:31,189 --> 01:56:31,199
uh the more resistance you have in your
 

6755
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:32,470
uh the more resistance you have in your
own

6756

human

6758
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360
human
 

6759
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:34,390
human
like

6760
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:34,400
like
 

6761
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,390
like
but cannot explain with malevolence or

6762
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:36,400
but cannot explain with malevolence or
 

6763
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:38,390
but cannot explain with malevolence or
stupidity what can be explained by just

6764
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:38,400
stupidity what can be explained by just
 

6765
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:41,350
stupidity what can be explained by just
people acting on their incentives

6766
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:41,360
people acting on their incentives
 

6767
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,109
people acting on their incentives
right so what happens in stanford is not

6768
01:56:43,109 --> 01:56:43,119
right so what happens in stanford is not
 

6769
01:56:43,119 --> 01:56:44,950
right so what happens in stanford is not
that somebody is evil

6770
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:44,960
that somebody is evil
 

6771
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:46,950
that somebody is evil
it's just that they do what they're

6772
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:46,960
it's just that they do what they're
 

6773
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:48,629
it's just that they do what they're
being paid for

6774
01:56:48,629 --> 01:56:48,639
being paid for
 

6775
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:50,870
being paid for
no and this is that's not evil that's i

6776
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:50,880
no and this is that's not evil that's i
 

6777
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:53,030
no and this is that's not evil that's i
i tend to so no i see that as

6778
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:53,040
i tend to so no i see that as
 

6779
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:55,270
i tend to so no i see that as
malevolence i see uh

6780
01:56:55,270 --> 01:56:55,280
malevolence i see uh
 

6781
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:56,550
malevolence i see uh
as i

6782

told you offline is some it's not

6786
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:02,560
told you offline is some it's not
 

6787
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:03,750
told you offline is some it's not
it's not

6788

it's not
 

6789
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,750
it's not
absolute malevolence but it's a small

6790
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:05,760
absolute malevolence but it's a small
 

6791
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,350
absolute malevolence but it's a small
amount it's cowardice

6792
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:07,360
amount it's cowardice
 

6793
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,189
amount it's cowardice
i mean when you see there's something

6794
01:57:09,189 --> 01:57:09,199
i mean when you see there's something
 

6795
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:11,270
i mean when you see there's something
wrong with the world

6796
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:11,280
wrong with the world
 

6797
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,189
wrong with the world
um it's either incompetence that you're

6798
01:57:13,189 --> 01:57:13,199
um it's either incompetence that you're
 

6799
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:15,030
um it's either incompetence that you're
not able to see it

6800
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:15,040
not able to see it
 

6801
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:17,109
not able to see it
or it's cowardice that you're not able

6802
01:57:17,109 --> 01:57:17,119
or it's cowardice that you're not able
 

6803
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:19,189
or it's cowardice that you're not able
to stand up not it's not necessarily in

6804
01:57:19,189 --> 01:57:19,199
to stand up not it's not necessarily in
 

6805
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:21,589
to stand up not it's not necessarily in
a big way but in a small way

6806
01:57:21,589 --> 01:57:21,599
a big way but in a small way
 

6807
01:57:21,599 --> 01:57:22,629
a big way but in a small way
so i

6808
01:57:22,629 --> 01:57:22,639
so i
 

6809
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:25,109
so i
i do think that is in a bit of

6810
01:57:25,109 --> 01:57:25,119
i do think that is in a bit of
 

6811
01:57:25,119 --> 01:57:26,870
i do think that is in a bit of
malevolence i'm not sure the example

6812
01:57:26,870 --> 01:57:26,880
malevolence i'm not sure the example
 

6813
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,709
malevolence i'm not sure the example
you're describing is the question is

6814
01:57:28,709 --> 01:57:28,719
you're describing is the question is
 

6815
01:57:28,719 --> 01:57:32,229
you're describing is the question is
what is it that you are aiming for and

6816
01:57:32,229 --> 01:57:32,239
what is it that you are aiming for and
 

6817
01:57:32,239 --> 01:57:34,790
what is it that you are aiming for and
if you don't believe in the future

6818
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:34,800
if you don't believe in the future
 

6819
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,149
if you don't believe in the future
if you for instance think that the

6820
01:57:36,149 --> 01:57:36,159
if you for instance think that the
 

6821
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:37,990
if you for instance think that the
dollar is going to crash by what you try

6822
01:57:37,990 --> 01:57:38,000
dollar is going to crash by what you try
 

6823
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,510
dollar is going to crash by what you try
to save dollars

6824
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:39,520
to save dollars
 

6825
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:41,990
to save dollars
if you uh don't think that humanity will

6826
01:57:41,990 --> 01:57:42,000
if you uh don't think that humanity will
 

6827
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,070
if you uh don't think that humanity will
be around in 100 years from now because

6828
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:44,080
be around in 100 years from now because
 

6829
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:46,149
be around in 100 years from now because
uh global warming will wipe out

6830
01:57:46,149 --> 01:57:46,159
uh global warming will wipe out
 

6831
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:48,390
uh global warming will wipe out
civilization why would you need to act

6832
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:48,400
civilization why would you need to act
 

6833
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,070
civilization why would you need to act
as if it were

6834
01:57:50,070 --> 01:57:50,080
as if it were
 

6835
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:52,070
as if it were
right so the question is is there an

6836
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:52,080
right so the question is is there an
 

6837
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:53,910
right so the question is is there an
overarching aesthetics

6838
01:57:53,910 --> 01:57:53,920
overarching aesthetics
 

6839
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,990
overarching aesthetics
that is projecting you and the world

6840
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:56,000
that is projecting you and the world
 

6841
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,589
that is projecting you and the world
into the future which i think is the

6842
01:57:57,589 --> 01:57:57,599
into the future which i think is the
 

6843
01:57:57,599 --> 01:57:59,669
into the future which i think is the
basic idea of religion that you

6844
01:57:59,669 --> 01:57:59,679
basic idea of religion that you
 

6845
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:01,510
basic idea of religion that you
understand the interactions that we have

6846
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:01,520
understand the interactions that we have
 

6847
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:03,350
understand the interactions that we have
with each other as some kind of

6848
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:03,360
with each other as some kind of
 

6849
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:04,870
with each other as some kind of
civilization level agent that is

6850
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:04,880
civilization level agent that is
 

6851
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:07,589
civilization level agent that is
projecting itself into the future if you

6852
01:58:07,589 --> 01:58:07,599
projecting itself into the future if you
 

6853
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:09,669
projecting itself into the future if you
if you don't have that shared purpose

6854
01:58:09,669 --> 01:58:09,679
if you don't have that shared purpose
 

6855
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:12,870
if you don't have that shared purpose
uh right what is there to be ethical for

6856
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:12,880
uh right what is there to be ethical for
 

6857
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,790
uh right what is there to be ethical for
so i think when we talk about

6858
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:14,800
so i think when we talk about
 

6859
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,910
so i think when we talk about
essex and ai we need to go beyond the

6860
01:58:17,910 --> 01:58:17,920
essex and ai we need to go beyond the
 

6861
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,149
essex and ai we need to go beyond the
insane bias discussions and so on where

6862
01:58:20,149 --> 01:58:20,159
insane bias discussions and so on where
 

6863
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:21,990
insane bias discussions and so on where
people are just measuring the distance

6864
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:22,000
people are just measuring the distance
 

6865
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,629
people are just measuring the distance
between a statistic to their uh

6866
01:58:24,629 --> 01:58:24,639
between a statistic to their uh
 

6867
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,229
between a statistic to their uh
preferred um

6868
01:58:26,229 --> 01:58:26,239
preferred um
 

6869
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:29,430
preferred um
current world model but the optimism

6870
01:58:29,430 --> 01:58:29,440
current world model but the optimism
 

6871
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,950
current world model but the optimism
i was a little confused by the previous

6872
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:30,960
i was a little confused by the previous
 

6873
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:34,550
i was a little confused by the previous
things just to clarify

6874
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:34,560

 

6875
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,229

it's

6876
01:58:36,229 --> 01:58:36,239
it's
 

6877
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:38,950
it's
there is a kind of underlying

6878
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:38,960
there is a kind of underlying
 

6879
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:41,109
there is a kind of underlying
morality to

6880
01:58:41,109 --> 01:58:41,119
morality to
 

6881
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:42,790
morality to
having an optimism that human

6882
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:42,800
having an optimism that human
 

6883
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,629
having an optimism that human
civilization will persist for longer

6884
01:58:44,629 --> 01:58:44,639
civilization will persist for longer
 

6885
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:47,270
civilization will persist for longer
than a hundred years like that like uh i

6886
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:47,280
than a hundred years like that like uh i
 

6887
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:50,070
than a hundred years like that like uh i
think a lot of people believe

6888
01:58:50,070 --> 01:58:50,080
think a lot of people believe
 

6889
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:51,990
think a lot of people believe
that it's it's a good thing for us to

6890
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:52,000
that it's it's a good thing for us to
 

6891
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,229
that it's it's a good thing for us to
keep living yeah of course and thriving

6892
01:58:54,229 --> 01:58:54,239
keep living yeah of course and thriving
 

6893
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:56,790
keep living yeah of course and thriving
morality itself is not an end to itself

6894
01:58:56,790 --> 01:58:56,800
morality itself is not an end to itself
 

6895
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,950
morality itself is not an end to itself
it's instrumental to people living in

6896
01:58:58,950 --> 01:58:58,960
it's instrumental to people living in
 

6897
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:00,870
it's instrumental to people living in
100 years from now

6898
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:00,880
100 years from now
 

6899
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:03,990
100 years from now
right or 500 years from now right so uh

6900
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:04,000
right or 500 years from now right so uh
 

6901
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,070
right or 500 years from now right so uh
it's only justifiable if you actually

6902
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:06,080
it's only justifiable if you actually
 

6903
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:08,629
it's only justifiable if you actually
think that it will lead to people uh or

6904
01:59:08,629 --> 01:59:08,639
think that it will lead to people uh or
 

6905
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:10,390
think that it will lead to people uh or
increase the probability of people being

6906
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:10,400
increase the probability of people being
 

6907
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:13,350
increase the probability of people being
around in that time frame and a lot of

6908
01:59:13,350 --> 01:59:13,360
around in that time frame and a lot of
 

6909
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,950
around in that time frame and a lot of
people don't actually believe that at

6910
01:59:14,950 --> 01:59:14,960
people don't actually believe that at
 

6911
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:16,790
people don't actually believe that at
least not actively

6912
01:59:16,790 --> 01:59:16,800
least not actively
 

6913
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:19,109
least not actively
but i believe what exactly so

6914
01:59:19,109 --> 01:59:19,119
but i believe what exactly so
 

6915
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:21,109
but i believe what exactly so
most people don't believe that they can

6916
01:59:21,109 --> 01:59:21,119
most people don't believe that they can
 

6917
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:23,350
most people don't believe that they can
afford to act on such a model

6918
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:23,360
afford to act on such a model
 

6919
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:25,430
afford to act on such a model
basically what happens in in the u.s is

6920
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:25,440
basically what happens in in the u.s is
 

6921
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,030
basically what happens in in the u.s is
i think that the healthcare system is

6922
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:27,040
i think that the healthcare system is
 

6923
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,229
i think that the healthcare system is
for a lot of people no longer

6924
01:59:28,229 --> 01:59:28,239
for a lot of people no longer
 

6925
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:29,910
for a lot of people no longer
sustainable which means that if they

6926
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:29,920
sustainable which means that if they
 

6927
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,430
sustainable which means that if they
need the help of the healthcare system

6928
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:31,440
need the help of the healthcare system
 

6929
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:33,430
need the help of the healthcare system
they're often not able to afford it yeah

6930
01:59:33,430 --> 01:59:33,440
they're often not able to afford it yeah
 

6931
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:35,830
they're often not able to afford it yeah
and when they cannot help it they are

6932
01:59:35,830 --> 01:59:35,840
and when they cannot help it they are
 

6933
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:37,750
and when they cannot help it they are
often going bankrupt it's i think the

6934
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:37,760
often going bankrupt it's i think the
 

6935
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,589
often going bankrupt it's i think the
leading course cause of personal

6936
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:39,599
leading course cause of personal
 

6937
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:41,270
leading course cause of personal
bankruptcy in the us is the healthcare

6938
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:41,280
bankruptcy in the us is the healthcare
 

6939
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,390
bankruptcy in the us is the healthcare
system

6940
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:42,400
system
 

6941
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:44,790
system
yeah and uh that would not be necessary

6942
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:44,800
yeah and uh that would not be necessary
 

6943
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,629
yeah and uh that would not be necessary
it's not because people are consuming

6944
01:59:46,629 --> 01:59:46,639
it's not because people are consuming
 

6945
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:48,950
it's not because people are consuming
more and more uh medical services and

6946
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:48,960
more and more uh medical services and
 

6947
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,550
more and more uh medical services and
are achieving a much much longer life as

6948
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:50,560
are achieving a much much longer life as
 

6949
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:52,790
are achieving a much much longer life as
a result that's not actually the story

6950
01:59:52,790 --> 01:59:52,800
a result that's not actually the story
 

6951
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:54,070
a result that's not actually the story
that is happening because you can

6952
01:59:54,070 --> 01:59:54,080
that is happening because you can
 

6953
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:55,910
that is happening because you can
compare to other countries and life

6954
01:59:55,910 --> 01:59:55,920
compare to other countries and life
 

6955
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:57,910
compare to other countries and life

expectancy in the u.s is currently not
 

6957
01:59:57,920 --> 01:59:59,589
expectancy in the u.s is currently not
increasing and it's not as high as in

6958
01:59:59,589 --> 01:59:59,599
increasing and it's not as high as in
 

6959
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:01,589
increasing and it's not as high as in
all the other industrialized countries

all the other industrialized countries
 

6961
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:03,189
all the other industrialized countries
so some industrialized countries are

6962
02:00:03,189 --> 02:00:03,199
so some industrialized countries are
 

6963
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:04,709
so some industrialized countries are
doing better with a much cheaper

6964
02:00:04,709 --> 02:00:04,719
doing better with a much cheaper
 

6965

and
 

6969
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,550
and
what you can see is for instance

6970
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:08,560
what you can see is for instance
 

6971
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:11,270
what you can see is for instance
administrative bloat the

6972
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:11,280
administrative bloat the
 

6973
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,350
administrative bloat the
healthcare system has maybe to some

6974
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:13,360
healthcare system has maybe to some

use case in productivity so they are

6984
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:27,360
use case in productivity so they are
 

6985
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:29,830
use case in productivity so they are
being paid to push paper around and the

6986
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:29,840
being paid to push paper around and the
 

6987
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:31,510
being paid to push paper around and the
number of administrators in the

6988
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:31,520
number of administrators in the
 

6989
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,109
number of administrators in the
healthcare system has been increasing

6990
02:00:33,109 --> 02:00:33,119
healthcare system has been increasing
 

6991
02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:34,470
healthcare system has been increasing
much faster than the number of

6992
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:34,480
much faster than the number of
 

6993
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:35,669
much faster than the number of
practitioners

6994
02:00:35,669 --> 02:00:35,679
practitioners
 

6995
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:36,870
practitioners
and this is something that you have to

6996
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:36,880
and this is something that you have to
 

6997
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:39,589
and this is something that you have to
pay for right and also the

6998
02:00:39,589 --> 02:00:39,599
pay for right and also the
 

6999
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,270
pay for right and also the
revenues that are being generated in the

7000
02:00:41,270 --> 02:00:41,280
revenues that are being generated in the
 

7001
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:42,870
revenues that are being generated in the
healthcare system are relatively large

7002
02:00:42,870 --> 02:00:42,880
healthcare system are relatively large
 

7003
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:45,109
healthcare system are relatively large
and somebody has to pay for them and

7004
02:00:45,109 --> 02:00:45,119
and somebody has to pay for them and
 

7005
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:46,709
and somebody has to pay for them and
the result why they are so large is

7006
02:00:46,709 --> 02:00:46,719
the result why they are so large is
 

7007
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:48,149
the result why they are so large is
because market mechanisms are not

7008
02:00:48,149 --> 02:00:48,159
because market mechanisms are not
 

7009
02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:51,189
because market mechanisms are not
working right the fda is largely not

7010
02:00:51,189 --> 02:00:51,199
working right the fda is largely not
 

7011
02:00:51,199 --> 02:00:54,390
working right the fda is largely not
protecting people from malpractice

7012
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:54,400
protecting people from malpractice
 

7013
02:00:54,400 --> 02:00:56,870
protecting people from malpractice
of healthcare providers the fda is

7014
02:00:56,870 --> 02:00:56,880
of healthcare providers the fda is
 

7015
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:58,709
of healthcare providers the fda is
protecting healthcare providers from

7016
02:00:58,709 --> 02:00:58,719
protecting healthcare providers from
 

7017
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:01,669
protecting healthcare providers from
competition right okay so this is a

7018
02:01:01,669 --> 02:01:01,679
competition right okay so this is a
 

7019
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:03,430
competition right okay so this is a
thing that is has to do with values and

7020
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:03,440
thing that is has to do with values and
 

7021
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,270
thing that is has to do with values and
this is not because people are malicious

7022
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:05,280
this is not because people are malicious
 

7023
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,589
this is not because people are malicious
on all levels it's because they are not

7024
02:01:07,589 --> 02:01:07,599
on all levels it's because they are not
 

7025
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:10,550
on all levels it's because they are not
incentivized to act on a greater whole

7026
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:10,560
incentivized to act on a greater whole
 

7027
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,790

on this idea that you treat somebody who

02:01:12,790 --> 02:01:12,800
on this idea that you treat somebody who

02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,709
on this idea that you treat somebody who
comes to you as a patient like you would

02:01:14,709 --> 02:01:14,719
comes to you as a patient like you would
 

7031
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:16,470
comes to you as a patient like you would
treat a family member yeah but yeah but

02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:16,480
treat a family member yeah but yeah but
 

7033
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,229

we're trying i mean

7034
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:18,239
we're trying i mean
 

7035
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:19,910
we're trying i mean
you're highlighting a lot of the flaws

7036
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:19,920
you're highlighting a lot of the flaws
 

7037
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:21,270
you're highlighting a lot of the flaws
of the different institutions the

7038
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:21,280
of the different institutions the
 

7039
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:23,189
of the different institutions the
systems we're operating under but i

7040
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:23,199
systems we're operating under but i
 

7041
02:01:23,199 --> 02:01:24,629
systems we're operating under but i
think there's a continuum throughout

7042
02:01:24,629 --> 02:01:24,639
think there's a continuum throughout
 

7043
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:25,830
think there's a continuum throughout

7046

mechanism design
 

7047
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:29,669
mechanism design
of trying to design incentives in such a

7048
02:01:29,669 --> 02:01:29,679
of trying to design incentives in such a
 

7049
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:31,669
of trying to design incentives in such a
way that these systems behave better and

7050
02:01:31,669 --> 02:01:31,679
way that these systems behave better and
 

7051
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:33,430
way that these systems behave better and
better and better i mean it's a very

7052
02:01:33,430 --> 02:01:33,440
better and better i mean it's a very
 

7053
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:35,270
better and better i mean it's a very
difficult thing to operate

7054
02:01:35,270 --> 02:01:35,280
difficult thing to operate
 

7055
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:37,430
difficult thing to operate
a society of hundreds of millions of

7056
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:37,440
a society of hundreds of millions of

02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,910
a society of hundreds of millions of
people effectively with yes

people effectively with yes
 

7059
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,830
people effectively with yes
so do we live in a society that is ever

7060
02:01:41,830 --> 02:01:41,840
so do we live in a society that is ever
 

7061
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:44,390
so do we live in a society that is ever
correcting is this uh right do we

7062
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:44,400
correcting is this uh right do we
 

7063
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:47,589
correcting is this uh right do we
observe that our models of what we are

7064
02:01:47,589 --> 02:01:47,599
observe that our models of what we are
 

7065
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:49,430
observe that our models of what we are
doing are predictive of the future and

02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:49,440
doing are predictive of the future and

02:01:49,440 --> 02:01:51,669
doing are predictive of the future and
when they are not we improve them

7068
02:01:51,669 --> 02:01:51,679
when they are not we improve them

you probably

7086
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:06,320
you probably
 

7087
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,070
you probably
make an estimate of what is the thing

7088
02:02:08,070 --> 02:02:08,080
make an estimate of what is the thing
 

7089
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:09,510
make an estimate of what is the thing
that's currently wrong in my life what

7090
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:09,520
that's currently wrong in my life what
 

7091
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,109
that's currently wrong in my life what
is it that i should change about my own

7092
02:02:11,109 --> 02:02:11,119
is it that i should change about my own
 

7093
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:13,990
is it that i should change about my own
policies what is the expected outcome

7094
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:14,000
policies what is the expected outcome
 

7095
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,629
policies what is the expected outcome
and if that outcome does manifest

7096
02:02:16,629 --> 02:02:16,639
and if that outcome does manifest
 

7097
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:18,550
and if that outcome does manifest
i will change the policy back right or i

7098
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:18,560
i will change the policy back right or i
 

7099
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:20,070
i will change the policy back right or i
will change it to something different

7100
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:20,080
will change it to something different
 

7101
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:22,229
will change it to something different
are we doing this on a societal level i

7102
02:02:22,229 --> 02:02:22,239
are we doing this on a societal level i
 

7103
02:02:22,239 --> 02:02:24,149
are we doing this on a societal level i
think so i think i think it's easy to

7104
02:02:24,149 --> 02:02:24,159
think so i think i think it's easy to
 

7105
02:02:24,159 --> 02:02:26,149
think so i think i think it's easy to
sort of highlight the i think we're

7106
02:02:26,149 --> 02:02:26,159
sort of highlight the i think we're
 

7107
02:02:26,159 --> 02:02:28,870
sort of highlight the i think we're
doing it in the way that um

7108
02:02:28,870 --> 02:02:28,880
doing it in the way that um
 

7109
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:30,550
doing it in the way that um
like i operate my current life i didn't

7110
02:02:30,550 --> 02:02:30,560
like i operate my current life i didn't
 

7111
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:32,870
like i operate my current life i didn't
sleep much last night uh

7112
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:32,880
sleep much last night uh
 

7113
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,030

you would say that lex the way you need

you would say that lex the way you need
 

7115
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:36,470

care system is operating poor but the

7136
02:02:56,950 --> 02:02:56,960
care system is operating poor but the
 

7137
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:59,030
care system is operating poor but the
point is that we just

7138
02:02:59,030 --> 02:02:59,040
point is that we just
 

7139
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,709
point is that we just
it seems like this is the way especially

7140
02:03:00,709 --> 02:03:00,719
it seems like this is the way especially
 

7141
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:02,950
it seems like this is the way especially
in the capital society we operate we

7142
02:03:02,950 --> 02:03:02,960
in the capital society we operate we
 

7143
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:05,030
in the capital society we operate we
keep running into trouble and last

7144
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:05,040
keep running into trouble and last
 

7145
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:08,070
keep running into trouble and last
minute we we try to get our our way out

7146
02:03:08,070 --> 02:03:08,080
minute we we try to get our our way out
 

7147
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:10,629
minute we we try to get our our way out
through innovation and it seems to work

7148
02:03:10,629 --> 02:03:10,639
through innovation and it seems to work
 

7149
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:12,950
through innovation and it seems to work
you have a lot of people that ultimately

7150
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:12,960
you have a lot of people that ultimately
 

7151
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:15,430
you have a lot of people that ultimately
are trying to build a better world and

7152
02:03:15,430 --> 02:03:15,440
are trying to build a better world and
 

7153
02:03:15,440 --> 02:03:19,350
are trying to build a better world and
and get uh urgency about them

7154
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:19,360
and get uh urgency about them
 

7155
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,430
and get uh urgency about them
when it's the problem becomes more and

7156
02:03:21,430 --> 02:03:21,440
when it's the problem becomes more and
 

7157
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,790
when it's the problem becomes more and
more imminent

7158
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:22,800
more imminent
 

7159
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,550
more imminent
and that's the way this operates but if

7160
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:24,560
and that's the way this operates but if
 

7161
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:25,990
and that's the way this operates but if
you look at the

7162
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:26,000
you look at the
 

7163
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:26,870
you look at the
the

02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:26,880
the

02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:29,669
the
the history the the long arc of history

02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:29,679
the history the the long arc of history
 

7167
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:31,430
the history the the long arc of history
it seems like that

7168
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:31,440
it seems like that
 

7169
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:34,070
it seems like that
operating on deadlines

7170
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:34,080
operating on deadlines
 

7171
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:36,149
operating on deadlines
produces progress and builds better and

02:03:36,149 --> 02:03:36,159
produces progress and builds better and
 

7173
02:03:36,159 --> 02:03:37,830
produces progress and builds better and
better systems you probably agree with

7174
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:37,840
better systems you probably agree with
 

7175
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:40,149
better systems you probably agree with
me that the us should have engaged in

put before the firing squad i think they

7232
02:04:39,589 --> 02:04:39,599
put before the firing squad i think they
 

7233
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:41,109
put before the firing squad i think they
are no just make sure that this doesn't

7234
02:04:41,109 --> 02:04:41,119
are no just make sure that this doesn't
 

7235
02:04:41,119 --> 02:04:43,030
are no just make sure that this doesn't
happen again no but

7236
02:04:43,030 --> 02:04:43,040
happen again no but
 

7237
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,709
happen again no but
you see but it's not that

7238
02:04:44,709 --> 02:04:44,719
you see but it's not that
 

7239
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:46,310
you see but it's not that
yes they're being held responsible by

7240

yes they're being held responsible by
many voices by people being frustrated

7242
02:04:48,709 --> 02:04:48,719
many voices by people being frustrated
 

7243
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:50,629
many voices by people being frustrated
there's new leaders being born now

7244
02:04:50,629 --> 02:04:50,639
there's new leaders being born now
 

7245
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:53,270
there's new leaders being born now
they're going to see rise to the top in

7246
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:53,280
they're going to see rise to the top in
 

7247
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:54,310
they're going to see rise to the top in
10 years

7248
02:04:54,310 --> 02:04:54,320
10 years
 

7249
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,390
10 years
this moves slower than

7250
02:04:56,390 --> 02:04:56,400
this moves slower than
 

7251
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,870
this moves slower than
there's obviously a lot of uh

7252
02:04:58,870 --> 02:04:58,880
there's obviously a lot of uh
 

7253
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:01,270
there's obviously a lot of uh
older incompetence and bureaucracy and

7254
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:01,280
older incompetence and bureaucracy and
 

7255
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,589
older incompetence and bureaucracy and
these systems move slowly

7256
02:05:03,589 --> 02:05:03,599
these systems move slowly
 

7257
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:05,669
these systems move slowly
they move you know like science one

7258
02:05:05,669 --> 02:05:05,679
they move you know like science one
 

7259
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:07,990
they move you know like science one
death at a time so like

7260
02:05:07,990 --> 02:05:08,000
death at a time so like
 

7261
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,189
death at a time so like
yes i think the the pain has been felt

7262
02:05:11,189 --> 02:05:11,199
yes i think the the pain has been felt
 

7263
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:12,870
yes i think the the pain has been felt
in the previous year

7264
02:05:12,870 --> 02:05:12,880
in the previous year
 

7265
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:15,430
in the previous year
is reverberating throughout the world

7266
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:15,440
is reverberating throughout the world
 

7267
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,430
is reverberating throughout the world
maybe i'm getting old i suspect that

7268
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:17,440
maybe i'm getting old i suspect that
 

7269
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,750
maybe i'm getting old i suspect that
every generation in the us after the war

7270
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:19,760
every generation in the us after the war
 

7271
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:22,069
every generation in the us after the war
has lost the plot even more i don't see

7272
02:05:22,069 --> 02:05:22,079
has lost the plot even more i don't see
 

7273
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:24,550
has lost the plot even more i don't see
this development the war world war ii

7274
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:24,560
this development the war world war ii
 

7275
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:27,030
this development the war world war ii
yeah so basically there was a time when

7276
02:05:27,030 --> 02:05:27,040
yeah so basically there was a time when
 

7277
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:29,510
yeah so basically there was a time when
uh we were modernist and in this

7278
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:29,520
uh we were modernist and in this
 

7279
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,589
uh we were modernist and in this
modernist time

7280
02:05:31,589 --> 02:05:31,599
modernist time
 

7281
02:05:31,599 --> 02:05:33,830
modernist time
the u.s felt actively threatened by the

7282
02:05:33,830 --> 02:05:33,840
the u.s felt actively threatened by the
 

7283
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,069
the u.s felt actively threatened by the
things that happened in the world the us

7284
02:05:36,069 --> 02:05:36,079
things that happened in the world the us
 

7285
02:05:36,079 --> 02:05:39,589
things that happened in the world the us
was worried about possibility of failure

7286
02:05:39,589 --> 02:05:39,599
was worried about possibility of failure
 

7287
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:43,109
was worried about possibility of failure
and this imminence of possible failure

7288
02:05:43,109 --> 02:05:43,119
and this imminence of possible failure
 

7289
02:05:43,119 --> 02:05:46,069
and this imminence of possible failure
led to decisions where there was a time

7290
02:05:46,069 --> 02:05:46,079
led to decisions where there was a time
 

7291
02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:47,430
led to decisions where there was a time
when the government would listen to

7292
02:05:47,430 --> 02:05:47,440
when the government would listen to
 

7293
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:50,470
when the government would listen to
physicists about how to do things yeah

7294
02:05:50,470 --> 02:05:50,480
physicists about how to do things yeah
 

7295
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,589
physicists about how to do things yeah
and the physicists were actually

7296
02:05:51,589 --> 02:05:51,599
and the physicists were actually
 

7297
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:52,870
and the physicists were actually
concerned about what the government

7298
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:52,880
concerned about what the government
 

7299
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,870
concerned about what the government
should be doing so they would be writing

7300
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:54,880
should be doing so they would be writing
 

7301
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,870
should be doing so they would be writing
letters to the government and so for

7302
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:56,880
letters to the government and so for
 

7303
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:58,470
letters to the government and so for
instance the decision for the manhattan

7304
02:05:58,470 --> 02:05:58,480
instance the decision for the manhattan
 

7305
02:05:58,480 --> 02:06:00,870
instance the decision for the manhattan
project was something that was driven in

7306
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:00,880
project was something that was driven in
 

7307
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,870
project was something that was driven in
the conversation between physicists and

7308
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:02,880
the conversation between physicists and
 

7309
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,950
the conversation between physicists and
the government i don't think such a

7310
02:06:04,950 --> 02:06:04,960
the government i don't think such a
 

7311
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,270
the government i don't think such a
discussion would take place today i i

7312
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:07,280
discussion would take place today i i
 

7313
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,510
discussion would take place today i i
disagree i think if the virus was much

7314
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:09,520
disagree i think if the virus was much
 

7315
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:11,589
disagree i think if the virus was much
deadlier we would see a very different

7316
02:06:11,589 --> 02:06:11,599
deadlier we would see a very different
 

7317
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:13,589
deadlier we would see a very different
response i think the virus was not

7318
02:06:13,589 --> 02:06:13,599
response i think the virus was not
 

7319
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:15,990
response i think the virus was not
sufficiently deadly and instead because

7320
02:06:15,990 --> 02:06:16,000
sufficiently deadly and instead because
 

7321
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,390
sufficiently deadly and instead because
it wasn't very deadly what happened is

7322
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:18,400
it wasn't very deadly what happened is
 

7323
02:06:18,400 --> 02:06:20,790
it wasn't very deadly what happened is
uh the the current system started to

7324
02:06:20,790 --> 02:06:20,800
uh the the current system started to
 

7325
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:23,430
uh the the current system started to
politicize it the mask this is what i

7326
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:23,440
politicize it the mask this is what i
 

7327
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:25,910
politicize it the mask this is what i
realized with masks early on they were

7328
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:25,920
realized with masks early on they were
 

7329
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:26,709
realized with masks early on they were
not

7330
02:06:26,709 --> 02:06:26,719
not
 

7331
02:06:26,719 --> 02:06:29,430
not
very quickly became not as a solution

7332
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:29,440
very quickly became not as a solution
 

7333
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,350
very quickly became not as a solution
but they became a thing

7334
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:31,360
but they became a thing
 

7335
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,109
but they became a thing
that politicians used to divide the

7336
02:06:33,109 --> 02:06:33,119
that politicians used to divide the
 

7337
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:35,270
that politicians used to divide the
country so that that same thing is

7338
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:35,280
country so that that same thing is
 

7339
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,030
country so that that same thing is
happening with vaccines same thing so

7340
02:06:37,030 --> 02:06:37,040
happening with vaccines same thing so
 

7341
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:39,109
happening with vaccines same thing so
like nobody's really people weren't

7342
02:06:39,109 --> 02:06:39,119
like nobody's really people weren't
 

7343
02:06:39,119 --> 02:06:41,030
like nobody's really people weren't
talking about solutions to this problem

7344
02:06:41,030 --> 02:06:41,040
talking about solutions to this problem
 

7345
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:42,149
talking about solutions to this problem
because i don't think the problem was

7346
02:06:42,149 --> 02:06:42,159
because i don't think the problem was
 

7347
02:06:42,159 --> 02:06:44,069
because i don't think the problem was
bad enough when you talk about the world

7348
02:06:44,069 --> 02:06:44,079
bad enough when you talk about the world
 

7349
02:06:44,079 --> 02:06:46,790
bad enough when you talk about the world
the war i think what i think our lives

7350
02:06:46,790 --> 02:06:46,800
the war i think what i think our lives
 

7351
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,709
the war i think what i think our lives
are too comfortable

7352
02:06:48,709 --> 02:06:48,719
are too comfortable
 

7353
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:51,270
are too comfortable
i think in uh in the developed world

7354
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:51,280
i think in uh in the developed world
 

7355
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:52,790
i think in uh in the developed world
things are too good and we have not

7356
02:06:52,790 --> 02:06:52,800
things are too good and we have not
 

7357
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,870
things are too good and we have not
faced severe dangers

7358
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:54,880
faced severe dangers
 

7359
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:57,510
faced severe dangers
one the dangers the severe dangers

7360
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:57,520
one the dangers the severe dangers
 

7361
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:59,510
one the dangers the severe dangers
existential threats are faced that's

7362
02:06:59,510 --> 02:06:59,520
existential threats are faced that's
 

7363
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,990
existential threats are faced that's
when we step up on a small scale and a

7364
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:02,000
when we step up on a small scale and a
 

7365
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,589
when we step up on a small scale and a
large scale now i don't

7366
02:07:05,589 --> 02:07:05,599
large scale now i don't
 

7367
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:06,470
large scale now i don't
i

7368
02:07:06,470 --> 02:07:06,480
i
 

7369
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:08,629
i
that's sort of my argument here but i

7370
02:07:08,629 --> 02:07:08,639
that's sort of my argument here but i
 

7371
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:10,870
that's sort of my argument here but i
did think the virus is

7372
02:07:10,870 --> 02:07:10,880
did think the virus is
 

7373
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:12,310
did think the virus is
i was hoping that it was actually

7374
02:07:12,310 --> 02:07:12,320
i was hoping that it was actually
 

7375
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:13,510
i was hoping that it was actually
sufficiently

7376
02:07:13,510 --> 02:07:13,520
sufficiently
 

7377
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:15,990
sufficiently
uh dangerous

7378
02:07:15,990 --> 02:07:16,000
uh dangerous
 

7379
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,830
uh dangerous
for us to step up because especially in

7380
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:17,840
for us to step up because especially in
 

7381
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,149
for us to step up because especially in
the early days it was unclear it still

7382
02:07:20,149 --> 02:07:20,159
the early days it was unclear it still
 

7383
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:23,270
the early days it was unclear it still
is unclear because of mutations

7384
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:23,280
is unclear because of mutations
 

7385
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,109
is unclear because of mutations
how bad it might be

7386
02:07:25,109 --> 02:07:25,119
how bad it might be
 

7387
02:07:25,119 --> 02:07:26,629
how bad it might be
right and so

7388
02:07:26,629 --> 02:07:26,639
right and so
 

7389
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:30,149
right and so
i thought we would step up and

7390
02:07:30,149 --> 02:07:30,159
i thought we would step up and
 

7391
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:33,510
i thought we would step up and
even so the masks point is is uh it's a

7392
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:33,520
even so the masks point is is uh it's a
 

7393
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:34,950
even so the masks point is is uh it's a
tricky one because

7394
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:34,960
tricky one because
 

7395
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:37,350
tricky one because
to me the manufacturer of masks isn't

7396
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:37,360
to me the manufacturer of masks isn't
 

7397
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:39,589
to me the manufacturer of masks isn't
isn't even the problem i'm still to this

7398
02:07:39,589 --> 02:07:39,599
isn't even the problem i'm still to this
 

7399
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:41,750
isn't even the problem i'm still to this
day and i was involved with with a bunch

7400
02:07:41,750 --> 02:07:41,760
day and i was involved with with a bunch
 

7401
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,990
day and i was involved with with a bunch
of this work have not seen good signs

7402
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:44,000
of this work have not seen good signs
 

7403
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,790
of this work have not seen good signs
done on whether masks work or not

7404
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:46,800
done on whether masks work or not
 

7405
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,149
done on whether masks work or not
like there still has not been a

7406
02:07:48,149 --> 02:07:48,159
like there still has not been a
 

7407
02:07:48,159 --> 02:07:50,390
like there still has not been a
large-scale study to me that should be

7408
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:50,400
large-scale study to me that should be
 

7409
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:51,990
large-scale study to me that should be
there should be large-scale studies and

7410
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:52,000
there should be large-scale studies and
 

7411
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,030
there should be large-scale studies and
every possible solution like aggressive

7412
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:55,040
every possible solution like aggressive
 

7413
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:56,310
every possible solution like aggressive
in the same way that the vaccine

7414
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:56,320
in the same way that the vaccine
 

7415
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:57,990
in the same way that the vaccine
development was aggressive there should

7416
02:07:57,990 --> 02:07:58,000
development was aggressive there should
 

7417
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:58,709
development was aggressive there should
be

7418
02:07:58,709 --> 02:07:58,719
be
 

7419
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:00,950
be
masks which test what kind of tests work

7420
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:00,960
masks which test what kind of tests work
 

7421
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:04,149
masks which test what kind of tests work
really well uh what kind of uh like even

7422
02:08:04,149 --> 02:08:04,159
really well uh what kind of uh like even
 

7423
02:08:04,159 --> 02:08:06,709
really well uh what kind of uh like even
the question of how the virus spreads

7424
02:08:06,709 --> 02:08:06,719
the question of how the virus spreads
 

7425
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:08,470
the question of how the virus spreads
there should be aggressive studies on

7426
02:08:08,470 --> 02:08:08,480
there should be aggressive studies on
 

7427
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:10,870
there should be aggressive studies on
that to understand i'm still

7428
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:10,880
that to understand i'm still
 

7429
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:12,550
that to understand i'm still
as far as far as i know there's still a

7430
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:12,560
as far as far as i know there's still a
 

7431
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:14,470
as far as far as i know there's still a
lot of uncertainty about that nobody

7432
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:14,480
lot of uncertainty about that nobody
 

7433
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:16,629
lot of uncertainty about that nobody
wants to see this as an engineering

7434
02:08:16,629 --> 02:08:16,639
wants to see this as an engineering
 

7435
02:08:16,639 --> 02:08:18,790
wants to see this as an engineering
problem that needs to be solved it's

7436
02:08:18,790 --> 02:08:18,800
problem that needs to be solved it's
 

7437
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:20,310
problem that needs to be solved it's
it's uh

7438
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:20,320
it's uh
 

7439
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,310
it's uh
that i was surprised about but i find

7440
02:08:22,310 --> 02:08:22,320
that i was surprised about but i find
 

7441
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,470
that i was surprised about but i find
that our views are largely convergent

7442
02:08:24,470 --> 02:08:24,480
that our views are largely convergent
 

7443
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:26,470
that our views are largely convergent
but not completely so i agree with the

7444
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:26,480
but not completely so i agree with the
 

7445
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:27,510
but not completely so i agree with the
thing that

7446
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:27,520
thing that
 

7447
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:29,990
thing that
uh because our society in some sense

7448
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:30,000
uh because our society in some sense
 

7449
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,550
uh because our society in some sense
perceives itself as too big to fail

7450
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:32,560
perceives itself as too big to fail
 

7451
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:35,030
perceives itself as too big to fail
right and uh the virus did not alert

7452
02:08:35,030 --> 02:08:35,040
right and uh the virus did not alert
 

7453
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,790
right and uh the virus did not alert
people to the fact that we are facing

7454
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:36,800
people to the fact that we are facing
 

7455
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:38,310
people to the fact that we are facing
possible failure

7456
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:38,320
possible failure
 

7457
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,390
possible failure
uh that basically put us into the

7458
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:40,400
uh that basically put us into the
 

7459
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:42,149
uh that basically put us into the
post-modernist mode and i don't mean in

7460
02:08:42,149 --> 02:08:42,159
post-modernist mode and i don't mean in
 

7461
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:44,149
post-modernist mode and i don't mean in
the philosophical sense but in a

7462
02:08:44,149 --> 02:08:44,159
the philosophical sense but in a
 

7463
02:08:44,159 --> 02:08:46,229
the philosophical sense but in a
societal sense the difference between a

7464
02:08:46,229 --> 02:08:46,239
societal sense the difference between a
 

7465
02:08:46,239 --> 02:08:48,470
societal sense the difference between a
post-modern society and the modern

7466
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:48,480
post-modern society and the modern
 

7467
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:50,470
post-modern society and the modern
society is that the modernist society

7468
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:50,480
society is that the modernist society
 

7469
02:08:50,480 --> 02:08:52,310
society is that the modernist society
has to deal with the ground truth and

7470
02:08:52,310 --> 02:08:52,320
has to deal with the ground truth and
 

7471
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:53,830
has to deal with the ground truth and
the postmodernist society has to deal

7472
02:08:53,830 --> 02:08:53,840
the postmodernist society has to deal
 

7473
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:55,510
the postmodernist society has to deal
with appearances

7474
02:08:55,510 --> 02:08:55,520
with appearances
 

7475
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:58,069
with appearances
politics becomes a performance and the

7476
02:08:58,069 --> 02:08:58,079
politics becomes a performance and the
 

7477
02:08:58,079 --> 02:08:59,830
politics becomes a performance and the
performance is done for an audience and

7478
02:08:59,830 --> 02:08:59,840
performance is done for an audience and
 

7479
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:02,390
performance is done for an audience and
the organized audience is the media and

7480
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:02,400
the organized audience is the media and
 

7481
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,709
the organized audience is the media and
the media evaluates itself via other

7482
02:09:04,709 --> 02:09:04,719
the media evaluates itself via other
 

7483
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:06,310
the media evaluates itself via other
media right so you have an audience of

02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:06,320
media right so you have an audience of
 

7485
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:09,270
media right so you have an audience of
critics that evaluate themselves and i

7486
02:09:09,270 --> 02:09:09,280
critics that evaluate themselves and i
 

7487
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:10,709
critics that evaluate themselves and i
don't think it's so much the failure of

7488
02:09:10,709 --> 02:09:10,719
don't think it's so much the failure of
 

7489

don't think it's so much the failure of
the politicians because to get in power

to deal with the published opinion well
i think it goes in cycles because the

7496
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:20,000
i think it goes in cycles because the
 

7497
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,510
i think it goes in cycles because the
what's going to happen

7498

will suffer more because the effects
of the closure of the economy and the

7506
02:09:32,229 --> 02:09:32,239
of the closure of the economy and the
 

7507
02:09:32,239 --> 02:09:34,229
of the closure of the economy and the
lack of solutions to the virus

7508
02:09:34,229 --> 02:09:34,239
lack of solutions to the virus
 

7509
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:37,910
lack of solutions to the virus
they're going to uprise and hopefully

7510
02:09:37,910 --> 02:09:37,920
they're going to uprise and hopefully
 

7511
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,750
they're going to uprise and hopefully
i mean this is this is where charismatic

leaders can get the the world in trouble
 

7515
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:44,790
leaders can get the the world in trouble
but hopefully we'll

7516
02:09:44,790 --> 02:09:44,800
but hopefully we'll
 

7517
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:48,149
but hopefully we'll
elect great leaders

that will break through this
 

7521
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:52,229
that will break through this
post-modernist idea of uh

7522
02:09:52,229 --> 02:09:52,239
post-modernist idea of uh
 

7523
02:09:52,239 --> 02:09:53,430
post-modernist idea of uh
of uh

7524
02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:53,440

02:10:01,990 --> 02:10:02,000
way yeah when the weimar republic was
 

7533
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,270
way yeah when the weimar republic was
unable to

02:10:03,270 --> 02:10:03,280
unable to
 

7535
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:05,669
unable to

germany was facing

7538
02:10:07,430 --> 02:10:07,440
germany was facing
 

7539
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:10,229
germany was facing
there was an option to go back

7540
02:10:10,229 --> 02:10:10,239
there was an option to go back
 

7541
02:10:10,239 --> 02:10:11,669
there was an option to go back
but there were people which thought

7542
02:10:11,669 --> 02:10:11,679
but there were people which thought
 

7543
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:13,830
but there were people which thought
let's get back to a constitutional

7544
02:10:13,830 --> 02:10:13,840
let's get back to a constitutional
 

7545
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:16,470
let's get back to a constitutional
monarchy and let's get this this to work

7546
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:16,480
monarchy and let's get this this to work
 

7547
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:18,790
monarchy and let's get this this to work
because democracy doesn't work

7548
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:18,800
because democracy doesn't work
 

7549
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:21,510
because democracy doesn't work
and eventually uh there was no way back

7550
02:10:21,510 --> 02:10:21,520
and eventually uh there was no way back
 

7551
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:23,030
and eventually uh there was no way back
where people decided there was no way

7552
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:23,040
where people decided there was no way
 

7553
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:25,109
where people decided there was no way
back they needed to go forward and the

7554
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:25,119
back they needed to go forward and the
 

7555
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:26,950
back they needed to go forward and the
only options for going forward was to

7556
02:10:26,950 --> 02:10:26,960
only options for going forward was to
 

7557
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:31,189
only options for going forward was to
become a stalinist communist basically

7558
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:31,199
become a stalinist communist basically
 

7559
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:34,229
become a stalinist communist basically
an option to completely expropriate

7560
02:10:34,229 --> 02:10:34,239
an option to completely expropriate
 

7561
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:36,550
an option to completely expropriate
the factories and so on and nationalize

7562
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:36,560
the factories and so on and nationalize
 

7563
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:38,870
the factories and so on and nationalize
them and to reorganize

7564
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:38,880
them and to reorganize
 

7565
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:41,270
them and to reorganize
germany and communist terms and ally

7566
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:41,280
germany and communist terms and ally
 

7567
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,109
germany and communist terms and ally
itself with stalin

7568
02:10:43,109 --> 02:10:43,119
itself with stalin
 

7569
02:10:43,119 --> 02:10:45,910
itself with stalin
and fascism and both options were

7570
02:10:45,910 --> 02:10:45,920
and fascism and both options were
 

7571
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:47,990
and fascism and both options were
obviously very bad

7572
02:10:47,990 --> 02:10:48,000
obviously very bad
 

7573
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,229
obviously very bad
and the one that the germans picked led

7574
02:10:50,229 --> 02:10:50,239
and the one that the germans picked led
 

7575
02:10:50,239 --> 02:10:52,229
and the one that the germans picked led
to a catastrophe that was

7576
02:10:52,229 --> 02:10:52,239
to a catastrophe that was
 

7577
02:10:52,239 --> 02:10:54,310
to a catastrophe that was
that devastated europe

7578
02:10:54,310 --> 02:10:54,320
that devastated europe
 

7579
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:56,709
that devastated europe
and i'm not sure if the us has an immune

7580
02:10:56,709 --> 02:10:56,719
and i'm not sure if the us has an immune
 

7581
02:10:56,719 --> 02:10:59,189
and i'm not sure if the us has an immune
response against that i think that the

7582
02:10:59,189 --> 02:10:59,199
response against that i think that the
 

7583
02:10:59,199 --> 02:11:00,950
response against that i think that the
far right is currently very weak in the

7584
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:00,960
far right is currently very weak in the
 

7585
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:05,750
far right is currently very weak in the
u.s but this can easily change

7586
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:05,760

 

7587
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,350

do you think uh

7588
02:11:07,350 --> 02:11:07,360
do you think uh
 

7589
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:09,030
do you think uh
from a historical perspective hitler

7590
02:11:09,030 --> 02:11:09,040
from a historical perspective hitler
 

7591
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:10,790
from a historical perspective hitler
could have been stopped

7592
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:10,800
could have been stopped
 

7593
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:13,990
could have been stopped
from within germany or or from outside

7594
02:11:13,990 --> 02:11:14,000
from within germany or or from outside
 

7595
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,990
from within germany or or from outside
or this

7596
02:11:15,990 --> 02:11:16,000
or this
 

7597
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,750
or this
well depends on who you want to focus

7598
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:17,760
well depends on who you want to focus
 

7599
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:19,589
well depends on who you want to focus
whether you want to focus on stalin or

7600
02:11:19,589 --> 02:11:19,599
whether you want to focus on stalin or
 

7601
02:11:19,599 --> 02:11:21,350
whether you want to focus on stalin or
hitler but he feels like hitler was the

7602
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:21,360
hitler but he feels like hitler was the
 

7603
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:22,310
hitler but he feels like hitler was the
one

7604
02:11:22,310 --> 02:11:22,320
one
 

7605
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:23,669
one
as a political movement that could have

7606
02:11:23,669 --> 02:11:23,679
as a political movement that could have
 

7607
02:11:23,679 --> 02:11:25,109
as a political movement that could have
been stopped

7608
02:11:25,109 --> 02:11:25,119
been stopped
 

7609
02:11:25,119 --> 02:11:26,709
been stopped
i think that uh

7610
02:11:26,709 --> 02:11:26,719
i think that uh
 

7611
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:28,629
i think that uh
the point was that a lot of people

7612
02:11:28,629 --> 02:11:28,639
the point was that a lot of people
 

7613
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:31,109
the point was that a lot of people
wanted hitler so he got support from a

7614
02:11:31,109 --> 02:11:31,119
wanted hitler so he got support from a
 

7615
02:11:31,119 --> 02:11:33,030
wanted hitler so he got support from a
lot of quarters it was a number of

7616
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:33,040
lot of quarters it was a number of
 

7617
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:35,430
lot of quarters it was a number of
industrialists who supported him because

7618
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:35,440
industrialists who supported him because
 

7619
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:36,870
industrialists who supported him because
they thought that the democracy is

7620
02:11:36,870 --> 02:11:36,880
they thought that the democracy is
 

7621
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:38,629
they thought that the democracy is
obviously not working and unstable and

7622
02:11:38,629 --> 02:11:38,639
obviously not working and unstable and
 

7623
02:11:38,639 --> 02:11:40,550
obviously not working and unstable and
you need a strong man

7624
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:40,560
you need a strong man
 

7625
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:43,109
you need a strong man
and he was willing to play that part

7626
02:11:43,109 --> 02:11:43,119
and he was willing to play that part
 

7627
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:45,109
and he was willing to play that part
there were also people in the us who

7628
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:45,119
there were also people in the us who
 

7629
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:47,910
there were also people in the us who
thought that hitler would stop uh stalin

7630
02:11:47,910 --> 02:11:47,920
thought that hitler would stop uh stalin
 

7631
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:50,550
thought that hitler would stop uh stalin
and would act as a balrack against

7632
02:11:50,550 --> 02:11:50,560
and would act as a balrack against
 

7633
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:52,310
and would act as a balrack against
bolshevism

7634
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:52,320
bolshevism
 

7635
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,149
bolshevism
which he probably would have done right

7636
02:11:54,149 --> 02:11:54,159
which he probably would have done right
 

7637
02:11:54,159 --> 02:11:56,149
which he probably would have done right
but uh at which cost

7638
02:11:56,149 --> 02:11:56,159
but uh at which cost
 

7639
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:58,950
but uh at which cost
and then many of the things that he was

7640
02:11:58,950 --> 02:11:58,960
and then many of the things that he was
 

7641
02:11:58,960 --> 02:12:01,589
and then many of the things that he was
going to do like the holocaust

7642
02:12:01,589 --> 02:12:01,599
going to do like the holocaust
 

7643
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:02,550
going to do like the holocaust
was

7644
02:12:02,550 --> 02:12:02,560
was
 

7645
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,069
was
something where people thought this is

7646
02:12:04,069 --> 02:12:04,079
something where people thought this is
 

7647
02:12:04,079 --> 02:12:05,990
something where people thought this is
rhetoric he's not actually going to do

7648
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,000
rhetoric he's not actually going to do
 

7649
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,550
rhetoric he's not actually going to do
this right especially many of the jews

7650
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:08,560
this right especially many of the jews
 

7651
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:10,390
this right especially many of the jews
themselves which were humanist and for

7652
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:10,400
themselves which were humanist and for
 

7653
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,390
themselves which were humanist and for
them this was outside of the scope that

7654
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:12,400
them this was outside of the scope that
 

7655
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,149
them this was outside of the scope that
was thinkable right

7656
02:12:14,149 --> 02:12:14,159
was thinkable right
 

7657
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:16,149
was thinkable right
i mean i i i wonder

7658
02:12:16,149 --> 02:12:16,159
i mean i i i wonder
 

7659
02:12:16,159 --> 02:12:19,589
i mean i i i wonder
if hitler is uniquely

7660
02:12:19,589 --> 02:12:19,599
if hitler is uniquely
 

7661
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:21,990
if hitler is uniquely
i i want to carefully use this term but

7662
02:12:21,990 --> 02:12:22,000
i i want to carefully use this term but
 

7663
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:23,510
i i want to carefully use this term but
uniquely evil

7664
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:23,520
uniquely evil
 

7665
02:12:23,520 --> 02:12:26,310
uniquely evil
so if hitler was never born

7666
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:26,320
so if hitler was never born
 

7667
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:28,069
so if hitler was never born
if somebody else would come in this

7668
02:12:28,069 --> 02:12:28,079
if somebody else would come in this
 

7669
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:29,030
if somebody else would come in this
place

7670
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:29,040
place
 

7671
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,310
place
so like

7672
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:30,320
so like
 

7673
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:31,109
so like
just

7674
02:12:31,109 --> 02:12:31,119
just
 

7675
02:12:31,119 --> 02:12:33,750
just
thinking about the progress of history

7676
02:12:33,750 --> 02:12:33,760
thinking about the progress of history
 

7677
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:36,629
thinking about the progress of history
how important are those singular figures

7678
02:12:36,629 --> 02:12:36,639
how important are those singular figures
 

7679
02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:37,430
how important are those singular figures
that

7680
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:37,440
that
 

7681
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:39,510
that
that lead to mass destruction and

7682
02:12:39,510 --> 02:12:39,520
that lead to mass destruction and
 

7683
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:40,950
that lead to mass destruction and
cruelty

7684
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:40,960
cruelty
 

7685
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:41,910
cruelty
because

7686
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:41,920
because
 

7687
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:43,830
because
my senses

7688
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:43,840
my senses
 

7689
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:46,470

hitler was unique

7690
02:12:46,470 --> 02:12:46,480
hitler was unique
 

7691
02:12:46,480 --> 02:12:47,510
hitler was unique
the

7692
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:47,520
the
 

7693
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:49,430
the
it wasn't just about the environment and

7694
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:49,440
it wasn't just about the environment and
 

7695
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,589
it wasn't just about the environment and
the context that gave him

7696
02:12:51,589 --> 02:12:51,599
the context that gave him
 

7697
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:52,470
the context that gave him
like

7698
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:52,480
like
 

7699
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,069
like
like another person would not come in

7700
02:12:54,069 --> 02:12:54,079
like another person would not come in
 

7701
02:12:54,079 --> 02:12:56,790
like another person would not come in
his place to do as destructive of the

7702
02:12:56,790 --> 02:12:56,800
his place to do as destructive of the
 

7703
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,229
his place to do as destructive of the
things that he did

7704
02:12:58,229 --> 02:12:58,239
things that he did
 

7705
02:12:58,239 --> 02:13:01,589
things that he did
there was a combination of uh charisma

7706
02:13:01,589 --> 02:13:01,599
there was a combination of uh charisma
 

7707
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:06,149
there was a combination of uh charisma
of madness of psychopathy of just uh ego

7708
02:13:06,149 --> 02:13:06,159
of madness of psychopathy of just uh ego
 

7709
02:13:06,159 --> 02:13:08,229
of madness of psychopathy of just uh ego
all those things which are very unlikely

7710
02:13:08,229 --> 02:13:08,239
all those things which are very unlikely
 

7711
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:10,870
all those things which are very unlikely
to come together in one person in the

7712
02:13:10,870 --> 02:13:10,880
to come together in one person in the
 

7713
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:12,390
to come together in one person in the
right time

7714
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:12,400
right time
 

7715
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:14,149
right time
it also depends on the context of the

7716
02:13:14,149 --> 02:13:14,159
it also depends on the context of the
 

7717
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:16,390
it also depends on the context of the
country that you're operating in

7718
02:13:16,390 --> 02:13:16,400
country that you're operating in
 

7719
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:19,430
country that you're operating in
if you uh tell the germans that they

7720
02:13:19,430 --> 02:13:19,440
if you uh tell the germans that they
 

7721
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:22,470
if you uh tell the germans that they
have a historical destiny uh

7722
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:22,480
have a historical destiny uh
 

7723
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:24,709
have a historical destiny uh
in this romantic country the effect is

7724
02:13:24,709 --> 02:13:24,719
in this romantic country the effect is
 

7725
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:26,149
in this romantic country the effect is
probably different than it is in other

7726
02:13:26,149 --> 02:13:26,159
probably different than it is in other
 

7727
02:13:26,159 --> 02:13:27,109
probably different than it is in other

countries
 

7729
02:13:27,119 --> 02:13:29,510
countries
but uh the uh

7730
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:29,520
but uh the uh

stalin has killed a few more people than
 

7733
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:35,030
stalin has killed a few more people than
hitler did and if you look at the

7734
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:35,040
hitler did and if you look at the
 

7735
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:36,790
hitler did and if you look at the

02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:05,360
he saw them as
 

7761
02:14:05,360 --> 02:14:06,069
he saw them as
a

7762
02:14:06,069 --> 02:14:06,079
a
 

7763
02:14:06,079 --> 02:14:07,750
a
harmful danger especially since they

7764
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:07,760
harmful danger especially since they
 

7765
02:14:07,760 --> 02:14:10,950
harmful danger especially since they
played such an important role in the

7766
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:10,960
played such an important role in the
 

7767
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:13,270
played such an important role in the
economy and culture of germany

7768
02:14:13,270 --> 02:14:13,280
economy and culture of germany
 

7769
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,270
economy and culture of germany
and uh

7770
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:15,280
and uh
 

7771
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:17,910
and uh
it so we had basically had some radical

7772
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:17,920
it so we had basically had some radical
 

7773
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:20,709
it so we had basically had some radical
but rational reason to murder them

7774
02:14:20,709 --> 02:14:20,719
but rational reason to murder them
 

7775
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:23,350
but rational reason to murder them
and stalin just killed everyone

7776
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:23,360
and stalin just killed everyone
 

7777
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:25,030
and stalin just killed everyone
basically the stalinist purchase were

7778
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:25,040
basically the stalinist purchase were
 

7779
02:14:25,040 --> 02:14:26,629
basically the stalinist purchase were
such a random thing where he said that

7780
02:14:26,629 --> 02:14:26,639
such a random thing where he said that
 

7781
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:30,470
such a random thing where he said that
there's a

7782
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,480

 

7783
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:32,470

certain possibility that this particular

7784
02:14:32,470 --> 02:14:32,480
certain possibility that this particular
 

7785
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:35,189
certain possibility that this particular
part of the population has a number of

7786
02:14:35,189 --> 02:14:35,199
part of the population has a number of
 

7787
02:14:35,199 --> 02:14:36,870
part of the population has a number of
german collaborators or something and we

7788
02:14:36,870 --> 02:14:36,880
german collaborators or something and we
 

7789
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:39,030
german collaborators or something and we
just kill them all yeah right well if

7790
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:39,040
just kill them all yeah right well if
 

7791
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:41,270
just kill them all yeah right well if
you look at what mao did the number of

7792
02:14:41,270 --> 02:14:41,280
you look at what mao did the number of
 

7793
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:43,430
you look at what mao did the number of
uh people that were killed absolute in

7794
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:43,440
uh people that were killed absolute in
 

7795
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:45,030
uh people that were killed absolute in
absolute numbers were much higher under

7796
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:45,040
absolute numbers were much higher under
 

7797
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,589
absolute numbers were much higher under
mao that they were under stalin

7798
02:14:47,589 --> 02:14:47,599
mao that they were under stalin
 

7799
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:50,390
mao that they were under stalin
so it's super hard to say the the the

7800
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:50,400
so it's super hard to say the the the
 

7801
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,550
so it's super hard to say the the the
other thing is that you look at jinga's

7802
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:52,560
other thing is that you look at jinga's
 

7803
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:56,310
other thing is that you look at jinga's
khan and so on how many people he killed

7804
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:56,320
khan and so on how many people he killed
 

7805
02:14:56,320 --> 02:14:58,390
khan and so on how many people he killed
where do you see there are a number of

7806
02:14:58,390 --> 02:14:58,400
where do you see there are a number of
 

7807
02:14:58,400 --> 02:14:59,830
where do you see there are a number of
of things that happen in human history

7808
02:14:59,830 --> 02:14:59,840
of things that happen in human history
 

7809
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:02,069
of things that happen in human history
that actually really put a substantial

7810
02:15:02,069 --> 02:15:02,079
that actually really put a substantial
 

7811
02:15:02,079 --> 02:15:04,149
that actually really put a substantial
dent in the existing population or

7812
02:15:04,149 --> 02:15:04,159
dent in the existing population or
 

7813
02:15:04,159 --> 02:15:05,830
dent in the existing population or
napoleon

7814
02:15:05,830 --> 02:15:05,840
napoleon
 

7815
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:06,950
napoleon
and

7816
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:06,960
and
 

7817
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:09,030
and
it's it's very difficult to eventually

7818
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:09,040
it's it's very difficult to eventually
 

7819
02:15:09,040 --> 02:15:10,550
it's it's very difficult to eventually
measure it because what's happening is

7820
02:15:10,550 --> 02:15:10,560
measure it because what's happening is
 

7821
02:15:10,560 --> 02:15:12,310
measure it because what's happening is
basically evolution

7822
02:15:12,310 --> 02:15:12,320
basically evolution
 

7823
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,870
basically evolution
uh on a human scale

7824
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:14,880
uh on a human scale
 

7825
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,669
uh on a human scale
where uh one monkey figures out a way to

7826
02:15:17,669 --> 02:15:17,679
where uh one monkey figures out a way to
 

7827
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:19,270
where uh one monkey figures out a way to
become viral

7828
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:19,280
become viral
 

7829
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:20,870
become viral
and uh is

7830
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:20,880
and uh is
 

7831
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:23,030
and uh is
using this viral technology to change

7832
02:15:23,030 --> 02:15:23,040
using this viral technology to change
 

7833
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:25,270
using this viral technology to change
the patterns of society at the very very

7834
02:15:25,270 --> 02:15:25,280
the patterns of society at the very very
 

7835
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:26,470
the patterns of society at the very very
large scale

7836
02:15:26,470 --> 02:15:26,480
large scale
 

7837
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:29,109
large scale
and what we find so abhorrent about

7838
02:15:29,109 --> 02:15:29,119
and what we find so abhorrent about
 

7839
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:31,270
and what we find so abhorrent about
these changes is the complexity that is

7840
02:15:31,270 --> 02:15:31,280
these changes is the complexity that is
 

7841
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:32,550
these changes is the complexity that is
being destroyed by this that it's

7842
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:32,560
being destroyed by this that it's
 

7843
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:34,870
being destroyed by this that it's
basically like a big fire that burns out

7844
02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:34,880
basically like a big fire that burns out
 

7845
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,310
basically like a big fire that burns out
a lot of the existing culture and

7846
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:36,320
a lot of the existing culture and
 

7847
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:39,109
a lot of the existing culture and
structure that existed before

7848
02:15:39,109 --> 02:15:39,119
structure that existed before
 

7849
02:15:39,119 --> 02:15:41,189
structure that existed before
yeah and it all just starts with one

7850
02:15:41,189 --> 02:15:41,199
yeah and it all just starts with one
 

7851
02:15:41,199 --> 02:15:42,550
yeah and it all just starts with one
monkey

7852
02:15:42,550 --> 02:15:42,560
monkey
 

7853
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:44,790
monkey
one one cares mata gabe and there's a

7854
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:44,800
one one cares mata gabe and there's a
 

7855
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:46,229
one one cares mata gabe and there's a
bunch of them throughout history yeah

7856
02:15:46,229 --> 02:15:46,239
bunch of them throughout history yeah
 

7857
02:15:46,239 --> 02:15:48,149
bunch of them throughout history yeah
but it's in a given environment it's

7858
02:15:48,149 --> 02:15:48,159
but it's in a given environment it's
 

7859
02:15:48,159 --> 02:15:50,229
but it's in a given environment it's
basically similar to wildfires in

7860
02:15:50,229 --> 02:15:50,239
basically similar to wildfires in
 

7861
02:15:50,239 --> 02:15:51,830
basically similar to wildfires in
california right the temperature is

7862
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:51,840
california right the temperature is
 

7863
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:53,189
california right the temperature is
rising

7864
02:15:53,189 --> 02:15:53,199
rising
 

7865
02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:55,430
rising
there is less rain falling

7866
02:15:55,430 --> 02:15:55,440
there is less rain falling
 

7867
02:15:55,440 --> 02:15:57,109
there is less rain falling
and then certainly a single spark can

7868
02:15:57,109 --> 02:15:57,119
and then certainly a single spark can
 

7869
02:15:57,119 --> 02:15:58,790
and then certainly a single spark can
have an effect that in other times would

7870
02:15:58,790 --> 02:15:58,800
have an effect that in other times would
 

7871
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,709
have an effect that in other times would
be contained

7872
02:16:00,709 --> 02:16:00,719
be contained
 

7873
02:16:00,719 --> 02:16:02,229
be contained
okay

7874
02:16:02,229 --> 02:16:02,239
okay
 

7875
02:16:02,239 --> 02:16:04,550
okay
speaking of which i i love when we went

7876
02:16:04,550 --> 02:16:04,560
speaking of which i i love when we went
 

7877
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:07,750
speaking of which i i love when we went
to hitler and stalin from 20 30 minutes

7878
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:07,760
to hitler and stalin from 20 30 minutes
 

7879
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:11,910
to hitler and stalin from 20 30 minutes
ago uh gpt 3 generating

7880
02:16:11,910 --> 02:16:11,920
ago uh gpt 3 generating
 

7881
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:15,109
ago uh gpt 3 generating
doing program synthesis the argument was

7882
02:16:15,109 --> 02:16:15,119
doing program synthesis the argument was
 

7883
02:16:15,119 --> 02:16:19,669
doing program synthesis the argument was
about morality of ai versus human

7884
02:16:19,669 --> 02:16:19,679
about morality of ai versus human
 

7885
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:21,109
about morality of ai versus human
so

7886
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:21,119
so
 

7887
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:23,510
so
um

7888
02:16:23,510 --> 02:16:23,520

 

7889
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:25,270

7899
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:35,030

7900
02:16:35,030 --> 02:16:35,040
example
 

7901
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:37,030
example
and i think

7902
02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:37,040
and i think
 

7903
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:39,750
and i think
your inclination was to say that it's

7904
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:39,760
your inclination was to say that it's
 

7905
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:41,830
your inclination was to say that it's
not so obvious that ai would be less

7906
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:41,840
not so obvious that ai would be less
 

7907
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:43,349
not so obvious that ai would be less
moral than humans

7908
02:16:43,349 --> 02:16:43,359
moral than humans
 

7909
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:46,549
moral than humans
or less effective at making a a world

7910
02:16:46,549 --> 02:16:46,559
or less effective at making a a world
 

7911
02:16:46,559 --> 02:16:49,509
or less effective at making a a world
that would make humans happy so i i'm

7912
02:16:49,509 --> 02:16:49,519
that would make humans happy so i i'm
 

7913
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:52,549
that would make humans happy so i i'm
not talking about self-directed systems

7914
02:16:52,549 --> 02:16:52,559
not talking about self-directed systems
 

7915
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:54,469
not talking about self-directed systems
that are

7916
02:16:54,469 --> 02:16:54,479
that are
 

7917
02:16:54,479 --> 02:16:57,190
that are
making their own goals at a global scale

7918
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:57,200
making their own goals at a global scale
 

7919
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:59,110
making their own goals at a global scale
if you just talk about the deployment of

02:16:59,110 --> 02:16:59,120
if you just talk about the deployment of
 

7921
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:02,709
if you just talk about the deployment of

technological systems that are able to
see order and patterns and use this as

7924
02:17:04,629 --> 02:17:04,639
see order and patterns and use this as
 

7925
02:17:04,639 --> 02:17:06,870
see order and patterns and use this as
control models to act on the goals that

7926
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:06,880
control models to act on the goals that
 

7927
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,309
control models to act on the goals that
we give them

7928
02:17:08,309 --> 02:17:08,319
we give them
 

7929
02:17:08,319 --> 02:17:10,950
we give them
then if we have the correct incentives

7930
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:10,960
then if we have the correct incentives
 

7931
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:12,629
then if we have the correct incentives
to set the correct incentives for these

7932
02:17:12,629 --> 02:17:12,639
to set the correct incentives for these
 

7933
02:17:12,639 --> 02:17:15,110
to set the correct incentives for these
systems i'm quite optimistic

7934
02:17:15,110 --> 02:17:15,120
systems i'm quite optimistic
 

7935
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:15,990
systems i'm quite optimistic
so but

7936
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,000
so but
 

7937
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,389
so but
so humans versus ai let me give you an

7938
02:17:18,389 --> 02:17:18,399
so humans versus ai let me give you an
 

7939
02:17:18,399 --> 02:17:20,549
so humans versus ai let me give you an
example

7940
02:17:20,549 --> 02:17:20,559
example
 

7941
02:17:20,559 --> 02:17:23,910
example
autonomous weapon system

7942
02:17:23,910 --> 02:17:23,920

 

7943
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:25,669

let's say there's a city somewhere in

7944
02:17:25,669 --> 02:17:25,679
let's say there's a city somewhere in
 

7945
02:17:25,679 --> 02:17:26,870
let's say there's a city somewhere in
the middle east

7946
02:17:26,870 --> 02:17:26,880
the middle east
 

7947
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:30,389
the middle east
that has a number of terrorists

7948
02:17:30,389 --> 02:17:30,399
that has a number of terrorists
 

7949
02:17:30,399 --> 02:17:32,790
that has a number of terrorists
and the question is what's currently

7950
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:32,800
and the question is what's currently
 

7951
02:17:32,800 --> 02:17:35,110
and the question is what's currently
done with with drone technologies you

7952
02:17:35,110 --> 02:17:35,120
done with with drone technologies you
 

7953
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:37,190
done with with drone technologies you
have information about the location of a

7954
02:17:37,190 --> 02:17:37,200
have information about the location of a
 

7955
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,589
have information about the location of a
particular terrorist and you have a

7956
02:17:39,589 --> 02:17:39,599
particular terrorist and you have a
 

7957
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:41,349
particular terrorist and you have a
targeted attack you have a bombing of

7958
02:17:41,349 --> 02:17:41,359
targeted attack you have a bombing of
 

7959
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:43,910
targeted attack you have a bombing of
that particular building

7960
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:43,920
that particular building
 

7961
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:46,070
that particular building
and that's all directed by humans at the

7962
02:17:46,070 --> 02:17:46,080
and that's all directed by humans at the
 

7963
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:48,549
and that's all directed by humans at the
high level strategy and also at the

7964
02:17:48,549 --> 02:17:48,559
high level strategy and also at the
 

7965
02:17:48,559 --> 02:17:50,070
high level strategy and also at the
deployment of individual bombs and

7966
02:17:50,070 --> 02:17:50,080
deployment of individual bombs and
 

7967
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:52,549
deployment of individual bombs and
missiles like that the actual

7968
02:17:52,549 --> 02:17:52,559
missiles like that the actual
 

7969
02:17:52,559 --> 02:17:55,030
missiles like that the actual
everything is done by human except the

7970
02:17:55,030 --> 02:17:55,040
everything is done by human except the
 

7971
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:56,709
everything is done by human except the
the final targeting

7972
02:17:56,709 --> 02:17:56,719
the final targeting
 

7973
02:17:56,719 --> 02:17:58,629
the final targeting
and the the like the country so like

7974
02:17:58,629 --> 02:17:58,639
and the the like the country so like
 

7975
02:17:58,639 --> 02:18:00,950
and the the like the country so like
with spot similar thing like control the

7976
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:00,960
with spot similar thing like control the
 

7977
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:01,830
with spot similar thing like control the
flight

7978
02:18:01,830 --> 02:18:01,840
flight
 

7979
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:02,709
flight
okay

7980
02:18:02,709 --> 02:18:02,719
okay
 

7981
02:18:02,719 --> 02:18:07,030
okay
what if you give ai control and saying

7982
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:07,040
what if you give ai control and saying
 

7983
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:10,709
what if you give ai control and saying
um write a program that says here's the

7984
02:18:10,709 --> 02:18:10,719
um write a program that says here's the
 

7985
02:18:10,719 --> 02:18:12,309
um write a program that says here's the
best information i have available about

7986
02:18:12,309 --> 02:18:12,319
best information i have available about
 

7987
02:18:12,319 --> 02:18:14,790
best information i have available about
the location of these five terrorists

7988
02:18:14,790 --> 02:18:14,800
the location of these five terrorists
 

7989
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,950
the location of these five terrorists
here's the city make sure it's cons all

7990
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:16,960
here's the city make sure it's cons all
 

7991
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,629
here's the city make sure it's cons all
the bombing you do is constrained to the

7992
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:18,639
the bombing you do is constrained to the
 

7993
02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:21,750
the bombing you do is constrained to the
city make sure it's precision based

7994
02:18:21,750 --> 02:18:21,760
city make sure it's precision based
 

7995
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:24,150
city make sure it's precision based
but you take care of it so you do one

7996
02:18:24,150 --> 02:18:24,160
but you take care of it so you do one
 

7997
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:26,709
but you take care of it so you do one
level of abstraction out and saying

7998
02:18:26,709 --> 02:18:26,719
level of abstraction out and saying
 

7999
02:18:26,719 --> 02:18:29,669
level of abstraction out and saying
take care of the terrorists in the city

8000
02:18:29,669 --> 02:18:29,679
take care of the terrorists in the city
 

8001
02:18:29,679 --> 02:18:31,589
take care of the terrorists in the city
which are you more comfortable with the

8002
02:18:31,589 --> 02:18:31,599
which are you more comfortable with the
 

8003
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:32,709
which are you more comfortable with the

or the javascript gpt-3 generated code

8006
02:18:35,589 --> 02:18:35,599
or the javascript gpt-3 generated code
 

8007
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:37,270
or the javascript gpt-3 generated code
that's doing the

8008
02:18:37,270 --> 02:18:37,280
that's doing the
 

8009
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:39,910
that's doing the

kind of
 

8013
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:43,750
kind of
question i'm asking is

02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:43,760
question i'm asking is
 

8015
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:46,389
question i'm asking is
the kind of bugs that we see in human

8016
02:18:46,389 --> 02:18:46,399
the kind of bugs that we see in human
 

8017
02:18:46,399 --> 02:18:48,549
the kind of bugs that we see in human
nature are they better or worse than the

8018
02:18:48,549 --> 02:18:48,559
nature are they better or worse than the
 

8019
02:18:48,559 --> 02:18:51,110
nature are they better or worse than the
kind of bugs we see in ai

8020
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:51,120
kind of bugs we see in ai
 

8021
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:53,669
kind of bugs we see in ai
they're different bugs there is an issue

8022
02:18:53,669 --> 02:18:53,679
they're different bugs there is an issue
 

8023
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:55,429
they're different bugs there is an issue
that if people are

8024
02:18:55,429 --> 02:18:55,439
that if people are
 

8025
02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:58,870
that if people are
creating an in imperfect automation

8026
02:18:58,870 --> 02:18:58,880
creating an in imperfect automation
 

8027
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,429
creating an in imperfect automation
of a process that normally requires a

8028
02:19:01,429 --> 02:19:01,439
of a process that normally requires a
 

8029
02:19:01,439 --> 02:19:02,790
of a process that normally requires a
moral judgment

8030
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:02,800
moral judgment
 

8031
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:05,429
moral judgment
and this mobile judgment is

8032
02:19:05,429 --> 02:19:05,439
and this mobile judgment is
 

8033
02:19:05,439 --> 02:19:07,110
and this mobile judgment is
the reason why it cannot be automated

8034
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:07,120
the reason why it cannot be automated
 

8035
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:10,070
the reason why it cannot be automated
often is not because the

8036
02:19:10,070 --> 02:19:10,080
often is not because the
 

8037
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:12,070
often is not because the
computation is too expensive

8038
02:19:12,070 --> 02:19:12,080
computation is too expensive
 

8039
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:13,750
computation is too expensive
but because the model that you give the

8040
02:19:13,750 --> 02:19:13,760
but because the model that you give the
 

8041
02:19:13,760 --> 02:19:16,309
but because the model that you give the
ai is not an adequate model of the

8042
02:19:16,309 --> 02:19:16,319
ai is not an adequate model of the
 

8043
02:19:16,319 --> 02:19:18,230
ai is not an adequate model of the
dynamics of the world because the ai

8044
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:18,240
dynamics of the world because the ai
 

8045
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:19,910
dynamics of the world because the ai
does not understand the context that

8046
02:19:19,910 --> 02:19:19,920
does not understand the context that
 

8047
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:21,990
does not understand the context that
it's operating in in the right way and

8048
02:19:21,990 --> 02:19:22,000
it's operating in in the right way and
 

8049
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,669
it's operating in in the right way and
this is something that already happens

8050
02:19:23,669 --> 02:19:23,679
this is something that already happens
 

8051
02:19:23,679 --> 02:19:25,830
this is something that already happens
with excel right you don't need to have

8052
02:19:25,830 --> 02:19:25,840
with excel right you don't need to have
 

8053
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,230
with excel right you don't need to have
an ai system to do this if you have an

8054
02:19:28,230 --> 02:19:28,240
an ai system to do this if you have an
 

8055
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:31,429
an ai system to do this if you have an
automated process in place where humans

8056
02:19:31,429 --> 02:19:31,439
automated process in place where humans
 

8057
02:19:31,439 --> 02:19:33,509
automated process in place where humans
decide using automated criteria whom to

8058
02:19:33,509 --> 02:19:33,519
decide using automated criteria whom to
 

8059
02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:34,870
decide using automated criteria whom to
kill when

8060
02:19:34,870 --> 02:19:34,880
kill when
 

8061
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:36,549
kill when
and whom to target when which already

8062
02:19:36,549 --> 02:19:36,559
and whom to target when which already
 

8063
02:19:36,559 --> 02:19:37,910
and whom to target when which already
happens

8064
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:37,920
happens
 

8065
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:39,750
happens
right and you have no way to get off the

8066
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:39,760
right and you have no way to get off the
 

8067
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:41,990
right and you have no way to get off the
kill list once that happens once you

8068
02:19:41,990 --> 02:19:42,000
kill list once that happens once you
 

8069
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,669
kill list once that happens once you
have been targeted according to some

8070
02:19:43,669 --> 02:19:43,679
have been targeted according to some
 

8071
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:45,910
have been targeted according to some
automatic criterion by people right in a

8072
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:45,920
automatic criterion by people right in a
 

8073
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:47,990
automatic criterion by people right in a
bureaucracy

8074
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:48,000
bureaucracy
 

8075
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:49,830
bureaucracy
that that is the issue the issue is it's

8076
02:19:49,830 --> 02:19:49,840
that that is the issue the issue is it's
 

8077
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:52,309
that that is the issue the issue is it's
not the ai it's the automation

8078
02:19:52,309 --> 02:19:52,319
not the ai it's the automation
 

8079
02:19:52,319 --> 02:19:53,190
not the ai it's the automation
so

8080
02:19:53,190 --> 02:19:53,200
so
 

8081
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:54,870
so
there's something about

8082
02:19:54,870 --> 02:19:54,880
there's something about
 

8083
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:56,710
there's something about
right it's automation but there's

8084
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,720
right it's automation but there's
 

8085
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,790
right it's automation but there's
something about the

8086
02:19:58,790 --> 02:19:58,800
something about the
 

8087
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:00,550
something about the
there's a certain level of abstraction

8088
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:00,560
there's a certain level of abstraction
 

8089
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:03,030
there's a certain level of abstraction
where you give control to ai to do the

8090
02:20:03,030 --> 02:20:03,040
where you give control to ai to do the
 

8091
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:04,469
where you give control to ai to do the
automation

8092
02:20:04,469 --> 02:20:04,479
automation
 

8093
02:20:04,479 --> 02:20:05,670
automation
there's a

8094
02:20:05,670 --> 02:20:05,680
there's a
 

8095
02:20:05,680 --> 02:20:07,910
there's a
scale that can be achieved that it feels

8096
02:20:07,910 --> 02:20:07,920
scale that can be achieved that it feels
 

8097
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:10,710
scale that can be achieved that it feels
like the scale of bug and scale mistake

8098
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:10,720
like the scale of bug and scale mistake
 

8099
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:12,309
like the scale of bug and scale mistake
and scale of destruction that can be

8100
02:20:12,309 --> 02:20:12,319
and scale of destruction that can be
 

8101
02:20:12,319 --> 02:20:14,550
and scale of destruction that can be
achieved

8102
02:20:14,550 --> 02:20:14,560
achieved
 

8103
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:16,870
achieved
of the kind that humans cannot achieve

8104
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:16,880
of the kind that humans cannot achieve
 

8105
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:19,830
of the kind that humans cannot achieve
so ai is much more able to destroy an

8106
02:20:19,830 --> 02:20:19,840
so ai is much more able to destroy an
 

8107
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:22,150
so ai is much more able to destroy an
entire country accidentally versus

8108
02:20:22,150 --> 02:20:22,160
entire country accidentally versus
 

8109
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:24,630
entire country accidentally versus
humans it feels like the more

8110
02:20:24,630 --> 02:20:24,640
humans it feels like the more
 

8111
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:28,710
humans it feels like the more
civilians die as they react or suffer as

8112
02:20:28,710 --> 02:20:28,720
civilians die as they react or suffer as
 

8113
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:31,030
civilians die as they react or suffer as
the consequences of your decisions

8114
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:31,040
the consequences of your decisions
 

8115
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:33,510
the consequences of your decisions
the more weight there is on the human

8116
02:20:33,510 --> 02:20:33,520
the more weight there is on the human
 

8117
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:36,309
the more weight there is on the human
mind to make that decision

8118
02:20:36,309 --> 02:20:36,319
mind to make that decision
 

8119
02:20:36,319 --> 02:20:38,389
mind to make that decision
and so like it becomes more and more

8120
02:20:38,389 --> 02:20:38,399
and so like it becomes more and more
 

8121
02:20:38,399 --> 02:20:40,710
and so like it becomes more and more
unlikely to make that decision for

8122
02:20:40,710 --> 02:20:40,720
unlikely to make that decision for
 

8123
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:43,670
unlikely to make that decision for
humans for ai it feels like it's harder

8124
02:20:43,670 --> 02:20:43,680
humans for ai it feels like it's harder
 

8125
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:46,950
humans for ai it feels like it's harder
to encode that kind of weight

8126
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:46,960
to encode that kind of weight
 

8127
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:49,110
to encode that kind of weight
in a way the ai that we're currently

8128
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:49,120
in a way the ai that we're currently
 

8129
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:51,910
in a way the ai that we're currently
building is automating statistics right

8130
02:20:51,910 --> 02:20:51,920
building is automating statistics right
 

8131
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:53,510
building is automating statistics right
intelligence is the ability to make

8132
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:53,520
intelligence is the ability to make
 

8133
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:55,830
intelligence is the ability to make
models so you can act on them and ai is

8134
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:55,840
models so you can act on them and ai is
 

8135
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:58,309
models so you can act on them and ai is
the tool to make better models

8136
02:20:58,309 --> 02:20:58,319
the tool to make better models
 

8137
02:20:58,319 --> 02:21:00,550
the tool to make better models
so in principle if you're using ai

8138
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:00,560
so in principle if you're using ai
 

8139
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:04,230
so in principle if you're using ai
wisely you're able to prevent more harm

8140
02:21:04,230 --> 02:21:04,240
wisely you're able to prevent more harm
 

8141
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:06,550
wisely you're able to prevent more harm
and i think that the main issue is is

8142
02:21:06,550 --> 02:21:06,560
and i think that the main issue is is
 

8143
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:08,309
and i think that the main issue is is
not on the side of the ai it's on the

8144
02:21:08,309 --> 02:21:08,319
not on the side of the ai it's on the
 

8145
02:21:08,319 --> 02:21:10,150
not on the side of the ai it's on the
side of the human command hierarchy that

8146
02:21:10,150 --> 02:21:10,160
side of the human command hierarchy that
 

8147
02:21:10,160 --> 02:21:12,550
side of the human command hierarchy that
is using technology irresponsibly so the

8148
02:21:12,550 --> 02:21:12,560
is using technology irresponsibly so the
 

8149
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:15,670
is using technology irresponsibly so the
question is how hard is it uh to encode

8150
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:15,680
question is how hard is it uh to encode
 

8151
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:17,590
question is how hard is it uh to encode
to to pro to properly encode the right

8152
02:21:17,590 --> 02:21:17,600
to to pro to properly encode the right
 

8153
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:19,670
to to pro to properly encode the right
incentives into the ai so

8154
02:21:19,670 --> 02:21:19,680
incentives into the ai so
 

8155
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:21,590
incentives into the ai so
for instance there's this idea what

8156
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:21,600
for instance there's this idea what
 

8157
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:24,389
for instance there's this idea what
happens if we let our airplanes be flown

8158
02:21:24,389 --> 02:21:24,399
happens if we let our airplanes be flown
 

8159
02:21:24,399 --> 02:21:26,790
happens if we let our airplanes be flown
with ai systems and the neural network

8160
02:21:26,790 --> 02:21:26,800
with ai systems and the neural network
 

8161
02:21:26,800 --> 02:21:28,950
with ai systems and the neural network
is a black box and so on and it turns

8162
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:28,960
is a black box and so on and it turns
 

8163
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,710
is a black box and so on and it turns
out our neural networks are actually not

8164
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:30,720
out our neural networks are actually not
 

8165
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:33,670
out our neural networks are actually not
black boxes anymore there are uh

8166
02:21:33,670 --> 02:21:33,680
black boxes anymore there are uh
 

8167
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:35,590
black boxes anymore there are uh
function approximators using linear

8168
02:21:35,590 --> 02:21:35,600
function approximators using linear
 

8169
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:36,630
function approximators using linear
algebra

8170
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:36,640
algebra
 

8171
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:38,469
algebra
and uh there are performing things that

8172
02:21:38,469 --> 02:21:38,479
and uh there are performing things that
 

8173
02:21:38,479 --> 02:21:41,190
and uh there are performing things that
we can understand but we can also

8174
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:41,200
we can understand but we can also
 

8175
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:42,790
we can understand but we can also
instead of letting the neural network

8176
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:42,800
instead of letting the neural network
 

8177
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:44,870
instead of letting the neural network
fly the airplane use the neural network

8178
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:44,880
fly the airplane use the neural network
 

8179
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:46,550
fly the airplane use the neural network
to generate approval of the correct

8180
02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:46,560
to generate approval of the correct
 

8181
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:49,349
to generate approval of the correct
program with the degree of accuracy of

8182
02:21:49,349 --> 02:21:49,359
program with the degree of accuracy of
 

8183
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:51,670
program with the degree of accuracy of
the proof that a human could not achieve

8184
02:21:51,670 --> 02:21:51,680
the proof that a human could not achieve
 

8185
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:54,070
the proof that a human could not achieve
right so we can use our ai by combining

8186
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:54,080
right so we can use our ai by combining
 

8187
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:56,389
right so we can use our ai by combining
different technologies to build systems

8188
02:21:56,389 --> 02:21:56,399
different technologies to build systems
 

8189
02:21:56,399 --> 02:21:57,910
different technologies to build systems
that are much more reliable than the

8190
02:21:57,910 --> 02:21:57,920
that are much more reliable than the
 

8191
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:00,389
that are much more reliable than the
systems that a human being could create

8192
02:22:00,389 --> 02:22:00,399
systems that a human being could create
 

8193
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:03,830
systems that a human being could create
and so in in this sense i would say that

8194
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:03,840
and so in in this sense i would say that
 

8195
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,550
and so in in this sense i would say that
if you use an early stage of technology

8196
02:22:06,550 --> 02:22:06,560
if you use an early stage of technology
 

8197
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:10,389
if you use an early stage of technology
to save labor and don't employ employ

8198
02:22:10,389 --> 02:22:10,399
to save labor and don't employ employ
 

8199
02:22:10,399 --> 02:22:12,230
to save labor and don't employ employ
competent people but just to hack

8200
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:12,240
competent people but just to hack
 

8201
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:14,309
competent people but just to hack
something together because you can that

8202
02:22:14,309 --> 02:22:14,319
something together because you can that
 

8203
02:22:14,319 --> 02:22:15,830
something together because you can that
is very dangerous and if people are

8204
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:15,840
is very dangerous and if people are
 

8205
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,349
is very dangerous and if people are
acting under these incentives that they

8206
02:22:17,349 --> 02:22:17,359
acting under these incentives that they
 

8207
02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:20,309
acting under these incentives that they
get away with delivering shoddy work

8208
02:22:20,309 --> 02:22:20,319
get away with delivering shoddy work
 

8209
02:22:20,319 --> 02:22:22,630
get away with delivering shoddy work
more cheaply using ai is less human

8210
02:22:22,630 --> 02:22:22,640
more cheaply using ai is less human
 

8211
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:24,389
more cheaply using ai is less human
oversight than before that's very

8212
02:22:24,389 --> 02:22:24,399
oversight than before that's very
 

8213
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:26,950
oversight than before that's very
dangerous the thing is though ai is

8214
02:22:26,950 --> 02:22:26,960
dangerous the thing is though ai is
 

8215
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:29,270
dangerous the thing is though ai is
still going to be unreliable perhaps

8216
02:22:29,270 --> 02:22:29,280
still going to be unreliable perhaps
 

8217
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:30,950
still going to be unreliable perhaps
less so than humans but it'll be

8218
02:22:30,950 --> 02:22:30,960
less so than humans but it'll be
 

8219
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:33,830
less so than humans but it'll be
unreliable in novel ways

8220
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:33,840
unreliable in novel ways
 

8221
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:35,190
unreliable in novel ways
and

8222
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:35,200
and
 

8223
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,110
and
yeah but this is an empirical question

8224
02:22:37,110 --> 02:22:37,120
yeah but this is an empirical question
 

8225
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:38,630
yeah but this is an empirical question
and it's something that we can figure

8226
02:22:38,630 --> 02:22:38,640
and it's something that we can figure
 

8227
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:41,750
and it's something that we can figure
out and work with so the issue is do we

8228
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:41,760
out and work with so the issue is do we
 

8229
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:44,150
out and work with so the issue is do we
trust the systems the social systems

8230
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,160
trust the systems the social systems
 

8231
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:45,830
trust the systems the social systems
that we have in place and the social

8232
02:22:45,830 --> 02:22:45,840
that we have in place and the social
 

8233
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,910
that we have in place and the social
systems that we can build and maintain

8234
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:47,920
systems that we can build and maintain
 

8235
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:50,389
systems that we can build and maintain
that they're able to use ai responsibly

8236
02:22:50,389 --> 02:22:50,399
that they're able to use ai responsibly
 

8237
02:22:50,399 --> 02:22:53,270
that they're able to use ai responsibly
if they can then ai is good news if they

8238
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:53,280
if they can then ai is good news if they
 

8239
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:54,870
if they can then ai is good news if they
cannot then it's going to make the

8240
02:22:54,870 --> 02:22:54,880
cannot then it's going to make the
 

8241
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:57,110
cannot then it's going to make the
existing problems worse

8242
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:57,120
existing problems worse
 

8243
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,349
existing problems worse
well and also who creates the ai who

8244
02:22:59,349 --> 02:22:59,359
well and also who creates the ai who
 

8245
02:22:59,359 --> 02:23:01,190

controls it who makes money from it

8246
02:23:01,190 --> 02:23:01,200
controls it who makes money from it

because it's ultimately humans and then

8248
02:23:03,510 --> 02:23:03,520
because it's ultimately humans and then
 

8249
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:05,590
because it's ultimately humans and then
you start talking about how much you

8250
02:23:05,590 --> 02:23:05,600
you start talking about how much you
 

8251
02:23:05,600 --> 02:23:07,830
you start talking about how much you
trust the humans so the question is what

8252
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:07,840
trust the humans so the question is what
 

8253
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:09,910
trust the humans so the question is what
does who mean i don't think that we have

8257
02:23:12,319 --> 02:23:14,469
identity per se i think that these the
story of a human being is somewhat

8258
02:23:14,469 --> 02:23:14,479
story of a human being is somewhat
 

8259
02:23:14,479 --> 02:23:15,429

random

8260
02:23:15,429 --> 02:23:15,439
random
 

8261
02:23:15,439 --> 02:23:17,190
random
what happens is more or less that

8262
02:23:17,190 --> 02:23:17,200
what happens is more or less that
 

8263
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:19,270
what happens is more or less that
everybody is acting on their local

their incentives and the question is
 

8269
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:25,510

that is
pressing the button is operating under

it's nice for those incentives to be
 

8279
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:33,910
it's nice for those incentives to be
transparent so

02:23:33,910 --> 02:23:33,920
transparent so
 

8281
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:35,510

02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:49,750
influence it's that a random person can
come up with a conspiracy theory and

8408
02:25:49,750 --> 02:25:49,760
come up with a conspiracy theory and
 

8409
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:52,950
come up with a conspiracy theory and
disrupt what people think and if that

8410
02:25:52,950 --> 02:25:52,960
disrupt what people think and if that
 

8411
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:55,510
disrupt what people think and if that
conspiracy theory is more compelling or

8412
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:55,520
conspiracy theory is more compelling or
 

8413
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:58,070
conspiracy theory is more compelling or
more attractive than the standardized

8414
02:25:58,070 --> 02:25:58,080
more attractive than the standardized
 

8415
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:00,150
more attractive than the standardized
public conspiracy theory that we give

8416
02:26:00,150 --> 02:26:00,160
public conspiracy theory that we give
 

8417
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:01,750
public conspiracy theory that we give
people as a default

8418
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:01,760
people as a default
 

8419
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:03,349
people as a default
then it might get more traction right

8420
02:26:03,349 --> 02:26:03,359
then it might get more traction right
 

8421
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:04,950
then it might get more traction right
you suddenly have the situation that the

8422
02:26:04,950 --> 02:26:04,960
you suddenly have the situation that the
 

8423
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:07,349
you suddenly have the situation that the
single individual somewhere on a farm in

02:26:07,349 --> 02:26:07,359
single individual somewhere on a farm in
 

8425
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:11,030
single individual somewhere on a farm in
texas has more listeners than cnn

8426
02:26:11,030 --> 02:26:11,040
texas has more listeners than cnn
 

8427
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:12,950
texas has more listeners than cnn
which particular farmer you're referring

8428
02:26:12,950 --> 02:26:12,960
which particular farmer you're referring
 

8429
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:13,710
which particular farmer you're referring
to in texas

8430
02:26:13,710 --> 02:26:13,720
to in texas
 

8431
02:26:13,720 --> 02:26:16,870
to in texas
[Laughter]

8432
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:16,880
[Laughter]
 

8433
02:26:16,880 --> 02:26:19,030
[Laughter]
i probably know

8434
02:26:19,030 --> 02:26:19,040
i probably know
 

8435
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:20,790
i probably know
yes i had dinner with him a couple times

8436
02:26:20,790 --> 02:26:20,800
yes i had dinner with him a couple times
 

8437
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:21,670
yes i had dinner with him a couple times
okay

8438
02:26:21,670 --> 02:26:21,680
okay
 

8439
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:23,349
okay
right this is an interesting situation

8440
02:26:23,349 --> 02:26:23,359
right this is an interesting situation
 

8441
02:26:23,359 --> 02:26:25,110
right this is an interesting situation
because you cannot get to be an anchor

8442
02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:25,120
because you cannot get to be an anchor
 

8443
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:27,429
because you cannot get to be an anchor
and cnn if you don't go through a

8444
02:26:27,429 --> 02:26:27,439
and cnn if you don't go through a
 

8445
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:29,830
and cnn if you don't go through a
complete uh complicated gatekeeping

8446
02:26:29,830 --> 02:26:29,840
complete uh complicated gatekeeping
 

8447
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:31,590
complete uh complicated gatekeeping
process and suddenly you have random

8448
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:31,600
process and suddenly you have random
 

8449
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:34,469
process and suddenly you have random
people without that gatekeeping process

8450
02:26:34,469 --> 02:26:34,479
people without that gatekeeping process
 

8451
02:26:34,479 --> 02:26:37,110
people without that gatekeeping process
uh just optimizing for attention

8452
02:26:37,110 --> 02:26:37,120
uh just optimizing for attention
 

8453
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:38,550
uh just optimizing for attention
not necessarily with a lot of

8454
02:26:38,550 --> 02:26:38,560
not necessarily with a lot of
 

8455
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,630
not necessarily with a lot of
responsibility for the long-term effects

8456
02:26:40,630 --> 02:26:40,640
responsibility for the long-term effects
 

8457
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:41,429
responsibility for the long-term effects
of

8458
02:26:41,429 --> 02:26:41,439
of
 

8459
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:42,950
of
projecting these theories into the

8460
02:26:42,950 --> 02:26:42,960
projecting these theories into the
 

8461
02:26:42,960 --> 02:26:45,830
projecting these theories into the
public and now uh there is a push of

8462
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:45,840
public and now uh there is a push of
 

8463
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:47,429
public and now uh there is a push of
making social media more like

8464
02:26:47,429 --> 02:26:47,439
making social media more like
 

8465
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:49,030
making social media more like
traditional media which means that the

8466
02:26:49,030 --> 02:26:49,040
traditional media which means that the
 

8467
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:51,349
traditional media which means that the
opinion that is being projected in

8468
02:26:51,349 --> 02:26:51,359
opinion that is being projected in
 

8469
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:53,349
opinion that is being projected in
social media is more limited to an

8470
02:26:53,349 --> 02:26:53,359
social media is more limited to an
 

8471
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:55,750
social media is more limited to an
acceptable range with the goal of

8472
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:55,760
acceptable range with the goal of
 

8473
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:58,469
acceptable range with the goal of
getting society into safe waters and

8474
02:26:58,469 --> 02:26:58,479
getting society into safe waters and
 

8475
02:26:58,479 --> 02:26:59,910
getting society into safe waters and
increase the stability and cohesion of

8476
02:26:59,910 --> 02:26:59,920
increase the stability and cohesion of
 

8477
02:26:59,920 --> 02:27:02,070
increase the stability and cohesion of
society again which i think is a

8478
02:27:02,070 --> 02:27:02,080
society again which i think is a
 

8479
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:04,230
society again which i think is a
laudable goal but of course it also is

8480
02:27:04,230 --> 02:27:04,240
laudable goal but of course it also is
 

8481
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:06,630
laudable goal but of course it also is
an opportunity to seize the means of

8482
02:27:06,630 --> 02:27:06,640
an opportunity to seize the means of
 

8483
02:27:06,640 --> 02:27:08,230
an opportunity to seize the means of
indoctrination

8484
02:27:08,230 --> 02:27:08,240
indoctrination
 

8485
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:10,389
indoctrination
and the incentives that people are under

8486
02:27:10,389 --> 02:27:10,399
and the incentives that people are under
 

8487
02:27:10,399 --> 02:27:12,309
and the incentives that people are under
when they do this are

8488
02:27:12,309 --> 02:27:12,319
when they do this are
 

8489
02:27:12,319 --> 02:27:14,070
when they do this are
in such a way that

8490
02:27:14,070 --> 02:27:14,080
in such a way that
 

8491
02:27:14,080 --> 02:27:17,030
in such a way that
the ai ethics that we would need

8492
02:27:17,030 --> 02:27:17,040
the ai ethics that we would need
 

8493
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:18,870
the ai ethics that we would need
becomes very often

8494
02:27:18,870 --> 02:27:18,880
becomes very often
 

8495
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:20,790
becomes very often
something like ai politics which is

8496
02:27:20,790 --> 02:27:20,800
something like ai politics which is
 

8497
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:23,349
something like ai politics which is
basically partisan and ideological and

8498
02:27:23,349 --> 02:27:23,359
basically partisan and ideological and
 

8499
02:27:23,359 --> 02:27:24,710
basically partisan and ideological and
this means that

8500
02:27:24,710 --> 02:27:24,720
this means that
 

8501
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:26,710
this means that
whatever one side says another side is

8502
02:27:26,710 --> 02:27:26,720
whatever one side says another side is
 

8503
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:28,389
whatever one side says another side is
going to be disagreeing with right in

8504
02:27:28,389 --> 02:27:28,399
going to be disagreeing with right in
 

8505
02:27:28,399 --> 02:27:31,030
going to be disagreeing with right in
the same way as when you turn masks or

8506
02:27:31,030 --> 02:27:31,040
the same way as when you turn masks or
 

8507
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:33,190
the same way as when you turn masks or
the vaccine into a political issue if

8508
02:27:33,190 --> 02:27:33,200
the vaccine into a political issue if
 

8509
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:35,590
the vaccine into a political issue if
you say that it is politically virtuous

8510
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:35,600
you say that it is politically virtuous
 

8511
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,349
you say that it is politically virtuous
to get vaccinated it will mean that the

8512
02:27:37,349 --> 02:27:37,359
to get vaccinated it will mean that the
 

8513
02:27:37,359 --> 02:27:39,190
to get vaccinated it will mean that the
people that don't like you

8514
02:27:39,190 --> 02:27:39,200
people that don't like you
 

8515
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:40,950
people that don't like you
will not want to get vaccinated right

8516
02:27:40,950 --> 02:27:40,960
will not want to get vaccinated right
 

8517
02:27:40,960 --> 02:27:42,950
will not want to get vaccinated right
and as soon as you have this partisan

8518
02:27:42,950 --> 02:27:42,960
and as soon as you have this partisan
 

8519
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:46,070
and as soon as you have this partisan
discourse it's going to be very hard to

8520
02:27:46,070 --> 02:27:46,080
discourse it's going to be very hard to
 

8521
02:27:46,080 --> 02:27:47,349
discourse it's going to be very hard to
make the right decisions because the

8522
02:27:47,349 --> 02:27:47,359
make the right decisions because the
 

8523
02:27:47,359 --> 02:27:49,110
make the right decisions because the
incentives get to be the wrong ones ai

ethics needs to be super boring it needs

8526
02:27:51,349 --> 02:27:51,359
ethics needs to be super boring it needs
 

8527
02:27:51,359 --> 02:27:53,270
ethics needs to be super boring it needs
to be done by people who do statistics

8528
02:27:53,270 --> 02:27:53,280
to be done by people who do statistics
 

8529
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:56,469
to be done by people who do statistics
all the time and have extremely boring

8530
02:27:56,469 --> 02:27:56,479
all the time and have extremely boring
 

8531
02:27:56,479 --> 02:27:58,870
all the time and have extremely boring
long-winded discussions that most people

8532
02:27:58,870 --> 02:27:58,880
long-winded discussions that most people
 

8533
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:00,150
long-winded discussions that most people
cannot follow because they are too

8534
02:28:00,150 --> 02:28:00,160
cannot follow because they are too
 

8535
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:02,389
cannot follow because they are too
complicated but that are that serious

8536
02:28:02,389 --> 02:28:02,399
complicated but that are that serious
 

8537
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:04,230
complicated but that are that serious
these people need to be able to to be

8538
02:28:04,230 --> 02:28:04,240
these people need to be able to to be
 

8539
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:06,230
these people need to be able to to be
better at statistics than the leading

8540
02:28:06,230 --> 02:28:06,240
better at statistics than the leading
 

8541
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:08,230
better at statistics than the leading
machine learning researchers and at the

8542
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:08,240
machine learning researchers and at the
 

8543
02:28:08,240 --> 02:28:09,270
machine learning researchers and at the
moment

8544
02:28:09,270 --> 02:28:09,280
moment
 

8545
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:11,990
moment
the ia ethics the debate is the one but

8546
02:28:11,990 --> 02:28:12,000
the ia ethics the debate is the one but
 

8547
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,070
the ia ethics the debate is the one but
you don't have any barrier to entry

8548
02:28:14,070 --> 02:28:14,080
you don't have any barrier to entry
 

8549
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:16,710
you don't have any barrier to entry
right everybody who has a strong opinion

8550
02:28:16,710 --> 02:28:16,720
right everybody who has a strong opinion
 

8551
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:18,309
right everybody who has a strong opinion
and is able to signal that opinion in

8552
02:28:18,309 --> 02:28:18,319
and is able to signal that opinion in
 

8553
02:28:18,319 --> 02:28:22,070
and is able to signal that opinion in
the right strong words

8554
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,080

and
 

8557
02:28:22,720 --> 02:28:24,309
and
to me that is a very frustrating thing

8558
02:28:24,309 --> 02:28:24,319
to me that is a very frustrating thing
 

8559
02:28:24,319 --> 02:28:25,750
to me that is a very frustrating thing
because the field is so crucially

8560
02:28:25,750 --> 02:28:25,760
because the field is so crucially
 

8561
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:28,230
because the field is so crucially
important to us so crucially important

8562
02:28:28,230 --> 02:28:28,240
important to us so crucially important
 

8563
02:28:28,240 --> 02:28:29,750
important to us so crucially important
but

8564
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:29,760
but
 

8565
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:31,590
but
uh the only qualification you currently

8566
02:28:31,590 --> 02:28:31,600
uh the only qualification you currently
 

8567
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:33,510
uh the only qualification you currently
need is to be outraged by the injustice

8568
02:28:33,510 --> 02:28:33,520
need is to be outraged by the injustice
 

8569
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:34,710
need is to be outraged by the injustice
in the world

8570
02:28:34,710 --> 02:28:34,720
in the world
 

8571
02:28:34,720 --> 02:28:36,710
in the world
it's more complicated right everybody

8572
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:36,720
it's more complicated right everybody
 

8573
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:38,950
it's more complicated right everybody
seems to be outraged but

8574
02:28:38,950 --> 02:28:38,960
seems to be outraged but
 

8575
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:40,710
seems to be outraged but
so let's just say that the incentives

8576
02:28:40,710 --> 02:28:40,720
so let's just say that the incentives
 

8577
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:42,150
so let's just say that the incentives
are not always the right ones so

8578
02:28:42,150 --> 02:28:42,160
are not always the right ones so
 

8579
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:44,790
are not always the right ones so
basically i i suspect that

8580
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:44,800
basically i i suspect that
 

8581
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:47,030
basically i i suspect that
a lot of people that enter this debate

8582
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,040
a lot of people that enter this debate
 

8583
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:49,030
a lot of people that enter this debate
don't have a vision for what society

8584
02:28:49,030 --> 02:28:49,040
don't have a vision for what society
 

8585
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:50,630
don't have a vision for what society
should be looking like in a way that is

8586
02:28:50,630 --> 02:28:50,640
should be looking like in a way that is
 

8587
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:52,309
should be looking like in a way that is
non-violent where we preserve liberal

8588
02:28:52,309 --> 02:28:52,319
non-violent where we preserve liberal
 

8589
02:28:52,319 --> 02:28:55,510
non-violent where we preserve liberal
democracy where we make sure that we all

8590
02:28:55,510 --> 02:28:55,520
democracy where we make sure that we all
 

8591
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:57,349
democracy where we make sure that we all
get along and

8592
02:28:57,349 --> 02:28:57,359
get along and
 

8593
02:28:57,359 --> 02:28:59,349
get along and
we are around in a few hundred years

8594
02:28:59,349 --> 02:28:59,359
we are around in a few hundred years
 

8595
02:28:59,359 --> 02:29:00,389
we are around in a few hundred years
from now

8596
02:29:00,389 --> 02:29:00,399
from now
 

8597
02:29:00,399 --> 02:29:02,150
from now

preferably with a comfortable

02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:04,790
preferably with a comfortable
technological civilization around us

8600
02:29:04,790 --> 02:29:04,800
technological civilization around us

02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:07,120
i i generally
 

8603
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:10,630
i i generally
have a very foggy view of that world but

8604
02:29:10,630 --> 02:29:10,640
have a very foggy view of that world but
 

8605
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:12,469
have a very foggy view of that world but
i tend to try to follow and i think

8606
02:29:12,469 --> 02:29:12,479
i tend to try to follow and i think
 

8607
02:29:12,479 --> 02:29:14,950
i tend to try to follow and i think
society should in some degree follow

8608
02:29:14,950 --> 02:29:14,960
society should in some degree follow

society should in some degree follow
the gradient of love increasing the

8610
02:29:17,270 --> 02:29:17,280
the gradient of love increasing the
 

8611
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:18,950
the gradient of love increasing the
amount of love in the world

8612
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:18,960
amount of love in the world
 

8613
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:21,270
amount of love in the world
and whenever i see different policies or

8614
02:29:21,270 --> 02:29:21,280
and whenever i see different policies or
 

8615
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:23,670
and whenever i see different policies or
algorithms or ideas that are not doing

8616
02:29:23,670 --> 02:29:23,680
algorithms or ideas that are not doing
 

8617
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:24,469
algorithms or ideas that are not doing
so

8618
02:29:24,469 --> 02:29:24,479
so
 

8619
02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:26,790
so
obviously that that's the ones that kind

8620
02:29:26,790 --> 02:29:26,800
obviously that that's the ones that kind
 

8621
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:27,910
obviously that that's the ones that kind

8622
02:29:27,910 --> 02:29:27,920
of resist
 

8623
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:30,070
of resist
so the thing that terrifies me about

8624
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:30,080
so the thing that terrifies me about
 

8625
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:32,469
so the thing that terrifies me about
this notion is i think that

8626
02:29:32,469 --> 02:29:32,479
this notion is i think that
 

8627
02:29:32,479 --> 02:29:35,590
this notion is i think that
german fascism was driven by love

8628
02:29:35,590 --> 02:29:35,600
german fascism was driven by love
 

8629
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:37,750
german fascism was driven by love
it was just a very selective love

8630
02:29:37,750 --> 02:29:37,760
it was just a very selective love
 

8631
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:39,670
it was just a very selective love
it was a love that now you're just

8632
02:29:39,670 --> 02:29:39,680
it was a love that now you're just
 

8633
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,830
it was a love that now you're just
manipulating i mean that's

8634
02:29:41,830 --> 02:29:41,840
manipulating i mean that's
 

8635
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:43,110
manipulating i mean that's
i

8636
02:29:43,110 --> 02:29:43,120
i
 

8637
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:45,670
i
it's you have to be very careful uh

8638
02:29:45,670 --> 02:29:45,680
it's you have to be very careful uh
 

8639
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:49,030
it's you have to be very careful uh
you're talking to the wrong person

8640
02:29:49,030 --> 02:29:49,040
you're talking to the wrong person
 

8641
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:51,270
you're talking to the wrong person
in this way about love so let's talk

8642
02:29:51,270 --> 02:29:51,280
in this way about love so let's talk
 

8643
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:53,670
in this way about love so let's talk
about what love is and i think that love

8644
02:29:53,670 --> 02:29:53,680
about what love is and i think that love
 

8645
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:56,150
about what love is and i think that love
is the discovery of shared purpose it's

8646
02:29:56,150 --> 02:29:56,160
is the discovery of shared purpose it's
 

8647
02:29:56,160 --> 02:29:58,550
is the discovery of shared purpose it's
the recognition of the sacred and the

8648
02:29:58,550 --> 02:29:58,560
the recognition of the sacred and the
 

8649
02:29:58,560 --> 02:29:59,590
the recognition of the sacred and the
other

8650
02:29:59,590 --> 02:29:59,600
other
 

8651
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:01,190
other
and this enables non-transactional

8652
02:30:01,190 --> 02:30:01,200
and this enables non-transactional
 

8653
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:02,790
and this enables non-transactional
interactions

8654
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:02,800
interactions
 

8655
02:30:02,800 --> 02:30:04,469
interactions
but the

8656
02:30:04,469 --> 02:30:04,479
but the
 

8657
02:30:04,479 --> 02:30:07,670
but the
the size of the other that you include

8658
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:07,680
the size of the other that you include
 

8659
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,750
the size of the other that you include
needs to be maximized

8660
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:09,760
needs to be maximized
 

8661
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:11,429
needs to be maximized
so it's

8662
02:30:11,429 --> 02:30:11,439
so it's
 

8663
02:30:11,439 --> 02:30:12,950
so it's
it's basically

8664
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:12,960
it's basically
 

8665
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:14,630
it's basically
appreciation

8666
02:30:14,630 --> 02:30:14,640
appreciation
 

8667
02:30:14,640 --> 02:30:16,830
appreciation
like deep appreciation

8668
02:30:16,830 --> 02:30:16,840
like deep appreciation
 

8669
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:18,950
like deep appreciation
of uh

8670
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:18,960
of uh

02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:21,349
of uh
the world around you fully

02:30:21,349 --> 02:30:21,359
the world around you fully
 

8673
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:23,670
the world around you fully
like um

02:30:25,190 --> 02:30:25,200
including the people that are very
 

8677
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,710
including the people that are very
different than you people that disagree

8678
02:30:26,710 --> 02:30:26,720
different than you people that disagree
 

8679
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:28,710
different than you people that disagree
with you completely including people

8680
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:28,720
with you completely including people
 

8681
02:30:28,720 --> 02:30:30,790
with you completely including people
including living creatures outside of

8682
02:30:30,790 --> 02:30:30,800
including living creatures outside of
 

8683
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:33,510
including living creatures outside of
just people include including ideas and

8684
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:33,520
just people include including ideas and
 

8685
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:34,309
just people include including ideas and
it's like

8686
02:30:34,309 --> 02:30:34,319
it's like
 

8687
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:36,950
it's like
appreciation of the full mess of it and

8688
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:36,960
appreciation of the full mess of it and
 

8689
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:40,389
appreciation of the full mess of it and
also it has to do with like empathy

8690
02:30:40,389 --> 02:30:40,399
also it has to do with like empathy
 

8691
02:30:40,399 --> 02:30:42,710
also it has to do with like empathy
which is coupled with a lack of

8692
02:30:42,710 --> 02:30:42,720
which is coupled with a lack of
 

8693
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:43,990
which is coupled with a lack of
confidence

8694
02:30:43,990 --> 02:30:44,000
confidence
 

8695
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,830
confidence
uncertainty about

8696
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:45,840
uncertainty about
 

8697
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:47,910
uncertainty about
of your own rightness it's like an open

8698
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:47,920
of your own rightness it's like an open
 

8699
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:50,469
of your own rightness it's like an open
a radical open-mindedness to the way

8700
02:30:50,469 --> 02:30:50,479
a radical open-mindedness to the way
 

8701
02:30:50,479 --> 02:30:52,389
a radical open-mindedness to the way
forward i agree with every part of what

8702
02:30:52,389 --> 02:30:52,399
forward i agree with every part of what
 

8703
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:55,110
forward i agree with every part of what
you said and now if you scale it up what

8704
02:30:55,110 --> 02:30:55,120
you said and now if you scale it up what
 

8705
02:30:55,120 --> 02:30:58,070
you said and now if you scale it up what
you recognize is that life is in some

8706
02:30:58,070 --> 02:30:58,080
you recognize is that life is in some
 

8707
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:01,270
you recognize is that life is in some
sense the service to a next level agency

8708
02:31:01,270 --> 02:31:01,280
sense the service to a next level agency
 

8709
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:03,190
sense the service to a next level agency
to the highest level agency that you can

8710
02:31:03,190 --> 02:31:03,200
to the highest level agency that you can
 

8711
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:05,830
to the highest level agency that you can
recognize it could be for instance life

8712
02:31:05,830 --> 02:31:05,840
recognize it could be for instance life
 

8713
02:31:05,840 --> 02:31:07,750
recognize it could be for instance life
on earth or beyond that

8714
02:31:07,750 --> 02:31:07,760
on earth or beyond that
 

8715
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:10,150
on earth or beyond that
really you could say intelligent

8716
02:31:10,150 --> 02:31:10,160
really you could say intelligent
 

8717
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:11,990
really you could say intelligent
complexity in the universe that you try

8718
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:12,000
complexity in the universe that you try
 

8719
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,790
complexity in the universe that you try
to maximize in a certain way but when

8720
02:31:14,790 --> 02:31:14,800
to maximize in a certain way but when
 

8721
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:16,710
to maximize in a certain way but when
you think it's true it basically means a

8722
02:31:16,710 --> 02:31:16,720
you think it's true it basically means a
 

8723
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:18,870
you think it's true it basically means a
certain aesthetic

8724
02:31:18,870 --> 02:31:18,880
certain aesthetic
 

8725
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:20,710
certain aesthetic
and there is not one possible aesthetic

8726
02:31:20,710 --> 02:31:20,720
and there is not one possible aesthetic
 

8727
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:22,790
and there is not one possible aesthetic
there are many possible aesthetics and

8728
02:31:22,790 --> 02:31:22,800
there are many possible aesthetics and
 

8729
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:24,950
there are many possible aesthetics and
once you project an aesthetic into the

8730
02:31:24,950 --> 02:31:24,960
once you project an aesthetic into the
 

8731
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:27,110
once you project an aesthetic into the

02:37:26,550 --> 02:37:26,560
maybe it's a natural convergence point
 

9071
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:28,150
maybe it's a natural convergence point
and it's not something that you will

right the cat that is torturing a mouse
 

9137
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:45,349
right the cat that is torturing a mouse
is not evil because the cat does not

9138
02:38:45,349 --> 02:38:45,359
is not evil because the cat does not
 

9139

there is no violence and nobody is
 

9145
02:38:52,319 --> 02:38:54,469
there is no violence and nobody is
suffering yeah right if you have an

9146
02:38:54,469 --> 02:38:54,479
suffering yeah right if you have an
 

9147
02:38:54,479 --> 02:38:55,990
suffering yeah right if you have an
aesthetic where you want to protect

9148
02:38:55,990 --> 02:38:56,000
aesthetic where you want to protect
 

9149
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,309
aesthetic where you want to protect
innocence then torturing

9150
02:38:58,309 --> 02:38:58,319
innocence then torturing
 

9151
02:38:58,319 --> 02:39:00,790
innocence then torturing
somebody needlessly is evil

9152
02:39:00,790 --> 02:39:00,800
somebody needlessly is evil
 

9153
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:02,630
somebody needlessly is evil
but only then

9154
02:39:02,630 --> 02:39:02,640
but only then
 

9155
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:04,710
but only then
no but within i guess the question is

9156
02:39:04,710 --> 02:39:04,720
no but within i guess the question is
 

9157
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:06,950
no but within i guess the question is
within the aesthetic like within

9158
02:39:06,950 --> 02:39:06,960
within the aesthetic like within
 

9159
02:39:06,960 --> 02:39:08,309
within the aesthetic like within
your

9160
02:39:08,309 --> 02:39:08,319
your
 

9161
02:39:08,319 --> 02:39:10,550
your
sense of what is good and evil are we

9162
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:10,560
sense of what is good and evil are we
 

9163
02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:11,990
sense of what is good and evil are we
still

9164
02:39:11,990 --> 02:39:12,000
still
 

9165
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,510
still
it seems like

9166
02:39:13,510 --> 02:39:13,520
it seems like
 

9167
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:17,110
it seems like
we're still able to uh commit evil

9168
02:39:17,110 --> 02:39:17,120
we're still able to uh commit evil
 

9169
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:19,270
we're still able to uh commit evil
yes so basically if you are committing

9170
02:39:19,270 --> 02:39:19,280
yes so basically if you are committing
 

9171
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:21,190
yes so basically if you are committing
to this next level agent you are not

9172
02:39:21,190 --> 02:39:21,200
to this next level agent you are not
 

9173
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:23,349
to this next level agent you are not
necessarily are this next level agent

9174
02:39:23,349 --> 02:39:23,359
necessarily are this next level agent
 

9175
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:24,790
necessarily are this next level agent
right you are part of it you have a

9176
02:39:24,790 --> 02:39:24,800
right you are part of it you have a
 

9177
02:39:24,800 --> 02:39:27,270
right you are part of it you have a
relationship to it like a cell does to

9178
02:39:27,270 --> 02:39:27,280
relationship to it like a cell does to
 

9179
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:30,070
relationship to it like a cell does to
its organism it's hyper organism and it

9180
02:39:30,070 --> 02:39:30,080
its organism it's hyper organism and it
 

9181
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:31,670
its organism it's hyper organism and it
only exists to the degree that it's

9182
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:31,680
only exists to the degree that it's
 

9183
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:34,550
only exists to the degree that it's
being implemented by you and others

9184
02:39:34,550 --> 02:39:34,560
being implemented by you and others
 

9185
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:35,910
being implemented by you and others
and

9186
02:39:35,910 --> 02:39:35,920
and
 

9187
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:37,429
and
that means that you're not completely

9188
02:39:37,429 --> 02:39:37,439
that means that you're not completely
 

9189
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:39,590
that means that you're not completely
fully serving it you have freedom in

9190
02:39:39,590 --> 02:39:39,600
fully serving it you have freedom in
 

9191
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:41,110
fully serving it you have freedom in
what you decide whether you are acting

9192
02:39:41,110 --> 02:39:41,120
what you decide whether you are acting
 

9193
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:43,429
what you decide whether you are acting
on your impulses and local incentives on

9194
02:39:43,429 --> 02:39:43,439
on your impulses and local incentives on
 

9195
02:39:43,439 --> 02:39:45,910
on your impulses and local incentives on
your feral impulses so to speak or

9196
02:39:45,910 --> 02:39:45,920
your feral impulses so to speak or
 

9197
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:47,830
your feral impulses so to speak or
whether you're committing to it and what

9198
02:39:47,830 --> 02:39:47,840
whether you're committing to it and what
 

9199
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:50,870
whether you're committing to it and what
you perceive then is a tension between

9200
02:39:50,870 --> 02:39:50,880
you perceive then is a tension between
 

9201
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:53,190
you perceive then is a tension between
what you would be doing with respect to

9202
02:39:53,190 --> 02:39:53,200
what you would be doing with respect to
 

9203
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:55,590
what you would be doing with respect to
the thing that you uh recognize as the

9204
02:39:55,590 --> 02:39:55,600
the thing that you uh recognize as the
 

9205
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:57,190
the thing that you uh recognize as the
sacred if you do

9206
02:39:57,190 --> 02:39:57,200
sacred if you do
 

9207
02:39:57,200 --> 02:39:59,270
sacred if you do
and what you're actually doing and this

9208
02:39:59,270 --> 02:39:59,280
and what you're actually doing and this
 

9209
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,590
and what you're actually doing and this
is the line between good and evil right

9210
02:40:01,590 --> 02:40:01,600
is the line between good and evil right
 

9211
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:03,349
is the line between good and evil right
where you see oh i'm here acting on my

9212
02:40:03,349 --> 02:40:03,359
where you see oh i'm here acting on my

an offset on your reward

9424
02:44:14,070 --> 02:44:14,080
an offset on your reward
 

9425
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:16,550
an offset on your reward
function on your payout matrix so it

9426
02:44:16,550 --> 02:44:16,560
function on your payout matrix so it
 

9427
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:18,630
function on your payout matrix so it
your behavior becomes compatible with

9428
02:44:18,630 --> 02:44:18,640
your behavior becomes compatible with
 

9429
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:20,790
your behavior becomes compatible with

the common good
 

9431
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:22,710
the common good
so the argument there

9432
02:44:22,710 --> 02:44:22,720
so the argument there
 

9433
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:24,630
so the argument there
is that you can have

9434
02:44:24,630 --> 02:44:24,640
is that you can have
 

9435
02:44:24,640 --> 02:44:26,309
is that you can have

so the idea is that you might be able to
 

9537
02:46:08,240 --> 02:46:10,870
so the idea is that you might be able to
achieve that in an anarchist state

9538
02:46:10,870 --> 02:46:10,880
achieve that in an anarchist state
 

9539
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:13,030
achieve that in an anarchist state
with companies so with the with the

9540
02:46:13,030 --> 02:46:13,040
with companies so with the with the
 

9541
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:15,030
with companies so with the with the
forces of capitalism

9542
02:46:15,030 --> 02:46:15,040
forces of capitalism
 

9543
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:15,830
forces of capitalism
is

9544
02:46:15,830 --> 02:46:15,840
is
 

9545
02:46:15,840 --> 02:46:18,150
is
create security companies

9546
02:46:18,150 --> 02:46:18,160
create security companies
 

9547
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:20,150
create security companies
where the one that's most ethically

9548
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:20,160
where the one that's most ethically
 

9549
02:46:20,160 --> 02:46:22,550
where the one that's most ethically
sound rises to the top basically it

9550
02:46:22,550 --> 02:46:22,560
sound rises to the top basically it
 

9551
02:46:22,560 --> 02:46:24,230
sound rises to the top basically it
would be much better representative of

9552
02:46:24,230 --> 02:46:24,240
would be much better representative of
 

9553
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:27,349
would be much better representative of
the people because there is uh

9554
02:46:27,349 --> 02:46:27,359
the people because there is uh
 

9555
02:46:27,359 --> 02:46:31,429
the people because there is uh
less sort of stickiness to the the big

9556
02:46:31,429 --> 02:46:31,439
less sort of stickiness to the the big
 

9557
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:33,349
less sort of stickiness to the the big
military force sticking around even

9558
02:46:33,349 --> 02:46:33,359
military force sticking around even
 

9559
02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:35,830
military force sticking around even
though it's long overlived

9560
02:46:35,830 --> 02:46:35,840
though it's long overlived
 

9561
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:38,870
though it's long overlived
outlet so you have groups of militants

9562
02:46:38,870 --> 02:46:38,880
outlet so you have groups of militants
 

9563
02:46:38,880 --> 02:46:40,870
outlet so you have groups of militants
that are hopefully officially organized

9564
02:46:40,870 --> 02:46:40,880
that are hopefully officially organized
 

9565
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:42,389
that are hopefully officially organized
because otherwise they're going to lose

9566
02:46:42,389 --> 02:46:42,399
because otherwise they're going to lose
 

9567
02:46:42,399 --> 02:46:44,469
because otherwise they're going to lose
against the other groups of militants

9568
02:46:44,469 --> 02:46:44,479
against the other groups of militants
 

9569
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:46,389
against the other groups of militants
and they are coordinating themselves

9570
02:46:46,389 --> 02:46:46,399
and they are coordinating themselves
 

9571
02:46:46,399 --> 02:46:48,630
and they are coordinating themselves
with the rest of society

9572
02:46:48,630 --> 02:46:48,640
with the rest of society
 

9573
02:46:48,640 --> 02:46:50,630
with the rest of society
until they are having a monopoly on

9574
02:46:50,630 --> 02:46:50,640
until they are having a monopoly on
 

9575
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:52,309
until they are having a monopoly on
violence how is that different from a

9576
02:46:52,309 --> 02:46:52,319
violence how is that different from a
 

9577
02:46:52,319 --> 02:46:54,070
violence how is that different from a
government i listen i'm doing right so

9578
02:46:54,070 --> 02:46:54,080
government i listen i'm doing right so
 

9579
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:55,910
government i listen i'm doing right so
it's basically converging to the same

9580
02:46:55,910 --> 02:46:55,920
it's basically converging to the same
 

9581
02:46:55,920 --> 02:46:58,309
it's basically converging to the same
thing so i think it always i did in my

9582
02:46:58,309 --> 02:46:58,319
thing so i think it always i did in my
 

9583
02:46:58,319 --> 02:46:59,990
thing so i think it always i did in my
as i was trying to argue with malice i

9584
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,000
as i was trying to argue with malice i
 

9585
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,349
as i was trying to argue with malice i
feel like it always converges towards

9586
02:47:01,349 --> 02:47:01,359
feel like it always converges towards
 

9587
02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:02,950
feel like it always converges towards
government at scale

9588
02:47:02,950 --> 02:47:02,960
government at scale
 

9589
02:47:02,960 --> 02:47:04,710
government at scale
but i think the idea is you can have a

9590
02:47:04,710 --> 02:47:04,720
but i think the idea is you can have a
 

9591
02:47:04,720 --> 02:47:07,349
but i think the idea is you can have a
lot of collectives that are

9592
02:47:07,349 --> 02:47:07,359
lot of collectives that are
 

9593
02:47:07,359 --> 02:47:10,230
lot of collectives that are
you basically never let anything scale

9594
02:47:10,230 --> 02:47:10,240
you basically never let anything scale
 

9595
02:47:10,240 --> 02:47:11,750
you basically never let anything scale
too big

9596
02:47:11,750 --> 02:47:11,760
too big
 

9597
02:47:11,760 --> 02:47:12,469
too big
so

9598
02:47:12,469 --> 02:47:12,479
so
 

9599
02:47:12,479 --> 02:47:13,990
so
one of the problems with governments is

9600
02:47:13,990 --> 02:47:14,000
one of the problems with governments is
 

9601
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:18,389
one of the problems with governments is
it gets too big in terms of like the the

9602
02:47:18,389 --> 02:47:18,399
it gets too big in terms of like the the
 

9603
02:47:18,399 --> 02:47:20,790
it gets too big in terms of like the the
the size of the group over which it has

9604
02:47:20,790 --> 02:47:20,800
the size of the group over which it has
 

9605
02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:23,910
the size of the group over which it has
control

9606
02:47:23,910 --> 02:47:23,920

 

9607
02:47:23,920 --> 02:47:26,389

my sense is that would happen anyway in

9608
02:47:26,389 --> 02:47:26,399
my sense is that would happen anyway in
 

9609
02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:29,190
my sense is that would happen anyway in
in this so successful company like

9610
02:47:29,190 --> 02:47:29,200
in this so successful company like
 

9611
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:31,670
in this so successful company like
amazon or facebook i mean it starts

9612
02:47:31,670 --> 02:47:31,680
amazon or facebook i mean it starts
 

9613
02:47:31,680 --> 02:47:34,790
amazon or facebook i mean it starts
forming a monopoly over over entire

9614
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:34,800
forming a monopoly over over entire
 

9615
02:47:34,800 --> 02:47:37,030
forming a monopoly over over entire
populations not over just a hundred

9616
02:47:37,030 --> 02:47:37,040
populations not over just a hundred
 

9617
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:38,550
populations not over just a hundred
hundreds of millions but billions of

9618
02:47:38,550 --> 02:47:38,560
hundreds of millions but billions of
 

9619
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:40,950
hundreds of millions but billions of
people so i don't know

9620
02:47:40,950 --> 02:47:40,960
people so i don't know
 

9621
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:42,550
people so i don't know
but

9622
02:47:42,550 --> 02:47:42,560
but
 

9623
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:44,630
but
there is something about the abuses of

9624
02:47:44,630 --> 02:47:44,640
there is something about the abuses of
 

9625
02:47:44,640 --> 02:47:46,150
there is something about the abuses of
power the government can have when it

9626
02:47:46,150 --> 02:47:46,160
power the government can have when it
 

9627
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:48,870
power the government can have when it
has a monopoly on violence right

9628
02:47:48,870 --> 02:47:48,880
has a monopoly on violence right
 

9629
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:49,830
has a monopoly on violence right
and so

9630
02:47:49,830 --> 02:47:49,840
and so
 

9631
02:47:49,840 --> 02:47:52,870
and so
that's that's a tension there but

9632
02:47:52,870 --> 02:47:52,880
that's that's a tension there but
 

9633
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:54,550
that's that's a tension there but
so the question is how can you set the

9634
02:47:54,550 --> 02:47:54,560
so the question is how can you set the
 

9635
02:47:54,560 --> 02:47:56,550
so the question is how can you set the
incentives for government correctly and

9636
02:47:56,550 --> 02:47:56,560
incentives for government correctly and
 

9637
02:47:56,560 --> 02:47:58,550
incentives for government correctly and
this mostly applies at the highest

9638
02:47:58,550 --> 02:47:58,560
this mostly applies at the highest
 

9639
02:47:58,560 --> 02:48:01,110
this mostly applies at the highest
levels of government and we because we

9640
02:48:01,110 --> 02:48:01,120
levels of government and we because we
 

9641
02:48:01,120 --> 02:48:02,389
levels of government and we because we
haven't found a way to set them

9642
02:48:02,389 --> 02:48:02,399
haven't found a way to set them
 

9643
02:48:02,399 --> 02:48:04,150
haven't found a way to set them
correctly we made the highest levels of

9644
02:48:04,150 --> 02:48:04,160
correctly we made the highest levels of
 

9645
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:06,150
correctly we made the highest levels of
government relatively weak

9646
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:06,160
government relatively weak
 

9647
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:08,469
government relatively weak
and this is i think part of the reason

9648
02:48:08,469 --> 02:48:08,479
and this is i think part of the reason
 

9649
02:48:08,479 --> 02:48:10,309
and this is i think part of the reason
why we had difficulty to coordinate the

9650
02:48:10,309 --> 02:48:10,319
why we had difficulty to coordinate the
 

9651
02:48:10,319 --> 02:48:12,150
why we had difficulty to coordinate the
pandemic response

9652
02:48:12,150 --> 02:48:12,160
pandemic response
 

9653
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:13,590
pandemic response
and china didn't have that much

9654
02:48:13,590 --> 02:48:13,600
and china didn't have that much
 

9655
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:14,870
and china didn't have that much
difficulty

9656
02:48:14,870 --> 02:48:14,880
difficulty
 

9657
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:17,030
difficulty
and there is of course a much higher

9658
02:48:17,030 --> 02:48:17,040
and there is of course a much higher
 

9659
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:19,510
and there is of course a much higher
risk of the abuse of power that exists

9660
02:48:19,510 --> 02:48:19,520
risk of the abuse of power that exists
 

9661
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:21,030
risk of the abuse of power that exists
in china because the power is largely

9662
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:21,040
in china because the power is largely
 

9663
02:48:21,040 --> 02:48:22,630
in china because the power is largely
unchecked

9664
02:48:22,630 --> 02:48:22,640
unchecked
 

9665
02:48:22,640 --> 02:48:23,429
unchecked
and

9666
02:48:23,429 --> 02:48:23,439
and
 

9667
02:48:23,439 --> 02:48:25,269
and
that's basically what happens in the

9668
02:48:25,269 --> 02:48:25,279
that's basically what happens in the
 

9669
02:48:25,279 --> 02:48:26,870
that's basically what happens in the
next generation for instance imagine

9670
02:48:26,870 --> 02:48:26,880
next generation for instance imagine
 

9671
02:48:26,880 --> 02:48:28,790
next generation for instance imagine
that we would agree that the current

9672
02:48:28,790 --> 02:48:28,800
that we would agree that the current
 

9673
02:48:28,800 --> 02:48:30,389
that we would agree that the current
government of china is largely correct

9674
02:48:30,389 --> 02:48:30,399
government of china is largely correct
 

9675
02:48:30,399 --> 02:48:32,550
government of china is largely correct
and but never limit and maybe we don't

9676
02:48:32,550 --> 02:48:32,560
and but never limit and maybe we don't
 

9677
02:48:32,560 --> 02:48:35,030
and but never limit and maybe we don't
agree on this but if if he did

9678
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:35,040
agree on this but if if he did
 

9679
02:48:35,040 --> 02:48:36,950
agree on this but if if he did
how can we make sure that this stays

9680
02:48:36,950 --> 02:48:36,960
how can we make sure that this stays
 

9681
02:48:36,960 --> 02:48:39,030
how can we make sure that this stays
like this and if you don't have checks

9682
02:48:39,030 --> 02:48:39,040
like this and if you don't have checks
 

9683
02:48:39,040 --> 02:48:42,150
like this and if you don't have checks
and balances uh division of power

9684
02:48:42,150 --> 02:48:42,160
and balances uh division of power
 

9685
02:48:42,160 --> 02:48:43,349
and balances uh division of power
it's hard to achieve we don't have a

9686
02:48:43,349 --> 02:48:43,359
it's hard to achieve we don't have a
 

9687
02:48:43,359 --> 02:48:45,190
it's hard to achieve we don't have a
solution for that problem

9688
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:45,200
solution for that problem
 

9689
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:47,349
solution for that problem
but the abolishment of government

9690
02:48:47,349 --> 02:48:47,359
but the abolishment of government
 

9691
02:48:47,359 --> 02:48:48,950
but the abolishment of government
basically would remove the control

9692
02:48:48,950 --> 02:48:48,960
basically would remove the control
 

9693
02:48:48,960 --> 02:48:51,429
basically would remove the control
structure from a cybernetic perspective

9694
02:48:51,429 --> 02:48:51,439
structure from a cybernetic perspective
 

9695
02:48:51,439 --> 02:48:54,550
structure from a cybernetic perspective
there is an optimal point in the system

9696
02:48:54,550 --> 02:48:54,560
there is an optimal point in the system
 

9697
02:48:54,560 --> 02:48:56,150
there is an optimal point in the system
that the regulation should be happening

9698
02:48:56,150 --> 02:48:56,160
that the regulation should be happening
 

9699
02:48:56,160 --> 02:48:59,030
that the regulation should be happening

9703
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:02,469

the local prisoner's dilemmas get
 

9713
02:49:08,720 --> 02:49:10,870
the local prisoner's dilemmas get
resolved right you cannot resolve the

9714
02:49:10,870 --> 02:49:10,880
resolved right you cannot resolve the
 

9715
02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:12,950
resolved right you cannot resolve the
prisoner's dilemma without some kind of

prisoner's dilemma without some kind of
 

9717
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:14,950
prisoner's dilemma without some kind of

eternal control
 

9719
02:49:14,960 --> 02:49:18,950
eternal control
that emulates an infinite game in a way

9720
02:49:18,950 --> 02:49:18,960
that emulates an infinite game in a way
 

9721
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:20,309
that emulates an infinite game in a way
yeah i mean there

9722
02:49:20,309 --> 02:49:20,319
yeah i mean there
 

9723
02:49:20,319 --> 02:49:22,309
yeah i mean there
there's a sense in which

9724
02:49:22,309 --> 02:49:22,319
there's a sense in which
 

9725
02:49:22,319 --> 02:49:25,030
there's a sense in which
it seems like the reason government

9726
02:49:25,030 --> 02:49:25,040
it seems like the reason government
 

9727
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:26,389
it seems like the reason government
the parts of government that don't work

9728
02:49:26,389 --> 02:49:26,399
the parts of government that don't work
 

9729
02:49:26,399 --> 02:49:27,670
the parts of government that don't work
well currently

9730
02:49:27,670 --> 02:49:27,680
well currently
 

9731
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:30,710
well currently
is because there's not good um

9732
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:30,720
is because there's not good um
 

9733
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:32,790
is because there's not good um

through which to interact for the

02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:37,349
through which to interact for the
citizenry to interact with government is

9740
02:49:37,349 --> 02:49:37,359
citizenry to interact with government is
 

9741
02:49:37,359 --> 02:49:39,190
citizenry to interact with government is
basically it

9742
02:49:39,190 --> 02:49:39,200
basically it
 

9743
02:49:39,200 --> 02:49:40,550
basically it
it hasn't caught up in terms of

it hasn't caught up in terms of
 

9745
02:49:40,560 --> 02:49:43,269
it hasn't caught up in terms of
technology and i think once you

02:49:43,269 --> 02:49:43,279
technology and i think once you
 

9747
02:49:43,279 --> 02:49:45,990
technology and i think once you
integrate some of the digital revolution

integrate some of the digital revolution
 

9749
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,830
integrate some of the digital revolution

um
 

9765
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:07,349
um
that don't require the human ingenuity

9766
02:50:07,349 --> 02:50:07,359
that don't require the human ingenuity
 

9767
02:50:07,359 --> 02:50:08,710
that don't require the human ingenuity
i feel like that's that's where

9768
02:50:08,710 --> 02:50:08,720
i feel like that's that's where
 

9769
02:50:08,720 --> 02:50:10,389
i feel like that's that's where
government could operate that well and

9770
02:50:10,389 --> 02:50:10,399
government could operate that well and
 

9771
02:50:10,399 --> 02:50:11,910
government could operate that well and
can also

9772
02:50:11,910 --> 02:50:11,920
can also
 

9773
02:50:11,920 --> 02:50:13,349
can also
break apart the inefficient

02:50:13,349 --> 02:50:13,359
break apart the inefficient
 

9775
02:50:13,359 --> 02:50:15,510
break apart the inefficient
bureaucracies if needed there'll be a

9776
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:15,520
bureaucracies if needed there'll be a
 

9777
02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:17,349
bureaucracies if needed there'll be a
strong incentive to

strong incentive to
 

9779
02:50:17,359 --> 02:50:18,469
strong incentive to
to um

9780
02:50:18,469 --> 02:50:18,479
to um
 

9781
02:50:18,479 --> 02:50:20,950
to um
to be efficient and successful so out

9782
02:50:20,950 --> 02:50:20,960
to be efficient and successful so out
 

9783
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:23,269
to be efficient and successful so out
human history we see an evolution and

02:50:23,269 --> 02:50:23,279
human history we see an evolution and
 

9785
02:50:23,279 --> 02:50:25,030
human history we see an evolution and
evolutionary competition of modes of

is in these modes and every nation state

is in these modes and every nation state
 

9791
02:50:29,279 --> 02:50:31,269
is in these modes and every nation state
in some sense is some kind of organism

in some sense is some kind of organism
 

9793
02:50:31,279 --> 02:50:33,190
in some sense is some kind of organism
that has found different solutions for

that has found different solutions for

that has found different solutions for
the problem of government

the problem of government
 

9797
02:50:34,960 --> 02:50:36,710
the problem of government
and you could look at all these

9798
02:50:36,710 --> 02:50:36,720
and you could look at all these
 

9799
02:50:36,720 --> 02:50:37,910
and you could look at all these
different models and the different

9800

different models and the different
 

9801
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:40,710
different models and the different

build a better government
 

9807
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:49,110
build a better government
and i suspect that the idea of anarchism

9808
02:50:49,110 --> 02:50:49,120
and i suspect that the idea of anarchism
 

9809
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:51,830
and i suspect that the idea of anarchism
similar to the idea of communism

9810
02:50:51,830 --> 02:50:51,840
similar to the idea of communism
 

9811
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:53,510
similar to the idea of communism
is the result of

9812
02:50:53,510 --> 02:50:53,520
is the result of
 

9813
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:55,670
is the result of
being disenchanted with the ugliness of

being disenchanted with the ugliness of

attempt to get to
 

9819
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:02,469
attempt to get to
an utopia and i suspect that communism

9820
02:51:02,469 --> 02:51:02,479
an utopia and i suspect that communism
 

9821
02:51:02,479 --> 02:51:04,710
an utopia and i suspect that communism
originally was not a utopia i think

9822
02:51:04,710 --> 02:51:04,720
originally was not a utopia i think
 

9823
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:06,150
originally was not a utopia i think
that's in the same way as original

9824
02:51:06,150 --> 02:51:06,160
that's in the same way as original
 

9825

that's in the same way as original
christianity it had a particular kind of

and this vision is a society a mode of
 

9831

organization within the society in which
 

9833
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:17,990
organization within the society in which
humans can

02:51:17,990 --> 02:51:18,000
humans can
 

9835
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:21,030
humans can
coexist at scale without coercion

terrorize each other into compliance
 

9843
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,230
terrorize each other into compliance
but you understand what everybody needs

9848
02:51:33,750 --> 02:51:33,760
contribute and what the intended future
 

9849
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:36,150
contribute and what the intended future
of the whole thing is and you

9850
02:51:36,150 --> 02:51:36,160
of the whole thing is and you
 

9851
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:37,750
of the whole thing is and you
everybody coordinates their behavior in

9852

the right way and informs each other
 

9855
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:41,269
the right way and informs each other
about how to do this and all the

about how to do this and all the
 

9857
02:51:41,279 --> 02:51:42,710
about how to do this and all the
interactions that happen are

interactions that happen are
 

9859

instrumental to making that happen
 

9861
02:51:44,960 --> 02:51:47,429
instrumental to making that happen
right could this happen at scale and i

9862
02:51:47,429 --> 02:51:47,439
right could this happen at scale and i
 

9863
02:51:47,439 --> 02:51:49,110
right could this happen at scale and i
think this is the idea of communism

9864
02:51:49,110 --> 02:51:49,120
think this is the idea of communism
 

9865
02:51:49,120 --> 02:51:51,590
think this is the idea of communism
communism is opposed to the idea that we

9866
02:51:51,590 --> 02:51:51,600
communism is opposed to the idea that we
 

9867
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:54,150
communism is opposed to the idea that we
need economic terror or other forms of

9868
02:51:54,150 --> 02:51:54,160
need economic terror or other forms of
 

9869
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:55,910
need economic terror or other forms of
terror to make that happen but in

9870
02:51:55,910 --> 02:51:55,920
terror to make that happen but in
 

9871
02:51:55,920 --> 02:51:57,990
terror to make that happen but in
practice what happened is that the

9872
02:51:57,990 --> 02:51:58,000
practice what happened is that the
 

9873
02:51:58,000 --> 02:51:59,670
practice what happened is that the
proto-communist countries the real

9874
02:51:59,670 --> 02:51:59,680
proto-communist countries the real
 

9875
02:51:59,680 --> 02:52:02,150
proto-communist countries the real
existing socialism replaced a part of

9876
02:52:02,150 --> 02:52:02,160
existing socialism replaced a part of
 

9877
02:52:02,160 --> 02:52:04,550
existing socialism replaced a part of
the economic terror of his moral terror

9878
02:52:04,550 --> 02:52:04,560
the economic terror of his moral terror
 

9879
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:06,309
the economic terror of his moral terror
right so we were told to do the right

9880
02:52:06,309 --> 02:52:06,319
right so we were told to do the right
 

9881
02:52:06,319 --> 02:52:08,230
right so we were told to do the right
thing for moral reasons and of course it

9882
02:52:08,230 --> 02:52:08,240
thing for moral reasons and of course it
 

9883
02:52:08,240 --> 02:52:10,150
thing for moral reasons and of course it
didn't really work and the economy

9884
02:52:10,150 --> 02:52:10,160
didn't really work and the economy
 

9885
02:52:10,160 --> 02:52:12,230
didn't really work and the economy
eventually collapsed and the immoral

9886
02:52:12,230 --> 02:52:12,240
eventually collapsed and the immoral
 

9887
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:14,469
eventually collapsed and the immoral
terror had actual real cause right

9888
02:52:14,469 --> 02:52:14,479
terror had actual real cause right
 

9889
02:52:14,479 --> 02:52:16,389
terror had actual real cause right
people were in prison because they were

9890
02:52:16,389 --> 02:52:16,399
people were in prison because they were
 

9891
02:52:16,399 --> 02:52:18,870
people were in prison because they were
morally non-compliant

9892
02:52:18,870 --> 02:52:18,880
morally non-compliant
 

9893
02:52:18,880 --> 02:52:20,389
morally non-compliant
and

9894
02:52:20,389 --> 02:52:20,399
and
 

9895
02:52:20,399 --> 02:52:21,510
and
that is

9896
02:52:21,510 --> 02:52:21,520
that is
 

9897
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:22,950
that is
the other thing is that the idea of

9898
02:52:22,950 --> 02:52:22,960
the other thing is that the idea of
 

9899
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:25,030
the other thing is that the idea of
communism became a utopia so it

9900
02:52:25,030 --> 02:52:25,040
communism became a utopia so it
 

9901
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:27,030
communism became a utopia so it
basically was projected to the afterlife

9902
02:52:27,030 --> 02:52:27,040
basically was projected to the afterlife
 

9903
02:52:27,040 --> 02:52:29,830
basically was projected to the afterlife
we were told in in my childhood that

9904
02:52:29,830 --> 02:52:29,840
we were told in in my childhood that
 

9905
02:52:29,840 --> 02:52:32,150
we were told in in my childhood that
communism was a hypothetical society to

9906
02:52:32,150 --> 02:52:32,160
communism was a hypothetical society to
 

9907
02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:34,150
communism was a hypothetical society to
which we were in a permanent revolution

9908
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:34,160
which we were in a permanent revolution
 

9909
02:52:34,160 --> 02:52:36,070
which we were in a permanent revolution
that justified everything was presently

9910
02:52:36,070 --> 02:52:36,080
that justified everything was presently
 

9911
02:52:36,080 --> 02:52:38,790
that justified everything was presently
wrong with society morally but it was

9912
02:52:38,790 --> 02:52:38,800
wrong with society morally but it was
 

9913
02:52:38,800 --> 02:52:40,309
wrong with society morally but it was
something that our grandchildren

9914
02:52:40,309 --> 02:52:40,319
something that our grandchildren
 

9915
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:42,309
something that our grandchildren
probably would not ever see because it

9916
02:52:42,309 --> 02:52:42,319
probably would not ever see because it
 

9917
02:52:42,319 --> 02:52:44,630
probably would not ever see because it
was too ideal and too far in the future

9918
02:52:44,630 --> 02:52:44,640
was too ideal and too far in the future
 

9919
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:46,309
was too ideal and too far in the future
to make it happen right now and people

9920
02:52:46,309 --> 02:52:46,319
to make it happen right now and people
 

9921
02:52:46,319 --> 02:52:48,469
to make it happen right now and people
were just not there yet morally

9922
02:52:48,469 --> 02:52:48,479
were just not there yet morally
 

9923
02:52:48,479 --> 02:52:50,389
were just not there yet morally
and the same thing happened with

9924
02:52:50,389 --> 02:52:50,399
and the same thing happened with
 

9925
02:52:50,399 --> 02:52:52,550
and the same thing happened with
christianity right this notion of heaven

9926
02:52:52,550 --> 02:52:52,560
christianity right this notion of heaven
 

9927
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:54,710
christianity right this notion of heaven
was mythologized and projected into an

9928
02:52:54,710 --> 02:52:54,720
was mythologized and projected into an
 

9929
02:52:54,720 --> 02:52:56,309
was mythologized and projected into an
afterlife and i think this was just the

9930
02:52:56,309 --> 02:52:56,319
afterlife and i think this was just the
 

9931
02:52:56,319 --> 02:52:59,030
afterlife and i think this was just the
idea of god's kingdom of this world in

9932
02:52:59,030 --> 02:52:59,040
idea of god's kingdom of this world in
 

9933
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:00,710
idea of god's kingdom of this world in
which we instantiate the next level

9934
02:53:00,710 --> 02:53:00,720
which we instantiate the next level
 

9935
02:53:00,720 --> 02:53:02,870
which we instantiate the next level
transcendental agent in the perfect form

9936
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:02,880
transcendental agent in the perfect form
 

9937
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:05,030
transcendental agent in the perfect form
so everything goes smoothly and without

9938
02:53:05,030 --> 02:53:05,040
so everything goes smoothly and without
 

9939
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:06,630
so everything goes smoothly and without
violence and without conflict and

9940
02:53:06,630 --> 02:53:06,640
violence and without conflict and
 

9941
02:53:06,640 --> 02:53:09,269
violence and without conflict and
without this human messiness on this

9942
02:53:09,269 --> 02:53:09,279
without this human messiness on this
 

9943
02:53:09,279 --> 02:53:11,510
without this human messiness on this
economic messiness and the terror and

9944
02:53:11,510 --> 02:53:11,520
economic messiness and the terror and
 

9945
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:13,510
economic messiness and the terror and
coercion that existed in the present

9946
02:53:13,510 --> 02:53:13,520
coercion that existed in the present
 

9947
02:53:13,520 --> 02:53:14,790
coercion that existed in the present
societies

9948
02:53:14,790 --> 02:53:14,800
societies
 

9949
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:16,630
societies
and the idea of that the humans can

9950
02:53:16,630 --> 02:53:16,640
and the idea of that the humans can
 

9951
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:18,790
and the idea of that the humans can
exist at scale in a harmonious way

9952
02:53:18,790 --> 02:53:18,800
exist at scale in a harmonious way
 

9953
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:22,070
exist at scale in a harmonious way
non-coercively is untested right a lot

9954
02:53:22,070 --> 02:53:22,080
non-coercively is untested right a lot
 

9955
02:53:22,080 --> 02:53:23,670
non-coercively is untested right a lot
of people tested it but didn't get it to

9956
02:53:23,670 --> 02:53:23,680
of people tested it but didn't get it to
 

9957
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:25,110
of people tested it but didn't get it to
work so far

9958
02:53:25,110 --> 02:53:25,120
work so far
 

9959
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:27,269
work so far
and the utopia is a world in where you

9960
02:53:27,269 --> 02:53:27,279
and the utopia is a world in where you
 

9961
02:53:27,279 --> 02:53:28,950
and the utopia is a world in where you
get all the good things without any of

9962
02:53:28,950 --> 02:53:28,960
get all the good things without any of
 

9963
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:30,630
get all the good things without any of
the bad things

9964
02:53:30,630 --> 02:53:30,640
the bad things
 

9965
02:53:30,640 --> 02:53:33,269
the bad things
and you are i think very susceptible to

9966
02:53:33,269 --> 02:53:33,279
and you are i think very susceptible to
 

9967
02:53:33,279 --> 02:53:34,870
and you are i think very susceptible to
believe in utopia when you are very

9968
02:53:34,870 --> 02:53:34,880
believe in utopia when you are very
 

9969
02:53:34,880 --> 02:53:36,630
believe in utopia when you are very
young and don't understand

9970
02:53:36,630 --> 02:53:36,640
young and don't understand
 

9971
02:53:36,640 --> 02:53:38,870
young and don't understand
that everything has to happen in causal

9972
02:53:38,870 --> 02:53:38,880
that everything has to happen in causal
 

9973
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:40,469
that everything has to happen in causal
patterns that there is always feedback

9974
02:53:40,469 --> 02:53:40,479
patterns that there is always feedback
 

9975
02:53:40,479 --> 02:53:42,550
patterns that there is always feedback
loops that ultimately are closed there's

9976
02:53:42,550 --> 02:53:42,560
loops that ultimately are closed there's
 

9977
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:44,150
loops that ultimately are closed there's
nothing that just happens because it's

9978
02:53:44,150 --> 02:53:44,160
nothing that just happens because it's
 

9979
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:46,630
nothing that just happens because it's
good or bad good or bad don't exist in

9980
02:53:46,630 --> 02:53:46,640
good or bad good or bad don't exist in
 

9981
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:48,790
good or bad good or bad don't exist in
isolation they only exist with respect

9982
02:53:48,790 --> 02:53:48,800
isolation they only exist with respect
 

9983
02:53:48,800 --> 02:53:50,630
isolation they only exist with respect
to larger systems

9984
02:53:50,630 --> 02:53:50,640
to larger systems
 

9985
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:51,429
to larger systems
so

9986
02:53:51,429 --> 02:53:51,439
so
 

9987
02:53:51,439 --> 02:53:56,230
so
can you intuit why utopias fail as uh as

9988
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:56,240
can you intuit why utopias fail as uh as
 

9989
02:53:56,240 --> 02:53:57,670
can you intuit why utopias fail as uh as
systems

9990
02:53:57,670 --> 02:53:57,680
systems
 

9991
02:53:57,680 --> 02:53:59,990
systems
so like having a utopia that's out there

9992
02:53:59,990 --> 02:54:00,000
so like having a utopia that's out there
 

9993
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:03,510
so like having a utopia that's out there
beyond the horizon is it because then

9994
02:54:03,510 --> 02:54:03,520
beyond the horizon is it because then
 

9995
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:04,630
beyond the horizon is it because then
um

9996
02:54:04,630 --> 02:54:04,640
um
 

9997
02:54:04,640 --> 02:54:06,550
um
so it's not only because it's impossible

9998
02:54:06,550 --> 02:54:06,560
so it's not only because it's impossible
 

9999
02:54:06,560 --> 02:54:09,910
so it's not only because it's impossible
to achieve utopias but it's because

10000
02:54:09,910 --> 02:54:09,920
to achieve utopias but it's because
 

10001
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:12,950
to achieve utopias but it's because
what certain humans certain small number

10002
02:54:12,950 --> 02:54:12,960
what certain humans certain small number
 

10003
02:54:12,960 --> 02:54:14,710
what certain humans certain small number
of humans start

10004
02:54:14,710 --> 02:54:14,720
of humans start
 

10005
02:54:14,720 --> 02:54:16,389
of humans start

um
 

10009
02:54:18,399 --> 02:54:22,389
um
sort of greedily attain power and money

10010
02:54:22,389 --> 02:54:22,399
sort of greedily attain power and money
 

10011
02:54:22,399 --> 02:54:25,429
sort of greedily attain power and money
and control and influence

10012
02:54:25,429 --> 02:54:25,439

10013
02:54:25,439 --> 02:54:26,550
and control and influence
as they

02:54:28,080 --> 02:54:29,030
become uh
uh

10018
02:54:29,030 --> 02:54:29,040
uh
 

10019
02:54:29,040 --> 02:54:32,469
uh
as they see the power in uh using this

10020
02:54:32,469 --> 02:54:32,479
as they see the power in uh using this
 

10021

uh
 

10023
02:54:33,279 --> 02:54:35,030
uh
idea of a utopia it's probably like

10024
02:54:35,030 --> 02:54:35,040
idea of a utopia it's probably like
 

10025
02:54:35,040 --> 02:54:37,349
idea of a utopia it's probably like
saying why is my garden not perfect it's

10026
02:54:37,349 --> 02:54:37,359
saying why is my garden not perfect it's
 

10027
02:54:37,359 --> 02:54:39,429
saying why is my garden not perfect it's
because some evil weeds are overgrowing

10028
02:54:39,429 --> 02:54:39,439
because some evil weeds are overgrowing
 

10029
02:54:39,439 --> 02:54:41,750
because some evil weeds are overgrowing
it and they always do yeah right but

10030
02:54:41,750 --> 02:54:41,760
it and they always do yeah right but
 

10031
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:43,910
it and they always do yeah right but
this is not how it works a good garden

10032
02:54:43,910 --> 02:54:43,920
this is not how it works a good garden
 

10033
02:54:43,920 --> 02:54:45,590
this is not how it works a good garden
is a system that is in balance and

10034
02:54:45,590 --> 02:54:45,600
is a system that is in balance and
 

10035
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:47,349
is a system that is in balance and
requires minimal interactions by the

10036
02:54:47,349 --> 02:54:47,359
requires minimal interactions by the
 

10037
02:54:47,359 --> 02:54:48,630
requires minimal interactions by the
gardener

10038
02:54:48,630 --> 02:54:48,640
gardener
 

10039
02:54:48,640 --> 02:54:49,750
gardener
and

10040
02:54:49,750 --> 02:54:49,760
and
 

10041
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:52,230
and
so you need to create a system that is

10042
02:54:52,230 --> 02:54:52,240
so you need to create a system that is
 

10043
02:54:52,240 --> 02:54:54,469
so you need to create a system that is
designed to self stabilize and the

10044
02:54:54,469 --> 02:54:54,479
designed to self stabilize and the
 

10045
02:54:54,479 --> 02:54:56,469
designed to self stabilize and the
design of social systems requires not

10046
02:54:56,469 --> 02:54:56,479
design of social systems requires not
 

10047
02:54:56,479 --> 02:54:58,070
design of social systems requires not
just the implementation of the desired

10048
02:54:58,070 --> 02:54:58,080
just the implementation of the desired
 

10049
02:54:58,080 --> 02:54:59,910
just the implementation of the desired
functionality but the next level design

10050
02:54:59,910 --> 02:54:59,920
functionality but the next level design
 

10051
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:02,150
functionality but the next level design
but also in biological systems you need

10052
02:55:02,150 --> 02:55:02,160
but also in biological systems you need
 

10053
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:03,510
but also in biological systems you need
to create a system that wants to

10054
02:55:03,510 --> 02:55:03,520
to create a system that wants to
 

10055
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:05,990
to create a system that wants to
converge to the intended function

10056
02:55:05,990 --> 02:55:06,000
converge to the intended function
 

10057
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,070
converge to the intended function
right so instead of just creating an

10058
02:55:08,070 --> 02:55:08,080
right so instead of just creating an
 

10059
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:09,670
right so instead of just creating an
institution like the fda that is

10060
02:55:09,670 --> 02:55:09,680
institution like the fda that is
 

10061
02:55:09,680 --> 02:55:12,230
institution like the fda that is
performing a particular kind of rule a

10062
02:55:12,230 --> 02:55:12,240
performing a particular kind of rule a
 

10063
02:55:12,240 --> 02:55:14,309
performing a particular kind of rule a
role in society you need to make sure

10064
02:55:14,309 --> 02:55:14,319
role in society you need to make sure
 

10065
02:55:14,319 --> 02:55:15,990
role in society you need to make sure
that the fda is actually driven by a

10066
02:55:15,990 --> 02:55:16,000
that the fda is actually driven by a
 

10067
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,150
that the fda is actually driven by a
system that wants to do this optimally

10068
02:55:18,150 --> 02:55:18,160
system that wants to do this optimally
 

10069
02:55:18,160 --> 02:55:19,910
system that wants to do this optimally
that is incentivize the root optimally

10070
02:55:19,910 --> 02:55:19,920
that is incentivize the root optimally
 

10071
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:22,710
that is incentivize the root optimally
and then makes the performance that is

10072
02:55:22,710 --> 02:55:22,720
and then makes the performance that is
 

10073
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:24,230
and then makes the performance that is
actually enacted in every generation

10074
02:55:24,230 --> 02:55:24,240
actually enacted in every generation
 

10075
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:26,870
actually enacted in every generation
instrumental to that thing that actual

10076
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:26,880
instrumental to that thing that actual
 

10077
02:55:26,880 --> 02:55:29,030
instrumental to that thing that actual
goal right and that is much harder to

10078
02:55:29,030 --> 02:55:29,040
goal right and that is much harder to
 

10079
02:55:29,040 --> 02:55:30,630
goal right and that is much harder to
design and to achieve so you have to

10080
02:55:30,630 --> 02:55:30,640
design and to achieve so you have to
 

10081
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:32,389
design and to achieve so you have to
design a system where

10082
02:55:32,389 --> 02:55:32,399
design a system where
 

10083
02:55:32,399 --> 02:55:35,030
design a system where

just it wasn't working given human
 

10097
02:55:45,359 --> 02:55:46,790
just it wasn't working given human
naturally the incentives were not

10098
02:55:46,790 --> 02:55:46,800
naturally the incentives were not
 

10099
02:55:46,800 --> 02:55:47,990
naturally the incentives were not
correct

10100
02:55:47,990 --> 02:55:48,000
correct
 

10101
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:49,349
correct
how do you uh

10102
02:55:49,349 --> 02:55:49,359
how do you uh
 

10103
02:55:49,359 --> 02:55:51,510
how do you uh
incentivize people when they are getting

10104
02:55:51,510 --> 02:55:51,520
incentivize people when they are getting
 

10105
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:53,269
incentivize people when they are getting
coal off the ground to work as hard as

10106
02:55:53,269 --> 02:55:53,279
coal off the ground to work as hard as
 

10107
02:55:53,279 --> 02:55:55,750
coal off the ground to work as hard as
possible because it's a terrible job and

10108
02:55:55,750 --> 02:55:55,760
possible because it's a terrible job and
 

10109
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:58,389
possible because it's a terrible job and
it's very bad for your health and

10110
02:55:58,389 --> 02:55:58,399
it's very bad for your health and
 

10111
02:55:58,399 --> 02:56:00,950
it's very bad for your health and
right how do you do this and you can uh

10112
02:56:00,950 --> 02:56:00,960
right how do you do this and you can uh
 

10113
02:56:00,960 --> 02:56:03,590
right how do you do this and you can uh
give them prices and medals and status

10114
02:56:03,590 --> 02:56:03,600
give them prices and medals and status
 

10115
02:56:03,600 --> 02:56:05,110
give them prices and medals and status
to some degree right there's only so

10116
02:56:05,110 --> 02:56:05,120
to some degree right there's only so
 

10117
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:07,269
to some degree right there's only so
much status to give for that and most

10118
02:56:07,269 --> 02:56:07,279
much status to give for that and most
 

10119
02:56:07,279 --> 02:56:09,269
much status to give for that and most
people will not fall for this yeah right

10120
02:56:09,269 --> 02:56:09,279
people will not fall for this yeah right
 

10121
02:56:09,279 --> 02:56:10,710
people will not fall for this yeah right
or you can pay them

10122
02:56:10,710 --> 02:56:10,720
or you can pay them
 

10123
02:56:10,720 --> 02:56:12,790
or you can pay them
or uh and you probably have to pay them

10124
02:56:12,790 --> 02:56:12,800
or uh and you probably have to pay them
 

10125
02:56:12,800 --> 02:56:14,630
or uh and you probably have to pay them
an asymmetric way because if you pay

10126
02:56:14,630 --> 02:56:14,640
an asymmetric way because if you pay
 

10127
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:17,030
an asymmetric way because if you pay
everybody the same and they uh

10128
02:56:17,030 --> 02:56:17,040
everybody the same and they uh
 

10129
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:19,190
everybody the same and they uh
you nationalize the coal mines

10130
02:56:19,190 --> 02:56:19,200
you nationalize the coal mines
 

10131
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:20,630
you nationalize the coal mines
eventually people will figure out that

10132
02:56:20,630 --> 02:56:20,640
eventually people will figure out that
 

10133
02:56:20,640 --> 02:56:23,110
eventually people will figure out that
they can game the system yes so you're

10134
02:56:23,110 --> 02:56:23,120
they can game the system yes so you're
 

10135
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:25,670
they can game the system yes so you're
you're describing capitalism

10136
02:56:25,670 --> 02:56:25,680
you're describing capitalism
 

10137
02:56:25,680 --> 02:56:27,910
you're describing capitalism
so capitalism is the present solution to

10138
02:56:27,910 --> 02:56:27,920
so capitalism is the present solution to
 

10139
02:56:27,920 --> 02:56:30,630
so capitalism is the present solution to
the system and what he also noticed that

10140
02:56:30,630 --> 02:56:30,640
the system and what he also noticed that
 

10141
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:32,630
the system and what he also noticed that
i think that marx was correct in saying

10142
02:56:32,630 --> 02:56:32,640
i think that marx was correct in saying
 

10143
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:35,670
i think that marx was correct in saying
that capitalism is prone to crisis that

10144
02:56:35,670 --> 02:56:35,680
that capitalism is prone to crisis that
 

10145
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:37,910
that capitalism is prone to crisis that
capitalism is a system that in its

10146
02:56:37,910 --> 02:56:37,920
capitalism is a system that in its
 

10147
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:40,710
capitalism is a system that in its
dynamics is not convergent but divergent

10148
02:56:40,710 --> 02:56:40,720
dynamics is not convergent but divergent
 

10149
02:56:40,720 --> 02:56:42,870
dynamics is not convergent but divergent
it's not a stable system

10150
02:56:42,870 --> 02:56:42,880
it's not a stable system
 

10151
02:56:42,880 --> 02:56:45,429
it's not a stable system
and that eventually it produces an

10152
02:56:45,429 --> 02:56:45,439
and that eventually it produces an
 

10153
02:56:45,439 --> 02:56:46,790
and that eventually it produces an
enormous

10154
02:56:46,790 --> 02:56:46,800
enormous
 

10155
02:56:46,800 --> 02:56:48,950
enormous
potential for productivity

10156
02:56:48,950 --> 02:56:48,960
potential for productivity
 

10157
02:56:48,960 --> 02:56:50,710
potential for productivity
but it also is systematically

10158
02:56:50,710 --> 02:56:50,720
but it also is systematically
 

10159
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:52,630
but it also is systematically
misallocating resources so a lot of

10160
02:56:52,630 --> 02:56:52,640
misallocating resources so a lot of
 

10161
02:56:52,640 --> 02:56:54,710
misallocating resources so a lot of
people cannot participate

10162
02:56:54,710 --> 02:56:54,720
people cannot participate
 

10163
02:56:54,720 --> 02:56:56,230
people cannot participate
in the production and consumption

10164
02:56:56,230 --> 02:56:56,240
in the production and consumption
 

10165
02:56:56,240 --> 02:56:58,550
in the production and consumption
anymore and this is what we observe we

10166
02:56:58,550 --> 02:56:58,560
anymore and this is what we observe we
 

10167
02:56:58,560 --> 02:57:00,630
anymore and this is what we observe we
observe that the middle class in the us

10168
02:57:00,630 --> 02:57:00,640
observe that the middle class in the us
 

10169
02:57:00,640 --> 02:57:02,309
observe that the middle class in the us
is tiny

10170
02:57:02,309 --> 02:57:02,319
is tiny
 

10171
02:57:02,319 --> 02:57:03,830
is tiny
it's uh

10172
02:57:03,830 --> 02:57:03,840
it's uh
 

10173
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:04,870
it's uh
a lot of people think that they're

10174
02:57:04,870 --> 02:57:04,880
a lot of people think that they're
 

10175
02:57:04,880 --> 02:57:06,950
a lot of people think that they're
middle class but if you are still flying

10176
02:57:06,950 --> 02:57:06,960
middle class but if you are still flying
 

10177
02:57:06,960 --> 02:57:10,950
middle class but if you are still flying
economy you're not middle class

10178
02:57:10,950 --> 02:57:10,960

 

10179
02:57:10,960 --> 02:57:11,670

right

10180
02:57:11,670 --> 02:57:11,680
right
 

10181
02:57:11,680 --> 02:57:14,710
right
every class is a magnitude smaller class

10182
02:57:14,710 --> 02:57:14,720

um so there's a big gap in terms of the
 

10213
02:57:47,840 --> 02:57:50,309
um so there's a big gap in terms of the
productivity that our society could have

basically start to see the world through
their eyes and you understand that in a

10292
02:59:11,670 --> 02:59:11,680
their eyes and you understand that in a
 

10293
02:59:11,680 --> 02:59:13,510
their eyes and you understand that in a
given situation they cannot do anything

10294
02:59:13,510 --> 02:59:13,520
given situation they cannot do anything
 

10295

and
 

10315
02:59:29,279 --> 02:59:30,630
and
has to do this right now and you have

10316
02:59:30,630 --> 02:59:30,640
has to do this right now and you have

this a small child that is um if
when he was a baby and so on where he

10320
02:59:35,269 --> 02:59:35,279
when he was a baby and so on where he
 

10321
02:59:35,279 --> 02:59:37,269
when he was a baby and so on where he
was just immediately expressing what he

10322
02:59:37,269 --> 02:59:37,279
was just immediately expressing what he
 

10323
02:59:37,279 --> 02:59:38,710

because you said the f
like a fundamental aspect of that is is

like a fundamental aspect of that is is
 

10363
03:00:18,399 --> 03:00:19,349

what role does love play

10372
03:00:29,510 --> 03:00:29,520
what role does love play
 

10373
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:32,230
what role does love play
in the human condition

10374
03:00:32,230 --> 03:00:32,240
in the human condition
 

10375
03:00:32,240 --> 03:00:34,550
in the human condition
i think that love is the facilitator of

10376
03:00:34,550 --> 03:00:34,560
i think that love is the facilitator of
 

10377

i think that love is the facilitator of

non-transsexual interaction
 

10379

non-transsexual interaction
you are um

10380
03:00:39,510 --> 03:00:39,520
you are um
 

10381
03:00:39,520 --> 03:00:41,190
you are um
observing your own purposes some of

10382
03:00:41,190 --> 03:00:41,200
observing your own purposes some of
 

10383
03:00:41,200 --> 03:00:43,269
observing your own purposes some of
these purposes go beyond your ego they

10384
03:00:43,269 --> 03:00:43,279
these purposes go beyond your ego they
 

10385
03:00:43,279 --> 03:00:45,910
these purposes go beyond your ego they
go beyond the particular organism that

10386
03:00:45,910 --> 03:00:45,920
go beyond the particular organism that
 

10387
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:47,670
go beyond the particular organism that
you are and your local interests that's

10388
03:00:47,670 --> 03:00:47,680
you are and your local interests that's
 

10389
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:49,429
you are and your local interests that's
what you mean by non-transactional yes

10390
03:00:49,429 --> 03:00:49,439
what you mean by non-transactional yes
 

10391
03:00:49,439 --> 03:00:50,950
what you mean by non-transactional yes
so basically when you are acting in

10392
03:00:50,950 --> 03:00:50,960
so basically when you are acting in
 

10393
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:52,710
so basically when you are acting in
transactional way it means that you are

10394
03:00:52,710 --> 03:00:52,720
transactional way it means that you are
 

10395
03:00:52,720 --> 03:00:55,750
transactional way it means that you are
respecting something in return for you

10396
03:00:55,750 --> 03:00:55,760
respecting something in return for you
 

10397

the i mean the feeling itself of joy is
a kind of benefit

a kind of benefit
 

10437
03:01:32,560 --> 03:01:34,710
a kind of benefit
is the kind of transaction

10438
03:01:34,710 --> 03:01:34,720
is the kind of transaction
 

10439
03:01:34,720 --> 03:01:36,870
is the kind of transaction
like yes but the joy is not the point

10440
03:01:36,870 --> 03:01:36,880
like yes but the joy is not the point
 

10441
03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:39,030
like yes but the joy is not the point
the joy is the signal that you get it's

03:01:39,030 --> 03:01:39,040
the joy is the signal that you get it's
 

10443

the joy is the signal that you get it's
the reinforcement signal that your brain

the reinforcement signal that your brain
 

10445
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:43,269
the reinforcement signal that your brain
sends to you because you are acting on

03:01:43,269 --> 03:01:43,279
sends to you because you are acting on
 

10447
03:01:43,279 --> 03:01:45,110
sends to you because you are acting on
the incentives of the agent that you're

the incentives of the agent that you're

larger right this is the way in which we
out-competed other hominins

uh take their neanderthals uh yeah right
and also other humans uh right there was

10462
03:02:00,230 --> 03:02:00,240
and also other humans uh right there was
 

10463
03:02:00,240 --> 03:02:02,630
and also other humans uh right there was
a population bottleneck for a human

10464
03:02:02,630 --> 03:02:02,640
a population bottleneck for a human
 

10465
03:02:02,640 --> 03:02:04,309
a population bottleneck for a human
society that

10466

society that
 

10467
03:02:04,319 --> 03:02:06,630
society that
leads to an extreme lack of genetic

10468
03:02:06,630 --> 03:02:06,640
leads to an extreme lack of genetic
 

10469
03:02:06,640 --> 03:02:09,510
leads to an extreme lack of genetic
diversity among humans if you look at

10470
03:02:09,510 --> 03:02:09,520
diversity among humans if you look at
 

10471
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:12,630
diversity among humans if you look at
bushmen in the kalahari that basically

10472
03:02:12,630 --> 03:02:12,640
bushmen in the kalahari that basically
 

10473
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:14,309
bushmen in the kalahari that basically
tribes that are not that far distant to

10474
03:02:14,309 --> 03:02:14,319
tribes that are not that far distant to
 

10475
03:02:14,319 --> 03:02:16,230
tribes that are not that far distant to
each other have more genetic diversity

10476
03:02:16,230 --> 03:02:16,240
each other have more genetic diversity
 

10477
03:02:16,240 --> 03:02:17,990
each other have more genetic diversity
that exists between

10478
03:02:17,990 --> 03:02:18,000
that exists between
 

10479
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:19,990
that exists between
europeans and chinese

10480
03:02:19,990 --> 03:02:20,000
europeans and chinese
 

10481
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:21,670
europeans and chinese
and it's because basically the out of

10482
03:02:21,670 --> 03:02:21,680
and it's because basically the out of
 

10483
03:02:21,680 --> 03:02:23,750
and it's because basically the out of
africa population

10484
03:02:23,750 --> 03:02:23,760
africa population
 

10485
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:25,910
africa population
at some point had a bottleneck of just a

10486
03:02:25,910 --> 03:02:25,920
at some point had a bottleneck of just a
 

10487
03:02:25,920 --> 03:02:28,070
at some point had a bottleneck of just a
few thousand individuals

10488
03:02:28,070 --> 03:02:28,080
few thousand individuals
 

10489
03:02:28,080 --> 03:02:30,469
few thousand individuals
and what probably happened is not that

10490
03:02:30,469 --> 03:02:30,479
and what probably happened is not that
 

10491
03:02:30,479 --> 03:02:32,950
and what probably happened is not that
at any time the number of people shrunk

10492
03:02:32,950 --> 03:02:32,960
at any time the number of people shrunk
 

10493
03:02:32,960 --> 03:02:35,030
at any time the number of people shrunk
below a few hundred thousand

10494
03:02:35,030 --> 03:02:35,040
below a few hundred thousand
 

10495
03:02:35,040 --> 03:02:36,790
below a few hundred thousand
what probably happened is that there was

10496
03:02:36,790 --> 03:02:36,800
what probably happened is that there was
 

10497
03:02:36,800 --> 03:02:38,790
what probably happened is that there was
a small group that had a decisive

10498
03:02:38,790 --> 03:02:38,800
a small group that had a decisive
 

10499
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:40,870
a small group that had a decisive
mutation that produced an advantage and

10500
03:02:40,870 --> 03:02:40,880
mutation that produced an advantage and
 

10501
03:02:40,880 --> 03:02:42,389
mutation that produced an advantage and
this group multiplied and killed

10502
03:02:42,389 --> 03:02:42,399
this group multiplied and killed
 

10503
03:02:42,399 --> 03:02:45,030
this group multiplied and killed
everybody else and we are descendants of

10504
03:02:45,030 --> 03:02:45,040
everybody else and we are descendants of
 

10505
03:02:45,040 --> 03:02:46,070
everybody else and we are descendants of
that group

10506
03:02:46,070 --> 03:02:46,080
that group
 

10507
03:02:46,080 --> 03:02:48,790
that group
yeah i i wonder what uh the the the

10508
03:02:48,790 --> 03:02:48,800
yeah i i wonder what uh the the the
 

10509
03:02:48,800 --> 03:02:52,070
yeah i i wonder what uh the the the
peculiar characteristics of that group

10510
03:02:52,070 --> 03:02:52,080
peculiar characteristics of that group
 

10511
03:02:52,080 --> 03:02:53,110
peculiar characteristics of that group
yeah

10512
03:02:53,110 --> 03:02:53,120
yeah
 

10513
03:02:53,120 --> 03:02:54,870
yeah
i mean we never know and a lot of people

10514
03:02:54,870 --> 03:02:54,880
i mean we never know and a lot of people
 

10515
03:02:54,880 --> 03:02:56,790
i mean we never know and a lot of people
do and we can only we can only just

10516
03:02:56,790 --> 03:02:56,800
do and we can only we can only just
 

10517
03:02:56,800 --> 03:02:59,030
do and we can only we can only just
listen to the echoes in our like the the

10518
03:02:59,030 --> 03:02:59,040
listen to the echoes in our like the the
 

10519
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:01,910
listen to the echoes in our like the the
ripples uh that are still within us so i

10520
03:03:01,910 --> 03:03:01,920
ripples uh that are still within us so i
 

10521
03:03:01,920 --> 03:03:03,910
ripples uh that are still within us so i
suspect what eventually made a big

10522
03:03:03,910 --> 03:03:03,920
suspect what eventually made a big
 

10523
03:03:03,920 --> 03:03:06,070
suspect what eventually made a big
difference was the ability to organize

10524
03:03:06,070 --> 03:03:06,080
difference was the ability to organize
 

10525
03:03:06,080 --> 03:03:10,070
difference was the ability to organize
at scale people to program each other

10526
03:03:10,070 --> 03:03:10,080
at scale people to program each other
 

10527
03:03:10,080 --> 03:03:12,550
at scale people to program each other
good ideas that we became programmable

10528
03:03:12,550 --> 03:03:12,560
good ideas that we became programmable
 

10529
03:03:12,560 --> 03:03:14,469
good ideas that we became programmable
that we are willing to work on lockstep

10530
03:03:14,469 --> 03:03:14,479
that we are willing to work on lockstep
 

10531
03:03:14,479 --> 03:03:17,030
that we are willing to work on lockstep
that we went below uh above the tribal

10532
03:03:17,030 --> 03:03:17,040
that we went below uh above the tribal
 

10533
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:19,190
that we went below uh above the tribal
level that we no longer were hoops over

10534
03:03:19,190 --> 03:03:19,200
level that we no longer were hoops over
 

10535
03:03:19,200 --> 03:03:21,590
level that we no longer were hoops over
a few hundred individuals and uh acted

10536
03:03:21,590 --> 03:03:21,600
a few hundred individuals and uh acted
 

10537
03:03:21,600 --> 03:03:23,190
a few hundred individuals and uh acted
on direct deportation systems

10538
03:03:23,190 --> 03:03:23,200
on direct deportation systems
 

10539
03:03:23,200 --> 03:03:25,750
on direct deportation systems
transactionally but that we basically

10540
03:03:25,750 --> 03:03:25,760
transactionally but that we basically
 

10541
03:03:25,760 --> 03:03:27,990
transactionally but that we basically
evolved an adaptation to become state

10542
03:03:27,990 --> 03:03:28,000
evolved an adaptation to become state
 

10543
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:28,950
evolved an adaptation to become state
building

10544
03:03:28,950 --> 03:03:28,960
building
 

10545
03:03:28,960 --> 03:03:31,670
building
yeah

10546
03:03:31,670 --> 03:03:31,680

 

10547
03:03:31,680 --> 03:03:34,790

to do to form collectives outside of the

10548
03:03:34,790 --> 03:03:34,800
to do to form collectives outside of the
 

10549
03:03:34,800 --> 03:03:36,070
to do to form collectives outside of the
direct collective yes and that's

10550
03:03:36,070 --> 03:03:36,080
direct collective yes and that's
 

10551
03:03:36,080 --> 03:03:38,550
direct collective yes and that's
basically a part of us became committed

10552
03:03:38,550 --> 03:03:38,560
basically a part of us became committed
 

10553
03:03:38,560 --> 03:03:40,710
basically a part of us became committed
to serving something outside

10554
03:03:40,710 --> 03:03:40,720
to serving something outside
 

10555
03:03:40,720 --> 03:03:41,910
to serving something outside
of what we know

10556
03:03:41,910 --> 03:03:41,920
of what we know
 

10557
03:03:41,920 --> 03:03:43,750
of what we know
yeah then that that's kind of what love

10558
03:03:43,750 --> 03:03:43,760
yeah then that that's kind of what love
 

10559
03:03:43,760 --> 03:03:45,750
yeah then that that's kind of what love
is and it's terrifying because it meant

10560
03:03:45,750 --> 03:03:45,760
is and it's terrifying because it meant
 

10561
03:03:45,760 --> 03:03:48,790
is and it's terrifying because it meant
that we eradicated the others

10562
03:03:48,790 --> 03:03:48,800
that we eradicated the others
 

10563
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:50,550
that we eradicated the others
right it's a force it's an adaptive

10564
03:03:50,550 --> 03:03:50,560
right it's a force it's an adaptive
 

10565
03:03:50,560 --> 03:03:52,790
right it's a force it's an adaptive
force that gets us ahead in evolution

10566
03:03:52,790 --> 03:03:52,800
force that gets us ahead in evolution
 

10567
03:03:52,800 --> 03:03:54,389
force that gets us ahead in evolution
which means we displace something else

10568
03:03:54,389 --> 03:03:54,399
which means we displace something else
 

10569
03:03:54,399 --> 03:03:56,630
which means we displace something else
that doesn't have that

10570
03:03:56,630 --> 03:03:56,640
that doesn't have that
 

10571
03:03:56,640 --> 03:03:58,630
that doesn't have that
oh so we had to murder a lot of people

10572
03:03:58,630 --> 03:03:58,640
oh so we had to murder a lot of people
 

10573
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:00,230
oh so we had to murder a lot of people
that weren't about love

10574
03:04:00,230 --> 03:04:00,240
that weren't about love
 

10575
03:04:00,240 --> 03:04:02,230
that weren't about love
so love led to destruction have the same

10576
03:04:02,230 --> 03:04:02,240
so love led to destruction have the same
 

10577
03:04:02,240 --> 03:04:03,910
so love led to destruction have the same
strong love as we did

10578
03:04:03,910 --> 03:04:03,920
strong love as we did
 

10579
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:05,910
strong love as we did
right that's why i i mentioned this

10580
03:04:05,910 --> 03:04:05,920
right that's why i i mentioned this
 

10581
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:09,190
right that's why i i mentioned this
thing with fascism when you see this uh

10582
03:04:09,190 --> 03:04:09,200
thing with fascism when you see this uh
 

10583
03:04:09,200 --> 03:04:12,309
thing with fascism when you see this uh
these speeches do you want total war and

everybody says yes right this is this

10586
03:04:14,870 --> 03:04:14,880
everybody says yes right this is this
 

10587
03:04:14,880 --> 03:04:17,190
everybody says yes right this is this
big uh oh my god we are part of

something that is more important than me

10590
03:04:18,550 --> 03:04:18,560
something that is more important than me
 

10591
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:22,950
something that is more important than me
that gives meaning to my existence

10592
03:04:22,950 --> 03:04:22,960

 

10593
03:04:22,960 --> 03:04:23,860

fair enough

10594
03:04:23,860 --> 03:04:23,870
fair enough
 

10595
03:04:23,870 --> 03:04:26,550
fair enough
[Laughter]

10596

uh do you have advice
 

10599
03:04:28,880 --> 03:04:30,950
uh do you have advice
for young people today

10600
03:04:30,950 --> 03:04:30,960
for young people today
 

10601
03:04:30,960 --> 03:04:33,030
for young people today
in high school in college

10602
03:04:33,030 --> 03:04:33,040
in high school in college
 

10603
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:34,830
in high school in college
that are thinking about what to

10604
03:04:34,830 --> 03:04:34,840
that are thinking about what to
 

10605
03:04:34,840 --> 03:04:38,469
that are thinking about what to
do uh with their career with their life

so that uh at the end of the whole thing

10608
03:04:40,309 --> 03:04:40,319
so that uh at the end of the whole thing
 

10609
03:04:40,319 --> 03:04:43,670
so that uh at the end of the whole thing
they could be proud of what they did

10610
03:04:43,670 --> 03:04:43,680

 

10611
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:45,670

don't cheat

have integrity
 

10615
03:04:47,520 --> 03:04:49,510
have integrity
integrity so what does integrity look

10616
03:04:49,510 --> 03:04:49,520
integrity so what does integrity look
 

10617
03:04:49,520 --> 03:04:51,750
integrity so what does integrity look
like when you're the river or the leaf

10618
03:04:51,750 --> 03:04:51,760
like when you're the river or the leaf
 

10619
03:04:51,760 --> 03:04:54,469
like when you're the river or the leaf
or the fat frog in a lake

10620
03:04:54,469 --> 03:04:54,479
or the fat frog in a lake
 

10621
03:04:54,479 --> 03:04:56,630
or the fat frog in a lake
it basically means that you try to

10622
03:04:56,630 --> 03:04:56,640
it basically means that you try to
 

10623
03:04:56,640 --> 03:04:57,830
it basically means that you try to
figure out

10624
03:04:57,830 --> 03:04:57,840
figure out
 

10625
03:04:57,840 --> 03:05:00,870
figure out
what the thing is that is the most

10626
03:05:00,870 --> 03:05:00,880
what the thing is that is the most
 

10627
03:05:00,880 --> 03:05:01,910
what the thing is that is the most
right

10628
03:05:01,910 --> 03:05:01,920
right
 

10629
03:05:01,920 --> 03:05:03,670
right
and this doesn't mean that you don't uh

10630
03:05:03,670 --> 03:05:03,680
and this doesn't mean that you don't uh
 

10631
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:05,269
and this doesn't mean that you don't uh
that you have to look for what other

10632
03:05:05,269 --> 03:05:05,279
that you have to look for what other
 

10633
03:05:05,279 --> 03:05:07,030
that you have to look for what other
people tell you what's right

10634
03:05:07,030 --> 03:05:07,040
people tell you what's right
 

10635
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:08,790
people tell you what's right
but uh you have to aim for moral

10636
03:05:08,790 --> 03:05:08,800
but uh you have to aim for moral
 

10637
03:05:08,800 --> 03:05:11,349
but uh you have to aim for moral
autonomy so things need to be right

10638
03:05:11,349 --> 03:05:11,359
autonomy so things need to be right
 

10639
03:05:11,359 --> 03:05:13,910
autonomy so things need to be right
independently of what other people say

i always felt that um
 

10643
03:05:16,479 --> 03:05:19,510
i always felt that um
when people told me to

10644
03:05:19,510 --> 03:05:19,520
when people told me to
 

10645
03:05:19,520 --> 03:05:21,910
when people told me to
listen to what others say like um read

listen to what others say like um read
the room build your uh ideas of what's

10648
03:05:24,710 --> 03:05:24,720
the room build your uh ideas of what's
 

10649
03:05:24,720 --> 03:05:26,389
the room build your uh ideas of what's
true based on the high status people of

03:05:26,389 --> 03:05:26,399
true based on the high status people of
 

10651
03:05:26,399 --> 03:05:27,990
true based on the high status people of
your in-group that does not protect me

your in-group that does not protect me
 

10653

your in-group that does not protect me
from fascism

living your what you think is right like

10714

living your what you think is right like
living it now that's also sometimes this

10716
03:06:30,150 --> 03:06:30,160
living it now that's also sometimes this
 

10717
03:06:30,160 --> 03:06:32,950
living it now that's also sometimes this
expectation that others are like us so

10718
03:06:32,950 --> 03:06:32,960
expectation that others are like us so
 

10719
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:35,349
expectation that others are like us so
imagine the possibility that some of the

imagine the possibility that some of the
 

10721
03:06:35,359 --> 03:06:37,110
imagine the possibility that some of the
people around you are space aliens that

10722
03:06:37,110 --> 03:06:37,120
people around you are space aliens that
 

10723

only look human
 

10725
03:06:39,200 --> 03:06:41,110
only look human
right so they don't have the same price

10726
03:06:41,110 --> 03:06:41,120
right so they don't have the same price
 

10727
03:06:41,120 --> 03:06:42,870
right so they don't have the same price
as you do they don't have don't have the

as you do they don't have don't have the
same impulses that's what's right and

10730
03:06:44,870 --> 03:06:44,880
same impulses that's what's right and
 

10731
03:06:44,880 --> 03:06:46,469
same impulses that's what's right and
wrong there is a large

10732
03:06:46,469 --> 03:06:46,479
wrong there is a large
 

10733
03:06:46,479 --> 03:06:48,950
wrong there is a large
diversity in these basic impulses that

10734
03:06:48,950 --> 03:06:48,960
diversity in these basic impulses that
 

10735
03:06:48,960 --> 03:06:50,230
diversity in these basic impulses that
people can have

10736
03:06:50,230 --> 03:06:50,240
people can have
 

10737
03:06:50,240 --> 03:06:52,469
people can have
in a given situation and now realize

10738
03:06:52,469 --> 03:06:52,479
in a given situation and now realize
 

10739
03:06:52,479 --> 03:06:54,309
in a given situation and now realize
that you are a space alien

10740
03:06:54,309 --> 03:06:54,319
that you are a space alien
 

10741
03:06:54,319 --> 03:06:56,230
that you are a space alien
right you are not actually human you you

10742
03:06:56,230 --> 03:06:56,240
right you are not actually human you you
 

10743
03:06:56,240 --> 03:06:57,510

go along like everybody else
 

10751
03:07:03,920 --> 03:07:05,990
go along like everybody else
and you have to figure that out what it

10752
03:07:05,990 --> 03:07:06,000
and you have to figure that out what it
 

10753
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,070
and you have to figure that out what it
means that you are

10754
03:07:08,070 --> 03:07:08,080
means that you are
 

10755
03:07:08,080 --> 03:07:10,230
means that you are
a full human being what it means to be

10756
03:07:10,230 --> 03:07:10,240
a full human being what it means to be
 

10757
03:07:10,240 --> 03:07:11,750
a full human being what it means to be
human in the world and how to connect

10758
03:07:11,750 --> 03:07:11,760
human in the world and how to connect
 

10759
03:07:11,760 --> 03:07:13,429
human in the world and how to connect
with others on that

10760
03:07:13,429 --> 03:07:13,439
with others on that
 

10761
03:07:13,439 --> 03:07:14,389
with others on that
and

10762
03:07:14,389 --> 03:07:14,399
and
 

10763
03:07:14,399 --> 03:07:17,269
and
there is also something don't be afraid

10764
03:07:17,269 --> 03:07:17,279
there is also something don't be afraid
 

10765
03:07:17,279 --> 03:07:19,590
there is also something don't be afraid
in the sense that you if you do this

10766
03:07:19,590 --> 03:07:19,600
in the sense that you if you do this
 

10767
03:07:19,600 --> 03:07:21,510
in the sense that you if you do this
you're not good enough because if you

10768
03:07:21,510 --> 03:07:21,520
you're not good enough because if you
 

10769
03:07:21,520 --> 03:07:23,030
you're not good enough because if you
are acting on these incentives of

10770
03:07:23,030 --> 03:07:23,040
are acting on these incentives of
 

10771
03:07:23,040 --> 03:07:25,349
are acting on these incentives of
integrity you become trustworthy that's

10772
03:07:25,349 --> 03:07:25,359
integrity you become trustworthy that's
 

10773
03:07:25,359 --> 03:07:27,349
integrity you become trustworthy that's
the way in which you can recognize each

10774
03:07:27,349 --> 03:07:27,359
the way in which you can recognize each
 

10775
03:07:27,359 --> 03:07:28,230
the way in which you can recognize each
other

10776
03:07:28,230 --> 03:07:28,240
other
 

10777
03:07:28,240 --> 03:07:29,910
other
there is a particular place where you

10778
03:07:29,910 --> 03:07:29,920
there is a particular place where you
 

10779
03:07:29,920 --> 03:07:31,830
there is a particular place where you
can meet you can figure out what that

10780
03:07:31,830 --> 03:07:31,840
can meet you can figure out what that
 

10781
03:07:31,840 --> 03:07:32,950
can meet you can figure out what that
place is

10782
03:07:32,950 --> 03:07:32,960
place is
 

10783
03:07:32,960 --> 03:07:35,349
place is
where you will give support to people

10784
03:07:35,349 --> 03:07:35,359
where you will give support to people
 

10785
03:07:35,359 --> 03:07:37,349
where you will give support to people
because you realize that they act with

10786
03:07:37,349 --> 03:07:37,359
because you realize that they act with
 

10787
03:07:37,359 --> 03:07:40,230
because you realize that they act with
integrity and they will also do that

10788
03:07:40,230 --> 03:07:40,240
integrity and they will also do that
 

10789
03:07:40,240 --> 03:07:42,150
integrity and they will also do that
