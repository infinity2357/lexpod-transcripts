you've mentioned that you were always

60
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
you've mentioned that you were always
 

61
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,429
you've mentioned that you were always
curious about the physical world and

62
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
curious about the physical world and
 

63
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,590
curious about the physical world and
that an early question you remember

64
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
that an early question you remember
 

65
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,149
that an early question you remember
stood out where you asked your dad

66
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
stood out where you asked your dad
 

67
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,550
stood out where you asked your dad
why does ice float on water and he

68
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
why does ice float on water and he
 

69
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,230
why does ice float on water and he
couldn't answer and this was very

70
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,240
couldn't answer and this was very
 

71
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,230
couldn't answer and this was very
surprising to you

72
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
surprising to you
 

73
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,429
surprising to you
so you went on to learn why

74
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
so you went on to learn why
 

75
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,950
so you went on to learn why
maybe you can speak to what are some

76
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:26,960
maybe you can speak to what are some
 

77
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,749
maybe you can speak to what are some
early questions in math and physics that

78
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
early questions in math and physics that
 

79
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,550
early questions in math and physics that
really sparked your curiosity yeah

80
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
really sparked your curiosity yeah
 

81
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,630
really sparked your curiosity yeah
that memory is

82
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640

 

83
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,069

kind of something i used to illustrate

84
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
kind of something i used to illustrate
 

85
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,510
kind of something i used to illustrate
something i think that's common in

86
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
something i think that's common in
 

87
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,670
something i think that's common in
science that people that do science

88
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
science that people that do science
 

89
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,950
science that people that do science
somehow have maintained

90
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960

 

91
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,109

maintain something that kids always have

92
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
maintain something that kids always have
 

93
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,590
maintain something that kids always have
a small kid

94
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
a small kid
 

95
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,030
a small kid
eight years old or so

96
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040

 

97
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,870

asks you so many questions usually

98
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
asks you so many questions usually
 

99
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,389
asks you so many questions usually
typically that you

100
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:58,399
typically that you
 

101
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,149
typically that you
consider them pests you tell them to

102
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
consider them pests you tell them to
 

103
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,950
consider them pests you tell them to
stop asking so many questions

104
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
stop asking so many questions
 

105
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,990
stop asking so many questions
and

106
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
and
 

107
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,030
and
somehow our system manages to kill that

108
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
somehow our system manages to kill that
 

109
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,830
somehow our system manages to kill that
in most people

110
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
in most people
 

111
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,510
in most people
so in school we make people do study and

112
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
so in school we make people do study and
 

113
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,750
so in school we make people do study and
do their things but not to pester them

114
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
do their things but not to pester them
 

115
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,990
do their things but not to pester them
by asking too many questions

116
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
by asking too many questions
 

117
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,470
by asking too many questions
and

118
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480

 

119
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,510

i think

120
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:21,520
i think
 

121
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,670
i think
not just myself but i think it's typical

122
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
not just myself but i think it's typical
 

123
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,510
not just myself but i think it's typical
of scientists like myself that uh

124
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:27,520
of scientists like myself that uh
 

125
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,270
of scientists like myself that uh
have somehow escaped that maybe we're

126
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
have somehow escaped that maybe we're
 

127
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,830
have somehow escaped that maybe we're
still children or maybe we

128
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:31,840
still children or maybe we
 

129
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,990
still children or maybe we
somehow didn't get it beaten out of us

130
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
somehow didn't get it beaten out of us
 

131
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,710
somehow didn't get it beaten out of us
but

132
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
but
 

133
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,430
but
i think it's i teach in a college level

134
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
i think it's i teach in a college level
 

135
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,190
i think it's i teach in a college level
and it's to me

136
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
and it's to me
 

137
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,110
and it's to me
one of the biggest deficits is the lack

138
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
one of the biggest deficits is the lack
 

139
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,589
one of the biggest deficits is the lack
of curiosity if you want that we've

140
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
of curiosity if you want that we've
 

141
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,509
of curiosity if you want that we've
beaten out of them because i think it's

142
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
beaten out of them because i think it's
 

143
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,910
beaten out of them because i think it's
an innate human quality is there some

144
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
an innate human quality is there some
 

145
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,910
an innate human quality is there some
advice or insights you can give to how

146
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
advice or insights you can give to how
 

147
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,430
advice or insights you can give to how
to keep that flame of character i think

148
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
to keep that flame of character i think
 

149
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,910
to keep that flame of character i think
it's a problem of both parents and

150
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
it's a problem of both parents and
 

151
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,710
it's a problem of both parents and
and

152
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
and
 

153
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,630
and
the parents should be should realize

154
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
the parents should be should realize
 

155
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,110
the parents should be should realize
that's a great quality we have

156
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
that's a great quality we have
 

157
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,949
that's a great quality we have
that you're curious and that's good

158
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
that you're curious and that's good
 

159
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,190
that you're curious and that's good
instead we have we have expressions like

160
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
instead we have we have expressions like
 

161
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,229
instead we have we have expressions like
curiosity killed the cat

162
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
curiosity killed the cat
 

163
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,030
curiosity killed the cat
and

164
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
and
 

165
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,869
and
and uh

166
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
and uh
 

167
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,350
and uh
and more but i mean that basically it's

168
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:11,360
and more but i mean that basically it's
 

169
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,110
and more but i mean that basically it's
not not thought to be a good thing you

170
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
not not thought to be a good thing you
 

171
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,110
not not thought to be a good thing you
get curiosity killed the cat means if

172
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
get curiosity killed the cat means if
 

173
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,949
get curiosity killed the cat means if
you're too curious you get in trouble

174
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
you're too curious you get in trouble
 

175
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,430
you're too curious you get in trouble
and i don't like catholics anyway so

176
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
and i don't like catholics anyway so
 

177
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,070
and i don't like catholics anyway so
maybe it's a good thing yeah yeah

178
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
maybe it's a good thing yeah yeah
 

179
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,830
maybe it's a good thing yeah yeah
that to me needs to be solved really in

180
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
that to me needs to be solved really in
 

181
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,149
that to me needs to be solved really in
education and in homes it's a

182
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
education and in homes it's a
 

183
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,910
education and in homes it's a
realization that there's certain human

184
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
realization that there's certain human
 

185
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,110
realization that there's certain human
qualities that we should try to build on

186
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
qualities that we should try to build on
 

187
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,670
qualities that we should try to build on
and not destroy one of them is curiosity

188
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
and not destroy one of them is curiosity
 

189
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,949
and not destroy one of them is curiosity
anyway back to me in curiosity i was

190
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
anyway back to me in curiosity i was
 

191
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,789
anyway back to me in curiosity i was
passed and asked a lot of questions my

192
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
passed and asked a lot of questions my
 

193
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,190
passed and asked a lot of questions my
father generally could answer them

194
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
father generally could answer them
 

195
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,949
father generally could answer them
and at that age

196
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
and at that age
 

197
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,869
and at that age
and the first one i remember that he

198
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
and the first one i remember that he
 

199
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,710
and the first one i remember that he
couldn't answer

200
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
couldn't answer
 

201
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,710
couldn't answer
was

202
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
was
 

203
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,789
was
not a very original question but

204
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
not a very original question but
 

205
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,550
not a very original question but
basically that

206
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
basically that
 

207
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,110
basically that
ice is made out of water and so why does

208
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
ice is made out of water and so why does
 

209
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,830
ice is made out of water and so why does
it float on water

210
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
it float on water
 

211
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,990
it float on water
and

212
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
and
 

213
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,149
and
he couldn't answer it

214
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
he couldn't answer it
 

215
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,670
he couldn't answer it
and it may not have been the first

216
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
and it may not have been the first
 

217
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,789
and it may not have been the first
question it's the first one that i

218
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
question it's the first one that i
 

219
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,509
question it's the first one that i
remember and and that was the first time

220
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
remember and and that was the first time
 

221
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,550
remember and and that was the first time
that i realized that

222
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
that i realized that
 

223
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,190
that i realized that

in this case it was going to the library

228
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
in this case it was going to the library
 

229
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,550
in this case it was going to the library

research
 

239
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,990
research
but but it's um

240
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
but but it's um
 

241
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,189
but but it's um
driven by

00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
driven by

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,150
driven by
if you're

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
if you're
 

245
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,909
if you're
hopefully you ask good questions if you

246
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
hopefully you ask good questions if you
 

247
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,510
hopefully you ask good questions if you
ask good questions and you have the

248
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
ask good questions and you have the
 

249
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,830
ask good questions and you have the
mechanism to solve them then you do what

250
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
mechanism to solve them then you do what
 

251
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,909
mechanism to solve them then you do what
i do in life basically not necessarily

252
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
i do in life basically not necessarily
 

253
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,790
i do in life basically not necessarily

255
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,790

and it's a great quality in humans and

256
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
and it's a great quality in humans and
 

257
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,469
and it's a great quality in humans and
we should nurture it

258
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
we should nurture it
 

259
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,189
we should nurture it
do you remember any other kind of in

260
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
do you remember any other kind of in

more basic physics ideas

264
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
more basic physics ideas

wasn't really into science

270
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
wasn't really into science
 

271
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,070
wasn't really into science
until i got to college to be honest with

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
until i got to college to be honest with

you
 

275
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,390
you
but

276
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
but
 

277
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,710
but
just staying with water for a minute i

278
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
just staying with water for a minute i
 

279
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,070
just staying with water for a minute i
remember

280
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
remember
 

281
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,670
remember
that i

282
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
that i
 

283
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,110
that i
was curious

284
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
was curious
 

285
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,550
was curious
uh

286
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
uh
 

287
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,350
uh
why uh what happens to water you know it

288
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
why uh what happens to water you know it
 

289
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,029
why uh what happens to water you know it
rains and there's water in a wet

290
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
rains and there's water in a wet
 

291
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,950
rains and there's water in a wet
pavement and then the pavement dries out

292
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
pavement and then the pavement dries out
 

293
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,469
pavement and then the pavement dries out
what happened to this

294
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
what happened to this
 

295
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,150
what happened to this
water that came down

296
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
water that came down
 

297
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,830
water that came down
and i you know i didn't know that much

298
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:23,840
and i you know i didn't know that much
 

299
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,749
and i you know i didn't know that much
and then eventually i learned in

300
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
and then eventually i learned in
 

301
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,590
and then eventually i learned in
chemistry or something water is made out

302
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
chemistry or something water is made out
 

303
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,990
chemistry or something water is made out
of hydrogen and oxygen those are both

304
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
of hydrogen and oxygen those are both
 

305
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,230
of hydrogen and oxygen those are both
gases so how the heck does it make this

306
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
gases so how the heck does it make this
 

307
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,890
gases so how the heck does it make this
substance this liquid

308
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:35,900

 

309
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,430

[Laughter]

310
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
[Laughter]
 

311
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,110
[Laughter]
yeah so but so that has to do with

312
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120
yeah so but so that has to do with
 

313
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,469
yeah so but so that has to do with
states of matter

314
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:40,479
states of matter
 

315
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,310
states of matter
you've uh i know

316
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
you've uh i know
 

317
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,469
you've uh i know
perhaps ligo and

318
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
perhaps ligo and
 

319
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,830
perhaps ligo and
the the thing for which you've gotten

320
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
the the thing for which you've gotten
 

321
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,230
the the thing for which you've gotten
the nobel prize and the things much of

322
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
the nobel prize and the things much of
 

323
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,550
the nobel prize and the things much of
your life work

324
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
your life work
 

325
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,469
your life work
perhaps was a happy accident in some

326
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:52,479
perhaps was a happy accident in some
 

327
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,270
perhaps was a happy accident in some
sense in the early days but is is there

328
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
sense in the early days but is is there
 

329
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,550
sense in the early days but is is there
a moment where you looked up to the

330
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
a moment where you looked up to the
 

331
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,469
a moment where you looked up to the
stars and also the same way you wondered

332
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
stars and also the same way you wondered
 

333
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,710
stars and also the same way you wondered
about water wandered about some of the

334
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
about water wandered about some of the
 

335
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,990
about water wandered about some of the
things that are out there in the

336
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
things that are out there in the
 

337
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,270
things that are out there in the
universe

338
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
universe
 

339
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,430
universe
oh yeah i think everybody's

340
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
oh yeah i think everybody's
 

341
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,390
oh yeah i think everybody's
looks and

342
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
looks and
 

343
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,070
looks and
is in awe and is curious about

344
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
is in awe and is curious about
 

345
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,990
is in awe and is curious about
what what it is out there and you know

346
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
what what it is out there and you know
 

347
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,590
what what it is out there and you know
and as i learned

348
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
and as i learned
 

349
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,950
and as i learned
more i learned

350
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
more i learned
 

351
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,830
more i learned
of course that we don't know very much

352
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
of course that we don't know very much
 

353
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,830
of course that we don't know very much
about what's there and the more we learn

354
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
about what's there and the more we learn
 

355
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,749
about what's there and the more we learn
the more we know we don't know i mean we

356
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
the more we know we don't know i mean we
 

357
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,469
the more we know we don't know i mean we
don't know what the majority of anything

358
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
don't know what the majority of anything
 

359
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,230
don't know what the majority of anything
is out there it's all

360
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
is out there it's all
 

361
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,469
is out there it's all
what we call dark matter a dark energy

362
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
what we call dark matter a dark energy
 

363
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,790
what we call dark matter a dark energy
and that's one of the big questions 20

364
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
and that's one of the big questions 20
 

365
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,469
and that's one of the big questions 20
year when i was a student those weren't

366
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
year when i was a student those weren't
 

367
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,629
year when i was a student those weren't
questions so we even know less in a

368
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
questions so we even know less in a
 

369
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,309
questions so we even know less in a
sense the more we

370
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
sense the more we
 

371
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,629
sense the more we
uh the more we look so

372
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
uh the more we look so
 

373
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,309
uh the more we look so
of course i think that's

374
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:40,319
of course i think that's
 

375
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,590
of course i think that's
one of the areas that

376
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600

 

377
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,230

almost it's universal people see the sky

378
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
almost it's universal people see the sky
 

379
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,390
almost it's universal people see the sky
they see the stars and they're beautiful

380
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
they see the stars and they're beautiful
 

381
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,189
they see the stars and they're beautiful
and

382
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
and
 

383
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,270
and
and see it looks different on different

384
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
and see it looks different on different
 

385
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,070
and see it looks different on different
nights and it's a curiosity that we all

386
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
nights and it's a curiosity that we all
 

387
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,670
nights and it's a curiosity that we all
have

388
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
have
 

389
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,749
have
what are some questions about the

390
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
what are some questions about the
 

391
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,510
what are some questions about the
universe

392
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
universe
 

393
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,909
universe
that in the same way that you felt about

394
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:01,919
that in the same way that you felt about
 

395
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,110
that in the same way that you felt about
the ice

396
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
the ice
 

397
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,390
the ice
that today

398
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
that today
 

399
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,749
that today
you mentioned to me offline you're

400
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
you mentioned to me offline you're
 

401
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,150
you mentioned to me offline you're
teaching um a course on the frontiers of

402
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
teaching um a course on the frontiers of
 

403
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,390
teaching um a course on the frontiers of
science frontiers of physics yeah what

404
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
science frontiers of physics yeah what
 

405
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,990
science frontiers of physics yeah what
are some questions

406
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
are some questions
 

407
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,510
are some questions
outside the ones we'll probably talk

408
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
outside the ones we'll probably talk
 

409
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,950
outside the ones we'll probably talk
about that kind of

410
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
about that kind of
 

411
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,909
about that kind of
yeah fill you with uh

412
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
yeah fill you with uh
 

413
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,870
yeah fill you with uh
get your flame of curiosity up and uh

414
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
get your flame of curiosity up and uh
 

415
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,469
get your flame of curiosity up and uh
firing up

416
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
firing up
 

417
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,550
firing up
yeah you know fill you with all

418
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
yeah you know fill you with all
 

419
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,629
yeah you know fill you with all
well first i'm a physicist not an

420
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
well first i'm a physicist not an
 

421
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,790
well first i'm a physicist not an
astronomer so i'm interested in physical

422
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
astronomer so i'm interested in physical
 

423
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,110
astronomer so i'm interested in physical
the physical phenomenon really so

424
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
the physical phenomenon really so
 

425
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,909
the physical phenomenon really so
the question of of uh

426
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
the question of of uh
 

427
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,230
the question of of uh
dark matter and dark energy which we

428
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,240
dark matter and dark energy which we
 

429
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,469
dark matter and dark energy which we
probably won't talk about are rece or

430
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
probably won't talk about are rece or
 

431
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,510
probably won't talk about are rece or
recent their last 20 30 years or

432
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
recent their last 20 30 years or
 

433
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,270
recent their last 20 30 years or
certainly dark energy

434
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,280
certainly dark energy
 

435
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,070
certainly dark energy
dark energy is a complete puzzle

436
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
dark energy is a complete puzzle
 

437
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,990
dark energy is a complete puzzle
it goes against what i'll

438
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
it goes against what i'll
 

439
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,550
it goes against what i'll
will what you will ask me about which is

440
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
will what you will ask me about which is
 

441
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,710
will what you will ask me about which is
general relativity and einstein's

442
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
general relativity and einstein's
 

443
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,790
general relativity and einstein's
general relativity it basically takes

444
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
general relativity it basically takes
 

445
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,830
general relativity it basically takes
something that he thought was

446
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
something that he thought was
 

447
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,990
something that he thought was
what he what he called a constant which

448
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
what he what he called a constant which
 

449
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,189
what he what he called a constant which
isn't and

450
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
isn't and
 

451
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,950
isn't and
and uh

452
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
and uh
 

453
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,029
and uh
in the if that's even the right theory

454
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
in the if that's even the right theory
 

455
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,270
in the if that's even the right theory
and it represents most of

456
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
and it represents most of
 

457
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,710
and it represents most of
the universe

458
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
the universe
 

459
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,150
the universe
and then we have something called dark

460
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
and then we have something called dark
 

461
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,830
and then we have something called dark
matter and there's good reason to

462
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
matter and there's good reason to
 

463
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,589
matter and there's good reason to
believe it might be an exotic form of

464
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
believe it might be an exotic form of
 

465
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,550
believe it might be an exotic form of
particles um and that is something i've

466
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
particles um and that is something i've
 

467
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,430
particles um and that is something i've
always

468
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
always
 

469
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,670
always
worked on on particle accelerators and

470
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
worked on on particle accelerators and
 

471
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,510
worked on on particle accelerators and
so forth and it's a big puzzle what it

472
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
so forth and it's a big puzzle what it
 

473
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,990
so forth and it's a big puzzle what it
is it's a bit of a cottage industry and

474
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
is it's a bit of a cottage industry and
 

475
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,029
is it's a bit of a cottage industry and
that there's

476
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
that there's
 

477
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,110
that there's
lots and lots of searches

478
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
lots and lots of searches
 

479
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,829
lots and lots of searches
um but it may be a little bit like you

480
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
um but it may be a little bit like you
 

481
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,750
um but it may be a little bit like you
know looking for a treasure under rocks

482
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
know looking for a treasure under rocks
 

483
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,469
know looking for a treasure under rocks
or something you know it's hard to

484
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479
or something you know it's hard to
 

485
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,149
or something you know it's hard to
we don't have really good guidance

486
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
we don't have really good guidance
 

487
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,350
we don't have really good guidance
except that

488
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
except that
 

489
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,589
except that
we have very very good

490
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
we have very very good
 

491
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,070
we have very very good
information that

492
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
information that
 

493
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,389
information that
it's pervasive and it's there

494
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
it's pervasive and it's there
 

495
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,750
it's pervasive and it's there
and that it's probably particles small

496
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
and that it's probably particles small
 

497
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,030
and that it's probably particles small
that the evidence is all of those things

498
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
that the evidence is all of those things
 

499
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,630
that the evidence is all of those things
but then the most

500
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
but then the most
 

501
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,350
but then the most
uh logical solution doesn't seem to work

502
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
uh logical solution doesn't seem to work
 

503
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,829
uh logical solution doesn't seem to work
something called supersymmetry

504
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
something called supersymmetry
 

505
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,430
something called supersymmetry
and

506
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
and
 

507
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,509
and
do you think the answer could be

508
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
do you think the answer could be
 

509
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,630
do you think the answer could be
something very complicated

510
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
something very complicated
 

511
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,430
something very complicated
you know i like to hope that think that

512
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
you know i like to hope that think that
 

513
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,030
you know i like to hope that think that
most things

514
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
most things
 

515
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,870
most things
that appear complicated are actually

516
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
that appear complicated are actually
 

517
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,430
that appear complicated are actually
simple if you really understand them

518
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
simple if you really understand them
 

519
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,630
simple if you really understand them
i think we just don't know at the

520
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
i think we just don't know at the
 

521
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,230
i think we just don't know at the
present time and it isn't something that

522
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
present time and it isn't something that
 

523
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,710
present time and it isn't something that
affects us it does affect it affects how

524
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
affects us it does affect it affects how
 

525
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,790
affects us it does affect it affects how
the stars go around each other and so

526
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
the stars go around each other and so
 

527
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,230
the stars go around each other and so
forth because we detect that there's

528
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
forth because we detect that there's
 

529
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,070
forth because we detect that there's
missing gravity but

530
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,080
missing gravity but
 

531
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,990
missing gravity but
uh but it doesn't affect

532
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
uh but it doesn't affect
 

533
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,710
uh but it doesn't affect
everyday life at all i tend to

534
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720

 

535
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,910

think and

536
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
think and
 

537
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,949
think and
expect maybe and that the answers will

538
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
expect maybe and that the answers will
 

539
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,509
expect maybe and that the answers will
be simple we just haven't found it yet

540
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:45,519
be simple we just haven't found it yet
 

541
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,949
be simple we just haven't found it yet
do you think those answers might change

542
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
do you think those answers might change
 

543
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,550
do you think those answers might change
the way we see

544
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
the way we see
 

545
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,110
the way we see
other sources of gravity black holes

546
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
other sources of gravity black holes

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
the way we see
 

549
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,790
the way we see
the parts

550
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
the parts
 

551
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,949
the parts
of the universe that we do study it's

552
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
of the universe that we do study it's
 

553
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,230
of the universe that we do study it's
conceivable

554
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
conceivable
 

555
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,470
conceivable
the black holes that we've found in our

556
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
the black holes that we've found in our
 

557
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,590
the black holes that we've found in our
experiment and now we're trying now to

558
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
experiment and now we're trying now to
 

559
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,990
experiment and now we're trying now to
understand the origin of those

560
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
understand the origin of those
 

561
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,110
understand the origin of those
it's

562
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
it's
 

563
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,870
it's
conceivable but not

564
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
conceivable but not
 

565
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,710
conceivable but not
doesn't seem the most likely that they

566
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
doesn't seem the most likely that they
 

567
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,870
doesn't seem the most likely that they
were pre-primordial that is they were

568
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
were pre-primordial that is they were
 

569
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,190
were pre-primordial that is they were
made at the beginning and they in that

570
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,200
made at the beginning and they in that
 

571
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,949
made at the beginning and they in that
sense they could represent at least part

572
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
sense they could represent at least part
 

573
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,710
sense they could represent at least part
of the dark matter

574
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
of the dark matter
 

575
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,110
of the dark matter
so there can be connections dark

576
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
so there can be connections dark
 

577
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,870
so there can be connections dark
black holes or

578
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
black holes or
 

579
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,630
black holes or
how many there are how much of the mass

580
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
how many there are how much of the mass
 

581
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,350
how many there are how much of the mass
they encompass is still pretty primitive

582
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
they encompass is still pretty primitive
 

583
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,590
they encompass is still pretty primitive
we don't know so before i talk to you

584
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
we don't know so before i talk to you
 

585
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,790
we don't know so before i talk to you
more about black holes let me take a

586
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
more about black holes let me take a
 

587
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,350
more about black holes let me take a
step back to yeah i was actually went to

588
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
step back to yeah i was actually went to
 

589
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,230
step back to yeah i was actually went to
high school in chicago and would go to

590
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
high school in chicago and would go to
 

591
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,430
high school in chicago and would go to
uh take classes at fermi lab

592
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:39,440
uh take classes at fermi lab
 

593
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,790
uh take classes at fermi lab
uh watch the buffalo and so on yeah

594
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
uh watch the buffalo and so on yeah
 

595
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,470
uh watch the buffalo and so on yeah
so let me ask about you mentioned that

596
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
so let me ask about you mentioned that
 

597
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,550
so let me ask about you mentioned that
enrico for me was somebody who was

598
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
enrico for me was somebody who was
 

599
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,230
enrico for me was somebody who was
inspiring to you

600
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
inspiring to you
 

601
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,790
inspiring to you
in a certain kind of way um

602
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
in a certain kind of way um
 

603
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,750
in a certain kind of way um
why is that can you speak to that sure

604
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:53,760
why is that can you speak to that sure
 

605
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,470
why is that can you speak to that sure
he was amazing actually uh

606
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
he was amazing actually uh
 

607
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,630
he was amazing actually uh
he's the last

608
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
he's the last
 

609
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,990
he's the last
this is not the re i'll come to the

610
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
this is not the re i'll come to the
 

611
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,470
this is not the re i'll come to the
reason in a minute but the

612
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
reason in a minute but the
 

613
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,310
reason in a minute but the
he had a big influence on me at a young

614
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
he had a big influence on me at a young
 

615
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,350
he had a big influence on me at a young
age

616
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:05,360
age
 

617
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,750
age
he uh but he was the only the last

618
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
he uh but he was the only the last
 

619
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,870
he uh but he was the only the last
physicist

620
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
physicist
 

621
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,069
physicist
of note

622
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
of note
 

623
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,230
of note
that was both an experimental physicist

624
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
that was both an experimental physicist
 

625
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,630
that was both an experimental physicist
and a theorist at the same time

626
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
and a theorist at the same time
 

627
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,509
and a theorist at the same time
and he did two amazing things within

628
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
and he did two amazing things within
 

629
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,710
and he did two amazing things within
months

630
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
months
 

631
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,190
months
in 1933.

632
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
in 1933.
 

633
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,150
in 1933.
he

634
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
he
 

635
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,790
he
it was we didn't really know what the

636
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
it was we didn't really know what the
 

637
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,269
it was we didn't really know what the
nucleus was what uh

638
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
nucleus was what uh
 

639
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,990
nucleus was what uh
radioactive decay was what beta decay

640
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
radioactive decay was what beta decay
 

641
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,030
radioactive decay was what beta decay
was when electrons come out of

642
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
was when electrons come out of
 

643
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,389
was when electrons come out of
a nucleus

644
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:36,399
a nucleus
 

645
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,910
a nucleus
and in

646
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
and in
 

647
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,870
and in
nearly near the end of 1933

648
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
nearly near the end of 1933
 

649
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,430
nearly near the end of 1933
um he

650
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
um he
 

651
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,509
um he
the neutron had just been discovered and

652
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
the neutron had just been discovered and
 

653
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,030
the neutron had just been discovered and
that meant that we knew a little bit

654
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
that meant that we knew a little bit
 

655
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,269
that meant that we knew a little bit
more about what the nucleus is that it's

656
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
more about what the nucleus is that it's
 

657
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,430
more about what the nucleus is that it's
made out of neutrons and protons the

658
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
made out of neutrons and protons the
 

659
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,949
made out of neutrons and protons the
neutron wasn't discovered till 1932

660
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
neutron wasn't discovered till 1932
 

661
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,269
neutron wasn't discovered till 1932
and then once we discovered that there

662
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:57,279
and then once we discovered that there
 

663
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,750
and then once we discovered that there
was a neutron and proton and they made

664
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
was a neutron and proton and they made
 

665
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,590
was a neutron and proton and they made
the nucleus and then their electrons

666
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:01,600
the nucleus and then their electrons
 

667
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,829
the nucleus and then their electrons

and that's he did this two completely

814
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
and that's he did this two completely
 

815
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,470
and that's he did this two completely
different things an experiment that was

00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
and a
 

821
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,670
and a
tremendous implementation because how do

you get enough neutrons
 

825
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,110
you get enough neutrons
and then he learned

826
00:14:59,110 --> 00:14:59,120
and then he learned
 

827
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,870
and then he learned
quickly that not only do you want

828
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880
quickly that not only do you want
 

829
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,389
quickly that not only do you want
neutrons but you want really slow ones

830
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:04,399
neutrons but you want really slow ones
 

831
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,310
neutrons but you want really slow ones
he learned that experimentally and he

832
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
he learned that experimentally and he
 

833
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,310
he learned that experimentally and he
learned how to make slow ones and then

834
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
learned how to make slow ones and then
 

835
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,629
learned how to make slow ones and then
they were able to make go through the

they were able to make go through the
periodic table and make

838
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:12,720
periodic table and make
 

839
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,150
periodic table and make
lots of

840
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
lots of
 

841
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,470
lots of
particles he missed on fission at the

842
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
particles he missed on fission at the
 

843
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,790
particles he missed on fission at the
moment but he had the basic information

844
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
moment but he had the basic information
 

845
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,269
moment but he had the basic information
and and then fission followed soon after

846
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
and and then fission followed soon after
 

847
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,509
and and then fission followed soon after
that forgive me for not knowing but is

848
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
that forgive me for not knowing but is
 

849
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,350
that forgive me for not knowing but is
the birth of the idea of bombarding with

850
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
the birth of the idea of bombarding with
 

851
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,710
the birth of the idea of bombarding with
new uh

852
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
new uh
 

853
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,189
new uh
neutrons

854
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
neutrons
 

855
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,670
neutrons
is that uh

856
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
is that uh
 

857
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,749
is that uh
is that an experimental idea was it born

858
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:33,759
is that an experimental idea was it born
 

859
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,350
is that an experimental idea was it born
out of an experiment you just observe

860
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:35,360
out of an experiment you just observe
 

861
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,749
out of an experiment you just observe
something or is this an einstein style

862
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
something or is this an einstein style
 

863
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,829
something or is this an einstein style
idea where you

864
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839

 

865
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,550

took a combination because he realized

866
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:44,560
took a combination because he realized
 

867
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,710
took a combination because he realized
that neutrons had a characteristic that

868
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
that neutrons had a characteristic that
 

869
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,389
that neutrons had a characteristic that
would allow them to go all the way into

870
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
would allow them to go all the way into
 

871
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,870
would allow them to go all the way into
the nucleus when we didn't really

872
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
the nucleus when we didn't really
 

873
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,629
the nucleus when we didn't really
understand what the

874
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
understand what the
 

875
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,710
understand what the
you know what how what the structure was

876
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
you know what how what the structure was
 

877
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,949
you know what how what the structure was
of all this so that took

878
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
of all this so that took
 

879
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,990
of all this so that took
uh

880
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
uh
 

881
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,150
uh
an understanding or recognition of the

882
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
an understanding or recognition of the
 

883
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,990
an understanding or recognition of the
physics itself of how a neutron

884
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
physics itself of how a neutron
 

885
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,230
physics itself of how a neutron
interacts compared to say an alpha

886
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
interacts compared to say an alpha

particle that giulio and curie had used

888
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
particle that giulio and curie had used
 

889
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,150
particle that giulio and curie had used
and then he had to invent

890
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
and then he had to invent
 

891
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,189
and then he had to invent
a way to have enough neutrons and uh you

892
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
a way to have enough neutrons and uh you
 

893
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,509
a way to have enough neutrons and uh you
know what he had a team of

894
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
know what he had a team of
 

895
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,150
know what he had a team of
associates and he pulled it off

896
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
associates and he pulled it off
 

897
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,829
associates and he pulled it off
quite quickly so you know it's pretty

898
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:20,839
quite quickly so you know it's pretty
 

899
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,590
quite quickly so you know it's pretty
astounding and probably maybe you can

900
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,600
astounding and probably maybe you can
 

901
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,870
astounding and probably maybe you can
speak to it

902
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:24,880
speak to it
 

903
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,189
speak to it
his ability to put together

904
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:27,199
his ability to put together
 

905
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,030
his ability to put together
the engineering aspects of great

906
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
the engineering aspects of great
 

907
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,310
the engineering aspects of great
experiments

908
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:30,320
experiments
 

909
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,910
experiments
and doing the theory they probably fed

910
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
and doing the theory they probably fed
 

911
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,550
and doing the theory they probably fed
each other i wonder can you speak to why

912
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:34,560
each other i wonder can you speak to why
 

913
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,710
each other i wonder can you speak to why
we don't see more of that is that just

914
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
we don't see more of that is that just
 

915
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,470
we don't see more of that is that just
really difficult to do

916
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
really difficult to do
 

917
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,590
really difficult to do
it's difficult to do yeah i think in

918
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
it's difficult to do yeah i think in
 

919
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,790
it's difficult to do yeah i think in
in both theory and experiment in physics

920
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
in both theory and experiment in physics
 

921
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,829
in both theory and experiment in physics
anyway

922
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:45,839
anyway
 

923
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,990
anyway
was um

924
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
was um
 

925
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,069
was um
it was conceivable if you had an the

926
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
it was conceivable if you had an the
 

927
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,069
it was conceivable if you had an the
right person to do it and no one's been

928
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
right person to do it and no one's been
 

929
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,670
right person to do it and no one's been
able to do it since so i had the dream

930
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
able to do it since so i had the dream
 

931
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,629
able to do it since so i had the dream
that that

932
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
that that
 

933
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,470
that that
was what i was going to be like fermi

934
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
was what i was going to be like fermi
 

935
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,230
was what i was going to be like fermi
but so you love both sides of it the

936
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
but so you love both sides of it the
 

937
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,030
but so you love both sides of it the
theory yeah yeah i never liked the idea

938
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,040
theory yeah yeah i never liked the idea
 

939
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,790
theory yeah yeah i never liked the idea
that you did experiments without really

940
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:02,800
that you did experiments without really
 

941
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,949
that you did experiments without really
understanding the theory or the theory

942
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
understanding the theory or the theory
 

943
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,549
understanding the theory or the theory
should be related very closely to

944
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:06,559
should be related very closely to
 

945
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,750
should be related very closely to
experiments

946
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
experiments
 

947
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,429
experiments
and so i've always done

948
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
and so i've always done
 

949
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,029
and so i've always done
experimental work that was closely

950
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:11,039
experimental work that was closely
 

951
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,350
experimental work that was closely
related to the theoretical ideas

952
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
related to the theoretical ideas
 

953
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,870
related to the theoretical ideas
i think i told you i'm russian so i'm

954
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
i think i told you i'm russian so i'm
 

955
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,230
i think i told you i'm russian so i'm
going to ask some romantic questions but

956
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
going to ask some romantic questions but
 

957
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,309
going to ask some romantic questions but
is it tragic to you that

958
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:22,319
is it tragic to you that
 

959
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,230
is it tragic to you that

curiosity a few minutes ago there's an

984
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
curiosity a few minutes ago there's an
 

985
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,150
curiosity a few minutes ago there's an
interesting book called the ratchet of

986
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
interesting book called the ratchet of
 

987
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,070
interesting book called the ratchet of
curiosity you know a ratchet is

988
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
curiosity you know a ratchet is
 

989
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,230
curiosity you know a ratchet is
something that goes in one direction

990
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:54,240
something that goes in one direction
 

991
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,190
something that goes in one direction
and that that it's written by a guy

992
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,200
and that that it's written by a guy
 

993
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,870
and that that it's written by a guy
who's probably a sociologist or

994
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
who's probably a sociologist or
 

995
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,630
who's probably a sociologist or
philosopher or something

996
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
philosopher or something
 

997
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,270
philosopher or something
and he he picks on this particular

998
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
and he he picks on this particular
 

999
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,350
and he he picks on this particular
problem but other ones and that is the

1000
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
problem but other ones and that is the
 

1001
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,510
problem but other ones and that is the
the danger of knowledge basically you

1002
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
the danger of knowledge basically you
 

1003
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,029
the danger of knowledge basically you
know you're curious

1004
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
know you're curious
 

1005
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,789
know you're curious
you learn something so it's a little bit

1006
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
you learn something so it's a little bit
 

1007
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,630
you learn something so it's a little bit
like curiosity killed the cat you have

1008
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
like curiosity killed the cat you have
 

1009
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,230
like curiosity killed the cat you have
to be worried about whether you can

1010
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
to be worried about whether you can
 

1011
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,270
to be worried about whether you can
handle

1012
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
handle
 

1013
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,270
handle
new information that you get so in this

1014
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
new information that you get so in this
 

1015
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,750
new information that you get so in this
case the new information had to do with

1016
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
case the new information had to do with
 

1017
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,950
case the new information had to do with
really understanding nuclear physics

1018
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:22,960
really understanding nuclear physics
 

1019
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,909
really understanding nuclear physics
and that information maybe we didn't

1020
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
and that information maybe we didn't
 

1021
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,590
and that information maybe we didn't
have the sophistication to know how to

1022
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
have the sophistication to know how to
 

1023
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,270
have the sophistication to know how to
keep it under control

1024
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
keep it under control
 

1025
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,950
keep it under control
yeah and fermi himself was

1026
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
yeah and fermi himself was
 

1027
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,070
yeah and fermi himself was
a very a political person so he wasn't

1028
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
a very a political person so he wasn't
 

1029
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,110

that others had with him as either he
 

1037
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,270
that others had with him as either he

avoided it all or he was pretty
 

1039
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,750
avoided it all or he was pretty
apolitical i mean he just saw the world

1040
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
apolitical i mean he just saw the world
 

1041
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,110
apolitical i mean he just saw the world
through kind of the lens of a scientist

1042
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
through kind of the lens of a scientist
 

1043
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,350
through kind of the lens of a scientist
but you asked if it's tragic uh

1044
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
but you asked if it's tragic uh
 

1045
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,830
but you asked if it's tragic uh
the bomb was tragic certainly on japan

1046
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
the bomb was tragic certainly on japan
 

1047
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,230
the bomb was tragic certainly on japan
and he had a role in that so i wouldn't

1048
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
and he had a role in that so i wouldn't
 

1049
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,430
and he had a role in that so i wouldn't
want it as my legacy for example

1050
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440
want it as my legacy for example
 

1051
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,430
want it as my legacy for example
i mean that but broader to the human

1052
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:09,440
i mean that but broader to the human
 

1053
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,830
i mean that but broader to the human

it's the ratchet of curiosity that we

that's been a concern

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
that's been a concern

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,510
that's been a concern
they're on a small scale on a silly

i mean he died young he died soon after

1166
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
i mean he died young he died soon after
 

1167
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,230
i mean he died young he died soon after
the world war uh

1168
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
the world war uh
 

1169
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,470
the world war uh
there was already you know

1170
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
there was already you know
 

1171
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,350
there was already you know
the

1172
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
the
 

1173
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,990
the
work by teller to develop the hydrogen

1174
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
work by teller to develop the hydrogen
 

1175
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,830
work by teller to develop the hydrogen
bomb and i think he was a little cynical

1176
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
bomb and i think he was a little cynical
 

1177
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,990
bomb and i think he was a little cynical
of that you know pushing it even further

1178
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
of that you know pushing it even further
 

1179
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,789
of that you know pushing it even further
and

1180
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:30,799
and
 

1181
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,870
and
uh rising tensions between the soviet

1182
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
uh rising tensions between the soviet
 

1183
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,950
uh rising tensions between the soviet
union and the u.s and looked like an

1184
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
union and the u.s and looked like an
 

1185
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,350
union and the u.s and looked like an
endless thing so but he didn't say very

1186
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
endless thing so but he didn't say very
 

1187
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,909
endless thing so but he didn't say very
much but a little bit as you said yeah

1188
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
much but a little bit as you said yeah
 

1189
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,710
much but a little bit as you said yeah
there's a few clips to sort of uh maybe

1190
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:42,720
there's a few clips to sort of uh maybe
 

1191
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,590
there's a few clips to sort of uh maybe
picked on a bad mood but in in the sense

1192
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
picked on a bad mood but in in the sense
 

1193
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,510
picked on a bad mood but in in the sense
that uh almost like a sadness a

1194
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
that uh almost like a sadness a
 

1195
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,470
that uh almost like a sadness a
melancholy sadness to

1196
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
melancholy sadness to
 

1197
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,909
melancholy sadness to
um

1198
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
um
 

1199
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,909
um
a hope that waned a little bit about

1200
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
a hope that waned a little bit about
 

1201
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,390
a hope that waned a little bit about
that uh yeah perhaps we can do

1202
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,400
that uh yeah perhaps we can do
 

1203
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,510
that uh yeah perhaps we can do
like

1204
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,520
like
 

1205
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,669
like
the science this curious species can

1206
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
the science this curious species can
 

1207
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,110
the science this curious species can
find the way out

1208
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,120
find the way out
 

1209
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,630
find the way out
well especially i think people who

1210
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
well especially i think people who
 

1211
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,870
well especially i think people who
worked like he did at los alamos and

1212
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:04,880
worked like he did at los alamos and
 

1213
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,029
worked like he did at los alamos and
spent years of their life

1214
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
spent years of their life
 

1215
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,029
spent years of their life
somehow had to convince themselves that

1216
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:09,039
somehow had to convince themselves that
 

1217
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,350
somehow had to convince themselves that
dropping these bombs would bring

1218
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
dropping these bombs would bring
 

1219
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,909
dropping these bombs would bring
lasting peace and it didn't and that it

1220
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
lasting peace and it didn't and that it
 

1221
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,190
lasting peace and it didn't and that it
didn't yeah

1222
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,200

 

1223
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,549

as a small interesting aside it'd be

1224
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:20,559
as a small interesting aside it'd be
 

1225
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,990
as a small interesting aside it'd be
interesting to hear if you have opinions

1226
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000
interesting to hear if you have opinions
 

1227
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,230
interesting to hear if you have opinions
on this his name is also attached to the

1228
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
on this his name is also attached to the
 

1229
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,870
on this his name is also attached to the
fermi paradox which asks if there's uh

1230
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
fermi paradox which asks if there's uh
 

1231
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,990
fermi paradox which asks if there's uh
you know with

1232
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
you know with
 

1233
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,190
you know with
it's a very interesting question which

1234
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
it's a very interesting question which
 

1235
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,230
it's a very interesting question which
is

1236
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
is
 

1237
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,870
is
if it does seem if you sort of reason

1238
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:34,880
if it does seem if you sort of reason
 

1239
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,110
if it does seem if you sort of reason
basically that there should be a lot of

1240
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,120
basically that there should be a lot of
 

1241
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,909
basically that there should be a lot of
alien civilizations out there if the

00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:39,919
alien civilizations out there if the
 

1243
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,590
alien civilizations out there if the

no matter the values you pick
 

1253
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,390
no matter the values you pick
it's likely that there's a lot of alien

it's likely that there's a lot of alien

the case
why have they

1260
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:54,799
why have they
 

1261
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,270
why have they
not at least obviously visited us or

1262
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
not at least obviously visited us or
 

1263
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,830
not at least obviously visited us or
sent us loud signals that everybody can

1264
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
sent us loud signals that everybody can
 

1265
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,710
sent us loud signals that everybody can
hear

1266
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:00,720
hear

fermi's quoted as saying sitting down at
lunch i think it was with

1270
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
lunch i think it was with
 

1271
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,510
lunch i think it was with
teller

1272
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
teller
 

1273
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,549
teller
and uh herb york who was kind of the one

1274
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
and uh herb york who was kind of the one
 

1275
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,510
and uh herb york who was kind of the one
of the fathers of the atomic bomb

1276
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
of the fathers of the atomic bomb
 

1277
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,190
of the fathers of the atomic bomb
and he sat down and he says something

1278
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,200
and he sat down and he says something
 

1279
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,789
and he sat down and he says something
like where are they

1280
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:16,799
like where are they
 

1281
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,590
like where are they
yeah

1282
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:17,600
yeah
 

1283
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,510
yeah
which meant where are these

1284
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
which meant where are these
 

1285
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,870
which meant where are these
other and

1286
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
other and
 

1287
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,909
other and
um

1288
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:21,919
um
 

1289
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,830
um
and then he did some

1290
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:23,840
and then he did some
 

1291
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,070
and then he did some
numerology where he

1292
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
numerology where he
 

1293
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,390
numerology where he
calculated you know how many what they

1294
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
calculated you know how many what they
 

1295
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,909
calculated you know how many what they
knew about how many

1296
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
knew about how many
 

1297
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,029
knew about how many
uh

1298
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:31,039
uh
 

1299
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,029
uh
galaxies there are and how many stars

1300
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
galaxies there are and how many stars
 

1301
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,029
galaxies there are and how many stars
and how many planets in are like the

1302
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039
and how many planets in are like the
 

1303
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,110
and how many planets in are like the
earth and blah blah blah that's been

1304
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,120
earth and blah blah blah that's been
 

1305
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,390
earth and blah blah blah that's been
done much better by somebody named drake

1306
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,400
done much better by somebody named drake
 

1307
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,390
done much better by somebody named drake
and so people usually refer to the i

1308
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:42,400
and so people usually refer to the i
 

1309
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,510
and so people usually refer to the i
don't know whether it's called the drake

1310
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:43,520
don't know whether it's called the drake
 

1311
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,269
don't know whether it's called the drake
formula or something but it has the same

1312
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
formula or something but it has the same
 

1313
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,549
formula or something but it has the same
conclusion

1314
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
conclusion
 

1315
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,190
conclusion
the conclusion is it would be a miracle

1316
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
the conclusion is it would be a miracle
 

1317
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,549
the conclusion is it would be a miracle
if there weren't other

1318
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
if there weren't other
 

1319
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,029
if there weren't other
you know uh there's the statistics are

1320
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
you know uh there's the statistics are
 

1321
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,269
you know uh there's the statistics are
so high that how can we be singular and

1322
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:55,279
so high that how can we be singular and
 

1323
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,310
so high that how can we be singular and
separate

1324
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:58,320

 

1325
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,510

that so probably there is

1326
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
that so probably there is
 

1327
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,470
that so probably there is
but there's

1328
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480
but there's
 

1329
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,470
but there's
almost certainly life somewhere

1330
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
almost certainly life somewhere
 

1331
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,470
almost certainly life somewhere
maybe there was even life on mars a

1332
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
maybe there was even life on mars a
 

1333
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,990
maybe there was even life on mars a
while back but

1334
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
while back but
 

1335
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,029
while back but
uh

1336
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,039
uh
 

1337
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,430
uh
intelligent life

1338
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:11,440
intelligent life
 

1339
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,230
intelligent life
probably why were we so so you know the

1340
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,240
probably why were we so so you know the
 

1341
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,149
probably why were we so so you know the
statistics say that communicating with

1342
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:16,159
statistics say that communicating with
 

1343
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:16,950
statistics say that communicating with
us

1344
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:16,960
us
 

1345
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,909
us
i think that it's harder than people

1346
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
i think that it's harder than people
 

1347
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,789
i think that it's harder than people
think

1348
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799

 

1349
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,789

we might

1350
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
we might
 

1351
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,430
we might
not know the right way to

1352
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
not know the right way to
 

1353
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,830
not know the right way to
expect the communication

1354
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:30,840
expect the communication
 

1355
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,750
expect the communication
but all the communication that we know

1356
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
but all the communication that we know
 

1357
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,870
but all the communication that we know
about travels at the speed of light

1358
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:36,880
about travels at the speed of light
 

1359
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,110
about travels at the speed of light
and we do we don't we don't think

1360
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
and we do we don't we don't think
 

1361
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,789
and we do we don't we don't think
anything can go faster in the speed of

1362
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
anything can go faster in the speed of
 

1363
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,990
anything can go faster in the speed of
light that

1364
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
light that
 

1365
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,310
light that
limits the problem quite quite a bit and

1366
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:44,320
limits the problem quite quite a bit and
 

1367
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,590
limits the problem quite quite a bit and
it uh

1368
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
it uh
 

1369
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,310
it uh
makes it difficult to have any back and

1370
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,320
makes it difficult to have any back and
 

1371
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,630
makes it difficult to have any back and
forth communication you can send signals

1372
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:50,640
forth communication you can send signals
 

1373
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,470
forth communication you can send signals
like we try to or

1374
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
like we try to or
 

1375
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,630
like we try to or
look for but to have any communication

1376
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
look for but to have any communication
 

1377
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,789
look for but to have any communication
it's pretty hard when you it has to be

1378
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
it's pretty hard when you it has to be
 

1379
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,750
it's pretty hard when you it has to be
close enough that the speed of light

1380
00:24:59,750 --> 00:24:59,760
close enough that the speed of light
 

1381
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,590
close enough that the speed of light
would mean we could communicate with

1382
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
would mean we could communicate with
 

1383
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,269
would mean we could communicate with
each other and i think

1384
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
each other and i think
 

1385
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,669
each other and i think
and we didn't even understand that i

1386
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
and we didn't even understand that i
 

1387
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,909
and we didn't even understand that i
mean it's an advanced civilization but

1388
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
mean it's an advanced civilization but
 

1389
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,470
mean it's an advanced civilization but
we didn't even understand that

1390
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
we didn't even understand that
 

1391
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,870
we didn't even understand that
a little more than 100 years ago

1392
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
a little more than 100 years ago
 

1393
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,950
a little more than 100 years ago
so uh

1394
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:14,960
so uh
 

1395
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,870
so uh
are we

1396
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
are we
 

1397
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,830
are we
just not advanced enough maybe

1398
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:19,840
just not advanced enough maybe
 

1399
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,830
just not advanced enough maybe
uh to know something about that's the

1400
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:21,840
uh to know something about that's the
 

1401
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,430
uh to know something about that's the
speed of light maybe there's some other

1402
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,440
speed of light maybe there's some other
 

1403
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,710
speed of light maybe there's some other
way to communicate that isn't based on

1404
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:25,720
way to communicate that isn't based on
 

1405
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,630
way to communicate that isn't based on
electromagnetism i don't i don't know

1406
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
electromagnetism i don't i don't know
 

1407
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,029
electromagnetism i don't i don't know
gravity seems to be also this have the

1408
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
gravity seems to be also this have the
 

1409
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,190
gravity seems to be also this have the
same speed that was a principle that

1410
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
same speed that was a principle that
 

1411
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,950
same speed that was a principle that
einstein had and something we've

1412
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:34,960
einstein had and something we've
 

1413
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,710
einstein had and something we've
measured actually

1414
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:36,720
measured actually
 

1415
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,190
measured actually
so is is it possible i mean so we'll

1416
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:39,200
so is is it possible i mean so we'll
 

1417
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,430
so is is it possible i mean so we'll
talk about gravitational waves and

1418
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,440
talk about gravitational waves and
 

1419
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,870
talk about gravitational waves and
it in some sense there's a

1420
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:44,880
it in some sense there's a
 

1421
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,110
it in some sense there's a
there's a brainstorming going on which

1422
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
there's a brainstorming going on which
 

1423
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,390
there's a brainstorming going on which
is like

1424
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,400
is like
 

1425
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,549
is like
how do we detect the signal like what

1426
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
how do we detect the signal like what
 

1427
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,149
how do we detect the signal like what
would a signal look like and how would

1428
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,159
would a signal look like and how would
 

1429
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,430
would a signal look like and how would
we detect and that's true for

1430
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
we detect and that's true for
 

1431
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,190
we detect and that's true for
gravitational waves that's true for

1432
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
gravitational waves that's true for
 

1433
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,510
gravitational waves that's true for
basically any physics phenomena

1434
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:57,520
basically any physics phenomena
 

1435
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,870
basically any physics phenomena
you have to predict that that signal

1436
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:58,880
you have to predict that that signal
 

1437
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,310
you have to predict that that signal
should exist you have to have some kind

1438
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
should exist you have to have some kind
 

1439
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,070
should exist you have to have some kind
of theory and model why that signal

1440
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,080
of theory and model why that signal
 

1441
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,710
of theory and model why that signal
should exist i mean is it possible that

1442
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:04,720
should exist i mean is it possible that
 

1443
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,630
should exist i mean is it possible that
aliens are communicating with us via

1444
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:06,640
aliens are communicating with us via
 

1445
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,710
aliens are communicating with us via
gravity

1446
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
gravity
 

1447
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,230
gravity
like why not well it it

1448
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,240
like why not well it it
 

1449
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,870
like why not well it it
yeah it's true why not uh

1450
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
yeah it's true why not uh
 

1451
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,430
yeah it's true why not uh
for us it's very hard to detect these

1452
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,440
for us it's very hard to detect these
 

1453
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,590
for us it's very hard to detect these
gravitational effects they have to come

1454
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
gravitational effects they have to come
 

1455
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,110
gravitational effects they have to come
from something

1456
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,120
from something
 

1457
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,710
from something
pretty that has a lot of gravity like

1458
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
pretty that has a lot of gravity like
 

1459
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,310
pretty that has a lot of gravity like
black holes but we're pretty primitive

1460
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,320
black holes but we're pretty primitive
 

1461
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,190
black holes but we're pretty primitive
at this stage

1462
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200

 

1463
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,549

there's uh

1464
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559

 

1465
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,870

very reputable physicists that look for

1466
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
very reputable physicists that look for
 

1467
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,549
very reputable physicists that look for
a fifth force

1468
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
a fifth force
 

1469
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,630
a fifth force
one that we haven't found yet maybe it's

1470
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:38,640
one that we haven't found yet maybe it's
 

1471
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,710
one that we haven't found yet maybe it's
the key so you know

1472
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:40,720
the key so you know
 

1473
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,630
the key so you know
it's what would that look like what

1474
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:42,640
it's what would that look like what
 

1475
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,549
it's what would that look like what
would a fifth force of physics look like

1476
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:44,559
would a fifth force of physics look like
 

1477
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,310
would a fifth force of physics look like
exactly well usually they think it's

1478
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
exactly well usually they think it's
 

1479
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,789
exactly well usually they think it's
probably a long range for longer range

1480
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:48,799
probably a long range for longer range
 

1481
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,710
probably a long range for longer range
force than we have now

1482
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:50,720
force than we have now
 

1483
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,669
force than we have now
um

1484
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
um
 

1485
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,870
um
but uh

1486
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
but uh
 

1487
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,350
but uh
they're reputable for colleagues of mine

1488
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,360
they're reputable for colleagues of mine
 

1489
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,350
they're reputable for colleagues of mine
that spend their life looking for a

1490
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:57,360
that spend their life looking for a
 

1491
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,149
that spend their life looking for a
fifth force so longer range than gravity

1492
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:00,159
fifth force so longer range than gravity
 

1493
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,029
fifth force so longer range than gravity
yeah

1494
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:01,039
yeah
 

1495
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,190
yeah
super it doesn't fall off like one over

1496
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,200
super it doesn't fall off like one over
 

1497
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,430
super it doesn't fall off like one over
r squared but maybe

1498
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
r squared but maybe
 

1499
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,470
r squared but maybe
separately

1500
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:06,480
separately
 

1501
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,750
separately
gravity

1502
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
gravity
 

1503
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,630
gravity
uh newton taught us goes like inversely

1504
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:10,640
uh newton taught us goes like inversely
 

1505
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,390
uh newton taught us goes like inversely
one over the square of the distance

1506
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
one over the square of the distance
 

1507
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,230
one over the square of the distance
apart you are so it falls pretty fast

1508
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
apart you are so it falls pretty fast
 

1509
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,669
apart you are so it falls pretty fast
that's okay so now we have a theory of

1510
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
that's okay so now we have a theory of
 

1511
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,269
that's okay so now we have a theory of
what consciousness is it's just the

1512
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:17,279
what consciousness is it's just the
 

1513
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,110
what consciousness is it's just the
fifth force of

1514
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,120
fifth force of
 

1515
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,430
fifth force of
physics yeah there we go that's a good

1516
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
physics yeah there we go that's a good
 

1517
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,110
physics yeah there we go that's a good
hypothesis

1518
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,120
hypothesis
 

1519
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,310
hypothesis
uh

1520
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320

 

1521
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,909

speaking of gravity uh of gravity uh

00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:29,919
speaking of gravity uh of gravity uh
 

1523
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,990
speaking of gravity uh of gravity uh
what are gravitational waves let's maybe

1524
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
what are gravitational waves let's maybe
 

1525
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,230
what are gravitational waves let's maybe
start from the basics

1526
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
start from the basics
 

1527
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,110
start from the basics
we learned gravity from newton

1528
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,120
we learned gravity from newton
 

1529
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,750
we learned gravity from newton
right you you and you were young you

1530
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,760
right you you and you were young you
 

1531
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,590
right you you and you were young you
were told that if you jumped up the

1532
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:41,600
were told that if you jumped up the
 

1533
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,750
were told that if you jumped up the
earth pulled you down

1534
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:43,760
earth pulled you down
 

1535
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,029
earth pulled you down
and when the apple falls out of the tree

1536
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
and when the apple falls out of the tree
 

1537
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,669
and when the apple falls out of the tree
the earth pulls it down

1538
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:49,679
the earth pulls it down
 

1539
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,830
the earth pulls it down
and maybe you even asked your teacher

1540
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:51,840
and maybe you even asked your teacher
 

1541
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,269
and maybe you even asked your teacher
why but

1542
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
why but
 

1543
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,549
why but
most of us

1544
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:54,559
most of us
 

1545
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,190
most of us
accepted that that was newton's

1546
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
accepted that that was newton's
 

1547
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,870
accepted that that was newton's
picture the apple falling out of the

1548
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880
picture the apple falling out of the
 

1549
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,110
picture the apple falling out of the
tree but newton's theory never told you

1550
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
tree but newton's theory never told you
 

1551
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,149
tree but newton's theory never told you
why the apple was attracted to the earth

1552
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:04,159
why the apple was attracted to the earth
 

1553
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,149
why the apple was attracted to the earth
that was a missing in newton's theory

1554
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
that was a missing in newton's theory
 

1555
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,070
that was a missing in newton's theory
newton's theory also

1556
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
newton's theory also
 

1557
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,149
newton's theory also
newton recognized at least one of the

1558
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
newton recognized at least one of the
 

1559
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,990
newton recognized at least one of the
two problems i'll tell you one of them

1560
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,000
two problems i'll tell you one of them
 

1561
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,510
two problems i'll tell you one of them
is there's more than those but one is

1562
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
is there's more than those but one is
 

1563
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,350
is there's more than those but one is
why does the earth what's the mechanism

1564
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,360
why does the earth what's the mechanism
 

1565
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,630
why does the earth what's the mechanism
by which

1566
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
by which
 

1567
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,110
by which
the earth pulls the apple or holds the

1568
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
the earth pulls the apple or holds the
 

1569
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,669
the earth pulls the apple or holds the
moon when it goes around whatever it is

1570
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:25,679
moon when it goes around whatever it is
 

1571
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,909
moon when it goes around whatever it is
uh that's not explained by newton even

1572
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,919
uh that's not explained by newton even
 

1573
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,909
uh that's not explained by newton even
though he has the most successful theory

a violation but he accurately describes

1580
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:36,640
a violation but he accurately describes
 

1581
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,470
a violation but he accurately describes
the movement of an object falling down

1582
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:38,480
the movement of an object falling down
 

1583
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,950
the movement of an object falling down
to earth but he's not answering why that

1584
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:40,960
to earth but he's not answering why that
 

1585
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,029
to earth but he's not answering why that
what's yeah yeah because it's a distance

1586
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,039
what's yeah yeah because it's a distance
 

1587
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,510
what's yeah yeah because it's a distance
he gives a formula right which which

1588
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,520
he gives a formula right which which
 

1589
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,549
he gives a formula right which which
it's the product of the earth's mass the

1590
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559
it's the product of the earth's mass the
 

1591
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,070
it's the product of the earth's mass the
apple's mass

1592
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,080
apple's mass
 

1593

00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:56,960
he called capital g the strength he
 

1599
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,190
he called capital g the strength he
couldn't determine but it was determined

1600
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,200
couldn't determine but it was determined
 

1601
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,870
couldn't determine but it was determined
100 years later

1602
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,880
100 years later
 

1603
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,029
100 years later
but no one ever saw a violation of this

1604
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
but no one ever saw a violation of this
 

1605
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,830
but no one ever saw a violation of this
until a possible violation which

1606
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
until a possible violation which
 

1607

00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:15,919
wrong if you calculated by
 

1617
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,669
wrong if you calculated by
newton's theory

1618

newton's theory
 

1619
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,669
newton's theory
but so

1620
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
but so
 

1621
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,029
but so
um like most theories then in in physics

1622
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:23,039
um like most theories then in in physics
 

1623
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,389
um like most theories then in in physics
you can have a wonderful one like

1624
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:24,399
you can have a wonderful one like
 

1625
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,510
you can have a wonderful one like
newton's theory it isn't wrong

1626
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:27,520
newton's theory it isn't wrong
 

1627
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,430
newton's theory it isn't wrong
but you have to have a

1628
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,440
but you have to have a
 

1629
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,909
but you have to have a
an improvement on it to answer things

1630
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:31,919
an improvement on it to answer things
 

1631
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,950
an improvement on it to answer things
that it can't answer and in this case

1632
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
that it can't answer and in this case
 

1633
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,669
that it can't answer and in this case
einstein's theory is the next step we

1634
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:37,679
einstein's theory is the next step we
 

1635
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,430
einstein's theory is the next step we
don't know if it's

1636
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440
don't know if it's
 

1637
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,230
don't know if it's
anything like a final theory or even the

1638
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,240
anything like a final theory or even the
 

1639
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,149
anything like a final theory or even the
only way to formulate it

1640
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159
only way to formulate it
 

1641
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,350
only way to formulate it
either

1642
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
either
 

1643
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,750
either
but he formulated this theory

1644
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:47,760
but he formulated this theory
 

1645
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,870
but he formulated this theory
which

1646
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
which
 

1647
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,990
which
which he

1648
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
which he
 

1649
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,510
which he
released in 1915

1650
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:53,520
released in 1915
 

1651
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,350
released in 1915
he took 10 years to develop but even

1652
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:55,360
he took 10 years to develop but even
 

1653
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,310
he took 10 years to develop but even
though in 1905 he solved three or four

1654
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:58,320
though in 1905 he solved three or four
 

1655
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,750
though in 1905 he solved three or four
of the most important problems in

1656
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
of the most important problems in
 

1657
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,510
of the most important problems in
physics in a matter of months and then

1658
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
physics in a matter of months and then
 

1659
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,669
physics in a matter of months and then
he spent 10 years on this problem before

1660
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:03,679
he spent 10 years on this problem before
 

1661
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,470
he spent 10 years on this problem before
he

1662
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,480
he
 

1663
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,389
he
uh let it out and it's called general

1664
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
uh let it out and it's called general
 

1665
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,430
uh let it out and it's called general
relativity it's a new theory of gravity

einstein

1670
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:14,399
einstein
 

1671
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,630
einstein
wrote a little paper

1672
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,640
wrote a little paper
 

1673
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,870
wrote a little paper
where he

1674
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
where he
 

1675
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,070
where he
did not do some fancy derivation instead

1676
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
did not do some fancy derivation instead
 

1677
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,990
did not do some fancy derivation instead
he did

1678
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,000

 

1679
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,029

what i would call it used his intuition

1680
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,039
what i would call it used his intuition
 

1681
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,990
what i would call it used his intuition
which he was very good at too

1682
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
which he was very good at too
 

1683
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,110
which he was very good at too
and that is he noticed that if he formed

1684
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
and that is he noticed that if he formed
 

1685
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,510
and that is he noticed that if he formed
if he wrote the formulas for general

1686
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:37,520
if he wrote the formulas for general
 

1687
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,990
if he wrote the formulas for general
relativity in a particular way

1688
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
relativity in a particular way
 

1689
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,230
relativity in a particular way
they looked a lot like the formulas for

1690
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
they looked a lot like the formulas for
 

1691
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,750
they looked a lot like the formulas for
electricity and magnetism

1692
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:45,760

 

1693
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,549

being einstein he then took the leap

1694
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:48,559
being einstein he then took the leap
 

1695
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,029
being einstein he then took the leap
that electricity and magnetism we

1696
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,039
that electricity and magnetism we
 

1697
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,190
that electricity and magnetism we
discovered only 20 years before that in

1698
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
discovered only 20 years before that in
 

1699
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,110
discovered only 20 years before that in
the 1880s

1700
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,120
the 1880s
 

1701
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,750
the 1880s
have waves of course that's

1702
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
have waves of course that's
 

1703
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,909
have waves of course that's
light and electromagnetic rays radio

1704
00:30:59,909 --> 00:30:59,919
light and electromagnetic rays radio
 

1705
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,230
light and electromagnetic rays radio
waves everything else so he said if the

1706
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:02,240
waves everything else so he said if the
 

1707
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,710
waves everything else so he said if the
formulas look similar

1708
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:04,720
formulas look similar
 

1709
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,310
formulas look similar
then gravity probably has ways too

1710
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
then gravity probably has ways too
 

1711
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,230
then gravity probably has ways too
that's such a big leap by the way i mean

1712
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,240
that's such a big leap by the way i mean
 

1713
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,830
that's such a big leap by the way i mean
maybe you can correct me but that just

1714
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
maybe you can correct me but that just
 

1715
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,350
maybe you can correct me but that just
seems

1716
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,360
seems
 

1717
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,430
seems
so that seems like a heck of a look yeah

1718
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
so that seems like a heck of a look yeah
 

1719
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,750
so that seems like a heck of a look yeah
and so that and it was considered to be

1720
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
and so that and it was considered to be
 

1721
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,389
and so that and it was considered to be
a heck of a leap so first that paper was

1722
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
a heck of a leap so first that paper was
 

1723
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,909
a heck of a leap so first that paper was
except for this

1724
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:21,919
except for this
 

1725
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,750
except for this
intuition was

1726
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
intuition was
 

1727
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,789
intuition was
uh

1728
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799
uh
 

1729
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,909
uh
poorly written had had a serious mistake

1730
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:27,919
poorly written had had a serious mistake
 

1731
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,149
poorly written had had a serious mistake
it had the a factor of two wrong and the

1732
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159
it had the a factor of two wrong and the
 

1733
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,149
it had the a factor of two wrong and the
strength of gravity which meant if we

1734
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:32,159
strength of gravity which meant if we
 

1735
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,310
strength of gravity which meant if we
use those formulas we would

1736
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:34,320
use those formulas we would
 

1737
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,230
use those formulas we would
and

1738
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
and
 

1739
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,909
and
two years later

1740
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
two years later
 

1741
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,070
two years later
he wrote a second paper

1742
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,080
he wrote a second paper
 

1743
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,389
he wrote a second paper
and in that paper it turns out to be

1744
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:42,399
and in that paper it turns out to be
 

1745
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,710
and in that paper it turns out to be
important for us because in that paper

1746
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:44,720
important for us because in that paper
 

1747
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,710
important for us because in that paper
he not only

1748
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:46,720
he not only
 

1749
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,190
he not only
fixed his factor of two mistake which he

1750
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,200
fixed his factor of two mistake which he
 

1751
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,750
fixed his factor of two mistake which he
never admitted he just wrote it fixed it

1752
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:51,760
never admitted he just wrote it fixed it
 

1753
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,750
never admitted he just wrote it fixed it
like he always did and

1754
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
like he always did and
 

1755
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,509
like he always did and
and then he

1756
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:55,519
and then he
 

1757
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,630
and then he
told us

1758
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:56,640
told us
 

1759
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,710
told us
how you make gravitational waves what

1760
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
how you make gravitational waves what
 

1761
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,950
how you make gravitational waves what
what makes gravitational waves

1762
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
what makes gravitational waves
 

1763
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,750
what makes gravitational waves
and

1764
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
and
 

1765
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,549
and
you might recall in electromagnetism we

1766
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
you might recall in electromagnetism we
 

1767
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,470
you might recall in electromagnetism we
make electromagnetic waves in a simple

1768
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,480
make electromagnetic waves in a simple
 

1769
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,310
make electromagnetic waves in a simple
way you take a plus charge and minus

1770
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
way you take a plus charge and minus
 

1771
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,470
way you take a plus charge and minus
charge you oscillate like this and that

1772
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
charge you oscillate like this and that
 

1773
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,630
charge you oscillate like this and that
makes electromagnetic waves

1774
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:12,640
makes electromagnetic waves
 

1775
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,789
makes electromagnetic waves
and a physicist named hertz

1776
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
and a physicist named hertz
 

1777
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,549
and a physicist named hertz
made a receiver that could detect the

1778
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
made a receiver that could detect the
 

1779
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,870
made a receiver that could detect the
waves and put in the next room

1780
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
waves and put in the next room
 

1781
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,470
waves and put in the next room
he saw them and moved forward and

1782
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
he saw them and moved forward and
 

1783
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,110
he saw them and moved forward and
backward and saw that it was wave-like

1784
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,120
backward and saw that it was wave-like
 

1785
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,710
backward and saw that it was wave-like
so

1786
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
so
 

1787
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,509
so
einstein said it won't be a dipole like

1788
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:27,519
einstein said it won't be a dipole like
 

1789
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,590
einstein said it won't be a dipole like
that it'll be a four-pole thing and

1790
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
that it'll be a four-pole thing and
 

1791
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,710
that it'll be a four-pole thing and
that's what

1792
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:30,720
that's what
 

1793
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,630
that's what
it's called a quadrupole moment that

1794
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:32,640
it's called a quadrupole moment that
 

1795
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,509
it's called a quadrupole moment that
gives the gravitational wave so he saw

1796
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:35,519
gives the gravitational wave so he saw
 

1797
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,190
gives the gravitational wave so he saw
that again by insight not by derivation

1798
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,200
that again by insight not by derivation
 

1799
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,110
that again by insight not by derivation
that's at the table for what you needed

1800
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,120
that's at the table for what you needed
 

1801
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,590
that's at the table for what you needed
to do to do it at the same time in the

1802
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,600
to do to do it at the same time in the
 

1803
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,950
to do to do it at the same time in the
same year schwartz child not einstein

1804
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:46,960
same year schwartz child not einstein
 

1805
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,630
same year schwartz child not einstein
said there were things like called black

1806
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:48,640
said there were things like called black
 

1807
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,789
said there were things like called black
holes so it's interesting that that came

1808
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
holes so it's interesting that that came
 

1809
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,430
holes so it's interesting that that came
the same so what year was that

1810
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,440
the same so what year was that
 

1811
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,590
the same so what year was that
2015.

1812
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:55,600
2015.
 

1813
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,509
2015.
it was in parallel

1814
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:57,519
it was in parallel
 

1815
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,870
it was in parallel
with i did

1816
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,880
with i did
 

1817
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,470
with i did
i should probably know this but did i

1818
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:00,480
i should probably know this but did i
 

1819
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,909
i should probably know this but did i
say not have any intuition that there

1820
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
say not have any intuition that there
 

1821
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,149
say not have any intuition that there
should be such things as black holes

1822
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:04,159
should be such things as black holes
 

1823
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,909
should be such things as black holes
that came from schwarzschild oh

1824
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:05,919
that came from schwarzschild oh
 

1825
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,190
that came from schwarzschild oh
interesting

1826
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
interesting
 

1827
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,990
interesting
yeah

1828
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
yeah
 

1829
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,710
yeah
so schwartz child who was a

1830
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
so schwartz child who was a
 

1831
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,509
so schwartz child who was a
a german theoretical physicist he got

1832
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
a german theoretical physicist he got
 

1833
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,669
a german theoretical physicist he got
killed in the war i think in the first

1834
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
killed in the war i think in the first
 

1835
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,470
killed in the war i think in the first
world war a year two years later

1836
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:18,480
world war a year two years later
 

1837
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,509
world war a year two years later
or so

1838
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:19,519
or so
 

1839
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,509
or so
he's the one that proposed black holes

1840
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:21,519
he's the one that proposed black holes
 

1841
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,870
he's the one that proposed black holes
that there were black holes it feels

1842
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
that there were black holes it feels
 

1843
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,190
that there were black holes it feels
like a natural conclusion of uh general

1844
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,200
like a natural conclusion of uh general
 

1845
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,950
like a natural conclusion of uh general
relativity you know

1846
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:26,960
relativity you know
 

1847
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,120
relativity you know
or is that uh

1848
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,130
or is that uh
 

1849
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,350
or is that uh
[Music]

1850
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
[Music]
 

1851
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,950
[Music]
well it may seem like it but i don't

1852
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:30,960
well it may seem like it but i don't
 

1853
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,950
well it may seem like it but i don't
know about a natural conclusion it is a

1854
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:32,960
know about a natural conclusion it is a
 

1855
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,630
know about a natural conclusion it is a
it's a result

1856
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:34,640
it's a result
 

1857
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,110
it's a result
of curved space time though right and

1858
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,120
of curved space time though right and
 

1859
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,950
of curved space time though right and
it's but it's such a weird result that

1860
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,960
it's but it's such a weird result that
 

1861
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,509
it's but it's such a weird result that
you might have to uh yeah it's a special

1862
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
you might have to uh yeah it's a special
 

1863
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,669
you might have to uh yeah it's a special
yeah it's a special case yeah

1864
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:43,679
yeah it's a special case yeah
 

1865
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,669
yeah it's a special case yeah
so um

1866
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:45,679
so um
 

1867
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,909
so um
i i don't know anyway

1868
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:47,919
i i don't know anyway
 

1869
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,909
i i don't know anyway
einstein then the interesting part of

1870
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:49,919
einstein then the interesting part of
 

1871
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,389
einstein then the interesting part of
the story is that einstein then left the

1872
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
the story is that einstein then left the
 

1873
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,549
the story is that einstein then left the
problem most physicists because it

1874
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:54,559
problem most physicists because it
 

1875
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,830
problem most physicists because it
really wasn't uh derived he just made

1876
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
really wasn't uh derived he just made
 

1877
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,710
really wasn't uh derived he just made
this

1878
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:58,720
this
 

1879
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,470
this
didn't pick up on it or general

1880
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:00,480
didn't pick up on it or general
 

1881
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,070
didn't pick up on it or general
relativity much because quantum

1882
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,080
relativity much because quantum
 

1883
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,590
relativity much because quantum
mechanics became the thing in physics

1884
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:05,600
mechanics became the thing in physics
 

1885
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,710
mechanics became the thing in physics
and

1886
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
and
 

1887
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,149
and
einstein

1888
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:08,159
einstein
 

1889
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,190
einstein
uh

1890
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
uh
 

1891
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,109
uh
only picked up this problem again after

1892
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,119
only picked up this problem again after
 

1893
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,109
only picked up this problem again after
he immigrated to the u.s so he came to

1894
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:13,119
he immigrated to the u.s so he came to
 

1895
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,349
he immigrated to the u.s so he came to
the u.s in 1932

1896
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:15,359
the u.s in 1932
 

1897
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,109
the u.s in 1932
and i think in 1934-5

1898
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:19,119
and i think in 1934-5
 

1899
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,109
and i think in 1934-5
he was working with another physicist

1900
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
he was working with another physicist
 

1901
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,030
he was working with another physicist
called rosen who he did several

1902
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
called rosen who he did several
 

1903
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,349
called rosen who he did several
important works with and they revisited

1904
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:25,359
important works with and they revisited
 

1905
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,790
important works with and they revisited
the question

1906
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:26,800
the question
 

1907
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,790
the question
and they

1908
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:28,800
and they
 

1909
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,750
and they
had a problem that most of us as

1910
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:31,760
had a problem that most of us as
 

1911
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,750
had a problem that most of us as
students always had that study general

1912
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
students always had that study general
 

1913
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,829
students always had that study general
relativity general relativity is really

1914
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:35,839
relativity general relativity is really
 

1915
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,669
relativity general relativity is really
hard because it's four-dimensional

1916
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:37,679
hard because it's four-dimensional
 

1917
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,909
hard because it's four-dimensional
instead of three-dimensional and if you

1918
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:39,919
instead of three-dimensional and if you
 

1919
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,790
instead of three-dimensional and if you
don't set it up right you get infinities

1920
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:42,800
don't set it up right you get infinities
 

1921
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,950
don't set it up right you get infinities
which don't belong there the we call

1922
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:44,960
which don't belong there the we call
 

1923
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,270
which don't belong there the we call
them coordinates singularities

1924
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:47,280
them coordinates singularities
 

1925
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,470
them coordinates singularities
as a name

1926
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
as a name
 

1927
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,149
as a name
but it but if you get these infinities

1928
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
but it but if you get these infinities
 

1929
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,750
but it but if you get these infinities
you don't get the answers you want and

1930
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760
you don't get the answers you want and
 

1931
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,149
you don't get the answers you want and
he was trying to derive now general

1932
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:56,159
he was trying to derive now general
 

1933
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,430
he was trying to derive now general
relativity out from general relativity

1934
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,440
relativity out from general relativity
 

1935
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,910
relativity out from general relativity
gravitational waves and in doing it he

1936
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920
gravitational waves and in doing it he
 

1937
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,230
gravitational waves and in doing it he
kept getting these infinities

1938
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,240
kept getting these infinities
 

1939
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,589
kept getting these infinities
and so he wrote a paper with rosen that

1940
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:07,599
and so he wrote a paper with rosen that
 

1941
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,510
and so he wrote a paper with rosen that
he submitted to

1942
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
he submitted to
 

1943
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,349
he submitted to
our most important journal physical

1944
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:11,359
our most important journal physical
 

1945
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,030
our most important journal physical

1946
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040
review letters
 

1947
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,870
review letters
and

1948
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:14,880
and
 

1949
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,950
and
that when it was submitted to physical

1950
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
that when it was submitted to physical
 

1951
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,589
that when it was submitted to physical
review letters it was entitled do

1952
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
review letters it was entitled do
 

1953
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,829
review letters it was entitled do
gravitational waves exist

1954
00:35:21,829 --> 00:35:21,839
gravitational waves exist
 

1955
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,990
gravitational waves exist
a very funny title to write 20 years

1956
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,000
a very funny title to write 20 years
 

1957
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,390
a very funny title to write 20 years
after he proposed they exist

1958
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,400
after he proposed they exist
 

1959
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,710
after he proposed they exist
but it's because he had found these

1960
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:28,720
but it's because he had found these
 

1961
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,750
but it's because he had found these
singularities these infinities

1962
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
singularities these infinities
 

1963
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,310
singularities these infinities
and so

1964
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:34,320

 

1965
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,230

1973
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,910
is peer review we live and die by peer
review as scientists send our stuff out

1974
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:45,920
review as scientists send our stuff out
 

1975
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,750
review as scientists send our stuff out
and it's we don't know when peer review

1976
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,760
and it's we don't know when peer review
 

1977
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,589
and it's we don't know when peer review
actually started

1978
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:49,599
actually started
 

1979
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,390
actually started
or what what peer review einstein ever

1980
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:52,400
or what what peer review einstein ever
 

1981
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,550
or what what peer review einstein ever
experienced before this time but the

1982
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
experienced before this time but the
 

1983
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,630
experienced before this time but the
editor of physical review sent this out

1984
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:56,640
editor of physical review sent this out
 

1985
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,790
editor of physical review sent this out
for review

1986
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:58,800
for review
 

1987
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,390
for review
he had a choice he could take any

1988
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:00,400
he had a choice he could take any
 

1989
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,430
he had a choice he could take any
article and just accept it he could

1990
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,440
article and just accept it he could
 

1991
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,510
article and just accept it he could
reject it or he could send it for review

1992
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
reject it or he could send it for review
 

1993
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,589
reject it or he could send it for review
right i believe the editors used to have

1994
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:07,599
right i believe the editors used to have
 

1995
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,910
right i believe the editors used to have
much more power yeah yeah and he was a

1996
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:09,920
much more power yeah yeah and he was a
 

1997
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,710
much more power yeah yeah and he was a
young man his name was tate and he ended

1998
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:12,720
young man his name was tate and he ended
 

1999
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,349
young man his name was tate and he ended
up being an editor for years but

2000
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
up being an editor for years but
 

2001
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,069
up being an editor for years but
so he sent this for review

2002
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
so he sent this for review
 

2003
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,910
so he sent this for review
to

2004
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
to
 

2005
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,990
to
a theoretical physicist named robertson

2006
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,000
a theoretical physicist named robertson
 

2007
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,069
a theoretical physicist named robertson
who was also in this field of general

2008
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:24,079
who was also in this field of general
 

2009
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,390
who was also in this field of general
relativity who happened to be on

2010
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,400
relativity who happened to be on
 

2011
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,950
relativity who happened to be on
sabbatical at that moment at caltech

2012
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:28,960
sabbatical at that moment at caltech
 

2013
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,950
sabbatical at that moment at caltech
otherwise his institution was princeton

2014
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:30,960
otherwise his institution was princeton
 

2015
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,910
otherwise his institution was princeton
where

2016
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:31,920
where
 

2017
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,670
where
einstein was

2018
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:33,680
einstein was
 

2019
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,270
einstein was
and he

2020
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
and he
 

2021
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,150
and he
saw that the way they set up the problem

2022
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,160
saw that the way they set up the problem
 

2023
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,030
saw that the way they set up the problem
the infinities were like i might get as

2024
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
the infinities were like i might get as
 

2025
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,790
the infinities were like i might get as
a student because if you don't set it up

2026
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:42,800
a student because if you don't set it up
 

2027
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,310
a student because if you don't set it up
right in general relativity you get

2028
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,320
right in general relativity you get
 

2029
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,190
right in general relativity you get
these

2030
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,200
these
 

2031
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,390
these
infinities

2032
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,400
infinities
 

2033
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,670
infinities
and so he reviewed the article and told

2034
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:49,680
and so he reviewed the article and told
 

2035
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,670
and so he reviewed the article and told
he gave an illustration that they set it

2036
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
he gave an illustration that they set it
 

2037
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,190
he gave an illustration that they set it
up in what are called cylindrical

2038
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,200
up in what are called cylindrical
 

2039
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,790
up in what are called cylindrical
coordinates these infinities went away

2040
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:56,800
coordinates these infinities went away
 

2041
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,310
coordinates these infinities went away
he's the

2042
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:58,320
he's the
 

2043
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,670
he's the
editor of

2044
00:36:59,670 --> 00:36:59,680
editor of
 

2045
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,670
editor of
uh physical review was obviously

2046
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
uh physical review was obviously
 

2047
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,910
uh physical review was obviously
intimidated by einstein he wrote this

2048
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:03,920
intimidated by einstein he wrote this
 

2049
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,750
intimidated by einstein he wrote this
really not not a letter back like i

2050
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:05,760
really not not a letter back like i
 

2051
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,990
really not not a letter back like i
would get saying you know you're screwed

2052
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
would get saying you know you're screwed
 

2053
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,990
would get saying you know you're screwed
up in your paper instead

2054
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,000
up in your paper instead
 

2055
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,470
up in your paper instead
it was kind of uh

2056
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,480
it was kind of uh
 

2057
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,290
it was kind of uh
what do you think of the comments of our

2058
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:14,300
what do you think of the comments of our
 

2059

letter to physical review saying
 

2067
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,150
letter to physical review saying
i didn't send you the paper

2068

i didn't send you the paper
 

2069

i now i withdraw the paper
and he never published again in the in

he
rewrote it

2082
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,280
rewrote it
 

2083
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,349
rewrote it
with the fixes that were made changed

2084
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
with the fixes that were made changed
 

2085
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,550
with the fixes that were made changed
the title

2086
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:46,560
the title
 

2087
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,950
the title
and published it in what was called the

2088
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:48,960
and published it in what was called the
 

2089
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,670
and published it in what was called the
franklin review which is the

uh franklin institute in philadelphia uh
 

2093
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,430
uh franklin institute in philadelphia uh
which is benjamin franklin institute

2094
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
which is benjamin franklin institute
 

2095
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,589
which is benjamin franklin institute
which doesn't have a journal now but

2096
00:37:59,589 --> 00:37:59,599
which doesn't have a journal now but
 

2097
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,430
which doesn't have a journal now but
did at that time so the article is

2098
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:01,440
did at that time so the article is
 

2099
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,270
did at that time so the article is
published it's the last time he ever

2100
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:03,280
published it's the last time he ever
 

2101
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,550
published it's the last time he ever
wrote about it

2102
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
wrote about it
 

2103
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,710
wrote about it
it remained controversial

2104
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:06,720
it remained controversial
 

2105
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,430
it remained controversial
so it wasn't until

2106
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
so it wasn't until
 

2107
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,950
so it wasn't until
close to 1960 1958 where there was a

2108
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:12,960
close to 1960 1958 where there was a
 

2109
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,910
close to 1960 1958 where there was a
conference in which brought that brought

2110
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:15,920
conference in which brought that brought
 

2111
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,109
conference in which brought that brought
together

2112
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:17,119
together
 

2113
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,390
together
the

2114
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:18,400
the
 

2115
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,829
the
experts in general relativity to try to

2116
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:21,839
experts in general relativity to try to
 

2117
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,310
experts in general relativity to try to
sort out whether there was uh

2118
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,320
sort out whether there was uh
 

2119
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,990
sort out whether there was uh
um

2120
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
um
 

2121
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,950
um
whether

2122
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:26,960
whether
 

2123
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,069
whether
it was true that there were

2124
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:28,079
it was true that there were
 

2125
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,069
it was true that there were
gravitational waves or not

2126
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,079
gravitational waves or not
 

2127
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,270
gravitational waves or not
and there was a very nice

2128
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:33,280
and there was a very nice
 

2129
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,470
and there was a very nice
derivation by a british

2130
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
derivation by a british
 

2131
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,589
derivation by a british
theorist

2132
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:37,599
theorist
 

2133
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:38,710
theorist
from

2134
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:38,720
from
 

2135
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,870
from
the heart of the theory that gets

2136
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:40,880
the heart of the theory that gets
 

2137
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,790
the heart of the theory that gets
gravitational waves

2138
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:42,800
gravitational waves
 

2139
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,030
gravitational waves
uh and that was number one the second

2140
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
uh and that was number one the second
 

2141
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,710
uh and that was number one the second
thing that happened at that meeting is

2142
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:46,720
thing that happened at that meeting is
 

2143
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,950
thing that happened at that meeting is
richard feynman was there

2144
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:48,960
richard feynman was there
 

2145
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,470
richard feynman was there
and feynman

2146
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:50,480
and feynman
 

2147
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,190
and feynman
said well if there's a typical feynman

2148
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
said well if there's a typical feynman
 

2149
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,190
said well if there's a typical feynman
if there's gravitational waves they need

2150
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:55,200
if there's gravitational waves they need
 

2151
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,349
if there's gravitational waves they need
to be able to do something otherwise

2152
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359
to be able to do something otherwise
 

2153
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,270
to be able to do something otherwise
they don't exist so they have to be able

2154
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,280
they don't exist so they have to be able
 

2155
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,150
they don't exist so they have to be able
to transfer energy so he made a

2156
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:02,160
to transfer energy so he made a
 

2157
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,470
to transfer energy so he made a
idea of a gadonkan experiment that is

2158
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:04,480
idea of a gadonkan experiment that is
 

2159
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,390
idea of a gadonkan experiment that is
just a bar

2160
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:06,400
just a bar
 

2161
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,390
just a bar
with a couple rings on it

2162
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,400
with a couple rings on it
 

2163
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,470
with a couple rings on it
and then if a gravitational wave goes

2164
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:10,480
and then if a gravitational wave goes
 

2165
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,829
and then if a gravitational wave goes
through it distorts the bar

2166
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:13,839
through it distorts the bar
 

2167
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,910
through it distorts the bar
that creates friction on these little

2168
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:15,920
that creates friction on these little
 

2169
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,109
that creates friction on these little
rings

2170
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:17,119
rings
 

2171
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,430
rings
and that's heat and that's energy so

2172
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
and that's heat and that's energy so
 

2173
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,670
and that's heat and that's energy so
that that meant is that a good idea that

2174
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:21,680
that that meant is that a good idea that
 

2175
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,589
that that meant is that a good idea that
sounds like a good idea yeah it means

2176
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
sounds like a good idea yeah it means
 

2177
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,069
sounds like a good idea yeah it means
that he showed that

2178
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:26,079
that he showed that
 

2179
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,230
that he showed that
with the distortion of space-time you

2180
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:28,240
with the distortion of space-time you
 

2181
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,390
with the distortion of space-time you
could transfer energy just by this

2182
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,400
could transfer energy just by this
 

2183
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,790
could transfer energy just by this
little idea and it was shown

2184
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:32,800
little idea and it was shown
 

2185
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,190
little idea and it was shown
theoretically so at that point

2186
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,200
theoretically so at that point
 

2187
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,670
theoretically so at that point
it was

2188
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:37,680

 

2189
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,470

believed theoretically then by

2190
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,480
believed theoretically then by
 

2191
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,990
believed theoretically then by
people that gravitational waves should

2192
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,000
people that gravitational waves should
 

2193
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,510
people that gravitational waves should
exist

2194
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
exist
 

2195
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,510
exist
no and we should be able to detect them

2196
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,520
no and we should be able to detect them
 

2197
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,589
no and we should be able to detect them
we should be able to detect them except

2198
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:47,599
we should be able to detect them except
 

2199
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,990
we should be able to detect them except
except that they're very very small

2200
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,000
except that they're very very small
 

2201
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,470
except that they're very very small
just so what kind of uh there's a bunch

2202
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:52,480
just so what kind of uh there's a bunch
 

2203
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,750
just so what kind of uh there's a bunch
of questions there but what kind of

2204
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:53,760
of questions there but what kind of
 

2205
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,270
of questions there but what kind of
events

2206
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280
events
 

2207
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,870
events
would generate

2208
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:56,880
would generate
 

2209
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,790
would generate
gravitational waves you have to have

2210
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,800
gravitational waves you have to have
 

2211
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,510
gravitational waves you have to have
this what i call quadrupole moment that

2212
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:01,520
this what i call quadrupole moment that
 

2213
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,710
this what i call quadrupole moment that
comes about if i have uh

2214
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:04,720
comes about if i have uh
 

2215
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,109
comes about if i have uh
for for example two objects that go

2216
00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:07,119
for for example two objects that go
 

2217
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,829
for for example two objects that go
around each other like this like the

2218
00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:09,839
around each other like this like the
 

2219
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,910
around each other like this like the
earth or the earth around the sun or the

2220
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
earth or the earth around the sun or the
 

2221
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,990
earth or the earth around the sun or the
moon around the earth or in our case it

2222
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,000
moon around the earth or in our case it
 

2223
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,829
moon around the earth or in our case it
turns out to be two black holes going

2224
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
turns out to be two black holes going
 

2225
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,990
turns out to be two black holes going
around each other like this so how's

2226
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,000
around each other like this so how's
 

2227
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,670
around each other like this so how's
that different than basic oscillation

2228
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680
that different than basic oscillation
 

2229
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,589
that different than basic oscillation
back and forth this is just more common

2230
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599
back and forth this is just more common
 

2231
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,910
back and forth this is just more common
in nature oscillation is a dipole moment

2232
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:23,920
in nature oscillation is a dipole moment
 

2233
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,109
in nature oscillation is a dipole moment
so it has to be in three-dimensional

2234
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:25,119
so it has to be in three-dimensional
 

2235
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,870
so it has to be in three-dimensional
space yeah kind of oscillations so you

2236
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:26,880
space yeah kind of oscillations so you
 

2237
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,990
space yeah kind of oscillations so you
have to have something that's

2238
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:28,000
have to have something that's
 

2239
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,069
have to have something that's
three-dimensional that'll give what's

2240
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
three-dimensional that'll give what's
 

2241
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,589
three-dimensional that'll give what's
what i call the quadrupole moment that's

2242
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:31,599
what i call the quadrupole moment that's
 

2243
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,510
what i call the quadrupole moment that's
just built into this and luckily in

2244
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
just built into this and luckily in
 

2245
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,270
just built into this and luckily in
nature you have stuff

2246
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:35,280
nature you have stuff
 

2247
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,349
nature you have stuff
and luckily things exist

2248
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:37,359
and luckily things exist
 

2249
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,510
and luckily things exist
and it is luckily because the effect is

2250
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:39,520
and it is luckily because the effect is
 

2251
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,069
and it is luckily because the effect is
so small that you could say look i can

2252
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:42,079
so small that you could say look i can
 

2253
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,309
so small that you could say look i can
take a barbell

2254
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:44,319
take a barbell
 

2255
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,349
take a barbell
and

2256
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:45,359
and
 

2257
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,150
and
and spin it right and detect the

2258
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
and spin it right and detect the
 

2259
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,390
and spin it right and detect the
gravitational waves but unfortunately no

2260
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:50,400
gravitational waves but unfortunately no
 

2261
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,790
gravitational waves but unfortunately no
matter how much i spin it how fast i

2262
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:52,800
matter how much i spin it how fast i
 

2263
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,109
matter how much i spin it how fast i
spin it it's so i know how to make

2264
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:55,119
spin it it's so i know how to make
 

2265
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,589
spin it it's so i know how to make
gravitational waves but they're so weak

2266
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:57,599
gravitational waves but they're so weak
 

2267
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,270
gravitational waves but they're so weak
i can't detect them so we have to take

2268
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,280
i can't detect them so we have to take
 

2269
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,430
i can't detect them so we have to take
something that's stronger than i can

2270
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
something that's stronger than i can
 

2271
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,510
something that's stronger than i can
make otherwise we would do what hertz

2272
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,520
make otherwise we would do what hertz
 

2273
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,589
make otherwise we would do what hertz
did for electromagnetic waves go in our

2274
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:05,599
did for electromagnetic waves go in our
 

2275
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,470
did for electromagnetic waves go in our
lab

2276
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:06,480
lab
 

2277
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,710
lab
take a barbell put it on something spin

2278
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:08,720
take a barbell put it on something spin
 

2279
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,150
take a barbell put it on something spin
it ask a dumb question so a uh a single

2280
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,160
it ask a dumb question so a uh a single
 

2281
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,309
it ask a dumb question so a uh a single
object that's weirdly shaped does that

2282
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:14,319
object that's weirdly shaped does that
 

2283
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,470
object that's weirdly shaped does that
generate gravitational waves so if it's

2284
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:16,480
generate gravitational waves so if it's
 

2285
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,790
generate gravitational waves so if it's
if it's rotating

2286
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
if it's rotating
 

2287
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,589
if it's rotating
sure

2288
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
sure
 

2289
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,150
sure
it it was just much weaker

2290
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,160
it it was just much weaker
 

2291
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,069
it it was just much weaker
it's weaker well we didn't know what the

2292
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:24,079
it's weaker well we didn't know what the
 

2293
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,309
it's weaker well we didn't know what the
strongest signal would be that we would

2294
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:26,319
strongest signal would be that we would
 

2295
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,349
strongest signal would be that we would
see

2296
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:27,359
see
 

2297
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,349
see
uh we targeted seeing something called

2298
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
uh we targeted seeing something called
 

2299
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,270
uh we targeted seeing something called
neutron stars actually because black

2300
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,280
neutron stars actually because black
 

2301
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,030
neutron stars actually because black
holes we don't know very much about it

2302
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,040
holes we don't know very much about it
 

2303
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,630
holes we don't know very much about it
turned out we were a little bit lucky

2304
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:34,640
turned out we were a little bit lucky
 

2305
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,790
turned out we were a little bit lucky
there was a stronger source which was

2306
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:36,800
there was a stronger source which was
 

2307
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,349
there was a stronger source which was
the black holes well another ridiculous

2308
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:39,359
the black holes well another ridiculous
 

2309
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,430
the black holes well another ridiculous
question so

2310
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
question so
 

2311
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,910
question so
you say waves what is what does a wave

2312
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:43,920
you say waves what is what does a wave
 

2313
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,309
you say waves what is what does a wave
mean like

2314
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:46,319
mean like
 

2315
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,150
mean like
the most ridiculous version of that

2316
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,160
the most ridiculous version of that
 

2317
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,030
the most ridiculous version of that
question is what does it feel like

2318
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,040
question is what does it feel like
 

2319
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,990
question is what does it feel like
to uh ride a wave as you get closer to

2320
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,000
to uh ride a wave as you get closer to
 

2321
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,390
to uh ride a wave as you get closer to
the source

2322
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
the source
 

2323
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,030
the source
or experience it well if you experience

2324
00:41:59,030 --> 00:41:59,040
or experience it well if you experience
 

2325
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,510
or experience it well if you experience
a wave imagine that this is what happens

2326
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:01,520
a wave imagine that this is what happens
 

2327
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,030
a wave imagine that this is what happens
to you

2328
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:03,040
to you
 

2329
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,470
to you
i don't know what you mean about getting

2330
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
i don't know what you mean about getting
 

2331
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,950
i don't know what you mean about getting
close it comes to you so it's like it's

2332
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960
close it comes to you so it's like it's
 

2333
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,589
close it comes to you so it's like it's
like uh this light wave or something

2334
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:09,599
like uh this light wave or something
 

2335
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,950
like uh this light wave or something
that comes through you so when the light

2336
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
that comes through you so when the light
 

2337
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,150
that comes through you so when the light
hits you it

2338
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,160
hits you it
 

2339
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,710
hits you it
makes your eyes detected

2340
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:14,720
makes your eyes detected
 

2341
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:17,829
makes your eyes detected
i flashed it what does this do is

2342
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:17,839
i flashed it what does this do is
 

2343
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,790
i flashed it what does this do is
it's like going to the amusement park

2344
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:20,800
it's like going to the amusement park
 

2345
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,710
it's like going to the amusement park
and they have these mirrors you look in

2346
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:22,720
and they have these mirrors you look in
 

2347
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,630
and they have these mirrors you look in
this mirror and you look short and fat

2348
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:24,640
this mirror and you look short and fat
 

2349
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,309
this mirror and you look short and fat
and the one next to you makes you tall

2350
00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:26,319
and the one next to you makes you tall
 

2351
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,270
and the one next to you makes you tall
and thin

2352
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:27,280
and thin
 

2353
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,069
and thin
okay

2354
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,079
okay
 

2355
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,630
okay
imagine that you went back and forth

2356
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,640
imagine that you went back and forth
 

2357
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,430
imagine that you went back and forth
between those two mirrors once a second

2358
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
between those two mirrors once a second
 

2359
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,190
between those two mirrors once a second
that would be a gravitational wave with

2360
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
that would be a gravitational wave with
 

2361
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,109
that would be a gravitational wave with
a period of once a second

2362
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:37,119
a period of once a second
 

2363
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,510
a period of once a second
uh if you did it 60 times a second go

2364
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:39,520
uh if you did it 60 times a second go
 

2365
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,030
uh if you did it 60 times a second go
back and forth and

2366
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:41,040
back and forth and
 

2367
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,630
back and forth and
and then that's all that happens it

2368
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:42,640
and then that's all that happens it
 

2369
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,870
and then that's all that happens it
makes you taller and shorter and fatter

2370
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:44,880
makes you taller and shorter and fatter
 

2371
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,670
makes you taller and shorter and fatter
back and forth as it goes through you

2372
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:47,680
back and forth as it goes through you
 

2373
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,430
back and forth as it goes through you
at the frequency of the gravitational

2374
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
at the frequency of the gravitational
 

2375
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,950
at the frequency of the gravitational
wave so

2376
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:50,960
wave so
 

2377
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,030
wave so
the frequencies that we detect are

2378
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,040
the frequencies that we detect are
 

2379
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,510
the frequencies that we detect are
higher than one a second but that's the

2380
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:55,520
higher than one a second but that's the
 

2381
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,349
higher than one a second but that's the
idea so but uh and the amount is small

2382
00:42:59,349 --> 00:42:59,359
idea so but uh and the amount is small
 

2383
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,750
idea so but uh and the amount is small
amount is small but when if you're

2384
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:01,760
amount is small but when if you're
 

2385
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,309
amount is small but when if you're
closer to the

2386
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:04,319
closer to the
 

2387
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,870
closer to the
to the source of the wave is it the same

2388
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880
to the source of the wave is it the same
 

2389
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,230
to the source of the wave is it the same
amount

2390
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
amount
 

2391
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,950
amount
yeah it's it doesn't dissipate it

2392
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:10,960
yeah it's it doesn't dissipate it
 

2393
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,349
yeah it's it doesn't dissipate it
doesn't dissipate

2394
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:13,359
doesn't dissipate
 

2395
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,870
doesn't dissipate
okay so it's not that fun of an

2396
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:14,880
okay so it's not that fun of an
 

2397
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,910
okay so it's not that fun of an
amusement ride well it it does dissipate

2398
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:17,920
amusement ride well it it does dissipate
 

2399
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,630
amusement ride well it it does dissipate
but it doesn't it doesn't it's it's just

2400
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:20,640
but it doesn't it doesn't it's it's just
 

2401
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,630
but it doesn't it doesn't it's it's just
it's proportional to the distance right

2402
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:22,640
it's proportional to the distance right
 

2403
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,270
it's proportional to the distance right
it's not uh it's not a big power right

2404
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
it's not uh it's not a big power right
 

2405
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,829
it's not uh it's not a big power right
gotcha so but so

2406
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
gotcha so but so
 

2407
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,510
gotcha so but so
it would be a fun ride if you get a

2408
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:29,520
it would be a fun ride if you get a
 

2409
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,829
it would be a fun ride if you get a
little bit closer or a lot closer

2410
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:31,839
little bit closer or a lot closer
 

2411
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,069
little bit closer or a lot closer
i mean like i i wonder what the

2412
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,079
i mean like i i wonder what the
 

2413
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,990
i mean like i i wonder what the
this is a ridiculous question but i have

2414
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
this is a ridiculous question but i have
 

2415
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,069
this is a ridiculous question but i have
you here

2416
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:38,079
you here
 

2417
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,750
you here
like the getting fatter and taller

2418
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:41,760
like the getting fatter and taller
 

2419
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,829
like the getting fatter and taller
i mean that experience

2420
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:43,839
i mean that experience
 

2421
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,670
i mean that experience
for some reason that's mind-blowing to

2422
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:45,680
for some reason that's mind-blowing to
 

2423
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,550
for some reason that's mind-blowing to
me

2424
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:46,560
me
 

2425
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,150
me
it brings

2426
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:48,160
it brings
 

2427
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,790
it brings
the distortion of space-time to you

2428
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:50,800
the distortion of space-time to you
 

2429
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,870
the distortion of space-time to you
i mean space-time is being morphed

2430
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:54,880
i mean space-time is being morphed
 

2431
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,190
i mean space-time is being morphed
right like this is a way right

2432
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:57,200
right like this is a way right
 

2433
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,470
right like this is a way right
that how that's so weird and we're in

2434
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480
that how that's so weird and we're in
 

2435
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,190
that how that's so weird and we're in
space so yeah we're in space and it's

2436
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200
space so yeah we're in space and it's
 

2437
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,710
space so yeah we're in space and it's
moving

2438
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
moving
 

2439
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,150
moving
i don't know what to do with it i mean

2440
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,160
i don't know what to do with it i mean
 

2441
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,470
i don't know what to do with it i mean
does it okay um

2442
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:08,480
does it okay um
 

2443
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,630
does it okay um
how much do you think about the

2444
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:10,640
how much do you think about the
 

2445
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,430
how much do you think about the
philosophical implications of

2446
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:13,440
philosophical implications of
 

2447
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,589
philosophical implications of
general relativity like that we're in

2448
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:15,599
general relativity like that we're in
 

2449
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,109
general relativity like that we're in
space time

2450
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:17,119
space time
 

2451
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,270
space time
and it can be bent by gravity

2452
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280

 

2453
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,710

like

2454
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:22,720
like
 

2455
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,710
like
is that just what it is are we are we

2456
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:24,720
is that just what it is are we are we
 

2457
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,309
is that just what it is are we are we
supposed to be okay with this

2458
00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:26,319
supposed to be okay with this
 

2459
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,910
supposed to be okay with this
because like newton

2460
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:27,920
because like newton
 

2461
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,589
because like newton
even newton is a little weird right but

2462
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:29,599
even newton is a little weird right but
 

2463
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,430
even newton is a little weird right but
that at least like makes sense that's

2464
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:31,440
that at least like makes sense that's
 

2465
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,030
that at least like makes sense that's
our physical world

2466
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:33,040
our physical world
 

2467
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,190
our physical world
you know when an apple falls it makes

2468
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
you know when an apple falls it makes
 

2469
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,390
you know when an apple falls it makes
sense

2470
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:36,400
sense
 

2471
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,349
sense
but like the fact that entirety of

2472
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:39,359
but like the fact that entirety of
 

2473
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:43,270
but like the fact that entirety of
the space time we're in can bend

2474
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:43,280
the space time we're in can bend
 

2475
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,870
the space time we're in can bend
well that's uh

2476
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:44,880
well that's uh
 

2477
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,829
well that's uh
that's i that's really mind-blowing

2478
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:47,839
that's i that's really mind-blowing
 

2479
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,829
that's i that's really mind-blowing
let me make another analogy this is a

2480
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:49,839
let me make another analogy this is a
 

2481
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,270
let me make another analogy this is a
therapy session for me at this point

2482
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,280
therapy session for me at this point
 

2483
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,990
therapy session for me at this point
right another analogy thank you so so

2484
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
right another analogy thank you so so
 

2485
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,870
right another analogy thank you so so
imagine you have a trampoline yes

2486
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:56,880
imagine you have a trampoline yes
 

2487
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,390
imagine you have a trampoline yes
okay

2488
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,400
okay
 

2489
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,990
okay
what happens if you put a marble on a

2490
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
what happens if you put a marble on a
 

2491
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,030
what happens if you put a marble on a
trampoline it doesn't do anything right

2492
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,040
trampoline it doesn't do anything right
 

2493
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,670
trampoline it doesn't do anything right
no just saves a little bit but not much

2494
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:05,680
no just saves a little bit but not much
 

2495
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,670
no just saves a little bit but not much
yeah i mean just if i drop it it's not

2496
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:07,680
yeah i mean just if i drop it it's not
 

2497
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,190
yeah i mean just if i drop it it's not
going to go anywhere

2498
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:09,200
going to go anywhere
 

2499
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,950
going to go anywhere
now imagine i put a bowling ball at the

2500
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:10,960
now imagine i put a bowling ball at the
 

2501
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,589
now imagine i put a bowling ball at the
center of the trampoline

2502
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
center of the trampoline
 

2503
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,390
center of the trampoline
now

2504
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,400
now
 

2505
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,309
now
i come up to the trampoline and put a

2506
00:45:16,309 --> 00:45:16,319
i come up to the trampoline and put a
 

2507
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,950
i come up to the trampoline and put a
marble on what happens

2508
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:18,960
marble on what happens
 

2509
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,430
marble on what happens
they'll roll towards the bowling ball

2510
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:21,440
they'll roll towards the bowling ball
 

2511
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,750
they'll roll towards the bowling ball
all right so what's happened is the

2512
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760
all right so what's happened is the
 

2513
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,670
all right so what's happened is the
presence of this

2514
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
presence of this
 

2515
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,870
presence of this
massive object distorted the space

2516
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:28,880
massive object distorted the space
 

2517
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,630
massive object distorted the space
that the trampoline did

2518
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:30,640
that the trampoline did
 

2519
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,349
that the trampoline did
this is the same thing that happens to

2520
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:33,359
this is the same thing that happens to
 

2521
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,150
this is the same thing that happens to
the presence of the earth

2522
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,160
the presence of the earth
 

2523
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,990
the presence of the earth
the earth and the apple the presence of

2524
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
the earth and the apple the presence of
 

2525
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,150
the earth and the apple the presence of
the earth affects the space around it

2526
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,160
the earth affects the space around it
 

2527
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,589
the earth affects the space around it
just like the

2528
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:41,599
just like the
 

2529
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,230
just like the
uh bowling ball on the trampoline yeah

2530
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:44,240
uh bowling ball on the trampoline yeah
 

2531
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,670
uh bowling ball on the trampoline yeah
this doesn't make me feel better i'm

2532
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:45,680
this doesn't make me feel better i'm
 

2533
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,270
this doesn't make me feel better i'm
referring from the perspective of an

2534
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
referring from the perspective of an
 

2535
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,150
referring from the perspective of an
aunt

2536
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,160
aunt
 

2537
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,430
aunt
walking around on that trampoline

2538
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:51,440
walking around on that trampoline
 

2539
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,230
walking around on that trampoline
then

2540
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:52,240
then
 

2541
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,270
then
some guy just dropped the ball and not

2542
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,280
some guy just dropped the ball and not
 

2543
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,870
some guy just dropped the ball and not
only dropped the ball right it's not

2544
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:56,880
only dropped the ball right it's not
 

2545
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,430
only dropped the ball right it's not
just dropping a bowling ball it's making

2546
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
just dropping a bowling ball it's making
 

2547
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,069
just dropping a bowling ball it's making
the the ball go up and down

2548
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:02,079
the the ball go up and down
 

2549
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,390
the the ball go up and down
or doing some kind of oscillation thing

2550
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:04,400
or doing some kind of oscillation thing
 

2551
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,390
or doing some kind of oscillation thing
where it's like waves

2552
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:06,400
where it's like waves
 

2553
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,309
where it's like waves
and that's so fundamentally different

2554
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,319
and that's so fundamentally different
 

2555
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,230
and that's so fundamentally different
from the experience on being on flat

2556
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,240
from the experience on being on flat
 

2557
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,309
from the experience on being on flat
land and walking around and just finding

2558
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:12,319
land and walking around and just finding
 

2559
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,710
land and walking around and just finding
delicious sweet things as ant does and

2560
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:14,720
delicious sweet things as ant does and
 

2561
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,550
delicious sweet things as ant does and
just it just feels like to me from a

2562
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:16,560
just it just feels like to me from a
 

2563
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,030
just it just feels like to me from a
human experience perspective

2564
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,040
human experience perspective
 

2565
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,270
human experience perspective
completely it's humbling it's truly

2566
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
completely it's humbling it's truly
 

2567
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,790
completely it's humbling it's truly
humbling

2568
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:22,800
humbling
 

2569
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,390
humbling
it's something but we see that kind of

2570
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:24,400
it's something but we see that kind of
 

2571
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,790
it's something but we see that kind of
phenomenon all the time

2572
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:26,800
phenomenon all the time
 

2573
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,430
phenomenon all the time
let me give you another example imagine

2574
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440
let me give you another example imagine
 

2575
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,109
let me give you another example imagine
that you walk up to a

2576
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,119
that you walk up to a
 

2577
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,870
that you walk up to a
a still pond

2578
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
a still pond
 

2579
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,390
a still pond
yes okay

2580
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:34,400
yes okay
 

2581
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,510
yes okay
now i throw

2582
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
now i throw
 

2583
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,349
now i throw
it you like to throw you throw a rock in

2584
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:37,359
it you like to throw you throw a rock in
 

2585
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,190
it you like to throw you throw a rock in
it what happens

2586
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
it what happens
 

2587
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,349
it what happens
the rock goes in sinks to the bottom

2588
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:41,359
the rock goes in sinks to the bottom
 

2589
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,750
the rock goes in sinks to the bottom
fine and these little ripples go out

2590
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:43,760
fine and these little ripples go out
 

2591
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,150
fine and these little ripples go out
yeah and they travel

2592
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:46,160
yeah and they travel
 

2593
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,390
yeah and they travel
out that's exactly what happens i mean

2594
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:48,400
out that's exactly what happens i mean
 

2595
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,150
out that's exactly what happens i mean
there's a disturbance

2596
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
there's a disturbance
 

2597
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,829
there's a disturbance
which is the safe

2598
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:51,839
which is the safe
 

2599
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,550
which is the safe
the bowling ball or our black holes and

2600
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:54,560
the bowling ball or our black holes and
 

2601
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,190
the bowling ball or our black holes and
then the ripples that go out in the

2602
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
then the ripples that go out in the
 

2603
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,750
then the ripples that go out in the
water they're not they don't have any

2604
00:46:59,750 --> 00:46:59,760
water they're not they don't have any
 

2605
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,910
water they're not they don't have any
they don't have the rock any part pieces

2606
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:01,920
they don't have the rock any part pieces
 

2607
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,309
they don't have the rock any part pieces
of the rock i see the thing is i guess

2608
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:04,319
of the rock i see the thing is i guess
 

2609
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,950
of the rock i see the thing is i guess
what's not disturbing about that

2610
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:06,960
what's not disturbing about that
 

2611
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,990
what's not disturbing about that
is it's a i mean it's a i guess a flat

2612
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,000
is it's a i mean it's a i guess a flat
 

2613
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,430
is it's a i mean it's a i guess a flat
two-dimensional surface that's being

2614
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:11,440
two-dimensional surface that's being
 

2615
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,710
two-dimensional surface that's being
disturbed

2616
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:12,720
disturbed
 

2617
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,390
disturbed
like for a three-dimensional surface a

2618
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
like for a three-dimensional surface a
 

2619
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,950
like for a three-dimensional surface a
three-dimensional space to be disturbed

2620
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:18,960
three-dimensional space to be disturbed
 

2621
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,950
three-dimensional space to be disturbed
feels weird it's even worse it's

2622
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:20,960
feels weird it's even worse it's
 

2623
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,790
feels weird it's even worse it's
four-dimensional because it's space and

2624
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:22,800
four-dimensional because it's space and
 

2625
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,790
four-dimensional because it's space and
time yeah

2626
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:24,800
time yeah
 

2627
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,870
time yeah
so that's why you need einstein is to

2628
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:26,880
so that's why you need einstein is to
 

2629
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,309
so that's why you need einstein is to
make it uh

2630
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
make it uh
 

2631
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,549
make it uh
four-dimensional no

2632
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:30,559
four-dimensional no
 

2633
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,549
four-dimensional no
to make it four-dimensional yeah yeah

2634
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:32,559
to make it four-dimensional yeah yeah
 

2635
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,390
to make it four-dimensional yeah yeah
it's gonna take the same phenomenon and

2636
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:34,400
it's gonna take the same phenomenon and
 

2637
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,190
it's gonna take the same phenomenon and
and

2638
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:35,200
and
 

2639
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,309
and
look at it in all of space and time

2640
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:38,319
look at it in all of space and time
 

2641
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,790
look at it in all of space and time
anyway luckily

2642
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:40,800
anyway luckily
 

2643
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,349
anyway luckily
for you and i and all of us

2644
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:43,359
for you and i and all of us
 

2645
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,510
for you and i and all of us
the amount of distortion is incredibly

2646
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:45,520
the amount of distortion is incredibly
 

2647
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,589
the amount of distortion is incredibly
small

2648
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:47,599
small
 

2649
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,030
small
so it turns out

2650
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,040
so it turns out
 

2651
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,670
so it turns out
that if you think of space

2652
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:51,680
that if you think of space
 

2653
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,750
that if you think of space
itself now this is going to blow your

2654
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:53,760
itself now this is going to blow your
 

2655
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,589
itself now this is going to blow your
mind too if you think of space as being

2656
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:55,599
mind too if you think of space as being
 

2657
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,630
mind too if you think of space as being
like a material like this table

2658
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:58,640
like a material like this table
 

2659
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,230
like a material like this table
it's very stiff you know we have

2660
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:00,240
it's very stiff you know we have
 

2661
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,910
it's very stiff you know we have
materials that are very pliable

2662
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:01,920
materials that are very pliable
 

2663
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,670
materials that are very pliable
materials that are very stiff

2664
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:03,680
materials that are very stiff
 

2665
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,470
materials that are very stiff
so

2666
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,480
so
 

2667
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,470
so
space itself is very stiff

2668
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:06,480
space itself is very stiff
 

2669
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,309
space itself is very stiff
so when gravitational waves come through

2670
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:08,319
so when gravitational waves come through
 

2671
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,470
so when gravitational waves come through
it luckily for us it doesn't distort it

2672
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,480
it luckily for us it doesn't distort it
 

2673
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,670
it luckily for us it doesn't distort it
so much that it affects our ordinary

2674
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:13,680
so much that it affects our ordinary
 

2675
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,150
so much that it affects our ordinary
life very much

2676
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,160
life very much
 

2677
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,829
life very much
no i mean that's great

2678
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839
no i mean that's great
 

2679
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,109
no i mean that's great
that's great i thought there was

2680
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:19,119
that's great i thought there was
 

2681
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,710
that's great i thought there was
something bad coming no this is great

2682
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:20,720
something bad coming no this is great
 

2683
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,710
something bad coming no this is great
that's great news so i mean that i mean

2684
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
that's great news so i mean that i mean
 

2685
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,549
that's great news so i mean that i mean
perhaps we evolved as the life on earth

2686
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:26,559
perhaps we evolved as the life on earth
 

2687
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:27,430
perhaps we evolved as the life on earth
do we

2688
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
do we
 

2689
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,270
do we
so to be such that for us this

2690
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:29,280
so to be such that for us this
 

2691
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,750
so to be such that for us this
particular set of uh effects of

2692
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:31,760
particular set of uh effects of
 

2693
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,349
particular set of uh effects of
gravitational waves

2694
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:33,359
gravitational waves
 

2695
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,549
gravitational waves
uh is not that significant maybe maybe

2696
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
uh is not that significant maybe maybe
 

2697
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,870
uh is not that significant maybe maybe
that's why you probably used

2698
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:38,880
that's why you probably used
 

2699
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,829
that's why you probably used
this effect today

2700
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:41,839
this effect today
 

2701
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,670
this effect today
or yesterday

2702
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
or yesterday
 

2703
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,309
or yesterday
so it's it's pervasive well you mean

2704
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:46,319
so it's it's pervasive well you mean
 

2705
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,430
so it's it's pervasive well you mean
gravity or the way the external

2706
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
gravity or the way the external
 

2707
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,430
gravity or the way the external
because i only curvature of space

2708
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:51,440
because i only curvature of space
 

2709
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,470
because i only curvature of space
curvature of space how i only care

2710
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:54,480
curvature of space how i only care
 

2711
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,150
curvature of space how i only care
personally as a human right the gravity

2712
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:56,160
personally as a human right the gravity
 

2713
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,990
personally as a human right the gravity
of earth but you use it every day almost

2714
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,000
of earth but you use it every day almost
 

2715
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,030
of earth but you use it every day almost
oh it's curving uh-huh no no no it's in

2716
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,040
oh it's curving uh-huh no no no it's in
 

2717
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,230
oh it's curving uh-huh no no no it's in
this thing

2718
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,240
this thing
 

2719
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,790
this thing
every time it tells you where you are

2720
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:06,800
every time it tells you where you are
 

2721
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,589
every time it tells you where you are
yeah

2722
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:07,599
yeah
 

2723
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,750
yeah
it how does it tell you where you are

2724
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,760
it how does it tell you where you are
 

2725
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,190
it how does it tell you where you are
it tells you where you are because we

2726
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:11,200
it tells you where you are because we
 

2727
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,510
it tells you where you are because we
have 24 satellites or some number that

2728
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:13,520
have 24 satellites or some number that
 

2729
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,630
have 24 satellites or some number that
are going around in space and it

2730
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
are going around in space and it
 

2731
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,270
are going around in space and it
asks how long it takes the

2732
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,280
asks how long it takes the
 

2733
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,230
asks how long it takes the
being

2734
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:20,240
being
 

2735
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,470
being
to go to the satellite and come back the

2736
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:22,480
to go to the satellite and come back the
 

2737
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,710
to go to the satellite and come back the
signal to different ones and then it

2738
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:24,720
signal to different ones and then it
 

2739
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,270
signal to different ones and then it
triangulates and tells you where you are

2740
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:27,280
triangulates and tells you where you are
 

2741
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,630
triangulates and tells you where you are
and then if you go down the road it

2742
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:28,640
and then if you go down the road it
 

2743
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,870
and then if you go down the road it
tells you where you are do you know that

2744
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:30,880
tells you where you are do you know that
 

2745
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,710
tells you where you are do you know that
if you did that with the satellites and

2746
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
if you did that with the satellites and
 

2747
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,109
if you did that with the satellites and
you didn't use einstein's equations oh

2748
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:35,119
you didn't use einstein's equations oh
 

2749
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:35,910
you didn't use einstein's equations oh
no

2750
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:35,920
no
 

2751
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,430
no
you want it you won't get the right

2752
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:37,440
you want it you won't get the right
 

2753
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,910
you want it you won't get the right
answer that's right and

2754
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:39,920
answer that's right and
 

2755
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,630
answer that's right and
in fact if you take a road let's say 10

2756
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:42,640
in fact if you take a road let's say 10
 

2757
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,710
in fact if you take a road let's say 10
meters wide i've done these numbers and

2758
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:44,720
meters wide i've done these numbers and
 

2759
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,549
meters wide i've done these numbers and
you ask how long you'd stay on the road

2760
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
you ask how long you'd stay on the road
 

2761
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,870
you ask how long you'd stay on the road
if you didn't make the correction

2762
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:48,880
if you didn't make the correction
 

2763
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,910
if you didn't make the correction
for

2764
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:49,920
for
 

2765
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,750
for
general relativity this thing you're poo

2766
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:51,760
general relativity this thing you're poo
 

2767
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,230
general relativity this thing you're poo
pooing because you're using every day

2768
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
pooing because you're using every day
 

2769
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,589
pooing because you're using every day
uh you'd go off the road and you'd go

2770
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:55,599
uh you'd go off the road and you'd go
 

2771
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,109
uh you'd go off the road and you'd go
the middle road well actually that might

2772
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:57,119
the middle road well actually that might
 

2773
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,470
the middle road well actually that might
be so you use it so so well

2774
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:00,480
be so you use it so so well
 

2775
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,230
be so you use it so so well
well i think i'm using an android so

2776
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,240
well i think i'm using an android so
 

2777
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,910
well i think i'm using an android so
maybe and the gps doesn't work that well

2778
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
maybe and the gps doesn't work that well
 

2779
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,990
maybe and the gps doesn't work that well
so maybe i'm using newton's physics uh

2780
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
so maybe i'm using newton's physics uh
 

2781
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,349
so maybe i'm using newton's physics uh
so i need to upgrade to general

2782
00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:07,359
so i need to upgrade to general
 

2783
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,309
so i need to upgrade to general
relativity um so

2784
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:10,319
relativity um so
 

2785
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,950
relativity um so
gravitational waves and einstein

2786
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:12,960
gravitational waves and einstein
 

2787
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,910
gravitational waves and einstein
had uh wait fireman really does have a

2788
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:15,920
had uh wait fireman really does have a
 

2789
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,069
had uh wait fireman really does have a
part in the story was that one of the

2790
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:18,079
part in the story was that one of the
 

2791
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:20,390
part in the story was that one of the
first kind of experimental pro

2792
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,400
first kind of experimental pro
 

2793
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,710
first kind of experimental pro
proposed detect gravitation well he did

2794
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:22,720
proposed detect gravitation well he did
 

2795
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,390
proposed detect gravitation well he did
what we call a gadonkan experiment

2796
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
what we call a gadonkan experiment
 

2797
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,390
what we call a gadonkan experiment
that's a thought experience okay not a

2798
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
that's a thought experience okay not a
 

2799
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,829
that's a thought experience okay not a
real experiment but then after that

2800
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:29,839
real experiment but then after that
 

2801
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,750
real experiment but then after that
then people believe gravitational waves

2802
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:31,760
then people believe gravitational waves
 

2803
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,990
then people believe gravitational waves
must exist you can kind of calculate how

2804
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:34,000
must exist you can kind of calculate how
 

2805
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,829
must exist you can kind of calculate how
big they are there's tiny

2806
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:35,839
big they are there's tiny
 

2807
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:36,950
big they are there's tiny
and so

2808
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960
and so
 

2809
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,870
and so
people started searching the first idea

2810
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
people started searching the first idea
 

2811
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,589
people started searching the first idea
that was used was feynman's idea

2812
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599
that was used was feynman's idea
 

2813
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,790
that was used was feynman's idea
and the

2814
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:42,800
and the
 

2815
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,069
and the
very end of it

2816
00:50:44,069 --> 00:50:44,079
very end of it
 

2817
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,309
very end of it
and it was to take a great big

2818
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
and it was to take a great big
 

2819
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,870
and it was to take a great big
huge bar of aluminum

2820
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:48,880
huge bar of aluminum
 

2821
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,349
huge bar of aluminum
and then put around and it's a it's made

2822
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:51,359
and then put around and it's a it's made
 

2823
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,790
and then put around and it's a it's made
like a cylinder

2824
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:52,800
like a cylinder
 

2825
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,870
like a cylinder
and then put around it some very very

2826
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
and then put around it some very very
 

2827
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,349
and then put around it some very very
sensitive detectors so that if a

2828
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:57,359
sensitive detectors so that if a
 

2829
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,870
sensitive detectors so that if a
gravitational wave happened to go

2830
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
gravitational wave happened to go
 

2831
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,510
gravitational wave happened to go
through it it would go

2832
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:01,520
through it it would go
 

2833
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,910
through it it would go
and you detect this extra strain that

2834
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:03,920
and you detect this extra strain that
 

2835
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,790
and you detect this extra strain that
was there and that was this method that

2836
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:06,800
was there and that was this method that
 

2837
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,829
was there and that was this method that
was used until we came along it wasn't a

2838
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:09,839
was used until we came along it wasn't a
 

2839
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,150
was used until we came along it wasn't a
very good method to use

2840
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:12,160
very good method to use
 

2841
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,470
very good method to use
and what was the

2842
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:14,480
and what was the
 

2843
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,069
and what was the
so we're talking about a pretty weak

2844
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:16,079
so we're talking about a pretty weak
 

2845
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,470
so we're talking about a pretty weak
signal here yeah that's why that method

2846
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:18,480
signal here yeah that's why that method
 

2847
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,790
signal here yeah that's why that method
didn't work so what can you tell the

2848
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:20,800
didn't work so what can you tell the
 

2849
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,430
didn't work so what can you tell the
story of figuring out what kind of

2850
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:23,440
story of figuring out what kind of
 

2851
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,470
story of figuring out what kind of
method would be able to detect

2852
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:26,480
method would be able to detect
 

2853
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,390
method would be able to detect
this very weak signal of gravitational

2854
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:28,400
this very weak signal of gravitational
 

2855
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,069
this very weak signal of gravitational
waves

2856
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:30,079
waves
 

2857
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,270
waves
so

2858
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:31,280
so
 

2859
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,790
so
remembering the

2860
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:32,800
remembering the
 

2861
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,190
remembering the
remembering what happens if you when you

2862
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:35,200
remembering what happens if you when you
 

2863
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,430
remembering what happens if you when you
go to the amusement park yeah that it's

2864
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:37,440
go to the amusement park yeah that it's
 

2865
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,589
go to the amusement park yeah that it's
going to do something like

2866
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:39,599
going to do something like
 

2867
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,589
going to do something like
stretch this way and squash that way

2868
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:41,599
stretch this way and squash that way
 

2869
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,150
stretch this way and squash that way
squash this way and stretch this way we

2870
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:44,160
squash this way and stretch this way we
 

2871
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,430
squash this way and stretch this way we
do have an

2872
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
do have an
 

2873
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,270
do have an
instrument that can detect that kind of

2874
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
instrument that can detect that kind of
 

2875
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,230
instrument that can detect that kind of
thing

2876
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:48,240
thing
 

2877
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,950
thing
it's called an interferometer

2878
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
it's called an interferometer
 

2879
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,630
it's called an interferometer
and what it does

2880
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:52,640
and what it does
 

2881
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,030
and what it does
is it just basically takes usually light

2882
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
is it just basically takes usually light
 

2883
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,870
is it just basically takes usually light
and the two directions that we're

2884
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:58,880
and the two directions that we're
 

2885
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,190
and the two directions that we're
talking about you send light down one

2886
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:01,200
talking about you send light down one
 

2887
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,190
talking about you send light down one
direction and the perpendicular

2888
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,200
direction and the perpendicular
 

2889
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,829
direction and the perpendicular
direction and if

2890
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:05,839
direction and if
 

2891
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,309
direction and if
nothing changes it takes the same and

2892
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:08,319
nothing changes it takes the same and
 

2893
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,710
nothing changes it takes the same and
the arms are the same length it just

2894
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:10,720
the arms are the same length it just
 

2895
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,950
the arms are the same length it just
goes down bounces back

2896
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:12,960
goes down bounces back
 

2897
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,870
goes down bounces back
and if you invert one compared to the

2898
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:14,880
and if you invert one compared to the
 

2899
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,630
and if you invert one compared to the
other they cancel so there's nothing

2900
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:16,640
other they cancel so there's nothing
 

2901
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,670
other they cancel so there's nothing
happens

2902
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:17,680
happens
 

2903
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,549
happens
but

2904
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:18,559
but
 

2905
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,549
but
if it's like the amusement park and one

2906
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:20,559
if it's like the amusement park and one
 

2907
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,030
if it's like the amusement park and one
of the arms got you know got shorter and

2908
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,040
of the arms got you know got shorter and
 

2909
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,109
of the arms got you know got shorter and
fatter so it took longer to go

2910
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:25,119
fatter so it took longer to go
 

2911
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,549
fatter so it took longer to go
horizontally than it did to go

2912
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:26,559
horizontally than it did to go
 

2913
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,950
horizontally than it did to go
vertically then when they come back when

2914
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:28,960
vertically then when they come back when
 

2915
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,910
vertically then when they come back when
when the

2916
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:29,920
when the
 

2917
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,750
when the
light comes back that comes back

2918
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:31,760
light comes back that comes back
 

2919
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,870
light comes back that comes back
somewhat

2920
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:32,880
somewhat
 

2921
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,309
somewhat
out of time

2922
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:34,319
out of time
 

2923
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,870
out of time
and that basically is the scheme

2924
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:36,880
and that basically is the scheme
 

2925
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,069
and that basically is the scheme
the only problem is that that's not

2926
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,079
the only problem is that that's not
 

2927
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,470
the only problem is that that's not
a very done very accurately

2928
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480
a very done very accurately
 

2929
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,870
a very done very accurately
in general and we had to do it extremely

2930
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:44,880
in general and we had to do it extremely
 

2931
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,190
in general and we had to do it extremely
accurately so what uh

2932
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:47,200
accurately so what uh
 

2933
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,750
accurately so what uh
what what's the what's the difficulty of

2934
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:49,760
what what's the what's the difficulty of
 

2935
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,549
what what's the what's the difficulty of
uh

2936
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:50,559
uh
 

2937
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,109
uh
doing so accurately okay

2938
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:53,119
doing so accurately okay
 

2939
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,750
doing so accurately okay
so the the measurement that we have to

2940
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:55,760
so the the measurement that we have to
 

2941
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,710
so the the measurement that we have to
do

2942
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:56,720
do
 

2943
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,870
do
is the distortion in time

2944
00:52:58,870 --> 00:52:58,880
is the distortion in time
 

2945
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,670
is the distortion in time
how big is it one it's a distortion

2946
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:01,680
how big is it one it's a distortion
 

2947
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,309
how big is it one it's a distortion
that's one part and 10 to the 21 that's

2948
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:04,319
that's one part and 10 to the 21 that's
 

2949
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,510
that's one part and 10 to the 21 that's
21 zeros and a one

2950
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:07,520
21 zeros and a one
 

2951
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,670
21 zeros and a one
okay wow and this so this is like a

2952
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
okay wow and this so this is like a
 

2953
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,790
okay wow and this so this is like a
delay in the thing coming back

2954
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:12,800
delay in the thing coming back
 

2955
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,030
delay in the thing coming back
uh it's a one of them coming back after

2956
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:15,040
uh it's a one of them coming back after
 

2957
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,109
uh it's a one of them coming back after
the other one but the difference is just

2958
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:17,119
the other one but the difference is just
 

2959
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,309
the other one but the difference is just
one part and 10 to the 21.

2960
00:53:20,309 --> 00:53:20,319
one part and 10 to the 21.
 

2961
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,190
one part and 10 to the 21.
so for that reason we make it big

2962
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
so for that reason we make it big
 

2963
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,510
so for that reason we make it big
let it let the arms be long

2964
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:25,520
let it let the arms be long
 

2965
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,710
let it let the arms be long
okay so one part and 10 to the 21.

2966
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:28,720
okay so one part and 10 to the 21.
 

2967
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,430
okay so one part and 10 to the 21.
in our case it's kilometers long so we

2968
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:31,440
in our case it's kilometers long so we
 

2969
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,109
in our case it's kilometers long so we
have an instrument that kilometers in

2970
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:33,119
have an instrument that kilometers in
 

2971
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,190
have an instrument that kilometers in
one direction kilometers in the other

2972
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:35,200
one direction kilometers in the other
 

2973
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,549
one direction kilometers in the other
kilometers we're talking about four

2974
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:36,559
kilometers we're talking about four
 

2975
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,470
kilometers we're talking about four
kilometers four kilometers in each

2976
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480
kilometers four kilometers in each
 

2977
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,069
kilometers four kilometers in each
direction

2978
00:53:40,069 --> 00:53:40,079
direction
 

2979
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,190
direction
uh

2980
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:41,200
uh
 

2981
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,430
uh
if you take then one part and 10 to the

2982
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
if you take then one part and 10 to the
 

2983
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,910
if you take then one part and 10 to the
21 we're talking about measuring

2984
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:45,920
21 we're talking about measuring
 

2985
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,710
21 we're talking about measuring
something to

2986
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:48,720
something to
 

2987
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,710
something to
10 to the minus 18 meters

2988
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:54,720

 

2989
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,589

okay

2990
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:55,599
okay
 

2991
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,990
okay
now to tell you how small that is yeah

2992
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
now to tell you how small that is yeah
 

2993
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,870
now to tell you how small that is yeah
the proton yeah the thing we're made of

2994
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:00,880
the proton yeah the thing we're made of
 

2995
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,109
the proton yeah the thing we're made of
that you can't go and grab so easily is

2996
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
that you can't go and grab so easily is
 

2997
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,430
that you can't go and grab so easily is
10 to the minus 15 meters

2998
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
10 to the minus 15 meters
 

2999
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,549
10 to the minus 15 meters
so this is 1 1000 the size of a proton

3000
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:08,559
so this is 1 1000 the size of a proton
 

3001
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,069
so this is 1 1000 the size of a proton
that's the effect size of the effect

3002
00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:12,079
that's the effect size of the effect
 

3003
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,069
that's the effect size of the effect
einstein himself didn't think this could

3004
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
einstein himself didn't think this could
 

3005
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,390
einstein himself didn't think this could
be measured have we ever seen

3006
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:16,400
be measured have we ever seen
 

3007
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,549
be measured have we ever seen
actually he said that

3008
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:18,559
actually he said that
 

3009
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,549
actually he said that
but that's because he didn't

3010
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:20,559
but that's because he didn't
 

3011
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,510
but that's because he didn't
you know anticipate modern lasers and

3012
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
you know anticipate modern lasers and
 

3013
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,190
you know anticipate modern lasers and
and techniques that we developed

3014
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:27,200
and techniques that we developed
 

3015
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,069
and techniques that we developed
okay

3016
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:28,079
okay
 

3017
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,190
okay
so

3018
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,200
so
 

3019
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,950
so
maybe can you tell me

3020
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
maybe can you tell me
 

3021
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,470
maybe can you tell me
a little bit what you're referring to is

3022
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:32,480
a little bit what you're referring to is
 

3023
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,109
a little bit what you're referring to is
ligo the laser uh interferometer

3024
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:35,119
ligo the laser uh interferometer
 

3025
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,589
ligo the laser uh interferometer
gravitational wave observatory

3026
00:54:37,589 --> 00:54:37,599
gravitational wave observatory
 

3027
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,349
gravitational wave observatory
what is ligo

3028
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:39,359
what is ligo
 

3029
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,030
what is ligo
can you just elaborate kind of the big

3030
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
can you just elaborate kind of the big
 

3031
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,549
can you just elaborate kind of the big
picture of you here before i ask you

3032
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559
picture of you here before i ask you
 

3033
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,430
picture of you here before i ask you
specific questions about it yeah so

3034
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:45,440
specific questions about it yeah so
 

3035
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,750
specific questions about it yeah so
in the same idea that i just said we

3036
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:47,760
in the same idea that i just said we
 

3037
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,950
in the same idea that i just said we
have

3038
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960
have
 

3039
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,349
have
two long vacuum

3040
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:51,359
two long vacuum
 

3041
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,390
two long vacuum
pipes

3042
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:52,400
pipes
 

3043
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,589
pipes
10 to

3044
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:53,599
10 to
 

3045
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,870
10 to
4 kilometers long okay

3046
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:56,880
4 kilometers long okay
 

3047
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,270
4 kilometers long okay
we start with a laser beam and we divide

3048
00:54:59,270 --> 00:54:59,280
we start with a laser beam and we divide
 

3049
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,470
we start with a laser beam and we divide
the beam

3050
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:00,480
the beam
 

3051
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,789
the beam
going down the two arms

3052
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:02,799
going down the two arms
 

3053
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,710
going down the two arms
and we have a mirror at the other end

3054
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:04,720
and we have a mirror at the other end
 

3055
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,390
and we have a mirror at the other end
reflects it back

3056
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:06,400
reflects it back
 

3057
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,510
reflects it back
it's more subtle but we bring it back

3058
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
it's more subtle but we bring it back
 

3059
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,789
it's more subtle but we bring it back
if there's

3060
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:10,799
if there's
 

3061
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,630
if there's
no distortion in space-time and the

3062
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
no distortion in space-time and the
 

3063
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,309
no distortion in space-time and the
lengths are exactly the same which we

3064
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:14,319
lengths are exactly the same which we
 

3065
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,990
lengths are exactly the same which we
calibrate them to be

3066
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,000
calibrate them to be
 

3067
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,950
calibrate them to be
then when it comes back if we just

3068
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
then when it comes back if we just
 

3069
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,710
then when it comes back if we just
invert one signal compared to the other

3070
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:20,720
invert one signal compared to the other
 

3071
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,150
invert one signal compared to the other
they'll just cancel

3072
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:22,160
they'll just cancel
 

3073
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,910
they'll just cancel
so we see nothing

3074
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:23,920
so we see nothing
 

3075
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,789
so we see nothing
okay

3076
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:24,799
okay
 

3077
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,630
okay
but if one arm got a little bit longer

3078
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
but if one arm got a little bit longer
 

3079
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,069
but if one arm got a little bit longer
than the other

3080
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
than the other
 

3081
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,750
than the other
then they don't come back at exactly the

3082
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:29,760
then they don't come back at exactly the
 

3083
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,750
then they don't come back at exactly the
same time they don't exactly cancel

3084
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:31,760
same time they don't exactly cancel
 

3085
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,829
same time they don't exactly cancel
that's what we

3086
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:32,839
that's what we
 

3087
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:34,549
that's what we
measure

3088
00:55:34,549 --> 00:55:34,559
measure
 

3089
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:35,430
measure
so

3090
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:35,440
so
 

3091
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,270
so
to give a number to it

3092
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
to give a number to it
 

3093
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,789
to give a number to it
we have to do that

3094
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:38,799
we have to do that
 

3095
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:39,910
we have to do that
to

3096
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
to
 

3097
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,870
to
we have

3098
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:40,880
we have
 

3099
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,870
we have
the change of length to be able to do

3100
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:42,880
the change of length to be able to do
 

3101
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,230
the change of length to be able to do
this 10 to the minus 18 meters to one

3102
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:46,240
this 10 to the minus 18 meters to one
 

3103
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,630
this 10 to the minus 18 meters to one
part in 10 to the 12th and that was the

3104
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:48,640
part in 10 to the 12th and that was the
 

3105
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,710
part in 10 to the 12th and that was the
big experimental challenge that

3106
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:52,720

 

3107
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,589

required a lot of innovation to be able

3108
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:55,599
required a lot of innovation to be able
 

3109
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,349
required a lot of innovation to be able
to do

3110
00:55:57,349 --> 00:55:57,359
to do
 

3111
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,430
to do
what you gave a lot of credit to i think

3112
00:55:59,430 --> 00:55:59,440
what you gave a lot of credit to i think
 

3113
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,109
what you gave a lot of credit to i think
caltech and mit for some of the

3114
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:01,119
caltech and mit for some of the
 

3115
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:03,109
caltech and mit for some of the
technical developments like within this

3116
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:03,119
technical developments like within this
 

3117
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,230
technical developments like within this
project

3118
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:04,240
project
 

3119
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,069
project
is there some interesting things you can

3120
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:06,079
is there some interesting things you can
 

3121
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,349
is there some interesting things you can
speak to

3122
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:07,359
speak to
 

3123
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:08,630
speak to
like

3124
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:08,640
like
 

3125
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,109
like
at the low level of some cool stuff that

3126
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:11,119
at the low level of some cool stuff that
 

3127
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,910
at the low level of some cool stuff that
had to be solved like what are we yeah

3128
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:13,920
had to be solved like what are we yeah
 

3129
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,390
had to be solved like what are we yeah
i'm a software engineer so okay all of

3130
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:16,400
i'm a software engineer so okay all of
 

3131
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,150
i'm a software engineer so okay all of
this i have so much more respect for

3132
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
this i have so much more respect for
 

3133
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,750
this i have so much more respect for
everything done here than anything i've

3134
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:19,760
everything done here than anything i've
 

3135
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,549
everything done here than anything i've
ever done so it's just code so

3136
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:22,559
ever done so it's just code so
 

3137
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,710
ever done so it's just code so
so i'll give you

3138
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:24,720
so i'll give you
 

3139
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,710
so i'll give you
an example of doing uh

3140
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:28,720

 

3141
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,789

mechanical engineering

3142
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:30,799
mechanical engineering
 

3143
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,510
mechanical engineering
and a better look at at a basically

3144
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:33,520
and a better look at at a basically
 

3145
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,910
and a better look at at a basically
mechanical engineering and geology and

3146
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:35,920
mechanical engineering and geology and
 

3147
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,190
mechanical engineering and geology and
maybe at a

3148
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,200
maybe at a
 

3149
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,230
maybe at a
level which

3150
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:38,240
level which
 

3151
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,390
level which
okay uh so what do we what's the problem

3152
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:40,400
okay uh so what do we what's the problem
 

3153
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,150
okay uh so what do we what's the problem
the problem is the following that i've

3154
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
the problem is the following that i've
 

3155
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,069
the problem is the following that i've
given you this picture of an instrument

3156
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,079
given you this picture of an instrument
 

3157
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,870
given you this picture of an instrument
that i by some magic i can make good

3158
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:46,880
that i by some magic i can make good
 

3159
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,630
that i by some magic i can make good
enough to measure this very short

3160
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:48,640
enough to measure this very short
 

3161
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,670
enough to measure this very short
distance

3162
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:49,680
distance
 

3163
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,750
distance
but then i put it down here

3164
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:51,760
but then i put it down here
 

3165
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,190
but then i put it down here
it won't work

3166
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:53,200
it won't work
 

3167
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,510
it won't work
and the reason it doesn't work is that

3168
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:55,520
and the reason it doesn't work is that
 

3169
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,750
and the reason it doesn't work is that
the earth itself is moving all over the

3170
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:57,760
the earth itself is moving all over the
 

3171
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,069
the earth itself is moving all over the
place all the time you don't realize it

3172
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:00,079
place all the time you don't realize it
 

3173
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,390
place all the time you don't realize it
it seems pretty good to you i get it but

3174
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,400
it seems pretty good to you i get it but
 

3175
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,349
it seems pretty good to you i get it but
it's moving all the time so somehow

3176
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:05,359
it's moving all the time so somehow
 

3177
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:07,670
it's moving all the time so somehow
it's moving so much that you we can't

3178
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:07,680
it's moving so much that you we can't
 

3179
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,430
it's moving so much that you we can't
deal with it we happen to be trying to

3180
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
deal with it we happen to be trying to
 

3181
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,589
deal with it we happen to be trying to
do the experiment here on earth

3182
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:11,599
do the experiment here on earth
 

3183
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,589
do the experiment here on earth
but we can't deal with it so we have to

3184
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
but we can't deal with it so we have to
 

3185
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,430
but we can't deal with it so we have to
make the instrument

3186
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:15,440
make the instrument
 

3187
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,510
make the instrument
isolated from the earth

3188
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:17,520
isolated from the earth
 

3189
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,710
isolated from the earth
oh no

3190
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
oh no
 

3191
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,390
oh no
at the frequencies we're at we've got to

3192
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400
at the frequencies we're at we've got to
 

3193
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,470
at the frequencies we're at we've got to
float it that's a mechanical that's an

3194
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:22,480
float it that's a mechanical that's an
 

3195
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,309
float it that's a mechanical that's an
engineering problem not a physics

3196
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:24,319
engineering problem not a physics
 

3197
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,630
engineering problem not a physics
problem so when you actually like uh

3198
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:26,640
problem so when you actually like uh
 

3199
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,390
problem so when you actually like uh
we're doing we're having a conversation

3200
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:28,400
we're doing we're having a conversation
 

3201
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,870
we're doing we're having a conversation
on a podcast right now there's uh and

3202
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:30,880
on a podcast right now there's uh and
 

3203
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,710
on a podcast right now there's uh and
people who record music work with this

3204
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:32,720
people who record music work with this
 

3205
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,309
people who record music work with this
you know how to create an isolated room

3206
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:36,319
you know how to create an isolated room
 

3207
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,750
you know how to create an isolated room
and they usually build a room within a

3208
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:37,760
and they usually build a room within a
 

3209
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,030
and they usually build a room within a
room

3210
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:39,040
room
 

3211
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,109
room
but that's still not isolated in fact

3212
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:41,119
but that's still not isolated in fact
 

3213
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,470
but that's still not isolated in fact
they say it's impossible to truly

3214
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:42,480
they say it's impossible to truly
 

3215
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,789
they say it's impossible to truly
isolate from sound from noise and stuff

3216
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:44,799
isolate from sound from noise and stuff
 

3217
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:45,750
isolate from sound from noise and stuff
like that

3218
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:45,760
like that
 

3219
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,510
like that
but that that

3220
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
but that that
 

3221
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,190
but that that
that's like one step

3222
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:49,200
that's like one step
 

3223
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,470
that's like one step
of

3224
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:50,480
of
 

3225
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,710
of
millions that you took

3226
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:52,720
millions that you took
 

3227
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,870
millions that you took
is building a room inside a room because

3228
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:54,880
is building a room inside a room because
 

3229
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,030
is building a room inside a room because
you basically have to isolate all now

3230
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
you basically have to isolate all now
 

3231
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,030
you basically have to isolate all now
this is actually an easier problem you

3232
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,040
this is actually an easier problem you
 

3233
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,589
this is actually an easier problem you
just have to do it really well so the

3234
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:01,599
just have to do it really well so the
 

3235
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,349
just have to do it really well so the
making a clean room is really a tough

3236
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:03,359
making a clean room is really a tough
 

3237
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:04,870
making a clean room is really a tough
problem because you have to put a room

3238
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:04,880
problem because you have to put a room
 

3239
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,870
problem because you have to put a room
inside a room yeah

3240
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:06,880
inside a room yeah
 

3241
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,670
inside a room yeah
so this is this is really simple

3242
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:09,680
so this is this is really simple
 

3243
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:12,309
so this is this is really simple
engineering or physics uh-huh okay so

3244
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:12,319
engineering or physics uh-huh okay so
 

3245
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,670
engineering or physics uh-huh okay so
what do you have to do how do you

3246
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
what do you have to do how do you
 

3247
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,510
what do you have to do how do you
isolate yourself from the from the earth

3248
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:15,520
isolate yourself from the from the earth
 

3249
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,470
isolate yourself from the from the earth
yes

3250
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:16,480
yes
 

3251
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,030
yes
first we work at

3252
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,040
first we work at
 

3253
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,349
first we work at
uh we're not looking at all frequencies

3254
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
uh we're not looking at all frequencies
 

3255
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,109
uh we're not looking at all frequencies
for gravitational waves we're looking at

3256
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:23,119
for gravitational waves we're looking at
 

3257
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,190
for gravitational waves we're looking at
particular frequencies

3258
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:25,200
particular frequencies
 

3259
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,510
particular frequencies
that you can deal with here on earth

3260
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:27,520
that you can deal with here on earth
 

3261
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,069
that you can deal with here on earth
so what frequencies would those be

3262
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:30,079
so what frequencies would those be
 

3263
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,430
so what frequencies would those be
you were just talking about frequencies

3264
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
you were just talking about frequencies
 

3265
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,910
you were just talking about frequencies
i mean we know by evolution our bodies

3266
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:35,920
i mean we know by evolution our bodies
 

3267
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,710
i mean we know by evolution our bodies
know it's the audio band

3268
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:38,720
know it's the audio band
 

3269
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,349
know it's the audio band
okay the reason our ears work where they

3270
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:41,359
okay the reason our ears work where they
 

3271
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,950
okay the reason our ears work where they
work is that's where the earth isn't

3272
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:42,960
work is that's where the earth isn't
 

3273
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,990
work is that's where the earth isn't
going making too much noise okay so the

3274
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
going making too much noise okay so the
 

3275
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,430
going making too much noise okay so the
reason our ears work the way they work

3276
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:47,440
reason our ears work the way they work
 

3277
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,510
reason our ears work the way they work
is because this is where it's quiet

3278
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:49,520
is because this is where it's quiet
 

3279
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,870
is because this is where it's quiet
that's right

3280
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
that's right
 

3281
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,990
that's right
so if you go to if you go to one hertz

3282
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:54,000
so if you go to if you go to one hertz
 

3283
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,910
so if you go to if you go to one hertz
instead of 10 hertz

3284
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:55,920
instead of 10 hertz
 

3285
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,829
instead of 10 hertz
it's the earth is

3286
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:57,839
it's the earth is
 

3287
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,309
it's the earth is
it's really moving around so

3288
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:00,319
it's really moving around so
 

3289
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,950
it's really moving around so
so somehow we live in a what we call the

3290
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:02,960
so somehow we live in a what we call the
 

3291
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,349
so somehow we live in a what we call the
audio band it's tens of hertz to

3292
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:05,359
audio band it's tens of hertz to
 

3293
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,589
audio band it's tens of hertz to
thousands of hertz that's where we

3294
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:07,599
thousands of hertz that's where we
 

3295
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,630
thousands of hertz that's where we
live that's where we live okay

3296
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:10,640
live that's where we live okay
 

3297
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,990
live that's where we live okay
if we're going to do an experiment on

3298
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
if we're going to do an experiment on
 

3299
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,910
if we're going to do an experiment on
the earth i might as well do this it's

3300
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:13,920
the earth i might as well do this it's
 

3301
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,270
the earth i might as well do this it's
the same frequency that's where the

3302
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:15,280
the same frequency that's where the
 

3303
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,190
the same frequency that's where the
earth is the quietest so we have to work

3304
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:17,200
earth is the quietest so we have to work
 

3305
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,710
earth is the quietest so we have to work
in that frequency so we're not looking

3306
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
in that frequency so we're not looking
 

3307
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,190
in that frequency so we're not looking
at all frequencies okay

3308
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:21,200
at all frequencies okay
 

3309
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,549
at all frequencies okay
so the solution for the for the shaking

3310
00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:24,559
so the solution for the for the shaking
 

3311
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:26,950
so the solution for the for the shaking
of the earth to get rid of it

3312
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:26,960
of the earth to get rid of it
 

3313
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,589
of the earth to get rid of it
is pretty mundane if we do the same

3314
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:29,599
is pretty mundane if we do the same
 

3315
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,630
is pretty mundane if we do the same
thing

3316
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:30,640
thing
 

3317
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,910
thing
that you do uh to make your car drive

3318
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:33,920
that you do uh to make your car drive
 

3319
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,309
that you do uh to make your car drive
smoothly down the road so what happens

3320
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:36,319
smoothly down the road so what happens
 

3321
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,710
smoothly down the road so what happens
when your car goes over a bump

3322
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:38,720
when your car goes over a bump
 

3323
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,270
when your car goes over a bump
early cars did that they bounced right

3324
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:41,280
early cars did that they bounced right
 

3325
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,630
early cars did that they bounced right
okay but you don't feel that in your car

3326
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:44,640
okay but you don't feel that in your car
 

3327
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,390
okay but you don't feel that in your car
so what happened to that energy you

3328
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:46,400
so what happened to that energy you
 

3329
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,789
so what happened to that energy you
can't just disappear energy so we have

3330
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:48,799
can't just disappear energy so we have
 

3331
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,470
can't just disappear energy so we have
these things called shock absorbers in

3332
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,480
these things called shock absorbers in
 

3333
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,510
these things called shock absorbers in
the car

3334
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:51,520
the car
 

3335
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,710
the car
what they do

3336
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:52,720
what they do
 

3337
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,349
what they do
is they absorb they take the the thing

3338
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:55,359
is they absorb they take the the thing
 

3339
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,510
is they absorb they take the the thing
that went like that and they basically

3340
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:57,520
that went like that and they basically
 

3341
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,950
that went like that and they basically
can't get rid of the energy but they

3342
00:59:58,950 --> 00:59:58,960
can't get rid of the energy but they
 

3343
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,910
can't get rid of the energy but they
move it to very very low frequency

3344
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:01,920
move it to very very low frequency
 

3345
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,470
move it to very very low frequency
so what you feel isn't

3346
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:04,480
so what you feel isn't
 

3347
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,549
so what you feel isn't
you feel like go shh

3348
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
you feel like go shh
 

3349
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,390
you feel like go shh
smoothly okay

3350
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
smoothly okay
 

3351
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,829
smoothly okay
all right so uh

3352
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:11,839
all right so uh
 

3353
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:14,309
all right so uh
we also work at this frequency so if we

3354
01:00:14,309 --> 01:00:14,319
we also work at this frequency so if we
 

3355
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,630
we also work at this frequency so if we
so we basically why

3356
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:16,640
so we basically why
 

3357
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,309
so we basically why
why do we have to do anything other than

3358
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:18,319
why do we have to do anything other than
 

3359
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,309
why do we have to do anything other than
shock absorbers so we made

3360
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:20,319
shock absorbers so we made
 

3361
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,270
shock absorbers so we made
the world's fanciest shock absorbers

3362
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:23,280
the world's fanciest shock absorbers
 

3363
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,190
the world's fanciest shock absorbers
okay

3364
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:25,200
okay
 

3365
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,190
okay
not just like in your car where there's

3366
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:27,200
not just like in your car where there's
 

3367
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,109
not just like in your car where there's
one layer of them they're just the right

3368
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:29,119
one layer of them they're just the right
 

3369
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:30,710
one layer of them they're just the right
squishiness and so forth they're better

3370
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:30,720
squishiness and so forth they're better
 

3371
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,390
squishiness and so forth they're better
than what's in the cars

3372
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:32,400
than what's in the cars
 

3373
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,069
than what's in the cars
and we have four layers of it so

3374
01:00:34,069 --> 01:00:34,079
and we have four layers of it so
 

3375
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,910
and we have four layers of it so
whatever shakes and gets through the

3376
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:35,920
whatever shakes and gets through the
 

3377
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,910
whatever shakes and gets through the
first layer we treat it in a second

3378
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:37,920
first layer we treat it in a second
 

3379
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,710
first layer we treat it in a second
third

3380
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:38,720
third
 

3381
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,870
third
level so it's a mechanical engineering

3382
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:40,880
level so it's a mechanical engineering
 

3383
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,950
level so it's a mechanical engineering
problem yeah that's what i said so

3384
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:42,960
problem yeah that's what i said so
 

3385
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,190
problem yeah that's what i said so
it's not there's no weird tricks to it

3386
01:00:45,190 --> 01:00:45,200
it's not there's no weird tricks to it
 

3387
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,430
it's not there's no weird tricks to it
like uh like a chemistry type thing or

3388
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
like uh like a chemistry type thing or
 

3389
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,750
like uh like a chemistry type thing or
no no just well the right squishiness

3390
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:49,760
no no just well the right squishiness
 

3391
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,069
no no just well the right squishiness
right need the right material inside and

3392
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:52,079
right need the right material inside and
 

3393
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,390
right need the right material inside and
ours look like little springs but

3394
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
ours look like little springs but
 

3395
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,349
ours look like little springs but
they're

3396
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:55,359
they're
 

3397
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,510
they're
springs they're springs so like

3398
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:57,520
springs they're springs so like
 

3399
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,430
springs they're springs so like
legitimately like shock absorbers yeah

3400
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
legitimately like shock absorbers yeah
 

3401
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,470
legitimately like shock absorbers yeah
what

3402
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:02,480
what
 

3403
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,910
what
okay okay

3404
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:03,920
okay okay
 

3405
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,390
okay okay
and this is now experimental physics at

3406
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:06,400
and this is now experimental physics at
 

3407
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,710
and this is now experimental physics at
the at its limit okay so you do this and

3408
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:08,720
the at its limit okay so you do this and
 

3409
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,549
the at its limit okay so you do this and
we make the world's fanciest shock

3410
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:10,559
we make the world's fanciest shock
 

3411
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,270
we make the world's fanciest shock
absorbers just mechanical engineering

3412
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:13,280
absorbers just mechanical engineering
 

3413
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,910
absorbers just mechanical engineering
just mechanical genius is hilarious but

3414
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:15,920
just mechanical genius is hilarious but
 

3415
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,230
just mechanical genius is hilarious but
we didn't yes we weren't good enough to

3416
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
we didn't yes we weren't good enough to
 

3417
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,069
we didn't yes we weren't good enough to
discover gravitational waves

3418
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079

 

3419
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:22,789

so

3420
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
so
 

3421
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,349
so
uh so we did another we added another

3422
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
uh so we did another we added another
 

3423
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,109
uh so we did another we added another
feature and it's something else that

3424
01:01:27,109 --> 01:01:27,119
feature and it's something else that
 

3425
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,750
feature and it's something else that
you're uh

3426
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
you're uh
 

3427
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,390
you're uh
aware of probably have one

3428
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:32,400
aware of probably have one
 

3429
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,870
aware of probably have one
and that is to get rid of noise you've

3430
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:34,880
and that is to get rid of noise you've
 

3431
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,309
and that is to get rid of noise you've
probably noise which is you don't like

3432
01:01:38,309 --> 01:01:38,319
probably noise which is you don't like
 

3433
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,150
probably noise which is you don't like
and that's the same principle that's in

3434
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:40,160
and that's the same principle that's in
 

3435
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,309
and that's the same principle that's in
these little bose uh

3436
01:01:42,309 --> 01:01:42,319
these little bose uh
 

3437
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,309
these little bose uh
uh earphones noise canceling

3438
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:44,319
uh earphones noise canceling
 

3439
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,230
uh earphones noise canceling
noise cancelling so

3440
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:46,240
noise cancelling so
 

3441
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,789
noise cancelling so
uh so how do they work they basically

3442
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:48,799
uh so how do they work they basically
 

3443
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,589
uh so how do they work they basically
you go on an airplane and they uh sense

3444
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:51,599
you go on an airplane and they uh sense
 

3445
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,150
you go on an airplane and they uh sense
the ambient noise from the engines

3446
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
the ambient noise from the engines
 

3447
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,470
the ambient noise from the engines
and cancel it because it's just the same

3448
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:56,480
and cancel it because it's just the same
 

3449
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,109
and cancel it because it's just the same
over and over again they cancel it and

3450
01:01:59,109 --> 01:01:59,119
over and over again they cancel it and
 

3451
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,710
over and over again they cancel it and
when the stewardess comes and asks you

3452
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:00,720
when the stewardess comes and asks you
 

3453
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,789
when the stewardess comes and asks you
whether you want coffee or a tea or a

3454
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:02,799
whether you want coffee or a tea or a
 

3455
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,309
whether you want coffee or a tea or a
drink or something you hear her fine

3456
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:04,319
drink or something you hear her fine
 

3457
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,109
drink or something you hear her fine
because she's not ambient she's a signal

3458
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:07,119
because she's not ambient she's a signal
 

3459
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,349
because she's not ambient she's a signal
so are we talking about active canceling

3460
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,359
so are we talking about active canceling
 

3461
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,829
so are we talking about active canceling
like where the action is canceling

3462
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:11,839
like where the action is canceling
 

3463
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,549
like where the action is canceling
so this is you okay so another don't

3464
01:02:14,549 --> 01:02:14,559
so this is you okay so another don't
 

3465
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,270
so this is you okay so another don't
tell me you have active canceling uh on

3466
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:17,280
tell me you have active canceling uh on
 

3467
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,990
tell me you have active canceling uh on
this yeah besides the show absolutely

3468
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
this yeah besides the show absolutely
 

3469
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,589
this yeah besides the show absolutely
so inside this

3470
01:02:21,589 --> 01:02:21,599
so inside this
 

3471
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,549
so inside this
array of shock absorbers yeah we you

3472
01:02:24,549 --> 01:02:24,559
array of shock absorbers yeah we you
 

3473
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,549
array of shock absorbers yeah we you
asked for some interesting this is

3474
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:26,559
asked for some interesting this is
 

3475
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,829
asked for some interesting this is
awesome

3476
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:27,839
awesome
 

3477
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,789
awesome
so inside this it's harder than the

3478
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:30,799
so inside this it's harder than the
 

3479
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,470
so inside this it's harder than the
earphone problem but it's just

3480
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:32,480
earphone problem but it's just
 

3481
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,349
earphone problem but it's just
engineering we have to see measure not

3482
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:35,359
engineering we have to see measure not
 

3483
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:37,349
engineering we have to see measure not
just that the

3484
01:02:37,349 --> 01:02:37,359
just that the
 

3485
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,990
just that the
engine still made noise

3486
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:40,000
engine still made noise
 

3487
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,829
engine still made noise
but the earth is shaking it's moving in

3488
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
but the earth is shaking it's moving in
 

3489
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,190
but the earth is shaking it's moving in
some direction

3490
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
some direction
 

3491
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,829
some direction
so we have to actually tell not only

3492
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:45,839
so we have to actually tell not only
 

3493
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,430
so we have to actually tell not only
that there's noise and cancel it but

3494
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
that there's noise and cancel it but
 

3495
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,750
that there's noise and cancel it but
what direction it's from so we put this

3496
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:49,760
what direction it's from so we put this
 

3497
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,190
what direction it's from so we put this
array of seismometers inside

3498
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:53,200
array of seismometers inside
 

3499
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,829
array of seismometers inside
this array of shock absorbers and

3500
01:02:55,829 --> 01:02:55,839
this array of shock absorbers and
 

3501
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,109
this array of shock absorbers and
measure the

3502
01:02:57,109 --> 01:02:57,119
measure the
 

3503
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,470
measure the
residual

3504
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:58,480
residual
 

3505
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,510
residual
motion

3506
01:02:59,510 --> 01:02:59,520
motion
 

3507
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,829
motion
and its

3508
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:00,839
and its
 

3509
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:04,230
and its
direction and we put little actuators

3510
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:04,240
direction and we put little actuators
 

3511
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,230
direction and we put little actuators
that push back against it and cancel it

3512
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:08,240
that push back against it and cancel it
 

3513
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:10,069
that push back against it and cancel it
this is awesome

3514
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:10,079
this is awesome
 

3515
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,750
this is awesome
so you have the actuators and you have

3516
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:11,760
so you have the actuators and you have
 

3517
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,190
so you have the actuators and you have
the thing that is sensing the the

3518
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,200
the thing that is sensing the the
 

3519
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,950
the thing that is sensing the the
vibrations and then you have the actual

3520
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
vibrations and then you have the actual
 

3521
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,109
vibrations and then you have the actual
actuators that adjust for that and do so

3522
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:17,119
actuators that adjust for that and do so
 

3523
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,349
actuators that adjust for that and do so
in perfect synchrony yeah

3524
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:19,359
in perfect synchrony yeah
 

3525
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,670
in perfect synchrony yeah
what if it all works right and so how

3526
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:21,680
what if it all works right and so how
 

3527
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,510
what if it all works right and so how
much do we reduce the shaking of the

3528
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:23,520
much do we reduce the shaking of the
 

3529
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,109
much do we reduce the shaking of the
earth

3530
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:25,119
earth
 

3531
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:26,549
earth
i mean

3532
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:26,559
i mean
 

3533
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,829
i mean
one part in 10 to the 12th

3534
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:29,839
one part in 10 to the 12th
 

3535
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:30,789
one part in 10 to the 12th
part

3536
01:03:30,789 --> 01:03:30,799
part
 

3537
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:32,789
part
inside what gets through us is one part

3538
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:32,799
inside what gets through us is one part
 

3539
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:36,710
inside what gets through us is one part
and 10 to the 12th

3540
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:36,720

 

3541
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,029

that's pretty big reduction you don't

3542
01:03:39,029 --> 01:03:39,039
that's pretty big reduction you don't
 

3543
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,789
that's pretty big reduction you don't
need that in your car but that's what we

3544
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:40,799
need that in your car but that's what we
 

3545
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,470
need that in your car but that's what we
do and so that's how isolated we are

3546
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:42,480
do and so that's how isolated we are
 

3547
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,470
do and so that's how isolated we are
from the earth and that was the biggest

3548
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:44,480
from the earth and that was the biggest
 

3549
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,670
from the earth and that was the biggest
uh

3550
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:45,680
uh
 

3551
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,069
uh
i'd say technical problem outside of the

3552
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:48,079
i'd say technical problem outside of the
 

3553
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,150
i'd say technical problem outside of the
physics instrument the interferometer

3554
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,160
physics instrument the interferometer
 

3555
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,870
physics instrument the interferometer
can ask you a a weird question here you

3556
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:52,880
can ask you a a weird question here you
 

3557
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,710
can ask you a a weird question here you
you make it very poetically and

3558
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:54,720
you make it very poetically and
 

3559
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,630
you make it very poetically and
humorously it's saying it's just a

3560
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
humorously it's saying it's just a
 

3561
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,789
humorously it's saying it's just a
mechanical engineering problem

3562
01:03:58,789 --> 01:03:58,799
mechanical engineering problem
 

3563
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,349
mechanical engineering problem
but is this one of the

3564
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:01,359
but is this one of the
 

3565
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:03,109
but is this one of the
biggest

3566
01:04:03,109 --> 01:04:03,119
biggest
 

3567
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,710
biggest
precision

3568
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:04,720
precision
 

3569
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,430
precision
mechanical engineering efforts ever

3570
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:07,440
mechanical engineering efforts ever
 

3571
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,270
mechanical engineering efforts ever
i mean this seems exceptionally

3572
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:09,280
i mean this seems exceptionally
 

3573
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,589
i mean this seems exceptionally
difficult it is and so it took a long

3574
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:11,599
difficult it is and so it took a long
 

3575
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,470
difficult it is and so it took a long
time and uh i think

3576
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:14,480
time and uh i think
 

3577
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,789
time and uh i think
nobody seems to challenge the statement

3578
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:16,799
nobody seems to challenge the statement
 

3579
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:19,029
nobody seems to challenge the statement
that this is the most precision precise

3580
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:19,039
that this is the most precision precise
 

3581
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,309
that this is the most precision precise
instrument that's ever been built ligo

3582
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:22,319
instrument that's ever been built ligo
 

3583
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,069
instrument that's ever been built ligo
i just i wonder what like listening to

3584
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:24,079
i just i wonder what like listening to
 

3585
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,670
i just i wonder what like listening to
led zeppelin sounds on this thing

3586
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:25,680
led zeppelin sounds on this thing
 

3587
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,910
led zeppelin sounds on this thing
because it's so isolated i mean this is

3588
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:27,920
because it's so isolated i mean this is
 

3589
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,510
because it's so isolated i mean this is
like uh

3590
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
like uh
 

3591
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,589
like uh
i don't know no background noise nope no

3592
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:31,599
i don't know no background noise nope no
 

3593
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,910
i don't know no background noise nope no
back it's wow

3594
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:33,920
back it's wow
 

3595
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,349
back it's wow
wow

3596
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:35,359
wow
 

3597
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:38,950
wow
wow that so when you were first

3598
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:38,960
wow that so when you were first
 

3599
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,270
wow that so when you were first
conceiving this um

3600
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:41,280
conceiving this um
 

3601
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,190
conceiving this um
i would probably uh if i was

3602
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:43,200
i would probably uh if i was
 

3603
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,510
i would probably uh if i was
knowledgeable enough kind of uh laugh

3604
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:45,520
knowledgeable enough kind of uh laugh
 

3605
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,190
knowledgeable enough kind of uh laugh
off the possibility this is even

3606
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:47,200
off the possibility this is even
 

3607
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,829
off the possibility this is even
possible i'm sure

3608
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:49,839
possible i'm sure
 

3609
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,510
possible i'm sure
like how many people

3610
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:51,520
like how many people
 

3611
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,349
like how many people
believe that this is possible did you

3612
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:53,359
believe that this is possible did you
 

3613
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:57,029
believe that this is possible did you
believe oh oh uh i did

3614
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:57,039
believe oh oh uh i did
 

3615
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,710
believe oh oh uh i did
i didn't know that we needed for sure

3616
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:58,720
i didn't know that we needed for sure
 

3617
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,390
i didn't know that we needed for sure
that we needed active when we started we

3618
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:00,400
that we needed active when we started we
 

3619
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,069
that we needed active when we started we
did just passive but we were doing the

3620
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:04,079
did just passive but we were doing the
 

3621
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,870
did just passive but we were doing the
tests to develop the active

3622
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:06,880
tests to develop the active
 

3623
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,950
tests to develop the active
to add as a second stage which we ended

you know now now there was a lot of
 

3631
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:17,029
you know now now there was a lot of
skepticism a lot of us especially

skepticism a lot of us especially

astronomers
 

3635
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,630
astronomers
felt that money was being wasted because

3636
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:20,640
felt that money was being wasted because
 

3637
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,470
felt that money was being wasted because
we were all so expensive

3638
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:22,480
we were all so expensive
 

3639
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,109
we were all so expensive
doing what i told you is not cheap so it

3640
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:25,119
doing what i told you is not cheap so it
 

3641
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:25,910
doing what i told you is not cheap so it
was

3642
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920
was
 

3643
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,430
was
kind of controversial i was funded by

3644
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440
kind of controversial i was funded by
 

3645
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,029
kind of controversial i was funded by
the national science foundation

3646
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:31,039

 

3647
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,630

can you just linger on this just for a

3648
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
can you just linger on this just for a
 

3649
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,630
can you just linger on this just for a
little longer with the actuator thing

3650
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:34,640
little longer with the actuator thing
 

3651
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,349
little longer with the actuator thing
the act of canceling it um

3652
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:39,359

 

3653
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:40,710

do you remember

3654
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:40,720
do you remember
 

3655
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,470
do you remember
like little experiments that were done

3656
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
like little experiments that were done
 

3657
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,190
like little experiments that were done
along the way to prove to the team to

3658
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:45,200
along the way to prove to the team to
 

3659
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,670
along the way to prove to the team to
themselves that this is even possible

3660
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:47,680
themselves that this is even possible
 

3661
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,109
themselves that this is even possible
so from our

3662
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:49,119
so from our
 

3663
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,309
so from our
because i work with quite a bit of

3664
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:50,319
because i work with quite a bit of
 

3665
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:51,430
because i work with quite a bit of
robots

3666
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,440
robots
 

3667
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,109
robots
and to me the idea that you could do it

3668
01:05:53,109 --> 01:05:53,119
and to me the idea that you could do it
 

3669
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,190
and to me the idea that you could do it
this precisely

3670
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:55,200
this precisely
 

3671
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,950
this precisely
is uh humbling and embarrassing frankly

3672
01:05:58,950 --> 01:05:58,960
is uh humbling and embarrassing frankly
 

3673
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,589
is uh humbling and embarrassing frankly
because like this is another level of

3674
01:06:01,589 --> 01:06:01,599
because like this is another level of
 

3675
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,470
because like this is another level of
precision that i can't even

3676
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:04,480
precision that i can't even
 

3677
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,430
precision that i can't even
um because robots are a mess

3678
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:07,440
um because robots are a mess
 

3679
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,430
um because robots are a mess
and this is basically

3680
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
and this is basically
 

3681
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,549
and this is basically
one of the most

3682
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:10,559
one of the most
 

3683
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,829
one of the most
precise robots ever

3684
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:13,839
precise robots ever
 

3685
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:16,230
precise robots ever
right so like uh can you is there uh

3686
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:16,240
right so like uh can you is there uh
 

3687
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,910
right so like uh can you is there uh
yeah do you have any like small scale

3688
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:17,920
yeah do you have any like small scale
 

3689
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,270
yeah do you have any like small scale
experiments that were done that's just

3690
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:19,280
experiments that were done that's just
 

3691
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,309
experiments that were done that's just
believe this is possible yeah and larger

3692
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:22,319
believe this is possible yeah and larger
 

3693
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:26,230
believe this is possible yeah and larger
scale we made we made uh test uh

3694
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:26,240
scale we made we made uh test uh
 

3695
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,150
scale we made we made uh test uh
chan that also has to be in vacuum too

3696
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:28,160
chan that also has to be in vacuum too
 

3697
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,309
chan that also has to be in vacuum too
but we made test chambers that had this

3698
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:30,319
but we made test chambers that had this
 

3699
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,349
but we made test chambers that had this
system

3700
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:31,359
system
 

3701
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,910
system
in it our first mock of the system so we

3702
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:33,920
in it our first mock of the system so we
 

3703
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,230
in it our first mock of the system so we
could test it

3704
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:36,240
could test it
 

3705
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,829
could test it
and

3706
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:37,839
and
 

3707
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:40,309
and
optimize it and make it work but it's

3708
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:40,319
optimize it and make it work but it's
 

3709
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:42,069
optimize it and make it work but it's
just a mechanical engineering problem

3710
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,079
just a mechanical engineering problem
 

3711
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:42,570
just a mechanical engineering problem
okay

3712
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:42,580
okay
 

3713
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:45,029
okay
[Laughter]

3714
01:06:45,029 --> 01:06:45,039
[Laughter]
 

3715
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,990
[Laughter]
humans are just ape descendants i gotcha

3716
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,000
humans are just ape descendants i gotcha
 

3717
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,510
humans are just ape descendants i gotcha
i gotcha uh is there any video of this

3718
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:51,520
i gotcha uh is there any video of this
 

3719
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,710
i gotcha uh is there any video of this
like um

3720
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:52,720
like um
 

3721
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,190
like um
some kind of educational purpose

3722
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:55,200
some kind of educational purpose
 

3723
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,789
some kind of educational purpose
visualizations of this act of canceling

3724
01:06:58,789 --> 01:06:58,799
visualizations of this act of canceling
 

3725
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:02,069
visualizations of this act of canceling
uh i don't think so

3726
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:02,079

 

3727
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:04,870

i mean is this does this live on

3728
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:04,880
i mean is this does this live on
 

3729
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,270
i mean is this does this live on
well we work for parts of it for the

3730
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:07,280
well we work for parts of it for the
 

3731
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:10,069
well we work for parts of it for the
active canceling we worked with for the

3732
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:10,079
active canceling we worked with for the
 

3733
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,230
active canceling we worked with for the
instruments for the sensor and

3734
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:12,240
instruments for the sensor and
 

3735
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,109
instruments for the sensor and
instruments we worked with uh

3736
01:07:15,109 --> 01:07:15,119
instruments we worked with uh
 

3737
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,109
instruments we worked with uh
a small company and met near where you

3738
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:17,119
a small company and met near where you
 

3739
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,589
a small company and met near where you
are because it was our mit people that

3740
01:07:19,589 --> 01:07:19,599
are because it was our mit people that
 

3741
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:22,069
are because it was our mit people that
got them that were you know interested

3742
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
got them that were you know interested
 

3743
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,670
got them that were you know interested
in the problem because they thought they

3744
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:23,680
in the problem because they thought they
 

3745
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,150
in the problem because they thought they
might be able to commercialize it for

3746
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:26,160
might be able to commercialize it for
 

3747
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,190
might be able to commercialize it for
making stable tables to make

3748
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:28,200
making stable tables to make
 

3749
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,470
making stable tables to make
microelectronics for example which are

3750
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
microelectronics for example which are
 

3751
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,029
microelectronics for example which are
limited by the how stable the table is

3752
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:33,039
limited by the how stable the table is
 

3753
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,109
limited by the how stable the table is
i mean at this point it's a little

3754
01:07:35,109 --> 01:07:35,119
i mean at this point it's a little
 

3755
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,870
i mean at this point it's a little
expensive

3756
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:36,880
expensive
 

3757
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,470
expensive
so you never know you never know where

3758
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:38,480
so you never know you never know where
 

3759
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,589
so you never know you never know where
this leads

3760
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:39,599
this leads
 

3761
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:40,789
this leads
okay so

3762
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:40,799
okay so
 

3763
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,549
okay so
maybe on the

3764
01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:44,559

 

3765
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,069

let me ask you just

3766
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
let me ask you just
 

3767
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,150
let me ask you just
sticking it a little longer this silly

3768
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:48,160
sticking it a little longer this silly
 

3769
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,029
sticking it a little longer this silly
old mechanical engineering problem uh

3770
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:51,039
old mechanical engineering problem uh
 

3771
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,309
old mechanical engineering problem uh
what was uh

3772
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:52,319
what was uh
 

3773
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:55,510
what was uh
to you kind of the darkest moment

3774
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:55,520
to you kind of the darkest moment
 

3775
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,829
to you kind of the darkest moment
of what was the hardest

3776
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:57,839
of what was the hardest
 

3777
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,069
of what was the hardest
stumbling block to get over on the

3778
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:00,079
stumbling block to get over on the
 

3779
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,910
stumbling block to get over on the
engineer side like was there any time

3780
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
engineer side like was there any time
 

3781
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,349
engineer side like was there any time
where there's a doubt where it's like

3782
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:03,359
where there's a doubt where it's like
 

3783
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,589
where there's a doubt where it's like
i'm not sure we'll be able to do this

3784
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,599
i'm not sure we'll be able to do this
 

3785
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:08,230
i'm not sure we'll be able to do this
a kind of uh engineering challenge that

3786
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,240
a kind of uh engineering challenge that
 

3787
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,990
a kind of uh engineering challenge that
was hit do you remember anything like

3788
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:10,000
was hit do you remember anything like
 

3789
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,390
was hit do you remember anything like
that i think the one that that

3790
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,400

 

3791
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,269

my colleague at mit ray weiss worked on

3792
01:08:17,269 --> 01:08:17,279
my colleague at mit ray weiss worked on
 

3793
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,430
my colleague at mit ray weiss worked on
so hard and uh

3794
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:19,440
so hard and uh
 

3795
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,390
so hard and uh
was

3796
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:20,400
was
 

3797
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,070
was
much more of a worry than this this is

3798
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,080
much more of a worry than this this is
 

3799
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,789
much more of a worry than this this is
only a question if you're not do it well

3800
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:24,799
only a question if you're not do it well
 

3801
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:27,030
only a question if you're not do it well
enough you have to keep making it better

3802
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,040
enough you have to keep making it better
 

3803
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:27,990
enough you have to keep making it better
somehow

3804
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:28,000
somehow
 

3805
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:28,870
somehow
but

3806
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:28,880
but
 

3807
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,910
but
this whole

3808
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:29,920
this whole
 

3809
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,030
this whole
huge instrument has to be in vacuum

3810
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:33,040
huge instrument has to be in vacuum
 

3811
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,390
huge instrument has to be in vacuum
and

3812
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,400
and
 

3813
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,950
and
the vacuum tanks are you know this big

3814
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:36,960
the vacuum tanks are you know this big
 

3815
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,430
the vacuum tanks are you know this big
around and uh so it's the world's

3816
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:39,440
around and uh so it's the world's
 

3817
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:42,870
around and uh so it's the world's
biggest high vacuum system and the cons

3818
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:42,880
biggest high vacuum system and the cons
 

3819
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,510
biggest high vacuum system and the cons
so how do you make it first of all

3820
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:45,520
so how do you make it first of all
 

3821
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,630
so how do you make it first of all
uh how do you make this four meter long

3822
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
uh how do you make this four meter long
 

3823
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,709
uh how do you make this four meter long
sealed vacuum system it has to be made

3824
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:50,719
sealed vacuum system it has to be made
 

3825
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,630
sealed vacuum system it has to be made
out of four kilometers four kilometers

3826
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:52,640
out of four kilometers four kilometers
 

3827
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,709
out of four kilometers four kilometers
long would i say something else meters

3828
01:08:54,709 --> 01:08:54,719
long would i say something else meters
 

3829
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,229
long would i say something else meters
four or four kilometers long big

3830
01:08:56,229 --> 01:08:56,239
four or four kilometers long big
 

3831
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:59,669
four or four kilometers long big
difference yeah and uh so but to make it

3832
01:08:59,669 --> 01:08:59,679
difference yeah and uh so but to make it
 

3833
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,829
difference yeah and uh so but to make it
yeah we started with uh

3834
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
yeah we started with uh
 

3835
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:06,070
yeah we started with uh
uh a roll of stainless steel and then we

3836
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:06,080
uh a roll of stainless steel and then we
 

3837
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,189
uh a roll of stainless steel and then we
spi roll it out like a spiral so there's

3838
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
spi roll it out like a spiral so there's
 

3839
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,269
spi roll it out like a spiral so there's
a spiral weld on it

3840
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:11,279
a spiral weld on it
 

3841
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,709
a spiral weld on it
okay so

3842
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:12,719
okay so
 

3843
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,709
okay so
the engineering was fine we did that we

3844
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:14,719
the engineering was fine we did that we
 

3845
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:15,910
the engineering was fine we did that we
worked through

3846
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
worked through
 

3847
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,749
worked through
very good companies and so forth to

3848
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
very good companies and so forth to
 

3849
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,590
very good companies and so forth to
build it

3850
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:19,600
build it
 

3851
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,149
build it
uh the big worry

3852
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:22,159
uh the big worry
 

3853
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,189
uh the big worry
it was

3854
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:23,199
it was
 

3855
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:26,309
it was
what if you develop a leak

3856
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319
what if you develop a leak
 

3857
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,550
what if you develop a leak
this is a high vacuum not just vacuum

3858
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:28,560
this is a high vacuum not just vacuum
 

3859
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,749
this is a high vacuum not just vacuum
system

3860
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:29,759
system
 

3861
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,669
system
typically in your in a laboratory if

3862
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:31,679
typically in your in a laboratory if
 

3863
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,269
typically in your in a laboratory if
there's a leak you put

3864
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:33,279
there's a leak you put
 

3865
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,110
there's a leak you put
helium around

3866
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:35,120
helium around
 

3867
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,630
helium around
the

3868
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:36,640
the
 

3869
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,030
the
the thing you have and then you detect

3870
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
the thing you have and then you detect
 

3871
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,189
the thing you have and then you detect
where the helium is coming in but if you

3872
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:41,199
where the helium is coming in but if you
 

3873
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:43,189
where the helium is coming in but if you
have something as big as this you can't

3874
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:43,199
have something as big as this you can't
 

3875
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:45,030
have something as big as this you can't
surround it with helium so you might not

3876
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:45,040
surround it with helium so you might not
 

3877
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,709
surround it with helium so you might not
actually even know that there's a leak

3878
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:46,719
actually even know that there's a leak
 

3879
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,510
actually even know that there's a leak
and it will be affecting well we we have

3880
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:49,520
and it will be affecting well we we have
 

3881
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,789
and it will be affecting well we we have
we can measure

3882
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:50,799
we can measure
 

3883
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,149
we can measure
the

3884
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:52,159
the
 

3885
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:54,070
the
how good the vacuum is so we can know

3886
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
how good the vacuum is so we can know
 

3887
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,030
how good the vacuum is so we can know
that but there a leak can develop and

3888
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:57,040
that but there a leak can develop and
 

3889
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,030
that but there a leak can develop and
and then we don't how do we fix it or

3890
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
and then we don't how do we fix it or
 

3891
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:00,709
and then we don't how do we fix it or
how do we find it

3892
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:00,719
how do we find it
 

3893
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,189
how do we find it
and uh so that was you asked about a

3894
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
and uh so that was you asked about a
 

3895
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,750
and uh so that was you asked about a
worry that was always a really big worry

3896
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
worry that was always a really big worry
 

3897
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,510
worry that was always a really big worry
uh what's the difference between a high

3898
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:07,520
uh what's the difference between a high
 

3899
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,470
uh what's the difference between a high
vacuum and uh and a vacuum what what is

3900
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:10,480
vacuum and uh and a vacuum what what is
 

3901
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,709
vacuum and uh and a vacuum what what is
high vacuum that's like some

3902
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:12,719
high vacuum that's like some
 

3903
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:15,830
high vacuum that's like some
a delta close to vacuum is there some

3904
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:15,840
a delta close to vacuum is there some
 

3905
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,550
a delta close to vacuum is there some
threshold well there's a unit

3906
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
threshold well there's a unit
 

3907
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,790
threshold well there's a unit
high vacuum is uh

3908
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:20,800
high vacuum is uh
 

3909
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,630
high vacuum is uh
when the vacuum and the units that are

3910
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:22,640
when the vacuum and the units that are
 

3911
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,470
when the vacuum and the units that are
used which are tors there's 10 to the

3912
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
used which are tors there's 10 to the
 

3913
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,110
used which are tors there's 10 to the
minus 9.

01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
minus 9.
 

3915
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,310
minus 9.
there's high vacuum is usually used in

3916
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:30,320
there's high vacuum is usually used in
 

3917
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,149
there's high vacuum is usually used in
small places the biggest vacuum system

3918
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:34,159
small places the biggest vacuum system
 

3919
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:37,510
small places the biggest vacuum system
period is that cern in this big particle

accelerator but the high vacuum where

3922
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:39,440
accelerator but the high vacuum where
 

3923
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,870
accelerator but the high vacuum where
they need really good vacuum so

3924
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:40,880
they need really good vacuum so
 

3925
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,870
they need really good vacuum so
particles don't scatter and it is

3926
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:42,880
particles don't scatter and it is
 

3927
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,590
particles don't scatter and it is
smaller than r so ours is a really large

3928
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:45,600
smaller than r so ours is a really large

uh high vacuum system i don't know this

3932
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
uh high vacuum system i don't know this
 

3933
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,149
uh high vacuum system i don't know this
is so cool i mean this is basically

3934
01:10:52,149 --> 01:10:52,159
is so cool i mean this is basically
 

3935
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,270
is so cool i mean this is basically

i mean is there any more i'm a huge uh

3948
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:07,520
i mean is there any more i'm a huge uh
 

3949
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,510
i mean is there any more i'm a huge uh
theory it's like yeah yeah but like

3950
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:09,520
theory it's like yeah yeah but like
 

3951
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,750
theory it's like yeah yeah but like

by human beings it's physics
 

3959
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,550
by human beings it's physics
you're using physics to construct

3960
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:18,560
you're using physics to construct
 

3961
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,790
you're using physics to construct
objects that can support huge amount of

mass
 

3965
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,510
mass
and it's like structural but it's also

3966
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:23,520
and it's like structural but it's also
 

3967
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,709
and it's like structural but it's also
beautiful and that humans can

3968
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:24,719
beautiful and that humans can
 

3969
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,709
beautiful and that humans can
collaborate to create that throughout

3970
01:11:26,709 --> 01:11:26,719
collaborate to create that throughout
 

3971
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,630
collaborate to create that throughout
history and then you take this on

3972
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:28,640
history and then you take this on
 

3973
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,470
history and then you take this on
another level

3974
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:30,480
another level
 

3975
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,030
another level
this is this is like

3976
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,040
this is this is like
 

3977
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,229
this is this is like
this is like

3978
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:34,239
this is like
 

3979
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,470
this is like
exciting to me beyond measure that

3980
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:36,480
exciting to me beyond measure that
 

3981
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,669
exciting to me beyond measure that
humans can create something so precise

3982
01:11:39,669 --> 01:11:39,679
humans can create something so precise
 

3983
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:42,070
humans can create something so precise
but but another concept lost in this you

3984
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:42,080
but but another concept lost in this you
 

3985
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,830
but but another concept lost in this you
just said you started talking about

3986
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:43,840
just said you started talking about
 

3987
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,149
just said you started talking about
single cell yeah okay

3988
01:11:46,149 --> 01:11:46,159
single cell yeah okay
 

3989
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:47,830
single cell yeah okay
you have to realize this discovery that

3990
01:11:47,830 --> 01:11:47,840
you have to realize this discovery that
 

3991
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,070
you have to realize this discovery that
we made that everybody spot off on

3992
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:50,080
we made that everybody spot off on
 

3993
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,350
we made that everybody spot off on
happened

3994
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:51,360
happened
 

3995
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,470
happened
1.3 billion years ago

3996
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:54,480
1.3 billion years ago
 

3997
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,709
1.3 billion years ago
somewhere and then the signal came to us

3998
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
somewhere and then the signal came to us
 

3999
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,709
somewhere and then the signal came to us
1.3 billion years ago we were just

4000
01:11:58,709 --> 01:11:58,719
1.3 billion years ago we were just
 

4001
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,590
1.3 billion years ago we were just
converting on the earth from single cell

4002
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:01,600
converting on the earth from single cell
 

4003
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,430
converting on the earth from single cell
to multi-cell life

4004
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:03,440
to multi-cell life
 

4005
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,669
to multi-cell life
so when this actually happened this

4006
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:05,679
so when this actually happened this
 

4007
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,229
so when this actually happened this
collision of two black holes yeah we

4008
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:08,239
collision of two black holes yeah we
 

4009
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,070
collision of two black holes yeah we
weren't here we weren't even close to

4010
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:10,080
weren't here we weren't even close to
 

4011
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,550
weren't here we weren't even close to
we're both developing a single

4012
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:12,560
we're both developing a single
 

4013
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,870
we're both developing a single
yeah we were at we're going from single

4014
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:14,880
yeah we were at we're going from single
 

4015
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,790
yeah we were at we're going from single
cell to multi-cell life at that point

4016
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:16,800
cell to multi-cell life at that point
 

4017
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,790
cell to multi-cell life at that point
all to meet up with this at this point

4018
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800
all to meet up with this at this point
 

4019
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,630

uh okay so
 

4029
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,030
uh okay so
on the human side of things it's kind of

4030
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,040
on the human side of things it's kind of
 

4031
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,950
on the human side of things it's kind of
fascinating because you're talking about

4032
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
fascinating because you're talking about
 

4033
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,910
fascinating because you're talking about
over a thousand people team for ligo

yeah uh that started out with uh you
 

4037
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,390
yeah uh that started out with uh you
know around a hundred

4038

know around a hundred
 

4039
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,550
know around a hundred
and you've uh

4040
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:44,560
and you've uh
 

4041
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,550
and you've uh
for parts of the time at least led this

4042
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:46,560
for parts of the time at least led this
 

4043
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,790
for parts of the time at least led this
team

team
 

4045
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,390
team
what does it take to lead a team like

4046
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
what does it take to lead a team like
 

4047
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,669
what does it take to lead a team like
this of incredibly brilliant

and just a lot of different parties
 

4053
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,030
and just a lot of different parties
involved a lot of egos

4054

involved a lot of egos
 

4055
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,590
involved a lot of egos
a lot of ideas you you had this fun

all agree on like uh
 

4063
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,870
all agree on like uh
you know the phrasing of a certain

4069
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,149
so on that's a very interesting simple
example i'd love you to speak to that

4070
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:18,159
example i'd love you to speak to that
 

4071
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,390
example i'd love you to speak to that
but just in general how

4072
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:20,400
but just in general how
 

4073
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,149
but just in general how
what does it take to lead this kind of

4074
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:22,159
what does it take to lead this kind of
 

4075
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:23,030
what does it take to lead this kind of
team

4076
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:23,040
team
 

4077
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,030
team
okay uh i think the the general

4078
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:27,040
okay uh i think the the general
 

4079
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,310
okay uh i think the the general
idea

4080
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:28,320
idea
 

4081
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,630
idea
is one we all know you wanna you wanna

4082
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:30,640
is one we all know you wanna you wanna
 

4083
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,709
is one we all know you wanna you wanna
you wanna to get

4084
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:32,719
you wanna to get
 

4085
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:34,229
you wanna to get
where the

4086
01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:34,239
where the
 

4087
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,110
where the
the

4088
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120
the
 

4089
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,110
the
sum of something is more than the

4090
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:37,120
sum of something is more than the
 

4091
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,189
sum of something is more than the
individual parts is what we say right

4092
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:39,199
individual parts is what we say right
 

4093
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,390
individual parts is what we say right
yeah

4094
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
yeah
 

4095
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,910
yeah
so that's what you're trying to achieve

4096
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
so that's what you're trying to achieve
 

4097
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,709
so that's what you're trying to achieve
yes okay how do you do that actually

4098
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:44,719
yes okay how do you do that actually
 

4099
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,709
yes okay how do you do that actually
mostly if we take

4100
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:46,719
mostly if we take
 

4101
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:47,750
mostly if we take
multiple

4102
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:47,760
multiple
 

4103
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,510
multiple
objects or people and when you put them

4104
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:49,520
objects or people and when you put them
 

4105
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,430
objects or people and when you put them
together the sum is less

4106
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:51,440
together the sum is less
 

4107
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,310
together the sum is less
yes

4108
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,320
yes
 

4109
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,189
yes
why because they overlap

4110
01:13:55,189 --> 01:13:55,199
why because they overlap
 

4111
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,430
why because they overlap
so you don't have individual things that

4112
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:57,440
so you don't have individual things that
 

4113
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,950
so you don't have individual things that
you know this

4114
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:58,960
you know this
 

4115
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,709
you know this
person does that this person does that

4116
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719
person does that this person does that
 

4117
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,669
person does that this person does that
then you get exactly the sum but what

4118
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:03,679
then you get exactly the sum but what
 

4119
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,310
then you get exactly the sum but what
you want is to develop where you get

4120
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:06,320
you want is to develop where you get
 

4121
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,390
you want is to develop where you get
more than what the individual

4122
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,400
more than what the individual
 

4123
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:09,990
more than what the individual
contributions are we know that's very

4124
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,000
contributions are we know that's very
 

4125
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,590
contributions are we know that's very
common people use that

4126
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:11,600
common people use that
 

4127
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,590
common people use that
expression everywhere and it's the

4128
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:13,600
expression everywhere and it's the
 

4129
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,229
expression everywhere and it's the
expression that has to be

4130
01:14:16,229 --> 01:14:16,239
expression that has to be
 

4131
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:18,950
expression that has to be
kind of built into how people feel it's

4132
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:18,960
kind of built into how people feel it's
 

4133
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,709
kind of built into how people feel it's
working because if you're

4134
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:20,719
working because if you're
 

4135
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,630
working because if you're
part of a team

4136
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
part of a team
 

4137
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,189
part of a team
and you realize that somehow the team is

4138
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:25,199
and you realize that somehow the team is
 

4139
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,430
and you realize that somehow the team is
able to do more than the individuals

4140
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:27,440
able to do more than the individuals
 

4141
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:29,910
able to do more than the individuals
could do themselves then they buy on

4142
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:29,920
could do themselves then they buy on
 

4143
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,990
could do themselves then they buy on
kind of in terms of the

4144
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:32,000
kind of in terms of the
 

4145
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,990
kind of in terms of the
process so that's the

4146
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:34,000
process so that's the
 

4147
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,950
process so that's the
that's the goal that you have to

4148
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
that's the goal that you have to
 

4149
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,910
that's the goal that you have to
have is to to achieve that and that

4150
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:39,920
have is to to achieve that and that
 

4151
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,189
have is to to achieve that and that
means

4152
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:41,199
means
 

4153
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,470
means
that you

4154
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
that you
 

4155
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,229
that you
have to

4156
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:44,239
have to
 

4157
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:45,830
have to
realize

4158
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
realize
 

4159
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,070
realize
parts of what you're trying to do

4160
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,080
parts of what you're trying to do
 

4161
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,070
parts of what you're trying to do
that require

4162
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:50,080
that require
 

4163
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,830
that require
not that one person couldn't do it it

4164
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:51,840
not that one person couldn't do it it
 

4165
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,870
not that one person couldn't do it it
requires the combined talents to be able

4166
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:54,880
requires the combined talents to be able
 

4167
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,709
requires the combined talents to be able
to do something that neither of them

4168
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:56,719
to do something that neither of them
 

4169
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:59,030
to do something that neither of them
could do themselves and we have a lot of

4170
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,040
could do themselves and we have a lot of
 

4171
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,030
could do themselves and we have a lot of
that kind of thing and i think

4172
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:01,040
that kind of thing and i think
 

4173
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,390
that kind of thing and i think
um i mean

4174
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
um i mean
 

4175
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,229
um i mean
build into the some of the examples that

4176
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239
build into the some of the examples that
 

4177
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:05,350
build into the some of the examples that
i gave you

4178
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
i gave you
 

4179
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:06,550
i gave you
and so

4180
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:06,560
and so
 

4181
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,709
and so
uh how do you then so so the key almost

4182
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:10,719
uh how do you then so so the key almost
 

4183
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,870
uh how do you then so so the key almost
in anything you do is the people

4184
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:12,880
in anything you do is the people
 

4185
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,630
in anything you do is the people
themselves right so

4186
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:14,640
themselves right so
 

4187
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,229
themselves right so
in our case

4188
01:15:16,229 --> 01:15:16,239
in our case
 

4189
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,189
in our case
the first and most important was to

4190
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:19,199
the first and most important was to
 

4191
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:20,550
the first and most important was to
attract

4192
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:20,560
attract
 

4193
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,229
attract
to spend years of their life on this and

4194
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:24,239
to spend years of their life on this and
 

4195
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:26,310
to spend years of their life on this and
the best possible people in the world to

4196
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:26,320
the best possible people in the world to
 

4197
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,990
the best possible people in the world to
do it so

4198
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,000
do it so
 

4199
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,149
do it so
the only way to convince them is that

4200
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:30,159
the only way to convince them is that
 

4201
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,709
the only way to convince them is that
somehow it's

4202
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:32,719
somehow it's
 

4203
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,630
somehow it's
better and more interesting for them

4204
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:34,640
better and more interesting for them
 

4205
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:36,870
better and more interesting for them
than what they could do themselves

4206
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:36,880
than what they could do themselves
 

4207
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,189
than what they could do themselves
and so that's part of this

4208
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:39,199
and so that's part of this
 

4209
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:42,070
and so that's part of this
uh idea that's it yeah that's powerful

4210
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,080
uh idea that's it yeah that's powerful
 

4211
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,390
uh idea that's it yeah that's powerful
but nevertheless there's best people in

4212
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:44,400
but nevertheless there's best people in
 

4213
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,310
but nevertheless there's best people in
the world there's egos is there

4214
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:46,320
the world there's egos is there
 

4215
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,750
the world there's egos is there
something to be said about managing egos

4216
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,760
something to be said about managing egos
 

4217
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,750
something to be said about managing egos
the human problem is always the hardest

4218
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:51,760
the human problem is always the hardest
 

4219
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,070
the human problem is always the hardest
and so there's that's an art not

4220
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:54,080
and so there's that's an art not
 

4221
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,990
and so there's that's an art not
a science i think

4222
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:56,000
a science i think
 

4223
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,030
a science i think
i think the fact here that

4224
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
i think the fact here that
 

4225
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,310
i think the fact here that
combined

4226
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:00,320
combined
 

4227
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:03,110
combined
there's a was a romantic goal

4228
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:03,120
there's a was a romantic goal
 

4229
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,350
there's a was a romantic goal
that we had to you know do something

4230
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:05,360
that we had to you know do something
 

4231
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,030
that we had to you know do something
that people hadn't done before which was

4232
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:09,040
that people hadn't done before which was
 

4233
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,270
that people hadn't done before which was
um

4234
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:11,280
um
 

4235
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,630
um
important scientifically and and a huge

4236
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:14,640
important scientifically and and a huge
 

4237
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,830
important scientifically and and a huge
challenge

4238
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:15,840
challenge
 

4239
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,390
challenge
uh enabled us to say take

4240
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:18,400
uh enabled us to say take
 

4241
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,790
uh enabled us to say take
and get uh i mean what we did just to

4242
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:20,800
and get uh i mean what we did just to
 

4243
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,030
and get uh i mean what we did just to
take an example we use the light to go

4244
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
take an example we use the light to go
 

4245
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,990
take an example we use the light to go
in this thing comes from lasers

4246
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
in this thing comes from lasers
 

4247
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,310
in this thing comes from lasers
we need a certain kind of laser so

4248
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,320
we need a certain kind of laser so
 

4249
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,790
we need a certain kind of laser so
uh the kind of laser that we use there

4250
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:30,800
uh the kind of laser that we use there
 

4251
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,830
uh the kind of laser that we use there
were three

4252
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:32,840
were three
 

4253
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,830
were three
different institutions in the world that

4254
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:35,840
different institutions in the world that
 

4255
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,070
different institutions in the world that
had the experts that do this maybe in

4256
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:38,080
had the experts that do this maybe in
 

4257
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,990
had the experts that do this maybe in
competition with each other

4258
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:40,000
competition with each other
 

4259
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,470
competition with each other
so we got all three to join together and

4260
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
so we got all three to join together and
 

4261
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,590
so we got all three to join together and
work with us uh to work on this as an

4262
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:45,600
work with us uh to work on this as an
 

4263
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,149
work with us uh to work on this as an
example so that you had and they had the

4264
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:50,159
example so that you had and they had the
 

4265
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:51,750
example so that you had and they had the
thing that they were working together on

4266
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:51,760
thing that they were working together on
 

4267
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,910
thing that they were working together on
a kind of object that they wouldn't have

4268
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:53,920
a kind of object that they wouldn't have
 

4269
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,110
a kind of object that they wouldn't have
otherwise

4270
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:55,120
otherwise
 

4271
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:55,910
otherwise
and

4272
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:55,920
and
 

4273
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,750
and
were part of a bigger team where they

4274
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:57,760
were part of a bigger team where they
 

4275
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,910
were part of a bigger team where they
could discover something that

4276
01:16:59,910 --> 01:16:59,920
could discover something that
 

4277
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,830
could discover something that
isn't even engineers these are engineers

4278
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:01,840
isn't even engineers these are engineers
 

4279
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,709
isn't even engineers these are engineers
that do lasers so and they're part of

4280
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
that do lasers so and they're part of
 

4281
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,950
that do lasers so and they're part of
our laser physicists and

4282
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:06,960
our laser physicists and
 

4283
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,270
our laser physicists and
so could you describe

4284
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:09,280
so could you describe
 

4285
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,310
so could you describe
the

4286
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:10,320
the
 

4287
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,390
the
moment

4288
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
moment
 

4289
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,470
moment
or the period of time

4290
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:14,480
or the period of time
 

4291
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,950
or the period of time
when finally this incredible creation of

4292
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:16,960
when finally this incredible creation of
 

4293
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,310
when finally this incredible creation of
human beings

4294
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,320
human beings
 

4295
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,229
human beings
led to a detection of gravitational

4296
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:20,239
led to a detection of gravitational
 

4297
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,350
led to a detection of gravitational
waves

4298
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,360
waves
 

4299
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,350
waves
it's a long story unfortunately this is

4300
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:23,360
it's a long story unfortunately this is
 

4301
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,870
it's a long story unfortunately this is
a part that

4302
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:24,880
a part that
 

4303
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,189
a part that
uh we started failures along the way

4304
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,199
uh we started failures along the way
 

4305
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,590
uh we started failures along the way
kind of thing or all failures that's all

4306
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:29,600
kind of thing or all failures that's all
 

4307
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,350
kind of thing or all failures that's all
that's built into it

4308
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:31,360
that's built into it
 

4309
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,270
that's built into it
okay if you're not a uh if you're not

4310
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:33,280
okay if you're not a uh if you're not
 

4311
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,830
okay if you're not a uh if you're not
mechanical engineering

4312
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:35,840
mechanical engineering
 

4313
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:37,590
mechanical engineering
you build on your failures that's

4314
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:37,600
you build on your failures that's
 

4315
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,590
you build on your failures that's
expected so we're trying things that no

4316
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:39,600
expected so we're trying things that no
 

4317
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,910
expected so we're trying things that no
one's done before so it's technically

4318
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:41,920
one's done before so it's technically
 

4319
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,550
one's done before so it's technically
not just gravitational waves and so it's

4320
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,560
not just gravitational waves and so it's
 

4321
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,149
not just gravitational waves and so it's
built on failures

4322
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:46,159
built on failures
 

4323
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,550
built on failures
but anyway we we did

4324
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
but anyway we we did
 

4325
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,790
but anyway we we did
before me even the the

4326
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:50,800
before me even the the
 

4327
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,310
before me even the the
people did

4328
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,320
people did
 

4329
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,550
people did
r d on the concepts

4330
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:54,560
r d on the concepts
 

4331
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,310
r d on the concepts
but starting in 1994 we got money from

4332
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:58,320
but starting in 1994 we got money from
 

4333
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,229
but starting in 1994 we got money from
the national science foundation to build

4334
01:18:00,229 --> 01:18:00,239
the national science foundation to build
 

4335
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,630
the national science foundation to build
this thing

4336
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:02,640
this thing
 

4337
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,110
this thing
it took about five years to build it so

4338
01:18:05,110 --> 01:18:05,120
it took about five years to build it so
 

4339
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,070
it took about five years to build it so
by 1999 we had

4340
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:08,080
by 1999 we had
 

4341
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,669
by 1999 we had
built the basic

4342
01:18:09,669 --> 01:18:09,679
built the basic
 

4343
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:10,630
built the basic
unit

4344
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:10,640
unit
 

4345
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:12,390
unit
it did not have

4346
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,400
it did not have
 

4347
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,030
it did not have
active seismic isolation at that stage

4348
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:15,040
active seismic isolation at that stage
 

4349
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,870
active seismic isolation at that stage
didn't have some other things that we

4350
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:16,880
didn't have some other things that we
 

4351
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,229
didn't have some other things that we
have now

4352
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:18,239
have now
 

4353
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,950
have now
what we did at that at at the beginning

4354
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:20,960
what we did at that at at the beginning
 

4355
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,310
what we did at that at at the beginning
was

4356
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,320
was
 

4357
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,550
was
uh

4358
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:24,560
uh
 

4359
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,709
uh
stick to

4360
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:26,719
stick to
 

4361
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,030
stick to
technologies that we had

4362
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,040
technologies that we had
 

4363
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,430
technologies that we had
at least enough knowledge that we could

4364
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:31,440
at least enough knowledge that we could
 

4365
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,270
at least enough knowledge that we could
make work or had tested in our own

4366
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:33,280
make work or had tested in our own
 

4367
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,870
make work or had tested in our own
laboratories

4368
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:34,880
laboratories
 

4369
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,310
laboratories
and so then we put together the

4370
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320
and so then we put together the
 

4371
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,750
and so then we put together the
instrument

4372
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:37,760
instrument
 

4373
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,590
instrument
we made it work

4374
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:39,600
we made it work
 

4375
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,590
we made it work
it didn't work very well but it worked

4376
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:41,600
it didn't work very well but it worked
 

4377
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,630
it didn't work very well but it worked
and

4378
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,640
and
 

4379
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,470
and
we didn't see any gravitational waves

4380
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:44,480
we didn't see any gravitational waves
 

4381
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,630
we didn't see any gravitational waves
then we figured out what limited us and

4382
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:46,640
then we figured out what limited us and
 

4383
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,070
then we figured out what limited us and
we went through this every year for

4384
01:18:50,070 --> 01:18:50,080
we went through this every year for
 

4385
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,669
we went through this every year for
almost 10 years

4386
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
almost 10 years
 

4387
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:55,830
almost 10 years
never seen gravitational waves we would

4388
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:55,840
never seen gravitational waves we would
 

4389
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,870
never seen gravitational waves we would
run it

4390
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:56,880
run it
 

4391
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,390
run it
looking for gravitational waves for

4392
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:58,400
looking for gravitational waves for
 

4393
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,390
looking for gravitational waves for
months

4394
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
months
 

4395
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,510
months
learn what limited us fix it for months

4396
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:03,520
learn what limited us fix it for months
 

4397
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,189
learn what limited us fix it for months
and then run it again

4398
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:05,199
and then run it again
 

4399
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,270
and then run it again
eventually we

4400
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,280
eventually we
 

4401
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,669
eventually we
knew we had to take another big step and

4402
01:19:09,669 --> 01:19:09,679
knew we had to take another big step and
 

4403
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:12,149
knew we had to take another big step and
that's when we made several changes

4404
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:12,159
that's when we made several changes
 

4405
01:19:12,159 --> 01:19:14,870
that's when we made several changes
including going adding these active

4406
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:14,880
including going adding these active
 

4407
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,189
including going adding these active
seismic isolation which turned out to be

4408
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:17,199
seismic isolation which turned out to be
 

4409
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,110
seismic isolation which turned out to be
a key

4410
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:19,120
a key
 

4411
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,510
a key
and we

4412
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:21,520
and we
 

4413
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,270
and we
fortunately got the national science

4414
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:23,280
fortunately got the national science
 

4415
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,270
fortunately got the national science
foundation to give us another

4416
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:25,280
foundation to give us another
 

4417
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,470
foundation to give us another
couple hundred

4418
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:26,480
couple hundred
 

4419
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:30,470
couple hundred
million dollars 100 million more and

4420
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:30,480
million dollars 100 million more and
 

4421
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,790
million dollars 100 million more and
we rebuilt it our fixed

4422
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:32,800
we rebuilt it our fixed
 

4423
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,550
we rebuilt it our fixed
or improved it

4424
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:34,560
or improved it
 

4425
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,550
or improved it
and uh

4426
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:36,560
and uh
 

4427
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,750
and uh
then in ninth uh in

4428
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:39,760
then in ninth uh in
 

4429
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,669
then in ninth uh in
2015 uh we turned it on

4430
01:19:43,669 --> 01:19:43,679
2015 uh we turned it on
 

4431
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,350
2015 uh we turned it on
and uh

4432
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,360
and uh
 

4433
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,030
and uh
we um

4434
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:47,040
we um
 

4435
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,149
we um
almost instantly saw uh this first

4436
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:50,159
almost instantly saw uh this first
 

4437
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:53,750
almost instantly saw uh this first
collision of two black holes

4438
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:53,760

 

4439
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,870

um

4440
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:54,880
um
 

4441
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,910
um
and

4442
01:19:55,910 --> 01:19:55,920
and
 

4443
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,550
and
then then we went through a process of

4444
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
then then we went through a process of
 

4445
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,310
then then we went through a process of
do we believe what we've seen yeah i

4446
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:00,320
do we believe what we've seen yeah i
 

4447
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,830
do we believe what we've seen yeah i
think i think you're one of the people

4448
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:01,840
think i think you're one of the people
 

4449
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,189
think i think you're one of the people
that went through that process it sounds

4450
01:20:03,189 --> 01:20:03,199
that went through that process it sounds
 

4451
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,110
that went through that process it sounds
like some people immediately believed it

4452
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:05,120
like some people immediately believed it
 

4453
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,590
like some people immediately believed it
yeah and and then you were like so as

4454
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:07,600
yeah and and then you were like so as
 

4455
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,110
yeah and and then you were like so as
human beings we all have different

4456
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:09,120
human beings we all have different
 

4457
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,910
human beings we all have different
reactions to almost anything and so

4458
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:11,920
reactions to almost anything and so
 

4459
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,430
reactions to almost anything and so
quite a few of my colleagues had a

4460
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:13,440
quite a few of my colleagues had a
 

4461
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,709
quite a few of my colleagues had a
eureka moment immediately i mean it's

4462
01:20:16,709 --> 01:20:16,719
eureka moment immediately i mean it's
 

4463
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,390
eureka moment immediately i mean it's
that's amazing

4464
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:18,400
that's amazing
 

4465
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,950
that's amazing
the the the figure that we

4466
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:20,960
the the the figure that we
 

4467
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,669
the the the figure that we
that we put in our paper

4468
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:23,679
that we put in our paper
 

4469
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,310
that we put in our paper
first is just data we didn't have to go

4470
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,320
first is just data we didn't have to go
 

4471
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,790
first is just data we didn't have to go
through you know fancy computer programs

4472
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:28,800
through you know fancy computer programs
 

4473
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,990
through you know fancy computer programs
to do anything

4474
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,000
to do anything
 

4475
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,790
to do anything
and

4476
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:30,800
and
 

4477
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,070
and
and we showed next to it uh the

4478
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:34,080
and we showed next to it uh the
 

4479
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,390
and we showed next to it uh the
calculations of einstein's equations it

4480
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:36,400
calculations of einstein's equations it
 

4481
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,189
calculations of einstein's equations it
looks just like the what we detected wow

4482
01:20:39,189 --> 01:20:39,199
looks just like the what we detected wow
 

4483
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,189
looks just like the what we detected wow
and we did it in two different detectors

4484
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
and we did it in two different detectors
 

4485
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,750
and we did it in two different detectors
halfway across the us so it was pretty

4486
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
halfway across the us so it was pretty
 

4487
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,550
halfway across the us so it was pretty
convincing but

4488
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:46,560
convincing but
 

4489
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,229
convincing but
but you don't want to

4490
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:48,239
but you don't want to
 

4491
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,390
but you don't want to
you don't want to fool yourself so we

4492
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400
you don't want to fool yourself so we
 

4493
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,350
you don't want to fool yourself so we
had a

4494
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:51,360
had a
 

4495
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,189
had a
being a scientist

4496
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:53,199
being a scientist
 

4497
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,310
being a scientist
we had a

4498
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:54,320
we had a
 

4499
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,550
we had a
for me we had to go through and try to

4500
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:56,560
for me we had to go through and try to
 

4501
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,229
for me we had to go through and try to
understand that the instrument itself

4502
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:58,239
understand that the instrument itself
 

4503
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:00,550
understand that the instrument itself
which was new i said we had rebuild it

4504
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:00,560
which was new i said we had rebuild it
 

4505
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,550
which was new i said we had rebuild it
couldn't somehow generate

4506
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:02,560
couldn't somehow generate
 

4507
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,470
couldn't somehow generate
things that look like this

4508
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:04,480
things that look like this
 

4509
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,430
things that look like this
that took some tests and then

4510
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:07,440
that took some tests and then
 

4511
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,830
that took some tests and then
the second you'll appreciate more

4512
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:09,840
the second you'll appreciate more
 

4513
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,390
the second you'll appreciate more
we had to somehow convince ourselves we

4514
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,400
we had to somehow convince ourselves we
 

4515
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,709
we had to somehow convince ourselves we
weren't hacked in some clever way cyber

4516
01:21:14,709 --> 01:21:14,719
weren't hacked in some clever way cyber
 

4517
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:16,950
weren't hacked in some clever way cyber
security question yeah even though we're

4518
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:16,960
security question yeah even though we're
 

4519
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,390
security question yeah even though we're
not on the internet the the but yeah

4520
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
not on the internet the the but yeah
 

4521
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,470
not on the internet the the but yeah
no it can be physical access too yeah

4522
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:22,480
no it can be physical access too yeah
 

4523
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,390
no it can be physical access too yeah
that's that's fascinating it's

4524
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:24,400
that's that's fascinating it's
 

4525
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,070
that's that's fascinating it's
fascinating you would think about that i

4526
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
fascinating you would think about that i
 

4527
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:26,830
fascinating you would think about that i
mean

4528
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:26,840
mean
 

4529
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,510
mean
not not enough

4530
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:31,520

 

4531
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,149

i mean because it's it's uh it matches

4532
01:21:34,149 --> 01:21:34,159
i mean because it's it's uh it matches
 

4533
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:35,350
i mean because it's it's uh it matches
prediction

4534
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,360
prediction
 

4535
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,790
prediction
so the chances of it actually being

4536
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:36,800
so the chances of it actually being
 

4537
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,709
so the chances of it actually being
manipulated is very very low

4538
01:21:38,709 --> 01:21:38,719
manipulated is very very low
 

4539
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:40,229
manipulated is very very low
but nevertheless

4540
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:40,239
but nevertheless
 

4541
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:41,990
but nevertheless
we still could have disgruntled old

4542
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,000
we still could have disgruntled old
 

4543
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,669
we still could have disgruntled old
graduate students who had worked with us

4544
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:43,679
graduate students who had worked with us
 

4545
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,270
graduate students who had worked with us
earlier that who

4546
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:45,280
earlier that who
 

4547
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,110
earlier that who
want you to i don't know how that's

4548
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:47,120
want you to i don't know how that's
 

4549
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,510
want you to i don't know how that's
supposed to embarrass you i suppose yeah

4550
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:49,520
supposed to embarrass you i suppose yeah
 

4551
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,390
supposed to embarrass you i suppose yeah
i suppose i see but

4552
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:52,400
i suppose i see but
 

4553
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,870
i suppose i see but
but about what i think you said within a

4554
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:54,880
but about what i think you said within a
 

4555
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,629
but about what i think you said within a
month you kind of convinced yourself

4556
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:56,639
month you kind of convinced yourself
 

4557
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,149
month you kind of convinced yourself
something within a month we convinced

4558
01:21:58,149 --> 01:21:58,159
something within a month we convinced
 

4559
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:01,030
something within a month we convinced
ourselves uh we kept a thousand

4560
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,040
ourselves uh we kept a thousand
 

4561
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,030
ourselves uh we kept a thousand
collaborators quiet during that time

4562
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:03,040
collaborators quiet during that time
 

4563
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,510
collaborators quiet during that time
then we spent another that's funny month

4564
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:05,520
then we spent another that's funny month
 

4565
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,350
then we spent another that's funny month
or so uh

4566
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:07,360
or so uh
 

4567
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,310
or so uh
trying to understand what we'd seen

4568
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,320
trying to understand what we'd seen
 

4569
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,550
trying to understand what we'd seen
so that we could do the science with it

4570
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:12,560
so that we could do the science with it
 

4571
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,070
so that we could do the science with it
instead of just putting it out to the

4572
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:14,080
instead of just putting it out to the
 

4573
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,669
instead of just putting it out to the
world and let somebody else understand

4574
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:15,679
world and let somebody else understand
 

4575
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:18,070
world and let somebody else understand
that it was two black holes and what it

4576
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,080
that it was two black holes and what it
 

4577
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,750
that it was two black holes and what it
was the fact that a thousand

4578
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:19,760
was the fact that a thousand
 

4579
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,990
was the fact that a thousand
collaborators were quiet

4580
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:22,000
collaborators were quiet
 

4581
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,990
collaborators were quiet
is a really strong indication that this

4582
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
is a really strong indication that this
 

4583
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,390
is a really strong indication that this
is a really close-knit team yeah over

4584
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:26,400
is a really close-knit team yeah over
 

4585
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,870
is a really close-knit team yeah over
and they're around the world

4586
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:28,880
and they're around the world
 

4587
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,390
and they're around the world
or either strong

4588
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400
or either strong
 

4589
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,590
or either strong
uh either strong knit or tight-knit or

4590
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:33,600
uh either strong knit or tight-knit or
 

4591
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,390
uh either strong knit or tight-knit or
had a strong dictatorship or something

4592
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:36,400
had a strong dictatorship or something
 

4593
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,310
had a strong dictatorship or something
yeah either fear or love you can rule by

4594
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:38,320
yeah either fear or love you can rule by
 

4595
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,910
yeah either fear or love you can rule by
fear of love yeah you can go back to

4596
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:39,920
fear of love yeah you can go back to
 

4597
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:41,590
fear of love yeah you can go back to
mecca valley yeah

4598
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:41,600
mecca valley yeah
 

4599
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,910
mecca valley yeah
all right well this i mean

4600
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:45,920

 

4601
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,510

this is really exciting that that was

4602
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:49,520
this is really exciting that that was
 

4603
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,510
this is really exciting that that was
that that's a success story because it

4604
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:51,520
that that's a success story because it
 

4605
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,830
that that's a success story because it
didn't have to be a success story

4606
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:53,840
didn't have to be a success story
 

4607
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:54,629
didn't have to be a success story
right

4608
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:54,639
right
 

4609
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,390
right
i mean eventually perhaps you could say

4610
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:56,400
i mean eventually perhaps you could say
 

4611
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,830
i mean eventually perhaps you could say
it'd be an effect but it could have

4612
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:57,840
it'd be an effect but it could have
 

4613
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,550
it'd be an effect but it could have
taken it over a century to get oh yeah

4614
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:00,560
taken it over a century to get oh yeah
 

4615
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,030
taken it over a century to get oh yeah
yeah it's uh and

4616
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:05,040

 

4617
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,380

and it's only downhill now kind of

4618
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:07,390
and it's only downhill now kind of
 

4619
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,830
and it's only downhill now kind of
[Laughter]

4620
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:09,840
[Laughter]
 

4621
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,510
[Laughter]
what do you mean it's only uh you mean

4622
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:11,520
what do you mean it's only uh you mean
 

4623
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,590
what do you mean it's only uh you mean
with gravitational waves well we're yeah

4624
01:23:13,590 --> 01:23:13,600
with gravitational waves well we're yeah
 

4625
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,310
with gravitational waves well we're yeah
we've it's we've now we now

4626
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
we've it's we've now we now
 

4627
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,229
we've it's we've now we now
uh well now we're off because of the

4628
01:23:18,229 --> 01:23:18,239
uh well now we're off because of the
 

4629
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,629
uh well now we're off because of the
pandemic but when we turned off we were

4630
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:20,639
pandemic but when we turned off we were
 

4631
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,149
pandemic but when we turned off we were
seeing

4632
01:23:22,149 --> 01:23:22,159
seeing
 

4633
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,470
seeing
some sort of gravitational wave event

4634
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:24,480
some sort of gravitational wave event
 

4635
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,390
some sort of gravitational wave event
each week

4636
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,400
each week
 

4637
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,870
each week
and now we're fixing we're fixing we're

4638
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:28,880
and now we're fixing we're fixing we're
 

4639
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,030
and now we're fixing we're fixing we're
adding features where it'll probably be

4640
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:31,040
adding features where it'll probably be
 

4641
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,790
adding features where it'll probably be
when we turn back on next year it'll

4642
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:32,800
when we turn back on next year it'll
 

4643
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,750
when we turn back on next year it'll
probably every one every couple days

4644
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:35,760
probably every one every couple days
 

4645
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,149
probably every one every couple days
and they're not all the same so it's

4646
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:38,159
and they're not all the same so it's
 

4647
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:40,070
and they're not all the same so it's
learning about what's out there in

4648
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:40,080
learning about what's out there in
 

4649
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,510
learning about what's out there in
gravity instead of just optics and

4650
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:43,520
gravity instead of just optics and
 

4651
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,030
gravity instead of just optics and
so it's all

4652
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:45,040
so it's all
 

4653
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:49,030
so it's all
uh great we're only limited by

4654
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:49,040
uh great we're only limited by
 

4655
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,510
uh great we're only limited by
the fantastic thing other than that this

4656
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,520
the fantastic thing other than that this
 

4657
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,790
the fantastic thing other than that this
is uh

4658
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:52,800
is uh
 

4659
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,870
is uh
a great field and you know it's all new

4660
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:54,880
a great field and you know it's all new
 

4661
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,430
a great field and you know it's all new
and so forth is that experimentally the

4662
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:57,440
and so forth is that experimentally the
 

4663
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,830
and so forth is that experimentally the
the great thing is that uh

4664
01:23:59,830 --> 01:23:59,840
the great thing is that uh
 

4665
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,870
the great thing is that uh
we're limited by

4666
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:02,880
we're limited by
 

4667
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,590
we're limited by
technology and technical limitations not

4668
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:05,600
technology and technical limitations not
 

4669
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,990
technology and technical limitations not
by science

4670
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,000
by science
 

4671
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,030
by science
so

4672
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:09,040
so
 

4673
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,870
so
the the the

4674
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:10,880
the the the
 

4675
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,830
the the the
uh

4676
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:11,840
uh
 

4677
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,510
uh
another

4678
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:13,520
another
 

4679
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,510
another
a really important discovery that was

4680
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,520
a really important discovery that was
 

4681
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,510
a really important discovery that was
made before ours

4682
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:17,520
made before ours
 

4683
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,350
made before ours
was what's called the higgs boson made

4684
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
was what's called the higgs boson made
 

4685
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,990
was what's called the higgs boson made
on the big accelerator at cern you know

4686
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:22,000
on the big accelerator at cern you know
 

4687
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,229
on the big accelerator at cern you know
this huge accelerator they discovered a

4688
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:24,239
this huge accelerator they discovered a
 

4689
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,390
this huge accelerator they discovered a
really important thing it's

4690
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
really important thing it's
 

4691
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,229
really important thing it's
you know we have einstein's equation e

4692
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:28,239
you know we have einstein's equation e
 

4693
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:31,590
you know we have einstein's equation e
equals m c squared so energy makes mass

4694
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:31,600
equals m c squared so energy makes mass
 

4695
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,750
equals m c squared so energy makes mass
or mass can make energy and that's the

4696
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:33,760
or mass can make energy and that's the
 

4697
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,270
or mass can make energy and that's the
bomb

4698
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:35,280
bomb
 

4699
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,229
bomb
but the mechanism by which that happens

4700
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:38,239
but the mechanism by which that happens
 

4701
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,350
but the mechanism by which that happens
not fission but but how do you create

4702
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:41,360
not fission but but how do you create
 

4703
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,470
not fission but but how do you create
mass from energy

4704
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
mass from energy
 

4705
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,990
mass from energy
was never

4706
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:46,000
was never
 

4707
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,350
was never
understood

4708
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:47,360
understood
 

4709
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,669
understood
until there was a

4710
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:49,679
until there was a
 

4711
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,990
until there was a
a theory of it about

4712
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,000
a theory of it about
 

4713
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,990
a theory of it about
70 years ago now

4714
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,000
70 years ago now
 

4715
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,350
70 years ago now
and

4716
01:24:55,350 --> 01:24:55,360
and
 

4717
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,430
and
so they discovered it's named after a

4718
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:57,440
so they discovered it's named after a
 

4719
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,189
so they discovered it's named after a
man named higgs it's called the higgs

4720
01:24:59,189 --> 01:24:59,199
man named higgs it's called the higgs
 

4721
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,390
man named higgs it's called the higgs
boson

4722
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:00,400
boson
 

4723
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,709
boson
and so it was discovered

4724
01:25:02,709 --> 01:25:02,719
and so it was discovered
 

4725
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:05,189
and so it was discovered
but since that time and i i worked on

4726
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:05,199
but since that time and i i worked on
 

4727
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:06,149
but since that time and i i worked on
those

4728
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:06,159
those
 

4729
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:07,830
those
experiments since that time they haven't

4730
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:07,840
experiments since that time they haven't
 

4731
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:09,910
experiments since that time they haven't
been able to progress very much further

4732
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:09,920
been able to progress very much further
 

4733
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,229
been able to progress very much further
a little bit but not a lot further and

4734
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:12,239
a little bit but not a lot further and
 

4735
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:13,830
a little bit but not a lot further and
the difference is that we're really

4736
01:25:13,830 --> 01:25:13,840
the difference is that we're really
 

4737
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,990
the difference is that we're really
lucky we're in

4738
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:16,000
lucky we're in
 

4739
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,229
lucky we're in
in what we're doing in that

4740
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:18,239
in what we're doing in that
 

4741
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:19,270
in what we're doing in that
there

4742
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:19,280
there
 

4743
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,669
there
uh you're you see this higgs boson but

4744
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
uh you're you see this higgs boson but
 

4745
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,270
uh you're you see this higgs boson but
there's tremendous amount of other

4746
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:23,280
there's tremendous amount of other
 

4747
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,709
there's tremendous amount of other
physics that goes on and you have to

4748
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:24,719
physics that goes on and you have to
 

4749
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,629
physics that goes on and you have to
pick out the needle in the haystack kind

4750
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:26,639
pick out the needle in the haystack kind
 

4751
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:29,189
pick out the needle in the haystack kind
of of physics you can't make the physics

4752
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:29,199
of of physics you can't make the physics
 

4753
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:30,790
of of physics you can't make the physics
go away it's there

4754
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
go away it's there
 

4755
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,910
go away it's there
in our case we have a very weak signal

4756
01:25:33,910 --> 01:25:33,920
in our case we have a very weak signal
 

4757
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,629
in our case we have a very weak signal
but once we get good enough to see it

4758
01:25:36,629 --> 01:25:36,639
but once we get good enough to see it
 

4759
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,390
but once we get good enough to see it
it's weak compared to where we've

4760
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:38,400
it's weak compared to where we've
 

4761
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,149
it's weak compared to where we've
reduced the background but the

4762
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:40,159
reduced the background but the
 

4763
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,950
reduced the background but the
background is not physics it's just

4764
01:25:42,950 --> 01:25:42,960
background is not physics it's just
 

4765
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,750
background is not physics it's just
technology you know it's getting

4766
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:45,760
technology you know it's getting
 

4767
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,990
technology you know it's getting
ourselves better isolated from the earth

4768
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:48,000
ourselves better isolated from the earth
 

4769
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,550
ourselves better isolated from the earth
or getting a more powerful laser

4770
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:50,560
or getting a more powerful laser
 

4771
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,790
or getting a more powerful laser
and so each time each since 2015 when we

4772
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:54,800
and so each time each since 2015 when we
 

4773
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,189
and so each time each since 2015 when we
saw the first one we continually can

4774
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:57,199
saw the first one we continually can
 

4775
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:00,070
saw the first one we continually can
make improvements that are enabling us

4776
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:00,080
make improvements that are enabling us
 

4777
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:01,830
make improvements that are enabling us
to turn this into a

4778
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:01,840
to turn this into a
 

4779
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,390
to turn this into a
a real science to do astronomy a new

4780
01:26:04,390 --> 01:26:04,400
a real science to do astronomy a new
 

4781
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,030
a real science to do astronomy a new
kind of astronomy it's a little like

4782
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,040
kind of astronomy it's a little like
 

4783
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,590
kind of astronomy it's a little like
astronomy i mean

4784
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:09,600
astronomy i mean
 

4785
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,110
astronomy i mean
galileo

4786
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
galileo
 

4787
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,350
galileo
started the field i mean he basically

4788
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:13,360
started the field i mean he basically
 

4789
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:17,590
started the field i mean he basically
took lenses that were made for classes

4790
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:17,600
took lenses that were made for classes
 

4791
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,070
took lenses that were made for classes
and he didn't invent the first telescope

4792
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:20,080
and he didn't invent the first telescope
 

4793
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,830
and he didn't invent the first telescope
but made a

4794
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:21,840
but made a
 

4795
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,390
but made a
looked at

4796
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:24,400

 

4797
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,510

neptune

4798
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:25,520
neptune
 

4799
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,669
neptune
and saw that it had four moons

4800
01:26:27,669 --> 01:26:27,679
and saw that it had four moons
 

4801
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,510
and saw that it had four moons
that was the birth of

4802
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:29,520
that was the birth of
 

4803
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,310
that was the birth of
not just using your eyes to understand

4804
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:32,320
not just using your eyes to understand
 

4805
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,669
not just using your eyes to understand
what's out there

4806
01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:33,679
what's out there
 

4807
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:35,270
what's out there
and since that time we've made better

4808
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:35,280
and since that time we've made better
 

4809
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,830
and since that time we've made better
and better telescopes obviously and

4810
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
and better telescopes obviously and
 

4811
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,669
and better telescopes obviously and
astronomy thrives

4812
01:26:39,669 --> 01:26:39,679
astronomy thrives
 

4813
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,550
astronomy thrives
and in a similar way we're starting to

4814
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:42,560
and in a similar way we're starting to
 

4815
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,390
and in a similar way we're starting to
be able to

4816
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:44,400
be able to
 

4817
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,629
be able to
for you know crawl but we're starting to

4818
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:46,639
for you know crawl but we're starting to
 

4819
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:48,870
for you know crawl but we're starting to
be able to do that with gravitational

4820
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:48,880
be able to do that with gravitational
 

4821
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:51,750
be able to do that with gravitational
waves it's and it's going to be more and

4822
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:51,760
waves it's and it's going to be more and
 

4823
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,189
waves it's and it's going to be more and
more that we can

4824
01:26:53,189 --> 01:26:53,199
more that we can
 

4825
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:54,790
more that we can
do is we can make better and better

4826
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:54,800
do is we can make better and better
 

4827
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,110
do is we can make better and better
instruments because as i say it's not

4828
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:57,120
instruments because as i say it's not
 

4829
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,709
instruments because as i say it's not
limited by

4830
01:26:58,709 --> 01:26:58,719
limited by
 

4831
01:26:58,719 --> 01:26:59,669
limited by
um

4832
01:26:59,669 --> 01:26:59,679
um
 

4833
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,350
um
picking it out of other yeah it's not

4834
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:01,360
picking it out of other yeah it's not
 

4835
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:03,110
picking it out of other yeah it's not
limited by the physics so you have an

4836
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:03,120
limited by the physics so you have an
 

4837
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,830
limited by the physics so you have an
optimism about engineering that event

4838
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:05,840
optimism about engineering that event
 

4839
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,830
optimism about engineering that event
you know as we

4840
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:07,840
you know as we
 

4841
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,030
you know as we
as human progress marches on

4842
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,040
as human progress marches on
 

4843
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:14,709
as human progress marches on
engineering will always uh find a way to

4844
01:27:14,709 --> 01:27:14,719
engineering will always uh find a way to
 

4845
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:15,590
engineering will always uh find a way to
uh

4846
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:15,600
uh
 

4847
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,669
uh
to build a large enough device accurate

4848
01:27:17,669 --> 01:27:17,679
to build a large enough device accurate
 

4849
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,830
to build a large enough device accurate
enough device to detect the size as long

4850
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:19,840
enough device to detect the size as long
 

4851
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,669
enough device to detect the size as long
as it's not limited by physics yeah

4852
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:21,679
as it's not limited by physics yeah
 

4853
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:25,270
as it's not limited by physics yeah
they'll do it

4854
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:25,280

 

4855
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,390

so

4856
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:26,400
so
 

4857
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,590
so
you

4858
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:27,600
you
 

4859
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,110
you
two other folks and the entire team

4860
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:31,120
two other folks and the entire team
 

4861
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:33,189
two other folks and the entire team
won the nobel prize

4862
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:33,199
won the nobel prize
 

4863
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,950
won the nobel prize
for this yeah big effort

4864
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:36,960
for this yeah big effort
 

4865
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,030
for this yeah big effort
there's a million questions i can ask

4866
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:39,040
there's a million questions i can ask
 

4867
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:40,629
there's a million questions i can ask
for but

4868
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
for but
 

4869
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:47,590
for but
looking back

4870
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600

 

4871
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,390

where does the nobel prize fit into all

4872
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:50,400
where does the nobel prize fit into all
 

4873
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,229
where does the nobel prize fit into all
of this

4874
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:52,239
of this
 

4875
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:53,830
of this
you know if you think hundreds years

4876
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:53,840
you know if you think hundreds years
 

4877
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,470
you know if you think hundreds years
from now

4878
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:56,480

 

4879
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,229

i venture to say that people will not

4880
01:27:58,229 --> 01:27:58,239
i venture to say that people will not
 

4881
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:01,270
i venture to say that people will not
remember the winners of a prize

4882
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:01,280
remember the winners of a prize
 

4883
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,950
remember the winners of a prize
but they'll remember creations like

4884
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:02,960
but they'll remember creations like
 

4885
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,629
but they'll remember creations like
these maybe i'm romanticizing

4886
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:04,639
these maybe i'm romanticizing
 

4887
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:06,950
these maybe i'm romanticizing
engineering

4888
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
engineering
 

4889
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,910
engineering
but i guess i want to ask how important

4890
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:09,920
but i guess i want to ask how important
 

4891
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,510
but i guess i want to ask how important
is the nobel prize in all this

4892
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:13,520

 

4893
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:15,590

well that's a it's a complicated

4894
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:15,600
well that's a it's a complicated
 

4895
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,110
well that's a it's a complicated
question it's uh

4896
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:19,120

 

4897
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,430

as a physicist it's something if you're

4898
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:21,440
as a physicist it's something if you're
 

4899
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,270
as a physicist it's something if you're
if you're trying to win a nobel prize

4900
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,280
if you're trying to win a nobel prize
 

4901
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,750
if you're trying to win a nobel prize
forget it because they give you know

4902
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:25,760
forget it because they give you know
 

4903
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,110
forget it because they give you know
one a year

4904
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:27,120
one a year
 

4905
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,910
one a year
so there's like there's been

4906
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:29,920
so there's like there's been
 

4907
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,830
so there's like there's been
200 physicists who've won the nobel

4908
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:31,840
200 physicists who've won the nobel
 

4909
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,070
200 physicists who've won the nobel
prize since 1900 and

4910
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
prize since 1900 and
 

4911
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:35,669
prize since 1900 and
and so that's

4912
01:28:35,669 --> 01:28:35,679
and so that's
 

4913
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:37,270
and so that's
you know

4914
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:37,280
you know
 

4915
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,430
you know
and so things just have to fall right so

4916
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:39,440
and so things just have to fall right so
 

4917
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,070
and so things just have to fall right so
your goal cannot be to win a nobel prize

4918
01:28:42,070 --> 01:28:42,080
your goal cannot be to win a nobel prize
 

4919
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,830
your goal cannot be to win a nobel prize
it wasn't my dream

4920
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:43,840
it wasn't my dream
 

4921
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:44,709
it wasn't my dream
uh

4922
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:44,719
uh
 

4923
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,229
uh
it's a

4924
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:46,239
it's a
 

4925
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:47,110
it's a
it's

4926
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:47,120
it's
 

4927
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,149
it's
uh tremendous for science i mean why the

4928
01:28:50,149 --> 01:28:50,159
uh tremendous for science i mean why the
 

4929
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:52,950
uh tremendous for science i mean why the
nobel prize for a guy that made dynamite

4930
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:52,960
nobel prize for a guy that made dynamite
 

4931
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,350
nobel prize for a guy that made dynamite
and stuff is you know what it is it's a

4932
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:55,360
and stuff is you know what it is it's a
 

4933
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,870
and stuff is you know what it is it's a
long story but

4934
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:56,880
long story but
 

4935
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,270
long story but
it's the one day a year where actually

4936
01:28:59,270 --> 01:28:59,280
it's the one day a year where actually
 

4937
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,229
it's the one day a year where actually
the science that people have done is all

4938
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:02,239
the science that people have done is all
 

4939
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,149
the science that people have done is all
over the world and so forth

4940
01:29:04,149 --> 01:29:04,159
over the world and so forth
 

4941
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,310
over the world and so forth
forget about the people again you know

4942
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:06,320
forget about the people again you know
 

4943
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,709
forget about the people again you know
it is really good for for science

4944
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:08,719
it is really good for for science
 

4945
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,629
it is really good for for science
celebrating science it celebrates

4946
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:10,639
celebrating science it celebrates
 

4947
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:11,669
celebrating science it celebrates
science

4948
01:29:11,669 --> 01:29:11,679
science
 

4949
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:12,550
science
for

4950
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:12,560
for
 

4951
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,470
for
you know several days different fields

4952
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:14,480
you know several days different fields
 

4953
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,310
you know several days different fields
uh you know chemistry

4954
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:16,320
uh you know chemistry
 

4955
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,149
uh you know chemistry
medicine and so forth

4956
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:18,159
medicine and so forth
 

4957
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,510
medicine and so forth
and uh

4958
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,520
and uh
 

4959
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,030
and uh
everybody doesn't understand everything

4960
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:21,040
everybody doesn't understand everything
 

4961
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,390
everybody doesn't understand everything
about these they're

4962
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:22,400
about these they're
 

4963
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,390
about these they're
generally a fairly abstract but then

4964
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:24,400
generally a fairly abstract but then
 

4965
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,910
generally a fairly abstract but then
it's you know it's

4966
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:25,920
it's you know it's
 

4967
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,669
it's you know it's
on the front page of newspapers around

4968
01:29:27,669 --> 01:29:27,679
on the front page of newspapers around
 

4969
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,030
on the front page of newspapers around
the world so it's really good for

4970
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
the world so it's really good for
 

4971
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:31,270
the world so it's really good for
science it's not easy to get science on

4972
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,280
science it's not easy to get science on
 

4973
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:32,950
science it's not easy to get science on
the front page of the new york times

4974
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:32,960
the front page of the new york times
 

4975
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:34,550
the front page of the new york times
it's not there

4976
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:34,560
it's not there
 

4977
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,590
it's not there
uh should be but it's not

4978
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600
uh should be but it's not
 

4979
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,510
uh should be but it's not
and uh

4980
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:39,520
and uh
 

4981
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,750
and uh
so the nobel prize is important in that

4982
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:41,760
so the nobel prize is important in that
 

4983
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,669
so the nobel prize is important in that
way uh

4984
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:43,679
way uh
 

4985
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,470
way uh
it's otherwise you know

4986
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:46,480
it's otherwise you know
 

4987
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,390
it's otherwise you know
i have a certain celebrity that i didn't

4988
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:48,400
i have a certain celebrity that i didn't
 

4989
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,830
i have a certain celebrity that i didn't
have before and

4990
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:50,840
have before and
 

4991
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,070
have before and
um and now you get to be a celebrity

4992
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:54,080
um and now you get to be a celebrity
 

4993
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,149
um and now you get to be a celebrity
that advertises science it's a mechanism

4994
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:56,159
that advertises science it's a mechanism
 

4995
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:56,870
that advertises science it's a mechanism
to

4996
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:56,880
to
 

4997
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,550
to
uh to remind us how incredible well

4998
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:00,560
uh to remind us how incredible well
 

4999
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,229
uh to remind us how incredible well
how much credit science deserves and

5000
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:02,239
how much credit science deserves and
 

5001
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,790
how much credit science deserves and
everything well it has a little bit more

5002
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:04,800
everything well it has a little bit more
 

5003
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,669
everything well it has a little bit more
one thing i didn't expect which is good

5004
01:30:07,669 --> 01:30:07,679
one thing i didn't expect which is good
 

5005
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,669
one thing i didn't expect which is good
is that you know

5006
01:30:09,669 --> 01:30:09,679
is that you know
 

5007
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:13,910
is that you know
we have a a government

5008
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920

 

5009
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,149

i'm not picking on ours necessarily but

5010
01:30:16,149 --> 01:30:16,159
i'm not picking on ours necessarily but
 

5011
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:17,830
i'm not picking on ours necessarily but
it's true of all governments are not run

5012
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:17,840
it's true of all governments are not run
 

5013
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:21,830
it's true of all governments are not run
by scientists in our case it's run by uh

5014
01:30:21,830 --> 01:30:21,840
by scientists in our case it's run by uh
 

5015
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,470
by scientists in our case it's run by uh
lawyers and businessmen yep okay

5016
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:24,480
lawyers and businessmen yep okay
 

5017
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,430
lawyers and businessmen yep okay
uh and at best they may have an aide or

5018
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:27,440
uh and at best they may have an aide or
 

5019
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:30,870
uh and at best they may have an aide or
something that knows a little science so

5020
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:30,880
something that knows a little science so
 

5021
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,110
something that knows a little science so
so our country is

5022
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:33,120
so our country is
 

5023
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,870
so our country is
and all countries are hardly

5024
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:36,880
and all countries are hardly
 

5025
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,870
and all countries are hardly
hardly take into account

5026
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:38,880
hardly take into account
 

5027
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,470
hardly take into account
science

5028
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:40,480
science
 

5029
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,350
science
in

5030
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:41,360
in
 

5031
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,990
in
making decisions yes okay

5032
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,000
making decisions yes okay
 

5033
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,070
making decisions yes okay
and

5034
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
and
 

5035
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,310
and
having a nobel prize the uh

5036
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:50,320
having a nobel prize the uh
 

5037
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,470
having a nobel prize the uh
people in those positions actually

5038
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,480
people in those positions actually
 

5039
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,590
people in those positions actually
listen

5040
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:53,600
listen
 

5041
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:54,550
listen
so

5042
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:54,560
so
 

5043
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,070
so
you have more influence i don't care

5044
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:56,080
you have more influence i don't care
 

5045
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,669
you have more influence i don't care
whether it's about global warming or

5046
01:30:57,669 --> 01:30:57,679
whether it's about global warming or
 

5047
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:00,149
whether it's about global warming or
what the issue is there's some

5048
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:00,159
what the issue is there's some
 

5049
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,629
what the issue is there's some
influence which is lacking otherwise

5050

influence which is lacking otherwise
 

5051
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:04,629
influence which is lacking otherwise
and uh i

5052
01:31:04,629 --> 01:31:04,639
and uh i
 

5053
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:06,550
and uh i
people pay attention to what i say if i

5054
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:06,560
people pay attention to what i say if i
 

5055
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,149
people pay attention to what i say if i
talk about global warming they wouldn't

5056
01:31:08,149 --> 01:31:08,159
talk about global warming they wouldn't
 

5057
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:09,030
talk about global warming they wouldn't
have

5058
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,040
have
 

5059
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,910
have
uh before i had the nobel prize

5060
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:11,920
uh before i had the nobel prize
 

5061
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,070
uh before i had the nobel prize
uh yeah this is very true you're like

5062
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,080
uh yeah this is very true you're like

good thing that's a good thing yeah uh
 

5071
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:25,510
good thing that's a good thing yeah uh
singling out people i mean on the other

5072
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:25,520
singling out people i mean on the other
 

5073
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,750
singling out people i mean on the other
side of it singling out people

5074
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:27,760
side of it singling out people
 

5075
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:29,990
side of it singling out people
has all kinds of you know whether it's

5076
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:30,000
has all kinds of you know whether it's
 

5077
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,709
has all kinds of you know whether it's
for academy awards or for this

5078
01:31:32,709 --> 01:31:32,719
for academy awards or for this
 

5079

for academy awards or for this
have unfairness and arbitrariness and so

5080
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:35,760
have unfairness and arbitrariness and so
 

5081
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,430
have unfairness and arbitrariness and so
forth and so on so

uh
 

5085
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,709
uh
you know that's the other side of the

5086
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:40,719
you know that's the other side of the
 

5087
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:42,310
you know that's the other side of the
coin jessica said especially with the

5088
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:42,320
coin jessica said especially with the
 

5089
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,950
coin jessica said especially with the
huge experimental projects like this

5090
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:44,960
huge experimental projects like this
 

5091
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,790
huge experimental projects like this
you know it's a large team

5092
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:46,800
you know it's a large team
 

5093
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,709
you know it's a large team
and it does the nature of the nobel

5094
01:31:48,709 --> 01:31:48,719
and it does the nature of the nobel
 

5095
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:50,950
and it does the nature of the nobel
prizes singles out a few individuals to

5096
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:50,960
prizes singles out a few individuals to
 

5097
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,110
prizes singles out a few individuals to
represent the team yeah

5098
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:53,120
represent the team yeah
 

5099
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,510
represent the team yeah
nevertheless is a beautiful thing uh

5100
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:55,520
nevertheless is a beautiful thing uh
 

5101
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,030
nevertheless is a beautiful thing uh
what are ways to improve ligo in the

5102
01:31:59,030 --> 01:31:59,040
what are ways to improve ligo in the
 

5103
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,270
what are ways to improve ligo in the
future increase the sensitivity

5104
01:32:01,270 --> 01:32:01,280
future increase the sensitivity
 

5105
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,030
future increase the sensitivity
i've seen a few ideas that are kind of

5106
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,040
i've seen a few ideas that are kind of
 

5107
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,470
i've seen a few ideas that are kind of
fascinating

5108
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:04,480
fascinating
 

5109
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,550
fascinating
is are you interested in them

5110
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:06,560
is are you interested in them
 

5111
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,470
is are you interested in them
sort of looking i'm not speaking about

5112
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:08,480
sort of looking i'm not speaking about
 

5113
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,229
sort of looking i'm not speaking about
five years perhaps you could speak to

5114
01:32:10,229 --> 01:32:10,239
five years perhaps you could speak to
 

5115
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:12,229
five years perhaps you could speak to
the next five years but also the next

5116
01:32:12,229 --> 01:32:12,239
the next five years but also the next
 

5117
01:32:12,239 --> 01:32:13,669
the next five years but also the next
hundred years

5118
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
hundred years
 

5119
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,310
hundred years
yeah so let me let me talk to both the

5120
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,320
yeah so let me let me talk to both the
 

5121
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,870
yeah so let me let me talk to both the
instrument and the science okay

5122
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:18,880
instrument and the science okay
 

5123
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,030
instrument and the science okay
so that's they go hand in hand i mean

5124
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,040
so that's they go hand in hand i mean
 

5125
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,709
so that's they go hand in hand i mean
the thing that i said is if we make it

5126
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:22,719
the thing that i said is if we make it
 

5127
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:23,750
the thing that i said is if we make it
better

5128
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:23,760
better
 

5129
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,870
better
we see more kinds of weaker objects and

5130
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:26,880
we see more kinds of weaker objects and
 

5131
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,830
we see more kinds of weaker objects and
we do astronomy okay

5132
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:29,840
we do astronomy okay
 

5133
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,990
we do astronomy okay
we're very motivated to make a new

5134
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000
we're very motivated to make a new
 

5135
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,590
we're very motivated to make a new
instrument

5136
01:32:33,590 --> 01:32:33,600
instrument
 

5137
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,229
instrument
which will be a big step the next step

5138
01:32:36,229 --> 01:32:36,239
which will be a big step the next step
 

5139
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,149
which will be a big step the next step
like making a new kind of telescope or

5140
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:38,159
like making a new kind of telescope or
 

5141
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:39,189
like making a new kind of telescope or
something

5142
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:39,199
something
 

5143
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,030
something
and

5144
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:41,040
and
 

5145
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,950
and
the ideas of what that instrument should

5146
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:42,960
the ideas of what that instrument should
 

5147
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,390
the ideas of what that instrument should
be uh

5148
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:44,400
be uh
 

5149
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,229
be uh
haven't converged yet there's different

5150
01:32:46,229 --> 01:32:46,239
haven't converged yet there's different
 

5151
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,149
haven't converged yet there's different
ideas in europe they've done more work

5152
01:32:48,149 --> 01:32:48,159
ideas in europe they've done more work
 

5153
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:51,430
ideas in europe they've done more work
to kind of

5154
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:51,440

 

5155
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,430

develop the ideas

5156
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:53,440
develop the ideas
 

5157
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,270
develop the ideas
but they're different from ours and we

5158
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:55,280
but they're different from ours and we
 

5159
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,550
but they're different from ours and we
have ideas

5160
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:56,560
have ideas
 

5161
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,350
have ideas
so

5162
01:32:57,350 --> 01:32:57,360
so
 

5163
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,870
so
but i think over the next few years

5164
01:32:58,870 --> 01:32:58,880
but i think over the next few years
 

5165
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,950
but i think over the next few years
we'll develop those

5166
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:00,960
we'll develop those
 

5167
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,629
we'll develop those
the idea is to make an instrument that's

5168
01:33:02,629 --> 01:33:02,639
the idea is to make an instrument that's
 

5169
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:04,629
the idea is to make an instrument that's
at least 10 times better than what we

5170
01:33:04,629 --> 01:33:04,639
at least 10 times better than what we
 

5171
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:05,830
at least 10 times better than what we
have

5172
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:05,840
have
 

5173
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,750
have
what we can do with this instrument 10

5174
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:07,760
what we can do with this instrument 10
 

5175
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,350
what we can do with this instrument 10
times better than that

5176
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
times better than that
 

5177
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,830
times better than that
10 times better means you can look 10

5178
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:11,840
10 times better means you can look 10
 

5179
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,070
10 times better means you can look 10
times further out

5180
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,080
times further out
 

5181
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,709
times further out
10 times further out is a thousand times

5182
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:16,719
10 times further out is a thousand times
 

5183
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:18,070
10 times further out is a thousand times
more volume

5184
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:18,080
more volume
 

5185
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,870
more volume
so you're seeing much much more of the

5186
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:20,880
so you're seeing much much more of the
 

5187
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,750
so you're seeing much much more of the
universe the big change

5188
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:23,760
universe the big change
 

5189
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,550
universe the big change
is

5190
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,560
is
 

5191
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,790
is
that if you can see far out you far you

5192
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:26,800
that if you can see far out you far you
 

5193
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,950
that if you can see far out you far you
see further back in history yeah you're

5194
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:28,960
see further back in history yeah you're
 

5195
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,550
see further back in history yeah you're
traveling back in time

5196
01:33:30,550 --> 01:33:30,560
traveling back in time
 

5197
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:32,390
traveling back in time
yeah and so

5198
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:32,400
yeah and so
 

5199
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,470
yeah and so
we can start to do what we call

5200
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,480
we can start to do what we call
 

5201
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,590
we can start to do what we call
cosmology instead of a astronomy or

5202
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:37,600
cosmology instead of a astronomy or
 

5203
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,189
cosmology instead of a astronomy or
astrophysics

5204
01:33:39,189 --> 01:33:39,199
astrophysics
 

5205
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:41,510
astrophysics
cosmology is really the study of the

5206
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:41,520
cosmology is really the study of the
 

5207
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,350
cosmology is really the study of the
evolution of the

5208
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:43,360
evolution of the
 

5209
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,790
evolution of the
oh interesting yeah yeah and uh so then

5210
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:46,800
oh interesting yeah yeah and uh so then
 

5211
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,550
oh interesting yeah yeah and uh so then
you can start to hope to get to the

5212
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:50,560
you can start to hope to get to the
 

5213
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,910
you can start to hope to get to the
important problems having to do with uh

5214
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:53,920
important problems having to do with uh
 

5215
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:54,709
important problems having to do with uh
how

5216
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:54,719
how
 

5217
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:57,669
how
the universe began how it evolved and so

5218
01:33:57,669 --> 01:33:57,679
the universe began how it evolved and so
 

5219
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,149
the universe began how it evolved and so
forth which we really

5220
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,159
forth which we really
 

5221
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:02,149
forth which we really
only study now with

5222
01:34:02,149 --> 01:34:02,159
only study now with
 

5223
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:03,669
only study now with
optical

5224
01:34:03,669 --> 01:34:03,679
optical
 

5225
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:06,310
optical
instruments or

5226
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:06,320
instruments or
 

5227
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,229
instruments or
electromagnetic waves

5228
01:34:08,229 --> 01:34:08,239
electromagnetic waves
 

5229
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:11,350
electromagnetic waves
and early in the universe those were

5230
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,360
and early in the universe those were
 

5231
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,030
and early in the universe those were
blocked because

5232
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,040
blocked because
 

5233
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,750
blocked because
basically it wasn't transparent so the

5234
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:15,760
basically it wasn't transparent so the
 

5235
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,669
basically it wasn't transparent so the
photons couldn't get out

5236
01:34:17,669 --> 01:34:17,679
photons couldn't get out
 

5237
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:19,990
photons couldn't get out
when everything was too dense what do

5238
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:20,000
when everything was too dense what do
 

5239
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,910
when everything was too dense what do
you think sorry on this tangent what do

5240
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:21,920
you think sorry on this tangent what do
 

5241
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:23,590
you think sorry on this tangent what do
you think an understanding of

5242
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:23,600
you think an understanding of
 

5243
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:25,350
you think an understanding of
gravitational waves from earlier in the

5244
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:25,360
gravitational waves from earlier in the
 

5245
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,189
gravitational waves from earlier in the
universe can help us understand about

5246
01:34:27,189 --> 01:34:27,199
universe can help us understand about
 

5247
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,030
universe can help us understand about
the big bang and all that stuff yeah

5248
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:29,040
the big bang and all that stuff yeah
 

5249
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:32,629
the big bang and all that stuff yeah
that's that's so but it's a non

5250
01:34:32,629 --> 01:34:32,639
that's that's so but it's a non
 

5251
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:33,990
that's that's so but it's a non
it's a it's a

5252
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,000
it's a it's a
 

5253
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,070
it's a it's a
it's another perspective on the thing is

5254
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:36,080
it's another perspective on the thing is
 

5255
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,669
it's another perspective on the thing is
is there some insights you think could

5256
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
is there some insights you think could
 

5257
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,669
is there some insights you think could
be revealed just to

5258
01:34:39,669 --> 01:34:39,679
be revealed just to
 

5259
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,229
be revealed just to
help a layman understand sure first we

5260
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:42,239
help a layman understand sure first we
 

5261
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:43,750
help a layman understand sure first we
don't understand we use the word big

5262
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:43,760
don't understand we use the word big
 

5263
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,910
don't understand we use the word big
bang we don't understand the physics of

5264
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:45,920
bang we don't understand the physics of
 

5265
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:48,709
bang we don't understand the physics of
what the big bang itself was

5266
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:48,719
what the big bang itself was
 

5267
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:50,229
what the big bang itself was
uh

5268
01:34:50,229 --> 01:34:50,239
uh
 

5269
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,070
uh
so i think

5270
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:52,080
so i think
 

5271
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,430
so i think
my my

5272
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:53,440
my my
 

5273
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,669
my my
and in the early stage there were

5274
01:34:55,669 --> 01:34:55,679
and in the early stage there were
 

5275
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,669
and in the early stage there were
particles and there was a huge amount of

5276
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
particles and there was a huge amount of
 

5277
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:01,430
particles and there was a huge amount of
gravity and mass being made and so

5278
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:01,440
gravity and mass being made and so
 

5279
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,030
gravity and mass being made and so
uh

5280
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:03,040
uh
 

5281
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,629
uh
the big

5282
01:35:04,629 --> 01:35:04,639
the big
 

5283
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:07,590
the big
the so i'll say two things one is

5284
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:07,600
the so i'll say two things one is
 

5285
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,990
the so i'll say two things one is
how did it all start how did it happen

5286
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:10,000
how did it all start how did it happen
 

5287
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,990
how did it all start how did it happen
and i'll give you at least one example

5288
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:12,000
and i'll give you at least one example
 

5289
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,550
and i'll give you at least one example
that we don't understand what we should

5290
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:14,560
that we don't understand what we should
 

5291
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,669
that we don't understand what we should
understand

5292
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:15,679
understand
 

5293
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:17,590
understand
we don't know why we're here

5294
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:17,600
we don't know why we're here
 

5295
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,470
we don't know why we're here
yes

5296
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:18,480
yes
 

5297
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,390
yes
no we do not

5298
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:20,400
no we do not
 

5299
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,870
no we do not
i don't mean it philosophically

5300
01:35:22,870 --> 01:35:22,880
i don't mean it philosophically
 

5301
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,910
i don't mean it philosophically
i mean in terms of physics okay

5302
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:25,920
i mean in terms of physics okay
 

5303
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,750
i mean in terms of physics okay
now what do i mean by that if i go into

5304
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:27,760
now what do i mean by that if i go into
 

5305
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,709
now what do i mean by that if i go into
my laboratory at cern or somewhere and i

5306
01:35:30,709 --> 01:35:30,719
my laboratory at cern or somewhere and i
 

5307
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:32,870
my laboratory at cern or somewhere and i
collide particles together put energy

5308
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:32,880
collide particles together put energy
 

5309
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,510
collide particles together put energy
together i make as much antimatter as

5310
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:35,520
together i make as much antimatter as
 

5311
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,750
together i make as much antimatter as
matter right

5312
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
matter right
 

5313
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,550
matter right
antimatter then annihilates matter and

5314
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:40,560
antimatter then annihilates matter and
 

5315
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,470
antimatter then annihilates matter and
makes energy so

5316
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:42,480
makes energy so
 

5317
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,790
makes energy so
in the early universe there

5318
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,800
in the early universe there
 

5319
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,030
in the early universe there
you made somehow

5320
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:47,040
you made somehow
 

5321
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,550
you made somehow
somehow

5322
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:48,560
somehow
 

5323
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,030
somehow
a lot of matter and anti-matter but

5324
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:51,040
a lot of matter and anti-matter but
 

5325
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,510
a lot of matter and anti-matter but
there was an asymmetry somehow there was

5326
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:53,520
there was an asymmetry somehow there was
 

5327
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,510
there was an asymmetry somehow there was
more matter and anti-matter

5328
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:55,520
more matter and anti-matter
 

5329
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,669
more matter and anti-matter
that matter and anti-minor annihilated

5330
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:57,679
that matter and anti-minor annihilated
 

5331
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:59,510
that matter and anti-minor annihilated
each other at least that's what we think

5332
01:35:59,510 --> 01:35:59,520
each other at least that's what we think
 

5333
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,669
each other at least that's what we think
and there was matt only matter left over

5334
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:01,679
and there was matt only matter left over
 

5335
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:04,070
and there was matt only matter left over
and we live in a universe that we see

5336
01:36:04,070 --> 01:36:04,080
and we live in a universe that we see
 

5337
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,830
and we live in a universe that we see
that's all matter

5338
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:05,840
that's all matter
 

5339
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,149
that's all matter
we don't have any idea we have an ideas

5340
01:36:08,149 --> 01:36:08,159
we don't have any idea we have an ideas
 

5341
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:09,750
we don't have any idea we have an ideas
but we don't have any

5342
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:09,760
but we don't have any
 

5343
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,149
but we don't have any
we don't have any way to understand that

5344
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:12,159
we don't have any way to understand that
 

5345
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:13,990
we don't have any way to understand that
at the present time with the physics

5346
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:14,000
at the present time with the physics
 

5347
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,189
at the present time with the physics
that we know

5348
01:36:15,189 --> 01:36:15,199
that we know
 

5349
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:17,350
that we know
can ask a dumb question does

5350
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,360
can ask a dumb question does
 

5351
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,189
can ask a dumb question does
anti-matter

5352
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:19,199
anti-matter
 

5353
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:21,830
anti-matter
have anything like a gravitational field

5354
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:21,840
have anything like a gravitational field
 

5355
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,870
have anything like a gravitational field
to uh send signals

5356
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:24,880
to uh send signals
 

5357
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:26,070
to uh send signals
so

5358
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:26,080
so
 

5359
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,030
so
how how does this asymmetry of matter

5360
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
how how does this asymmetry of matter
 

5361
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,310
how how does this asymmetry of matter
anti-matter

5362
01:36:30,310 --> 01:36:30,320
anti-matter
 

5363
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,870
anti-matter
could be investigated or further

5364
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:32,880
could be investigated or further
 

5365
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,950
could be investigated or further
understood by observing gravitational

5366
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:34,960
understood by observing gravitational
 

5367
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:36,790
understood by observing gravitational
fields or weirdnesses in gravitational

5368
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:36,800
fields or weirdnesses in gravitational
 

5369
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,990
fields or weirdnesses in gravitational
fields i i think that

5370
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:40,000
fields i i think that
 

5371
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,910
fields i i think that
in principle if there were you know

5372
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:43,920
in principle if there were you know
 

5373
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,990
in principle if there were you know
anti-neutron stars instead of just

5374
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:46,000
anti-neutron stars instead of just
 

5375
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,470
anti-neutron stars instead of just
neutron stars we would see

5376
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:48,480
neutron stars we would see
 

5377
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,629
neutron stars we would see
different kinds of signals but

5378
01:36:50,629 --> 01:36:50,639
different kinds of signals but
 

5379
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,709
different kinds of signals but
it didn't get to that it's we live in a

5380
01:36:52,709 --> 01:36:52,719
it didn't get to that it's we live in a
 

5381
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:55,030
it didn't get to that it's we live in a
universe that we've done enough looking

5382
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:55,040
universe that we've done enough looking
 

5383
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,950
universe that we've done enough looking
because we don't see anti-pro matter

5384
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:56,960
because we don't see anti-pro matter
 

5385
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,030
because we don't see anti-pro matter
anti-protons anywhere no matter what we

5386
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,040
anti-protons anywhere no matter what we
 

5387
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,990
anti-protons anywhere no matter what we
look at that it's all made out of matter

5388
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:02,000
look at that it's all made out of matter
 

5389
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,990
look at that it's all made out of matter
there is no antimatter except we go in

5390
01:37:03,990 --> 01:37:04,000
there is no antimatter except we go in
 

5391
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,390
there is no antimatter except we go in
our laboratories

5392
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:06,400
our laboratories
 

5393
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,590
our laboratories
so

5394
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:07,600
so
 

5395
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,270
so
but when we go in our laboratories we

5396
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:09,280
but when we go in our laboratories we
 

5397
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,510
but when we go in our laboratories we
make as much antimatter as matter so

5398
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:11,520
make as much antimatter as matter so
 

5399
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,709
make as much antimatter as matter so
there's something about the early

5400
01:37:12,709 --> 01:37:12,719
there's something about the early
 

5401
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:14,470
there's something about the early
universe that made this

5402
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:14,480
universe that made this
 

5403
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:16,870
universe that made this
asymmetry so we can't even explain why

5404
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:16,880
asymmetry so we can't even explain why
 

5405
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,510
asymmetry so we can't even explain why
we're here that's what i meant yeah

5406
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:19,520
we're here that's what i meant yeah
 

5407
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:22,390
we're here that's what i meant yeah
physic physics-wise not you know

5408
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:22,400
physic physics-wise not you know
 

5409
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,470
physic physics-wise not you know
uh not in terms of

5410
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:24,480
uh not in terms of
 

5411
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,149
uh not in terms of
how we evolved and all that kind of

5412
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:26,159
how we evolved and all that kind of
 

5413
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:29,030
how we evolved and all that kind of
stuff so uh so there might be

5414
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:29,040
stuff so uh so there might be
 

5415
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:32,550
stuff so uh so there might be
inklings of uh

5416
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:32,560

 

5417
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,390

of some of the physics

5418
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:34,400
of some of the physics
 

5419
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,629
of some of the physics
that uh gravitational so so

5420
01:37:36,629 --> 01:37:36,639
that uh gravitational so so
 

5421
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:39,030
that uh gravitational so so
gravitational waves don't get obstructed

5422
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:39,040
gravitational waves don't get obstructed
 

5423
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:41,430
gravitational waves don't get obstructed
like light so i said light only goes to

5424
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:41,440
like light so i said light only goes to
 

5425
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,669
like light so i said light only goes to
300 000 years so it goes back to the

5426
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
300 000 years so it goes back to the
 

5427
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,669
300 000 years so it goes back to the
beginning so if you could study the

5428
01:37:45,669 --> 01:37:45,679
beginning so if you could study the
 

5429
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:47,510
beginning so if you could study the
early universe with gravitational waves

5430
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:47,520
early universe with gravitational waves
 

5431
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,350
early universe with gravitational waves
we can't do that yet

5432
01:37:49,350 --> 01:37:49,360
we can't do that yet
 

5433
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,790
we can't do that yet
then

5434
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,800
then
 

5435
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,629
then
it took 400 years to be able to do that

5436
01:37:52,629 --> 01:37:52,639
it took 400 years to be able to do that
 

5437
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:53,350
it took 400 years to be able to do that
with

5438
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:53,360
with
 

5439
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,189
with
optical but

5440
01:37:55,189 --> 01:37:55,199
optical but
 

5441
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:57,350
optical but
then you can really understand the very

5442
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:57,360
then you can really understand the very
 

5443
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:00,390
then you can really understand the very
maybe understand the very early universe

5444
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:00,400
maybe understand the very early universe
 

5445
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,270
maybe understand the very early universe
so in terms of uh

5446
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:03,280
so in terms of uh
 

5447
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,109
so in terms of uh
questions like

5448
01:38:05,109 --> 01:38:05,119
questions like
 

5449
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:07,750
questions like
why we're here or what the big bang was

5450
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:07,760
why we're here or what the big bang was
 

5451
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,030
why we're here or what the big bang was
um we should be we can in principle

5452
01:38:11,030 --> 01:38:11,040
um we should be we can in principle
 

5453
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,950
um we should be we can in principle
study that with gravitational waves so

5454
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:12,960
study that with gravitational waves so
 

5455
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,149
study that with gravitational waves so
to keep

5456
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:14,159
to keep
 

5457
01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:16,470
to keep
moving in this direction it's a unique

5458
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:16,480
moving in this direction it's a unique
 

5459
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,629
moving in this direction it's a unique
kind of uh way

5460
01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:18,639
kind of uh way
 

5461
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:20,790
kind of uh way
to understand our universe do you think

5462
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
to understand our universe do you think
 

5463
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,189
to understand our universe do you think
there's more nobel prize level ideas to

5464
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:23,199
there's more nobel prize level ideas to
 

5465
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:25,189
there's more nobel prize level ideas to
be discovered in relation to

5466
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:25,199
be discovered in relation to
 

5467
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,109
be discovered in relation to

i'd be shocked if their gravitational
 

5469
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:29,590
i'd be shocked if their gravitational
waves if there isn't uh not even going

5470
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:29,600

5471
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,270

to that which is a very long range

5472
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:31,280
to that which is a very long range
 

5473
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:32,390
to that which is a very long range
problem but

5474
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,400
problem but
 

5475
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,229
problem but
i think that

5476
01:38:34,229 --> 01:38:34,239
i think that
 

5477
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:35,350
i think that
we only

5478
01:38:35,350 --> 01:38:35,360
we only
 

5479
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,229
we only
see

5480
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239
see
 

5481
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,470
see
with electromagnetic waves four percent

5482
01:38:38,470 --> 01:38:38,480
with electromagnetic waves four percent
 

5483
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,830
with electromagnetic waves four percent
of what's out there

5484
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:41,840

 

5485
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,950

there must be we looked for things that

5486
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:44,960
there must be we looked for things that
 

5487
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:47,030
there must be we looked for things that
we knew should be there

5488
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,040
we knew should be there
 

5489
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,590

5491
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,550

i would be shocked if there wasn't

yeah
 

5513
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:19,910
yeah
is it

5514
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:19,920
is it
 

5515
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,910
is it
do you have a preference for

01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:21,920
do you have a preference for

5525
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:35,109
it's completely analogous to what's been
done in astronomy right so astronomy

5526
01:39:35,109 --> 01:39:35,119
done in astronomy right so astronomy
 

5527
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:37,270
done in astronomy right so astronomy
from the time of galileo

5528

from the time of galileo
 

5529
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:41,510
from the time of galileo
was done with uh visible light yeah

5530
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
was done with uh visible light yeah
 

5531
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,750

a strong the big advances in astronomy

5532
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:43,760
a strong the big advances in astronomy
 

5533
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,750
a strong the big advances in astronomy
in the last 50 years are because we have

5534
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:45,760
in the last 50 years are because we have
 

5535
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,910
in the last 50 years are because we have

01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,830
instruments that look at the infrared
microwave

5538
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:49,840
microwave
 

5539
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,390
microwave
ultraviolet and so forth so

5540
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:52,400
ultraviolet and so forth so
 

5541
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:54,390
ultraviolet and so forth so
looking at different wavelengths has

5542
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:54,400
looking at different wavelengths has
 

5543
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,629
looking at different wavelengths has
been important basically going into

5544
01:39:56,629 --> 01:39:56,639
been important basically going into
 

5545
01:39:56,639 --> 01:39:57,910
been important basically going into
space

5546
01:39:57,910 --> 01:39:57,920
space
 

5547
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,750
space
means that we'll look at instead of the

5548
01:39:59,750 --> 01:39:59,760
means that we'll look at instead of the
 

5549
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,310
means that we'll look at instead of the
audio band which we look at as we said

5550
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:02,320
audio band which we look at as we said
 

5551
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,229
audio band which we look at as we said
on the ear surface we'll look at lower

5552
01:40:04,229 --> 01:40:04,239
on the ear surface we'll look at lower
 

5553
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:06,470
on the ear surface we'll look at lower
frequencies it's so it's completely

5554
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:06,480
frequencies it's so it's completely
 

5555
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,870
frequencies it's so it's completely
complementary and it starts to be

5556
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:08,880
complementary and it starts to be
 

5557
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,950
complementary and it starts to be
looking at different frequencies just

5558
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:10,960
looking at different frequencies just
 

5559
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:14,310
looking at different frequencies just
like we do with astronomy isn't it

5560
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:14,320
like we do with astronomy isn't it
 

5561
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,070
like we do with astronomy isn't it
it seems almost incredible to me

5562
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:16,080
it seems almost incredible to me
 

5563
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,390
it seems almost incredible to me
engineering-wise just like on earth to

5564
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:18,400
engineering-wise just like on earth to
 

5565
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,750
engineering-wise just like on earth to
send something that's kilometers across

5566
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:21,760
send something that's kilometers across
 

5567
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,709
send something that's kilometers across
into uh into space is that is it harder

5568
01:40:24,709 --> 01:40:24,719
into uh into space is that is it harder
 

5569
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:25,990
into uh into space is that is it harder
to engineer

5570
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:26,000
to engineer
 

5571
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,390
to engineer
then it actually is a little different

5572
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:28,400
then it actually is a little different
 

5573
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:31,109
then it actually is a little different
it's three satellites

5574
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:31,119
it's three satellites
 

5575
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:33,030
it's three satellites
separated by hundreds of thousands of

5576
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:33,040
separated by hundreds of thousands of
 

5577
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,950
separated by hundreds of thousands of
kilometers

5578
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:34,960
kilometers
 

5579
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,270
kilometers
and they send a laser beam from one to

5580
01:40:37,270 --> 01:40:37,280
and they send a laser beam from one to
 

5581
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,229
and they send a laser beam from one to
the other

5582
01:40:38,229 --> 01:40:38,239
the other
 

5583
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:39,510
the other
and uh

5584
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:39,520
and uh
 

5585
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,790
and uh
if they

5586
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:40,800
if they
 

5587
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,950
if they
the distance if the triangle changes

5588
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:42,960
the distance if the triangle changes
 

5589
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,950
the distance if the triangle changes
shape a little bit they detect that from

5590
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:44,960
shape a little bit they detect that from
 

5591
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,470
shape a little bit they detect that from
the gravity the passage did you say

5592
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:46,480
the gravity the passage did you say
 

5593
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:49,350
the gravity the passage did you say
hundreds of thousands of kilometers yeah

5594
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:49,360
hundreds of thousands of kilometers yeah
 

5595
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,760
hundreds of thousands of kilometers yeah
sending lasers to each other

5596
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:51,770
sending lasers to each other
 

5597
01:40:51,770 --> 01:40:55,590
sending lasers to each other
[Laughter]

5598
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:55,600

 

5599
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,140

okay it's just engineering

5600
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:57,150
okay it's just engineering
 

5601
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:59,350
okay it's just engineering
[Laughter]

5602
01:40:59,350 --> 01:40:59,360
[Laughter]
 

5603
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:02,149
[Laughter]
uh is is possible though

5604
01:41:02,149 --> 01:41:02,159
uh is is possible though
 

5605
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:03,510
uh is is possible though
yes

5606
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:03,520
yes
 

5607
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,629
yes
okay

5608
01:41:06,629 --> 01:41:06,639

 

5609
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:08,790

uh that's that's just incredible because

5610
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:08,800
uh that's that's just incredible because
 

5611
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,390
uh that's that's just incredible because
they have to maintain i mean the

5612
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,400
they have to maintain i mean the
 

5613
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,550
they have to maintain i mean the
precision here is probably there there

5614
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:12,560
precision here is probably there there
 

5615
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,550
precision here is probably there there
might be some more what is it maybe

5616
01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:14,560
might be some more what is it maybe
 

5617
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:16,709
might be some more what is it maybe
noise is a smaller problem

5618
01:41:16,709 --> 01:41:16,719
noise is a smaller problem
 

5619
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:18,870
noise is a smaller problem
i guess there's no vibration to do

5620
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:18,880
i guess there's no vibration to do
 

5621
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,750
i guess there's no vibration to do
to worry about like seismic stuff

5622
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:21,760
to worry about like seismic stuff
 

5623
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,270
to worry about like seismic stuff
so getting away from earth maybe you get

5624
01:41:23,270 --> 01:41:23,280
so getting away from earth maybe you get
 

5625
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,030
so getting away from earth maybe you get
away from yeah those parts are easier

5626
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:25,040
away from yeah those parts are easier
 

5627
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:26,550
away from yeah those parts are easier
they don't have to measure it as

5628
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:26,560
they don't have to measure it as
 

5629
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,790
they don't have to measure it as
accurately at low frequencies

5630
01:41:28,790 --> 01:41:28,800
accurately at low frequencies
 

5631
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,149
accurately at low frequencies
uh but they have um a lot of tough

5632
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:32,159
uh but they have um a lot of tough
 

5633
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,550
uh but they have um a lot of tough
engineering problems the

5634
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:34,560
engineering problems the
 

5635
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,750
engineering problems the
the

5636
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:35,760
the
 

5637
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,950
the
in order to detect that the

5638
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:38,960
in order to detect that the
 

5639
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,669
in order to detect that the
the uh gravitational waves affect things

5640
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:41,679
the uh gravitational waves affect things
 

5641
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:42,550
the uh gravitational waves affect things
the

5642
01:41:42,550 --> 01:41:42,560
the
 

5643
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,790
the
sensors have to be what we call free

5644
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:44,800
sensors have to be what we call free
 

5645
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,270
sensors have to be what we call free
masses just like ours are isolated from

5646
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:47,280
masses just like ours are isolated from
 

5647
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,109
masses just like ours are isolated from
the earth they have to isolate it from

5648
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:49,119
the earth they have to isolate it from
 

5649
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,030
the earth they have to isolate it from
the satellite

5650
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:51,040
the satellite
 

5651
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,430
the satellite
and that's a hard problem they have to

5652
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:53,440
and that's a hard problem they have to
 

5653
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,109
and that's a hard problem they have to
do that pretty not as well as we have to

5654
01:41:55,109 --> 01:41:55,119
do that pretty not as well as we have to
 

5655
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:56,149
do that pretty not as well as we have to
do it but

5656
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
do it but
 

5657
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,070
do it but
very well and

5658
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:58,080
very well and
 

5659
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,310
very well and
they've done a test mission and the

5660
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:00,320
they've done a test mission and the
 

5661
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,470
they've done a test mission and the
engineering seems to be

5662
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,480
engineering seems to be
 

5663
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:05,270
engineering seems to be
at least in principle in hand

5664
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:05,280
at least in principle in hand
 

5665
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:07,109
at least in principle in hand
this will be in the twenty thirties

5666
01:42:07,109 --> 01:42:07,119
this will be in the twenty thirties
 

5667
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,590
this will be in the twenty thirties
twenty thirties yeah

5668
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600
twenty thirties yeah
 

5669
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,830
twenty thirties yeah
this is incredible this is uh

5670
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:11,840
this is incredible this is uh
 

5671
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,390
this is incredible this is uh
this is this is incredible uh

5672
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:14,400
this is this is incredible uh
 

5673
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,990
this is this is incredible uh
let me ask about black holes um yeah so

5674
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:18,000
let me ask about black holes um yeah so
 

5675
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,109
let me ask about black holes um yeah so
what we're talking about is observing

5676
01:42:21,109 --> 01:42:21,119
what we're talking about is observing
 

5677
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:22,950
what we're talking about is observing
uh

5678
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:22,960
uh
 

5679
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:24,709
uh
orbiting black holes

5680
01:42:24,709 --> 01:42:24,719
orbiting black holes
 

5681
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:27,270
orbiting black holes
uh that i get i saw the terminology of

5682
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:27,280
uh that i get i saw the terminology of
 

5683
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,750
uh that i get i saw the terminology of
like binary black hole systems

5684
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:29,760
like binary black hole systems
 

5685
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,350
like binary black hole systems
is that's that's when the the one that's

5686
01:42:31,350 --> 01:42:31,360
is that's that's when the the one that's
 

5687
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:32,790
is that's that's when the the one that's
when they're dancing

5688
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:32,800
when they're dancing
 

5689
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,790
when they're dancing
okay going around each other just like

5690
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:34,800
okay going around each other just like
 

5691
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,790
okay going around each other just like
the earth around the sun okay is that

5692
01:42:36,790 --> 01:42:36,800
the earth around the sun okay is that
 

5693
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,709
the earth around the sun okay is that
weird that there's black holes going

5694
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:38,719
weird that there's black holes going
 

5695
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,070
weird that there's black holes going
around each other

5696
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:40,080
around each other
 

5697
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:42,950
around each other
so the finding binary systems of stars

5698
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:42,960
so the finding binary systems of stars
 

5699
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,270
so the finding binary systems of stars
is similar to finding binary systems of

5700
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:45,280
is similar to finding binary systems of
 

5701
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,229
is similar to finding binary systems of
uh black holes well they were once stars

5702
01:42:48,229 --> 01:42:48,239
uh black holes well they were once stars
 

5703
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:48,950
uh black holes well they were once stars
so

5704
01:42:48,950 --> 01:42:48,960
so
 

5705
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,189
so
um

5706
01:42:51,189 --> 01:42:51,199
um
 

5707
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,149
um
so

5708
01:42:52,149 --> 01:42:52,159
so
 

5709
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:53,430
so
we haven't

5710
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:53,440
we haven't
 

5711
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,030
we haven't
said what what a black hole is

5712
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:55,040
said what what a black hole is
 

5713
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,629
said what what a black hole is
physically yet yeah so what's a black

5714
01:42:56,629 --> 01:42:56,639
physically yet yeah so what's a black
 

5715
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:57,669
physically yet yeah so what's a black
hole so

5716
01:42:57,669 --> 01:42:57,679
hole so
 

5717
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:59,830
hole so
black hole is a is first it's a

5718
01:42:59,830 --> 01:42:59,840
black hole is a is first it's a
 

5719
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,990
black hole is a is first it's a
mathematical concept or a physical

5720
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,000
mathematical concept or a physical
 

5721
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,830
mathematical concept or a physical
concept and that is

5722
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:03,840
concept and that is
 

5723
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,510
concept and that is
a region of space

5724
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:05,520
a region of space
 

5725
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:08,470
a region of space
so it's simply a region of space where

5726
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:08,480
so it's simply a region of space where
 

5727
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,030
so it's simply a region of space where
the curvature of space-time meaning the

5728
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:11,040
the curvature of space-time meaning the
 

5729
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,390
the curvature of space-time meaning the
gravitational field is so strong

5730
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:14,400
gravitational field is so strong
 

5731
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,870
gravitational field is so strong
that nothing can get out yeah

5732
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:16,880
that nothing can get out yeah
 

5733
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,950
that nothing can get out yeah
including light

5734
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:18,960
including light
 

5735
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:21,270
including light
and there's light gets bent

5736
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:21,280
and there's light gets bent
 

5737
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,070
and there's light gets bent
in gravitational if the gravitations if

5738
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:24,080
in gravitational if the gravitations if
 

5739
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:26,629
in gravitational if the gravitations if
the space time is warped enough and so

5740
01:43:26,629 --> 01:43:26,639
the space time is warped enough and so
 

5741
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,950
the space time is warped enough and so
even light gets bent around and stays in

5742
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:28,960
even light gets bent around and stays in
 

5743
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,510
even light gets bent around and stays in
it so that's concept of a black hole so

5744
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:31,520
it so that's concept of a black hole so
 

5745
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,109
it so that's concept of a black hole so
it's not a f

5746
01:43:33,109 --> 01:43:33,119
it's not a f
 

5747
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:35,830
it's not a f
and maybe you can make maybe it's a

5748
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:35,840
and maybe you can make maybe it's a
 

5749
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,669
and maybe you can make maybe it's a
that's a concept

5750
01:43:37,669 --> 01:43:37,679
that's a concept
 

5751
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:40,390
that's a concept
that didn't say how they come about

5752
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:40,400
that didn't say how they come about
 

5753
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,470
that didn't say how they come about
and there could be different ways they

5754
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:42,480
and there could be different ways they
 

5755
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:47,510
and there could be different ways they
come about the ones that we are seeing

5756
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:47,520
come about the ones that we are seeing
 

5757
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:50,149
come about the ones that we are seeing
there's a we're not sure

5758
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:50,159
there's a we're not sure
 

5759
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,750
there's a we're not sure
it's what we're trying to learn now is

5760
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:51,760
it's what we're trying to learn now is
 

5761
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,070
it's what we're trying to learn now is
what they but the general

5762
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:54,080
what they but the general
 

5763
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:55,669
what they but the general
expectation

5764
01:43:55,669 --> 01:43:55,679
expectation
 

5765
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:57,430
expectation
is that they come

5766
01:43:57,430 --> 01:43:57,440
is that they come
 

5767
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,070
is that they come
at the bl these black holes happen when

5768
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:00,080
at the bl these black holes happen when
 

5769
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,990
at the bl these black holes happen when
a star dies

5770
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:02,000
a star dies
 

5771
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,669
a star dies
so what does that mean that a star dies

5772
01:44:03,669 --> 01:44:03,679
so what does that mean that a star dies
 

5773
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:05,109
so what does that mean that a star dies
what happens

5774
01:44:05,109 --> 01:44:05,119
what happens
 

5775
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:08,870
what happens
a star like our sun

5776
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:08,880

 

5777
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:12,629

basically makes heat and light by fusion

5778
01:44:12,629 --> 01:44:12,639
basically makes heat and light by fusion
 

5779
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:13,910
basically makes heat and light by fusion
it's made of

5780
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:13,920
it's made of
 

5781
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,590
it's made of
and as it burns it burns up the hydrogen

5782
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:17,600
and as it burns it burns up the hydrogen
 

5783
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,669
and as it burns it burns up the hydrogen
and then the helium and then

5784
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:19,679
and then the helium and then
 

5785
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,070
and then the helium and then
and slowly works its way up to the

5786
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:22,080
and slowly works its way up to the
 

5787
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:24,390
and slowly works its way up to the
heavier and heavier elements that are in

5788
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:24,400
heavier and heavier elements that are in
 

5789
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,750
heavier and heavier elements that are in
the star

5790
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:25,760
the star
 

5791
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,310
the star
and when it gets up to iron the fusion

5792
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:28,320
and when it gets up to iron the fusion
 

5793
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,550
and when it gets up to iron the fusion
process doesn't work anymore

5794
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:30,560
process doesn't work anymore
 

5795
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,709
process doesn't work anymore
and so the stars die

5796
01:44:32,709 --> 01:44:32,719
and so the stars die
 

5797
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,390
and so the stars die
and that happens to stars and then they

5798
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:34,400
and that happens to stars and then they
 

5799
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,510
and that happens to stars and then they
do

5800
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:35,520
do
 

5801
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,830
do
what's called a supernova what happens

5802
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:37,840
what's called a supernova what happens
 

5803
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:38,629
what's called a supernova what happens
then

5804
01:44:38,629 --> 01:44:38,639
then
 

5805
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,870
then
is that a star is a delicate balance

5806
01:44:40,870 --> 01:44:40,880
is that a star is a delicate balance
 

5807
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,669
is that a star is a delicate balance
between an outward pressure from fusion

5808
01:44:43,669 --> 01:44:43,679
between an outward pressure from fusion
 

5809
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:44,709
between an outward pressure from fusion
and

5810
01:44:44,709 --> 01:44:44,719
and
 

5811
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,229
and
light and burning

5812
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:46,239
light and burning
 

5813
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:49,189
light and burning
and an inward pressure of gravity trying

5814
01:44:49,189 --> 01:44:49,199
and an inward pressure of gravity trying
 

5815
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:51,030
and an inward pressure of gravity trying
to pull the

5816
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:51,040
to pull the
 

5817
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:53,830
to pull the
masses together once it burns itself out

5818
01:44:53,830 --> 01:44:53,840
masses together once it burns itself out
 

5819
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:54,950
masses together once it burns itself out
it goes

5820
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:54,960
it goes
 

5821
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:57,669
it goes
and it collapses and that's a supernova

5822
01:44:57,669 --> 01:44:57,679
and it collapses and that's a supernova
 

5823
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:00,310
and it collapses and that's a supernova
when it collapses all the mass that was

5824
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:00,320
when it collapses all the mass that was
 

5825
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,629
when it collapses all the mass that was
there is in a very much smaller

5826
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:02,639
there is in a very much smaller
 

5827
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:03,830
there is in a very much smaller
space

5828
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:03,840
space
 

5829
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:07,350
space
and if a star if you do the calculations

5830
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:07,360
and if a star if you do the calculations
 

5831
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,430
and if a star if you do the calculations
if a star is big enough

5832
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:09,440
if a star is big enough
 

5833
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:11,669
if a star is big enough
that can create a strong enough

5834
01:45:11,669 --> 01:45:11,679
that can create a strong enough
 

5835
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:15,189
that can create a strong enough
gravitational field to make a black hole

5836
01:45:15,189 --> 01:45:15,199
gravitational field to make a black hole
 

5837
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:17,109
gravitational field to make a black hole
our sun won't

5838
01:45:17,109 --> 01:45:17,119
our sun won't
 

5839
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:19,109
our sun won't
it's too small too small

5840
01:45:19,109 --> 01:45:19,119
it's too small too small
 

5841
01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:21,590
it's too small too small
and we don't know exactly

5842
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:21,600
and we don't know exactly
 

5843
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,709
and we don't know exactly
what it but it's usually thought that a

5844
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:24,719
what it but it's usually thought that a
 

5845
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:27,669
what it but it's usually thought that a
star has to be at least three times

5846
01:45:27,669 --> 01:45:27,679
star has to be at least three times
 

5847
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:29,590
star has to be at least three times
as big as our sun

5848
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:29,600
as big as our sun
 

5849
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,950
as big as our sun
to make a black hole but that's the

5850
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:30,960
to make a black hole but that's the
 

5851
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,950
to make a black hole but that's the
physical way there you can make black

5852
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:32,960
physical way there you can make black
 

5853
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:33,830
physical way there you can make black
holes

5854
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:33,840
holes
 

5855
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,990
holes
that's the first um

5856
01:45:37,990 --> 01:45:38,000

 

5857
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,390

explanation that one would give for the

5858
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:40,400
explanation that one would give for the
 

5859
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,830
explanation that one would give for the
for what we see

5860
01:45:41,830 --> 01:45:41,840
for what we see
 

5861
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:44,550
for what we see
but it's not necessarily true we're not

5862
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:44,560
but it's not necessarily true we're not
 

5863
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:47,109
but it's not necessarily true we're not
sure yet what we see in terms of for the

5864
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:47,119
sure yet what we see in terms of for the
 

5865
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:49,189
sure yet what we see in terms of for the
origins of black holes no the black

5866
01:45:49,189 --> 01:45:49,199
origins of black holes no the black
 

5867
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:50,950
origins of black holes no the black
holes that we see

5868
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:50,960
holes that we see
 

5869
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:53,109
holes that we see
in gravitational waves so the but you're

5870
01:45:53,109 --> 01:45:53,119
in gravitational waves so the but you're
 

5871
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:55,510
in gravitational waves so the but you're
also looking for the ones who are binary

5872
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:55,520
also looking for the ones who are binary
 

5873
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:57,910
also looking for the ones who are binary
solar systems like so they're binary

5874
01:45:57,910 --> 01:45:57,920
solar systems like so they're binary
 

5875
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,750
solar systems like so they're binary
systems but they could have been made

5876
01:45:59,750 --> 01:45:59,760
systems but they could have been made
 

5877
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,750
systems but they could have been made
from binary stars so there's binary

5878
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:01,760
from binary stars so there's binary
 

5879
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,590
from binary stars so there's binary
stars around so that's

5880
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:03,600
stars around so that's
 

5881
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,430
stars around so that's
that's so so that's so this first

5882
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:05,440
that's so so that's so this first
 

5883
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,510
that's so so that's so this first
explanation is that that's what they are

5884
01:46:07,510 --> 01:46:07,520
explanation is that that's what they are
 

5885
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,750
explanation is that that's what they are
gotcha um

5886
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:09,760
gotcha um
 

5887
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:11,350
gotcha um
other

5888
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:11,360
other
 

5889
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:13,830
other
explanati but but what we see

5890
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:13,840
explanati but but what we see
 

5891
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,910
explanati but but what we see
has some puzzles this is kind of the way

5892
01:46:15,910 --> 01:46:15,920
has some puzzles this is kind of the way
 

5893
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,270
has some puzzles this is kind of the way
science works i guess yeah um

5894
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,280
science works i guess yeah um
 

5895
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:20,470
science works i guess yeah um
we see

5896
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:20,480
we see
 

5897
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:22,550
we see
heavier ones

5898
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:22,560
heavier ones
 

5899
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:23,750
heavier ones
than

5900
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:23,760
than
 

5901
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:25,109
than
up to

5902
01:46:25,109 --> 01:46:25,119
up to
 

5903
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:28,709
up to
we've seen one system that was 140 times

5904
01:46:28,709 --> 01:46:28,719
we've seen one system that was 140 times
 

5905
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:31,830
we've seen one system that was 140 times
the mass of our own sun

5906
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:31,840
the mass of our own sun
 

5907
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,950
the mass of our own sun
that's not believed to be possible

5908
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:34,960
that's not believed to be possible
 

5909
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,709
that's not believed to be possible
with the

5910
01:46:36,709 --> 01:46:36,719
with the
 

5911
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:39,750
with the
parent being a big star because big

5912
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:39,760
parent being a big star because big
 

5913
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,310
parent being a big star because big
stars can only be so big

5914
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:42,320
stars can only be so big
 

5915
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:47,109
stars can only be so big
uh or they uh are unstable it's just the

5916
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:47,119
uh or they uh are unstable it's just the
 

5917
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:48,550
uh or they uh are unstable it's just the
the fact that they live in an

5918
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:48,560
the fact that they live in an
 

5919
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,189
the fact that they live in an
environment that makes them unstable

5920
01:46:51,189 --> 01:46:51,199
environment that makes them unstable
 

5921
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:52,149
environment that makes them unstable
so

5922
01:46:52,149 --> 01:46:52,159
so
 

5923
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:53,830
so
uh the fact that we see bigger ones they

5924
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:53,840
uh the fact that we see bigger ones they
 

5925
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:54,790
uh the fact that we see bigger ones they
maybe

5926
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:54,800
maybe
 

5927
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:57,430
maybe
come from something else it's possible

5928
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:57,440
come from something else it's possible
 

5929
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,590
come from something else it's possible
that they were

5930
01:46:59,590 --> 01:46:59,600
that they were
 

5931
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:02,629
that they were
uh made in a different way by

5932
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:02,639
uh made in a different way by
 

5933
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:04,470
uh made in a different way by
little ones eating each other up or

5934
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:04,480
little ones eating each other up or
 

5935
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:06,229
little ones eating each other up or
maybe they were made

5936
01:47:06,229 --> 01:47:06,239
maybe they were made
 

5937
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:09,430
maybe they were made
or maybe they came with the big bang the

5938
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:09,440
or maybe they came with the big bang the
 

5939
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,590
or maybe they came with the big bang the
prime what we call primordial which

5940
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:11,600
prime what we call primordial which
 

5941
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,270
prime what we call primordial which
means they're really different they came

5942
01:47:13,270 --> 01:47:13,280
means they're really different they came
 

5943
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,750
means they're really different they came
from that we don't know at this point if

5944
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:15,760
from that we don't know at this point if
 

5945
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,590
from that we don't know at this point if
they came with a big bang then maybe

5946
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:17,600
they came with a big bang then maybe
 

5947
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:19,030
they came with a big bang then maybe
they account for

5948
01:47:19,030 --> 01:47:19,040
they account for
 

5949
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:21,590
they account for
what we call dark matter or some of it

5950
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:21,600
what we call dark matter or some of it
 

5951
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,189
what we call dark matter or some of it
like there was a lot of them if they

5952
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:23,199
like there was a lot of them if they
 

5953
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:25,030
like there was a lot of them if they
came with them and yeah because there's

5954
01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:25,040
came with them and yeah because there's
 

5955
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,350
came with them and yeah because there's
a lot of dark matter yeah

5956
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:27,360
a lot of dark matter yeah
 

5957
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,830
a lot of dark matter yeah
but uh will gravitational waves give you

5958
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:29,840
but uh will gravitational waves give you
 

5959
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,870
but uh will gravitational waves give you
any kind of an um intuition about the

5960
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:32,880
any kind of an um intuition about the
 

5961
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,709
any kind of an um intuition about the
origin of these oscillators we think

5962
01:47:34,709 --> 01:47:34,719
origin of these oscillators we think
 

5963
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:37,750
origin of these oscillators we think
that if we see um the distributions

5964
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:37,760
that if we see um the distributions
 

5965
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:39,350
that if we see um the distributions
enough of them the distributions of

5966
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:39,360
enough of them the distributions of
 

5967
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,310
enough of them the distributions of
their

5968
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,320
their
 

5969
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,470
their
masses the distributions of their how

5970
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:42,480
masses the distributions of their how
 

5971
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:44,390
masses the distributions of their how
they're spinning so we can actually

5972
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:44,400
they're spinning so we can actually
 

5973
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,310
they're spinning so we can actually
measure when they're going around each

5974
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:46,320
measure when they're going around each
 

5975
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,189
measure when they're going around each
other

5976
01:47:47,189 --> 01:47:47,199
other
 

5977
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:48,709
other
whether they're spinning

5978
01:47:48,709 --> 01:47:48,719
whether they're spinning
 

5979
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:50,950
whether they're spinning
you know like this direction of the spin

5980
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:50,960
you know like this direction of the spin
 

5981
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:52,870
you know like this direction of the spin
or no the orientation whether the whole

5982
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:52,880
or no the orientation whether the whole
 

5983
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,629
or no the orientation whether the whole
system has any

5984
01:47:54,629 --> 01:47:54,639
system has any
 

5985
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:55,669
system has any
wobbles

5986
01:47:55,669 --> 01:47:55,679
wobbles
 

5987
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:57,109
wobbles
what

5988
01:47:57,109 --> 01:47:57,119
what
 

5989
01:47:57,119 --> 01:48:00,390
what
so this is this is now okay

5990
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:00,400
so this is this is now okay
 

5991
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:01,830
so this is this is now okay
we're doing that and then you're

5992
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:01,840
we're doing that and then you're
 

5993
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:03,830
we're doing that and then you're
constantly kind of crawling back and

5994
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:03,840
constantly kind of crawling back and
 

5995
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:05,590
constantly kind of crawling back and
back into and we're crawling back in

5996
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:05,600
back into and we're crawling back in
 

5997
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,830
back into and we're crawling back in
time and seeing how many there are as we

5998
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:07,840
time and seeing how many there are as we
 

5999
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,629
time and seeing how many there are as we
go back and so do they point back so

6000
01:48:10,629 --> 01:48:10,639
go back and so do they point back so
 

6001
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,629
go back and so do they point back so
you're like uh what is that discipline

6002
01:48:12,629 --> 01:48:12,639
you're like uh what is that discipline
 

6003
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:14,149
you're like uh what is that discipline
called cartography or something you're

6004
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:14,159
called cartography or something you're
 

6005
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:15,830
called cartography or something you're
like mapping

6006
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:15,840
like mapping
 

6007
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,790
like mapping
this the early universe

6008
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:18,800
this the early universe
 

6009
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,430
this the early universe
via the lens of gravitational

6010
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:21,440
via the lens of gravitational
 

6011
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:23,350
via the lens of gravitational
waves not yet the early universe but at

6012
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:23,360
waves not yet the early universe but at
 

6013
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,590
waves not yet the early universe but at
least back and forth earlier yeah right

6014
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:25,600
least back and forth earlier yeah right
 

6015
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:26,550
least back and forth earlier yeah right
so

6016
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:26,560
so
 

6017
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,149
so
um

6018
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:28,159
um
 

6019
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:30,229
um
so black holes are this

6020
01:48:30,229 --> 01:48:30,239
so black holes are this
 

6021
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:32,229
so black holes are this
mathematical phenomenon but they come

6022
01:48:32,229 --> 01:48:32,239
mathematical phenomenon but they come
 

6023
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:34,149
mathematical phenomenon but they come
about in different ways we have a huge

6024
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:34,159
about in different ways we have a huge
 

6025
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:35,270
about in different ways we have a huge
black hole

6026

galaxies
 

6031
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,709
galaxies
those probably were made some other way

6032
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:40,719
those probably were made some other way
 

6033
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:42,310
those probably were made some other way
we don't know when the galaxies

6034
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:42,320
we don't know when the galaxies
 

6035
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,430
we don't know when the galaxies
themselves

01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440
themselves
 

6037
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,430
themselves
had to do with the formation of galaxies

6038
01:48:45,430 --> 01:48:45,440
had to do with the formation of galaxies
 

6039
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,310
had to do with the formation of galaxies
we we don't really know so the fact that

6040
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:48,320
we we don't really know so the fact that
 

6041
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,229
we we don't really know so the fact that
we use the word black hole

6042
01:48:50,229 --> 01:48:50,239
we use the word black hole
 

6043
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:52,229
we use the word black hole
the origin of black holes might be quite

6044
01:48:52,229 --> 01:48:52,239
the origin of black holes might be quite
 

6045
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:54,390
the origin of black holes might be quite
different depending on

01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:54,400
different depending on
 

6047
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,910
different depending on
how they happen

how they happen
 

6049
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,350
how they happen
they just have to in the end have a

01:48:57,350 --> 01:48:57,360
they just have to in the end have a
 

6051
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,510
they just have to in the end have a
gravitational field that will bend

6052
01:48:59,510 --> 01:48:59,520
gravitational field that will bend
 

6053
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,189
gravitational field that will bend
everything in

01:49:01,189 --> 01:49:01,199
everything in
 

6055
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:03,109
everything in
how do you feel about black holes as a

6056
01:49:03,109 --> 01:49:03,119
how do you feel about black holes as a
 

6057
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:05,270
how do you feel about black holes as a
human being there's a there's this thing

6058
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:05,280
human being there's a there's this thing
 

6059
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,149
human being there's a there's this thing
that's

6060
01:49:06,149 --> 01:49:06,159
that's
 

6061
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,790
that's
nearly infinitely dense can

6062
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:08,800
nearly infinitely dense can
 

6063
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,070
nearly infinitely dense can
doesn't let like light escape

6064
01:49:12,070 --> 01:49:12,080
doesn't let like light escape
 

6065
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,669
doesn't let like light escape
isn't that kind of terrifying feels like

6066
01:49:13,669 --> 01:49:13,679
isn't that kind of terrifying feels like
 

6067
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:15,990
isn't that kind of terrifying feels like
the stuff in nightmares i think i think

6068
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:16,000
the stuff in nightmares i think i think
 

6069
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,629
the stuff in nightmares i think i think
it's it's an opportunity

6070
01:49:18,629 --> 01:49:18,639
it's it's an opportunity
 

6071
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:21,350
it's it's an opportunity
to to do what exactly

6072
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:21,360
to to do what exactly
 

6073
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,870
to to do what exactly
so uh

6074
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:22,880
so uh
 

6075
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,310
so uh
like the early universe is an

6076
01:49:24,310 --> 01:49:24,320
like the early universe is an
 

6077
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,070
like the early universe is an
opportunity if i we can study the early

6078
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:26,080
opportunity if i we can study the early
 

6079
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:28,070
opportunity if i we can study the early
universe we can learn things like i told

6080
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:28,080
universe we can learn things like i told
 

6081
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,229
universe we can learn things like i told
you and here again

6082
01:49:30,229 --> 01:49:30,239
you and here again
 

6083
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:32,229
you and here again
we have an embarrassing situation in

6084
01:49:32,229 --> 01:49:32,239
we have an embarrassing situation in
 

6085
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:33,990
we have an embarrassing situation in
physics yes

6086
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:34,000
physics yes
 

6087
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,229
physics yes
we have two wonderful theories of

6088
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:36,239
we have two wonderful theories of
 

6089
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:37,830
we have two wonderful theories of
physics

6090
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:37,840
physics
 

6091
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:40,149
physics
one based on quantum mechanics

6092
01:49:40,149 --> 01:49:40,159
one based on quantum mechanics
 

6093
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:42,470
one based on quantum mechanics
quantum field theory and

6094
01:49:42,470 --> 01:49:42,480
quantum field theory and
 

6095
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,870
quantum field theory and
we can go to a big accelerator like at

6096
01:49:44,870 --> 01:49:44,880
we can go to a big accelerator like at
 

6097
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,589
we can go to a big accelerator like at
cern and smash particles together and

6098
01:49:47,589 --> 01:49:47,599
cern and smash particles together and
 

6099
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,310
cern and smash particles together and
almost explain anything that happens

6100
01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:50,320
almost explain anything that happens
 

6101
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,709
almost explain anything that happens
beautifully using quantum field theory

6102
01:49:52,709 --> 01:49:52,719
beautifully using quantum field theory
 

6103
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:54,629
beautifully using quantum field theory
and quantum mechanics

6104
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:54,639
and quantum mechanics
 

6105
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:56,709
and quantum mechanics
then we have another theory of physics

6106
01:49:56,709 --> 01:49:56,719
then we have another theory of physics
 

6107
01:49:56,719 --> 01:49:58,470
then we have another theory of physics
called general relativity which is what

6108
01:49:58,470 --> 01:49:58,480
called general relativity which is what
 

6109
01:49:58,480 --> 01:49:59,830
called general relativity which is what
we've been talking about most of the

6110
01:49:59,830 --> 01:49:59,840
we've been talking about most of the
 

6111
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,669
we've been talking about most of the
time which is fantastic at describing

6112
01:50:03,669 --> 01:50:03,679
time which is fantastic at describing
 

6113
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:05,830
time which is fantastic at describing
uh things at high velocities long

6114
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:05,840
uh things at high velocities long
 

6115
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,109
uh things at high velocities long
distances

6116
01:50:07,109 --> 01:50:07,119
distances
 

6117
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:12,709
distances
you know uh and so forth so

6118
01:50:12,709 --> 01:50:12,719

 

6119
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:14,709

that's not the way it's supposed to be

6120
01:50:14,709 --> 01:50:14,719
that's not the way it's supposed to be
 

6121
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:17,109
that's not the way it's supposed to be
uh we're trying to create a theory of

6122
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:17,119
uh we're trying to create a theory of
 

6123
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:20,070
uh we're trying to create a theory of
physics not two theories of physics

6124
01:50:20,070 --> 01:50:20,080
physics not two theories of physics
 

6125
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,990
physics not two theories of physics
so we have an embarrassment that we have

6126
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,000
so we have an embarrassment that we have
 

6127
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,390
so we have an embarrassment that we have
two different theories of physics

6128
01:50:24,390 --> 01:50:24,400
two different theories of physics
 

6129
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,310
two different theories of physics
people have tried to

6130
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:26,320
people have tried to
 

6131
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,310
people have tried to
make a unified theory what they call a

6132
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:28,320
make a unified theory what they call a
 

6133
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,070
make a unified theory what they call a
unified there you've heard those words

6134
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:30,080
unified there you've heard those words
 

6135
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:32,229
unified there you've heard those words
for decades

6136
01:50:32,229 --> 01:50:32,239
for decades
 

6137
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:35,750
for decades
they still haven't that's been primarily

6138
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:35,760
they still haven't that's been primarily
 

6139
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,790
they still haven't that's been primarily
done theoretically or try they people

6140
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:38,800
done theoretically or try they people
 

6141
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,870
done theoretically or try they people
actively do that

6142
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:40,880
actively do that
 

6143
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,149
actively do that
my personal belief is that the

6144
01:50:44,149 --> 01:50:44,159
my personal belief is that the
 

6145
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:44,950
my personal belief is that the
like

6146
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960
like
 

6147
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,669
like
much of physics we need some clues

6148
01:50:47,669 --> 01:50:47,679
much of physics we need some clues
 

6149
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:49,750
much of physics we need some clues
so we need some experimental evidence so

6150
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:49,760
so we need some experimental evidence so
 

6151
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:52,950
so we need some experimental evidence so
where is there a place if we go to cern

6152
01:50:52,950 --> 01:50:52,960
where is there a place if we go to cern
 

6153
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,030
where is there a place if we go to cern
and do those experiments gravitational

6154
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:55,040
and do those experiments gravitational
 

6155
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,109
and do those experiments gravitational
waves or general relativity don't matter

6156
01:50:57,109 --> 01:50:57,119
waves or general relativity don't matter
 

6157
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:59,990
waves or general relativity don't matter
yes if we go to study you know our black

6158
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:00,000
yes if we go to study you know our black
 

6159
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,950
yes if we go to study you know our black
holes

6160
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:00,960
holes
 

6161
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,629

elementary particle physics doesn't

6162
01:51:02,629 --> 01:51:02,639
elementary particle physics doesn't
 

6163
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:05,350
elementary particle physics doesn't
matter we're studying these huge objects

6164
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:05,360
matter we're studying these huge objects
 

6165
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:08,149
matter we're studying these huge objects
so where might we have a place where

6166
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:08,159
so where might we have a place where
 

6167
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:11,030
so where might we have a place where
both phenomena have to be satisfied an

6168
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:11,040
both phenomena have to be satisfied an
 

6169
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:13,430
both phenomena have to be satisfied an
example is black holes inside black

6170
01:51:13,430 --> 01:51:13,440
example is black holes inside black
 

6171
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:14,950
example is black holes inside black
holes yeah

6172
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:14,960
holes yeah
 

6173
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,950
holes yeah
so we can't do that today

6174
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:16,960
so we can't do that today
 

6175
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,109
so we can't do that today
but when i think of black hole it's a

6176
01:51:19,109 --> 01:51:19,119
but when i think of black hole it's a
 

6177
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:20,870
but when i think of black hole it's a
potential

6178
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:20,880

01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,189
and maybe
can give us clues

6192
01:51:31,189 --> 01:51:31,199
can give us clues
 

6193
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:34,390
can give us clues
to how we bring to the embarrassment of

6194
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:34,400
to how we bring to the embarrassment of
 

6195
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:37,510
to how we bring to the embarrassment of
having two theories of physics together

6196
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:37,520
having two theories of physics together
 

6197
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,189
having two theories of physics together
that's my own

6198
01:51:39,189 --> 01:51:39,199
that's my own
 

6199
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:40,870
that's my own
romantic what's the worst that could

6200
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:40,880
romantic what's the worst that could
 

6201
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,950
romantic what's the worst that could
happen it's so enticing just go in and

6202
01:51:42,950 --> 01:51:42,960
happen it's so enticing just go in and
 

6203
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:43,910
happen it's so enticing just go in and
look

6204
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:43,920
look
 

6205
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,589
look
do you think um

6206
01:51:45,589 --> 01:51:45,599
do you think um
 

6207
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:47,510
do you think um
how far are we away from figuring out

6208
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
how far are we away from figuring out
 

6209
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,270
how far are we away from figuring out
the unified uh

6210
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:49,280
the unified uh
 

6211
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,629
the unified uh
theory of physics the theory of

6212
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
theory of physics the theory of
 

6213
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,790
theory of physics the theory of
everything i think what's your sense who

6214
01:51:52,790 --> 01:51:52,800
everything i think what's your sense who
 

6215
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:53,669
everything i think what's your sense who
will

6216
01:51:53,669 --> 01:51:53,679
will
 

6217
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:55,669
will
solve it like what discipline will solve

6218
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:55,679
solve it like what discipline will solve
 

6219
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,870
solve it like what discipline will solve
it yeah uh

6220
01:51:58,870 --> 01:51:58,880
it yeah uh
 

6221
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,830
it yeah uh
i i think

6222
01:52:00,830 --> 01:52:00,840
i i think
 

6223
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,589
i i think
uh so little

6224
01:52:03,589 --> 01:52:03,599
uh so little
 

6225
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:07,910
uh so little
progress has been made uh

6226
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:07,920

 

6227
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:08,870

without

6228
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:08,880
without
 

6229
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,109
without
more experimental clues as i said that

6230
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:11,119
more experimental clues as i said that
 

6231
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:13,430
more experimental clues as i said that
we're not uh

6232
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:13,440
we're not uh
 

6233
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:17,669
we're not uh
we're just not able to

6234
01:52:17,669 --> 01:52:17,679
we're just not able to
 

6235
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:20,550
we're just not able to
say that we're close without some clues

6236
01:52:20,550 --> 01:52:20,560
say that we're close without some clues
 

6237
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,790
say that we're close without some clues
the best the closest

6238
01:52:22,790 --> 01:52:22,800
the best the closest
 

6239
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:23,830
the best the closest

6241
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:26,070
the most
popular theory these days that might

6242
01:52:26,070 --> 01:52:26,080
popular theory these days that might
 

6243
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:28,629
popular theory these days that might
lead to that is called string theory

6244
01:52:28,629 --> 01:52:28,639
lead to that is called string theory
 

6245
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:29,830
lead to that is called string theory
yeah

6246
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:29,840
yeah
 

6247
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,510
yeah
the problem with string theory is it

6248
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:31,520
the problem with string theory is it
 

6249
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,550
the problem with string theory is it
works

6250
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:32,560
works
 

6251
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:34,550
works
uh it solves a lot of beautiful

6252
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:34,560
uh it solves a lot of beautiful
 

6253
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,430
uh it solves a lot of beautiful
mathematical problems we have in physics

6254
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:37,440
mathematical problems we have in physics
 

6255
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:39,350

6259
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,390
and uh
it's

6260
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:42,400
it's
 

6261
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,669
it's
it's uh

6262
01:52:43,669 --> 01:52:43,679
it's uh
 

6263
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:46,310
it's uh
very satisfying theoretically

6264
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:46,320
very satisfying theoretically
 

6265
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:49,030
very satisfying theoretically
but it has almost no predictive

6266
01:52:49,030 --> 01:52:49,040
but it has almost no predictive
 

6267
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:52,070
but it has almost no predictive
maybe no predictive ability because

6268
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:52,080
maybe no predictive ability because
 

6269
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:54,950
maybe no predictive ability because
it is a theory that works in 11

01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:07,669
in order to make predictions
in our world with string theory you have

6280
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:07,679
in our world with string theory you have
 

6281
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:09,830
in our world with string theory you have
to somehow get rid of these other

6282
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:09,840
to somehow get rid of these other
 

6283
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:10,830
to somehow get rid of these other

dimensions that's done mathematically by
 

6287
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,229

01:53:16,229 --> 01:53:16,239
saying they curl up on each other on
 

6289
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:18,310
saying they curl up on each other on

anything here

6292
01:53:19,669 --> 01:53:19,679
anything here
 

6293
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:21,910
anything here
but how you do that and that's okay

6294
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:21,920
but how you do that and that's okay
 

6295
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,990
but how you do that and that's okay
that's an okay argument but how you do

6296
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:24,000
that's an okay argument but how you do
 

6297
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:24,790
that's an okay argument but how you do
that

6298
01:53:24,790 --> 01:53:24,800
that
 

6299
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,430
that
is not unique

6300
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:27,440
is not unique
 

6301
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,950
is not unique
so that means if i start with that

6302
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:28,960
so that means if i start with that
 

6303
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,430
so that means if i start with that
theory and i go to our world here i

6304
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:31,440
theory and i go to our world here i
 

6305
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:33,910
theory and i go to our world here i
can't uniquely go to it

6306
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:33,920
can't uniquely go to it
 

6307
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,109
can't uniquely go to it
and if i can't

6308
01:53:35,109 --> 01:53:35,119
and if i can't
 

6309
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:37,270
and if i can't
it's not predictive and that's that's

6310
01:53:37,270 --> 01:53:37,280
it's not predictive and that's that's
 

6311
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:39,030
it's not predictive and that's that's
actually and that's a killer that's a

6312
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,040
actually and that's a killer that's a
 

6313
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:41,430
actually and that's a killer that's a
killer and string theory is it seems

6314
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:41,440
killer and string theory is it seems
 

6315
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,189
killer and string theory is it seems
like from my outsider's perspective has

6316
01:53:43,189 --> 01:53:43,199
like from my outsider's perspective has
 

6317
01:53:43,199 --> 01:53:45,350
like from my outsider's perspective has
lost favor over the years perhaps

6318
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:45,360
lost favor over the years perhaps
 

6319
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:47,189
lost favor over the years perhaps
because of this very it's a lack of

6320
01:53:47,189 --> 01:53:47,199
because of this very it's a lack of
 

6321
01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:50,149
because of this very it's a lack of
predictive power i mean that science

6322
01:53:50,149 --> 01:53:50,159
predictive power i mean that science
 

6323
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:52,229
predictive power i mean that science
has to connect to something where you

6324
01:53:52,229 --> 01:53:52,239
has to connect to something where you
 

6325
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:54,390
has to connect to something where you
make predictions as beautiful

6326
01:53:54,390 --> 01:53:54,400
make predictions as beautiful
 

6327
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,870
make predictions as beautiful
as it as it might be so i don't think

6328
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:56,880
as it as it might be so i don't think
 

6329
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,669
as it as it might be so i don't think
we're close i think we need

6330
01:53:59,669 --> 01:53:59,679
we're close i think we need
 

6331
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:00,629
we're close i think we need
some

6332
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:00,639
some
 

6333
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:03,270
some
experimental clues it may be

6334
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:03,280
experimental clues it may be
 

6335
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:05,669
experimental clues it may be
that information on

6336
01:54:05,669 --> 01:54:05,679
that information on
 

6337
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:07,510
that information on
something we don't understand presently

6338
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:07,520
something we don't understand presently
 

6339
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,910
something we don't understand presently
at all like dark energy or

6340
01:54:09,910 --> 01:54:09,920
at all like dark energy or
 

6341
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,990
at all like dark energy or
probably not dark matter but dark energy

6342
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:12,000
probably not dark matter but dark energy
 

6343
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,390
probably not dark matter but dark energy
or something might give us some ideas

6344
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:14,400
or something might give us some ideas
 

6345
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,189
or something might give us some ideas
but

6346
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:15,199
but
 

6347
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:17,030
but
i i don't think we're

6348
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:17,040
i i don't think we're
 

6349
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:20,070
i i don't think we're
i can't envision right now

6350
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:20,080
i can't envision right now
 

6351
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:25,030
i can't envision right now
um in the short term meaning you know

6352
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:25,040
um in the short term meaning you know
 

6353
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,430
um in the short term meaning you know
the horizon that we can see

6354
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:27,440
the horizon that we can see
 

6355
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,430
the horizon that we can see
how we're gonna uh bring these two

6356
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:29,440
how we're gonna uh bring these two
 

6357
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,589
how we're gonna uh bring these two
theories together

6358
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:31,599
theories together
 

6359
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,910
theories together
a kind of um

6360
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:33,920
a kind of um
 

6361
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:36,149
a kind of um
two-part question maybe just asking the

6362
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:36,159
two-part question maybe just asking the
 

6363
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:37,990
two-part question maybe just asking the
same thing in two different ways

6364
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:38,000
same thing in two different ways
 

6365
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,070
same thing in two different ways
one one question is

6366
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:40,080
one one question is
 

6367
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,149
one one question is
do you have hope that humans

6368
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:42,159
do you have hope that humans
 

6369
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:44,790
do you have hope that humans
will colonize

6370
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:44,800
will colonize
 

6371
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:47,750
will colonize
the uh the galaxy so expand out become a

6372
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:47,760
the uh the galaxy so expand out become a
 

6373
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:50,229
the uh the galaxy so expand out become a
multi-planetary species another way of

6374
01:54:50,229 --> 01:54:50,239
multi-planetary species another way of
 

6375
01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:52,470
multi-planetary species another way of
asking that from a gravitational and a

6376
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:52,480
asking that from a gravitational and a
 

6377
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:54,390
asking that from a gravitational and a
propulsion perspective do you think

6378
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:54,400
propulsion perspective do you think
 

6379
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,149
propulsion perspective do you think
we'll come up with ways to travel close

6380
01:54:56,149 --> 01:54:56,159
we'll come up with ways to travel close
 

6381
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:57,830
we'll come up with ways to travel close
to the speed of light or maybe faster

6382
01:54:57,830 --> 01:54:57,840
to the speed of light or maybe faster
 

6383
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,669
to the speed of light or maybe faster
than the speed of light

6384
01:54:59,669 --> 01:54:59,679
than the speed of light
 

6385
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:01,669
than the speed of light
which would make it a whole heck of a

6386
01:55:01,669 --> 01:55:01,679
which would make it a whole heck of a
 

6387
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:04,470
which would make it a whole heck of a
lot easier to to expand out into the

6388
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:04,480
lot easier to to expand out into the
 

6389
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:05,990
lot easier to to expand out into the
into the universe

6390
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,000
into the universe
 

6391
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:06,950
into the universe
yeah

6392
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:06,960
yeah
 

6393
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,510
yeah
uh

6394
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:09,520

 

6395
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,070

well i think

6396
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:12,080
well i think
 

6397
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:13,510
well i think
you know we're not

6398
01:55:13,510 --> 01:55:13,520
you know we're not
 

6399
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,910
you know we're not
that's a very futuristic i think we're

6400
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:15,920
that's a very futuristic i think we're
 

6401
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:18,950
that's a very futuristic i think we're
not that far from being able to

6402
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:18,960
not that far from being able to
 

6403
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,390
not that far from being able to
make a one-way trip to mars

6404
01:55:22,390 --> 01:55:22,400
make a one-way trip to mars
 

6405
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:24,550
make a one-way trip to mars
that's a that's then a

6406
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:24,560
that's a that's then a
 

6407
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:28,149
that's a that's then a
question of uh

6408
01:55:28,149 --> 01:55:28,159

 

6409
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:29,990

whether people are willing to send

6410
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:30,000
whether people are willing to send
 

6411
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,910
whether people are willing to send
somebody on a one-way trip but oh i

6412
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:31,920
somebody on a one-way trip but oh i
 

6413
01:55:31,920 --> 01:55:33,669
somebody on a one-way trip but oh i
think they are i think there's a lot of

6414
01:55:33,669 --> 01:55:33,679
think they are i think there's a lot of
 

6415
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:36,070
think they are i think there's a lot of
exp the explorers burn bright and with

6416
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:36,080
exp the explorers burn bright and with
 

6417
01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:37,910
exp the explorers burn bright and with
their hearts yeah exactly people wanting

6418
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:37,920
their hearts yeah exactly people wanting
 

6419
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,270
their hearts yeah exactly people wanting
to die so

6420
01:55:39,270 --> 01:55:39,280
to die so
 

6421
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,430
to die so
the opportunity to to explore new

6422
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:41,440
the opportunity to to explore new
 

6423
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,229
the opportunity to to explore new
territory yeah so uh

6424
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:44,239
territory yeah so uh
 

6425
01:55:44,239 --> 01:55:47,510
territory yeah so uh
you know with this this recent

6426
01:55:47,510 --> 01:55:47,520
you know with this this recent
 

6427
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,750
you know with this this recent
landing on mars is pretty impressive

6428
01:55:49,750 --> 01:55:49,760
landing on mars is pretty impressive
 

6429
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,189
landing on mars is pretty impressive
they have a little helicopter that can

6430
01:55:51,189 --> 01:55:51,199
they have a little helicopter that can
 

6431
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:53,830
they have a little helicopter that can
fly around you can imagine

6432
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:53,840
fly around you can imagine
 

6433
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:56,070
fly around you can imagine
you can imagine in the not too distant

6434
01:55:56,070 --> 01:55:56,080
you can imagine in the not too distant
 

6435
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:58,870
you can imagine in the not too distant
future that you could have i don't think

6436
01:55:58,870 --> 01:55:58,880
future that you could have i don't think
 

6437
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,070
future that you could have i don't think
civilizations colonizing i can envision

6438
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:02,080
civilizations colonizing i can envision
 

6439
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,790
civilizations colonizing i can envision
but i i can envision something more like

6440
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:04,800
but i i can envision something more like
 

6441
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,229
but i i can envision something more like
the south pole

6442
01:56:06,229 --> 01:56:06,239
the south pole
 

6443
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:08,149
the south pole
we haven't colonized

6444
01:56:08,149 --> 01:56:08,159
we haven't colonized
 

6445
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:10,550
we haven't colonized
antarctica because it's

6446
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:10,560
antarctica because it's
 

6447
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:13,109
antarctica because it's
all ice and cold and so forth but we

6448
01:56:13,109 --> 01:56:13,119
all ice and cold and so forth but we
 

6449
01:56:13,119 --> 01:56:14,629
all ice and cold and so forth but we
have

6450
01:56:14,629 --> 01:56:14,639
have
 

6451
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:17,589
have
uh stations so we have a station that's

6452
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:17,599
uh stations so we have a station that's
 

6453
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:19,669
uh stations so we have a station that's
self-sustaining at the south pole that

6454
01:56:19,669 --> 01:56:19,679
self-sustaining at the south pole that
 

6455
01:56:19,679 --> 01:56:20,950
self-sustaining at the south pole that
i've been there

6456
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:20,960
i've been there
 

6457
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:23,669
i've been there
it has oh really yeah

6458
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:23,679
it has oh really yeah
 

6459
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:24,950
it has oh really yeah
what's that like

6460
01:56:24,950 --> 01:56:24,960
what's that like
 

6461
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,390
what's that like
uh and

6462
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,400
uh and
 

6463
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,709
uh and
because that there's parallels there

6464
01:56:28,709 --> 01:56:28,719
because that there's parallels there
 

6465
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:31,750
because that there's parallels there
to go to mars it's fantastic it is

6466
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:31,760
to go to mars it's fantastic it is
 

6467
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,270
to go to mars it's fantastic it is
what's the journey like

6468
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:33,280
what's the journey like
 

6469
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:36,470
what's the journey like
the journey involves going uh the south

6470
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:36,480
the journey involves going uh the south
 

6471
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,790
the journey involves going uh the south
pole station is uh run

6472
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:38,800
pole station is uh run
 

6473

healthy enough to the south pole to
 

6487
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:55,350
healthy enough to the south pole to
see it

6488

see it
 

6489
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,910
see it
uh which i took uh

uh it's about a
 

6509
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,750
uh it's about a
seven or eight hour flight and they

6510

seven or eight hour flight and they
 

6511
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,709
seven or eight hour flight and they
can't predict the weather so when when i

6512
01:57:24,709 --> 01:57:24,719
can't predict the weather so when when i
 

6513
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:25,910
can't predict the weather so when when i
flew from

aircraft they tell you in advance that
 

6523
01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:36,070
aircraft they tell you in advance that
they can't predict whether they can land

6524
01:57:36,070 --> 01:57:36,080
they can't predict whether they can land
 

6525
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,070
they can't predict whether they can land
because they have to land on uh

6526
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,080
because they have to land on uh
 

6527
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,350
because they have to land on uh
reassuring

6528
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:39,360
reassuring
 

6529
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,669
reassuring
yeah and so about

yeah and so about
 

6531
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:44,870
yeah and so about
halfway the pilot got on and said uh

6532
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:44,880
halfway the pilot got on and said uh
 

6533
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:46,709
halfway the pilot got on and said uh
sorry this is uh they call it a

6534
01:57:46,709 --> 01:57:46,719
sorry this is uh they call it a
 

6535
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:49,189
sorry this is uh they call it a
boomerang flight you know boomerang goes

6536
01:57:49,189 --> 01:57:49,199
boomerang flight you know boomerang goes
 

6537
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:50,790
boomerang flight you know boomerang goes
out and goes back

6538
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:50,800
out and goes back
 

6539
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,870
out and goes back
so we had to stay a little while in

6540
01:57:52,870 --> 01:57:52,880
so we had to stay a little while in
 

6541
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:54,950
so we had to stay a little while in
christchurch but then we eventually went

6542
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:54,960
christchurch but then we eventually went
 

6543
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:55,669
christchurch but then we eventually went
to

6544
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:55,679
to
 

6545
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:58,390
to
mcmurdo station and then

6546
01:57:58,390 --> 01:57:58,400
mcmurdo station and then
 

6547
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,790
mcmurdo station and then
flew to the south pole the south pole

6548
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:00,800
flew to the south pole the south pole
 

6549
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,709
flew to the south pole the south pole
itself

6550
01:58:02,709 --> 01:58:02,719
itself
 

6551
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:03,910
itself
is

6552
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:03,920
is
 

6553
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,589
is
when i was there was minus 51 degrees

6554
01:58:07,589 --> 01:58:07,599
when i was there was minus 51 degrees
 

6555
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:09,589
when i was there was minus 51 degrees
that was summer

6556
01:58:09,589 --> 01:58:09,599
that was summer
 

6557
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:11,270
that was summer
uh

6558
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,280
uh
 

6559
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,189
uh
it uh

6560
01:58:13,189 --> 01:58:13,199
it uh
 

6561
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,750
it uh
zero humidity

6562
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:15,760
zero humidity
 

6563
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:19,430
zero humidity
and uh

6564
01:58:19,430 --> 01:58:19,440

 

6565
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,750

and it's about

6566
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:21,760
and it's about
 

6567
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:24,470
and it's about
11 000 feet altitude

6568
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:24,480
11 000 feet altitude
 

6569
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:26,149
11 000 feet altitude
because it's

6570
01:58:26,149 --> 01:58:26,159
because it's
 

6571
01:58:26,159 --> 01:58:27,990
because it's
never warm enough for anything to melt

6572
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,000
never warm enough for anything to melt
 

6573
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,830
never warm enough for anything to melt
so it doesn't snow very much but it's

6574
01:58:29,830 --> 01:58:29,840
so it doesn't snow very much but it's
 

6575
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,910
so it doesn't snow very much but it's
about 11 000 feet

6576
01:58:31,910 --> 01:58:31,920
about 11 000 feet
 

6577
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:34,629
about 11 000 feet
of snowpack so you land in a place

6578
01:58:34,629 --> 01:58:34,639
of snowpack so you land in a place
 

6579
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:36,550
of snowpack so you land in a place
that's high altitude

6580
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:36,560
that's high altitude
 

6581
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,430
that's high altitude
um

6582
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:37,440
um
 

6583
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,030
um
cold as could be

6584
01:58:39,030 --> 01:58:39,040
cold as could be
 

6585
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:42,709
cold as could be
and dry and incredibly dry

6586
01:58:42,709 --> 01:58:42,719
and dry and incredibly dry
 

6587
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,310
and dry and incredibly dry
which means you have a physical

6588
01:58:44,310 --> 01:58:44,320
which means you have a physical
 

6589
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,390
which means you have a physical
adjustment

6590
01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:46,400
adjustment
 

6591
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,310
adjustment
the

6592
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:48,320
the
 

6593
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,709
the
place itself is uh

6594
01:58:50,709 --> 01:58:50,719
place itself is uh
 

6595
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:53,510
place itself is uh
it's fantastic they have this great

6596
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:53,520
it's fantastic they have this great
 

6597
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,589
it's fantastic they have this great
station there they they do astronomy at

6598
01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:55,599
station there they they do astronomy at
 

6599
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:57,430
station there they they do astronomy at
the south pole nature wise is it

6600
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:57,440
the south pole nature wise is it
 

6601
01:58:57,440 --> 01:58:58,550
the south pole nature wise is it
beautiful

6602
01:58:58,550 --> 01:58:58,560
beautiful
 

6603
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:01,189
beautiful
what's the is what's the experience like

6604
01:59:01,189 --> 01:59:01,199
what's the is what's the experience like
 

6605
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:03,830
what's the is what's the experience like
or is it like visiting any town

6606
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:03,840
or is it like visiting any town
 

6607
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,709
or is it like visiting any town
no it's very small there's only um

6608
01:59:06,709 --> 01:59:06,719
no it's very small there's only um
 

6609
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:08,629
no it's very small there's only um
less than 100 people there even when i

6610
01:59:08,629 --> 01:59:08,639
less than 100 people there even when i
 

6611
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:09,669
less than 100 people there even when i
was there

6612
01:59:09,669 --> 01:59:09,679
was there
 

6613
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:10,629
was there
you know

6614
01:59:10,629 --> 01:59:10,639
you know
 

6615
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:11,990
you know
there were about

6616
01:59:11,990 --> 01:59:12,000
there were about
 

6617
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,550
there were about
50 or 60 there and in the winter there's

6618
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:14,560
50 or 60 there and in the winter there's
 

6619
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,229
50 or 60 there and in the winter there's
less half of that their winter when yeah

6620
01:59:18,229 --> 01:59:18,239
less half of that their winter when yeah
 

6621
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:21,350
less half of that their winter when yeah
it's real cold it gets really cold yeah

6622
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:21,360
it's real cold it gets really cold yeah
 

6623
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:23,350
it's real cold it gets really cold yeah
and but it's but it's

6624
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:23,360
and but it's but it's
 

6625
01:59:23,360 --> 01:59:26,550
and but it's but it's
it's a station i i think

6626
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:26,560
it's a station i i think
 

6627
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,149
it's a station i i think
and that's

6628
01:59:28,149 --> 01:59:28,159
and that's
 

6629
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:30,709
and that's
i mean we haven't gone beyond that uh

6630
01:59:30,709 --> 01:59:30,719
i mean we haven't gone beyond that uh
 

6631
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:32,790
i mean we haven't gone beyond that uh
on the coast of antarctica they have

6632
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:32,800
on the coast of antarctica they have
 

6633
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:35,270
on the coast of antarctica they have
greenhouses and they're self-sustaining

6634
01:59:35,270 --> 01:59:35,280
greenhouses and they're self-sustaining
 

6635
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:38,070
greenhouses and they're self-sustaining
in mcmurdo station but we haven't really

6636
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:38,080
in mcmurdo station but we haven't really
 

6637
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:40,310
in mcmurdo station but we haven't really
settled more than

6638
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:40,320
settled more than
 

6639
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,390
settled more than
that kind of thing in antarctica which

6640
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:42,400
that kind of thing in antarctica which
 

6641
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:44,229
that kind of thing in antarctica which
is a big

6642
01:59:44,229 --> 01:59:44,239
is a big
 

6643
01:59:44,239 --> 01:59:46,629
is a big
uh

6644
01:59:46,629 --> 01:59:46,639

 

6645
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:48,709

a country or you know

6646
01:59:48,709 --> 01:59:48,719
a country or you know
 

6647
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:50,229
a country or you know
a

6648
01:59:50,229 --> 01:59:50,239
a
 

6649
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:52,149
a
big plot a big

6650
01:59:52,149 --> 01:59:52,159
big plot a big
 

6651
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:53,910
big plot a big
piece of land so

6652
01:59:53,910 --> 01:59:53,920
piece of land so
 

6653
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,350
piece of land so
i don't

6654
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:55,360
i don't
 

6655
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:57,510
i don't
i can't envision kind of

6656
01:59:57,510 --> 01:59:57,520
i can't envision kind of
 

6657
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,229
i can't envision kind of
colonizing at people living so much as

6658
02:00:00,229 --> 02:00:00,239
colonizing at people living so much as
 

6659
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:03,910
colonizing at people living so much as
much as i can see

6660
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:03,920

 

6661
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,990

the equivalent of the south pole station

6662
02:00:05,990 --> 02:00:06,000
the equivalent of the south pole station
 

6663
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,229
the equivalent of the south pole station
well in the computing world there's a

6664
02:00:08,229 --> 02:00:08,239
well in the computing world there's a
 

6665
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:09,510
well in the computing world there's a
idea of

6666
02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:09,520
idea of
 

6667
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,109
idea of
you know backing up your data and then

6668
02:00:11,109 --> 02:00:11,119
you know backing up your data and then
 

6669
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:13,589
you know backing up your data and then
you want to do off-site backup

6670
02:00:13,589 --> 02:00:13,599
you want to do off-site backup
 

6671
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:15,510
you want to do off-site backup
uh you know to make sure that if the

6672
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:15,520
uh you know to make sure that if the
 

6673
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,189
uh you know to make sure that if the
whole thing burn if your whole house

6674
02:00:17,189 --> 02:00:17,199
whole thing burn if your whole house
 

6675
02:00:17,199 --> 02:00:19,510
whole thing burn if your whole house
burns down then you can have a backup

6676
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:19,520
burns down then you can have a backup
 

6677
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,510
burns down then you can have a backup
offsite of the data i think the

6678
02:00:21,510 --> 02:00:21,520
offsite of the data i think the
 

6679
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,470
offsite of the data i think the
difference between antarctica and

6680
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:24,480
difference between antarctica and
 

6681
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,510
difference between antarctica and
and mars is mars is a off-site backup

6682
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:27,520
and mars is mars is a off-site backup
 

6683

and mars is mars is a off-site backup
that if we have nuclear war whatever the

02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:29,440
that if we have nuclear war whatever the
 

6685
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,669
that if we have nuclear war whatever the
heck might happen here on earth it'd be

6686
02:00:31,669 --> 02:00:31,679
heck might happen here on earth it'd be
 

6687
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:33,990
heck might happen here on earth it'd be
nice to have a backup elsewhere and uh

6688
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:34,000
nice to have a backup elsewhere and uh
 

6689

maybe like one or two computer

6704
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:51,840
maybe like one or two computer
 

6705
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:53,830
maybe like one or two computer
scientists those are essential maybe

6706
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:53,840
scientists those are essential maybe
 

6707
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:55,350
scientists those are essential maybe
even a physicist so

6708
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:55,360
even a physicist so
 

6709
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:57,350
even a physicist so
i'm not sure yeah maybe not

6710
02:00:57,350 --> 02:00:57,360
i'm not sure yeah maybe not
 

6711
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,510
i'm not sure yeah maybe not
so that comes back to something you

6712
02:00:59,510 --> 02:00:59,520
so that comes back to something you
 

6713
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,430
so that comes back to something you
talked about earlier which is fermi the

6714
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:01,440
talked about earlier which is fermi the
 

6715
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:03,990
talked about earlier which is fermi the
paradox family's paradox because you

6716
02:01:03,990 --> 02:01:04,000
paradox family's paradox because you
 

6717
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,709
paradox family's paradox because you
talked about having to escape yeah

6718
02:01:06,709 --> 02:01:06,719
talked about having to escape yeah
 

6719
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:07,510
talked about having to escape yeah
but

6720
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:07,520
but
 

6721
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:10,070
but
and so the missing one one number you

6722
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:10,080
and so the missing one one number you
 

6723
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:12,310
and so the missing one one number you
don't know how to use in fermi's

6724
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:12,320
don't know how to use in fermi's
 

6725
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,310
don't know how to use in fermi's
calculation or drake who's done it

6726
02:01:14,310 --> 02:01:14,320
calculation or drake who's done it
 

6727
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:17,189
calculation or drake who's done it
better is how long do civilizations last

6728
02:01:17,189 --> 02:01:17,199
better is how long do civilizations last
 

6729
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:18,310
better is how long do civilizations last
yeah

6730
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:18,320
yeah
 

6731
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,430
yeah
before they

6732
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:19,440
before they
 

6733
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:21,430
before they
are we you know we've barely gotten to

6734
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:21,440
are we you know we've barely gotten to
 

6735
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:23,589
are we you know we've barely gotten to
where we can communicate with

6736
02:01:23,589 --> 02:01:23,599
where we can communicate with
 

6737
02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:25,910
where we can communicate with
electricity and magnetism and maybe

6738
02:01:25,910 --> 02:01:25,920
electricity and magnetism and maybe
 

6739
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,149
electricity and magnetism and maybe
we'll wipe ourselves out pretty soon so

6740
02:01:28,149 --> 02:01:28,159
we'll wipe ourselves out pretty soon so
 

6741

we have where we where we started the
 

6769
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:58,470
we have where we where we started the
fact that we can do things that don't

kind of keep going or there can be
 

6775
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,430
kind of keep going or there can be
whether it you know ends up being a

whether it you know ends up being a
 

6777

whether it you know ends up being a
virus that we create or

6778

virus that we create or
 

6779
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:07,430

well i would i would hope they
 

7817
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:10,230
well i would i would hope they
if to the extent that they evaluated me

7818

if to the extent that they evaluated me
 

7819
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:12,870
if to the extent that they evaluated me
uh felt that i helped move science

7820
02:21:12,870 --> 02:21:12,880
uh felt that i helped move science
 

7821
02:21:12,880 --> 02:21:15,670
uh felt that i helped move science
forward as a

7822
02:21:15,670 --> 02:21:15,680
forward as a
 

7823
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:18,950
forward as a
tangible contribution and that

7824
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:18,960
tangible contribution and that
 

7825

i served as a good role model for
 

7827
02:21:22,319 --> 02:21:25,349
i served as a good role model for
how humans should live their lives

7828
02:21:25,349 --> 02:21:25,359
how humans should live their lives
 

7829
02:21:25,359 --> 02:21:27,830
how humans should live their lives
and we're part of creating one of the

7830
02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:27,840
and we're part of creating one of the
 

7831
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:29,830
and we're part of creating one of the
most incredible things

7832
02:21:29,830 --> 02:21:29,840
most incredible things
 

7833
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:32,150
most incredible things
humans have ever created

7834
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:32,160
humans have ever created
 

7835
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,150
humans have ever created
so yes there's the science that's the

7836
02:21:34,150 --> 02:21:34,160
so yes there's the science that's the
 

7837
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:37,590
so yes there's the science that's the
fermi thing right yeah uh the instrument

7838
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:37,600
fermi thing right yeah uh the instrument
 

7839
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:39,670
fermi thing right yeah uh the instrument
i guess and the instrument the

7840
02:21:39,670 --> 02:21:39,680
i guess and the instrument the
 

7841
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:41,990
i guess and the instrument the
instrument is a magical creation not

7842
02:21:41,990 --> 02:21:42,000
instrument is a magical creation not
 

7843
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,990
instrument is a magical creation not
just by a human by a collection of

7844
02:21:43,990 --> 02:21:44,000
just by a human by a collection of
 

7845
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,110
just by a human by a collection of
humans the collaboration

7846

that's
 

7851
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:54,630
that's
that's humanity at his best

02:21:54,630 --> 02:21:54,640
that's humanity at his best
 

7853
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:56,469

i i do hope

7854
02:21:56,469 --> 02:21:56,479
i i do hope
 

7855
02:21:56,479 --> 02:21:59,190
i i do hope
i do hope will last quite a bit longer

7856
02:21:59,190 --> 02:21:59,200
i do hope will last quite a bit longer
 

7857
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:01,750
i do hope will last quite a bit longer
but if we don't

7858
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:01,760
but if we don't
 

7859
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:03,830
but if we don't
this is a good thing to remember humans

7860
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:03,840
this is a good thing to remember humans
 

7861
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:04,630
