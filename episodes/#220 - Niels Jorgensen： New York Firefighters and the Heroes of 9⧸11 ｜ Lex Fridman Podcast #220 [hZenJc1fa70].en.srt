00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,909
massive piles of
intertwined steel what was left of the

1284
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
intertwined steel what was left of the
 

1285
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,549
intertwined steel what was left of the
steel and and you know there was no

1286
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
steel and and you know there was no
 

1287
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,830
steel and and you know there was no
cement it was all just dust

1288
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:06,840
cement it was all just dust
 

1289
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,390
cement it was all just dust
and

1290
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
and
 

1291
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,510
and
it was just a burning pile of dust and

1292
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
it was just a burning pile of dust and
 

1293
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,070
it was just a burning pile of dust and
concrete and plastic and it was just

1294
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
concrete and plastic and it was just
 

1295
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,750
concrete and plastic and it was just

everything was just pulverized and it
 

1297
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,110
everything was just pulverized and it
was it was truly hard to

1298
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,120
was it was truly hard to
 

1299
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,430
was it was truly hard to
mentally compute that like it was like

1300
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,440
mentally compute that like it was like
 

1301
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,270
mentally compute that like it was like
what and then

1302
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
what and then
 

1303
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,590
what and then
there was just fighter jets couple fire

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600
there was just fighter jets couple fire
 

1305
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,750
there was just fighter jets couple fire
just just circling and and you just

1306
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
just just circling and and you just
 

1307
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,110

00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
and we
 

1321
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,990
and we
couldn't really get concrete intel as to

1322
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
couldn't really get concrete intel as to
 

1323
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,149
couldn't really get concrete intel as to
what exactly we knew planes but then we

1324
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
what exactly we knew planes but then we
 

1325
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,909
what exactly we knew planes but then we
kept hearing there was

1326
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
kept hearing there was
 

1327
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,630
kept hearing there was
multiple devices there was devices in a

1328
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640
multiple devices there was devices in a
 

1329
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,470
multiple devices there was devices in a
battery tunnel and there was devices on

1330
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
battery tunnel and there was devices on
 

1331
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,310
battery tunnel and there was devices on
the george washington bridge and in the

1332
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
the george washington bridge and in the
 

1333
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,070
the george washington bridge and in the
subways and it was just it was just

1334
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,080
subways and it was just it was just
 

1335
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,310
subways and it was just it was just
chaos it was i mean we kept it together

1336
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,320
chaos it was i mean we kept it together
 

1337
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,230
chaos it was i mean we kept it together
obviously because that's kind of we try

1338
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,240
obviously because that's kind of we try
 

1339
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,590
obviously because that's kind of we try
that's what we do

1340
00:23:59,590 --> 00:23:59,600
that's what we do
 

1341
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,950
that's what we do
but the

1342
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
but the
 

1343
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,190
but the
the just constant barrage of different

1344
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
the just constant barrage of different
 

1345
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,830
the just constant barrage of different
reports it was like holy shoot

1346
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:05,840
reports it was like holy shoot
 

1347
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,070
reports it was like holy shoot
and then as we were being deployed it

1348
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
and then as we were being deployed it
 

1349
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,510
and then as we were being deployed it
was a little frustrating but they were

1350
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,520
was a little frustrating but they were
 

1351
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,269
was a little frustrating but they were
trying to take command and send us in

1352
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:11,279
trying to take command and send us in
 

1353
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,590
trying to take command and send us in
groups now because they realize we have

1354
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
groups now because they realize we have
 

1355
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,750
groups now because they realize we have
to start searching this there's

1356
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
to start searching this there's
 

1357
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,789
to start searching this there's
you could hear

1358
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:16,799
you could hear
 

1359
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,510
you could hear
the alarms on the on the scott air mask

1362
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,120
the packs we wear to go into the
 

1363
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,990
the packs we wear to go into the
building

1364
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
building
 

1365
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,830
building
it has a motion alarm and if you stop

1366
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:23,840
it has a motion alarm and if you stop
 

1367
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,669
it has a motion alarm and if you stop
moving for 30 seconds it just sounds

1368
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
moving for 30 seconds it just sounds

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
and you could hear multiple units of
 

1377
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,870

i did but
you know we trained we trained for a lot

1402
00:24:59,029 --> 00:24:59,039
you know we trained we trained for a lot
 

1403
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,350
you know we trained we trained for a lot
of situations and we trained in you know

1404
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:01,360
of situations and we trained in you know
 

1405
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,590
of situations and we trained in you know
real life atmospheres and whatnot and

1406
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
real life atmospheres and whatnot and
 

1407
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,909
real life atmospheres and whatnot and
this was just beyond that by leaps and

1408
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
this was just beyond that by leaps and
 

1409
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,070
this was just beyond that by leaps and
bounds it was it was bizarre

1410
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
bounds it was it was bizarre
 

1411
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,310
bounds it was it was bizarre
did you see the towers collapse as we

did you see the towers collapse as we
 

1413
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,070
did you see the towers collapse as we
were coming over the bridge the first

and all you saw on the tv was just this

1452
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
and all you saw on the tv was just this
 

1453
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,510
and all you saw on the tv was just this
pile of dust and

1454
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:47,520
pile of dust and
 

1455
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,110
pile of dust and
i guess because they didn't see it going

1456
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,120
i guess because they didn't see it going

bad communication system
 

1649
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,149
bad communication system
we've been fighting for years to get

1653
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,310
radios that work properly we couldn't
because it was a lot of money

1654
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
because it was a lot of money
 

1655
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,149

01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,309
what happens then is your replacement is
now in overtime

3954
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319
now in overtime
 

3955
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,110

so you're out being paid on medical eve

3956
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,120

building so once that diesel
 

5779
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:45,750
building so once that diesel
became ignited in seven

5780
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:45,760
became ignited in seven
 

5781
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:46,550
became ignited in seven
now

5782
01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:46,560
now
 

5783
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:47,830
now
you had

5784
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:47,840
you had
 

5785
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,149
you had
enough temperature to fail that steel in

5786
01:41:50,149 --> 01:41:50,159
enough temperature to fail that steel in
 

5787

knowledge i have from my career

5796
01:41:59,669 --> 01:41:59,679
knowledge i have from my career
 

5797
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:02,629
knowledge i have from my career
that it was just a matter of

5798
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
that it was just a matter of
 

5799
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,350
that it was just a matter of
it burned too long it burned too hot and

5800
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:05,360
it burned too long it burned too hot and
 

5801
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:06,629
it burned too long it burned too hot and
it failed

5802
01:42:06,629 --> 01:42:06,639
it failed
 

5803
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,310
it failed
i mean if you look at the way it came

5804
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:08,320
i mean if you look at the way it came
 

5805
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:09,430
i mean if you look at the way it came
down

5806
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:09,440
down
 

5807
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,070
down
it came down as it was designed to

5808
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:12,080
it came down as it was designed to
 

5809
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,750
it came down as it was designed to
in the god forbid event that it was to

5810
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:13,760
in the god forbid event that it was to
 

5811
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,470
in the god forbid event that it was to
collapse it it came down pancaking upon

5812
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:16,480
collapse it it came down pancaking upon
 

5813
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:17,750
collapse it it came down pancaking upon
itself

5814
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:17,760

if it had failed horizontally and just

5816
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:21,840
if it had failed horizontally and just
 

5817
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,390
if it had failed horizontally and just
sprayed out side to side

5818
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:24,400
sprayed out side to side
 

5819
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,830

those buildings would have dropped for a

5820
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:25,840
those buildings would have dropped for a
 

5821
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,750
those buildings would have dropped for a
quarter half a mile up to canal street

oh my gosh it could have been so much
worse i mean it you would have taken out

5830
01:42:36,709 --> 01:42:36,719
worse i mean it you would have taken out
 

5831
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:38,149
worse i mean it you would have taken out
every building you know

actually did come down
 

5873
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,590
actually did come down
but moments after we were there and

5874
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:21,600
but moments after we were there and
 

5875
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,550
but moments after we were there and
again i i would like to believe that it

5876
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:24,560
again i i would like to believe that it
 

5877
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:25,590
again i i would like to believe that it
just

5878
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:25,600
just
 

5879
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,310
just
it was just that that fuel was going

5880
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:28,320
it was just that that fuel was going
 

5881
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,070
it was just that that fuel was going
and

5882
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:30,080
and
 

5883
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,070
and
it just took its physics took its course

5884
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,080
it just took its physics took its course
 

5885
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,990
it just took its physics took its course
in it and it failed

5886
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:34,000
in it and it failed
 

5887
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,430
in it and it failed
so physics and science aside it's hard

5888
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:37,440
so physics and science aside it's hard
 

5889
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,629
so physics and science aside it's hard
uh it's both i would like to believe and

5890
01:43:40,629 --> 01:43:40,639
uh it's both i would like to believe and
 

5891
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:42,229
uh it's both i would like to believe and
it's hard to imagine that anybody would

5892
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:42,239
it's hard to imagine that anybody would
 

5893
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:44,550
it's hard to imagine that anybody would
be so evil as to orchestrate parts of

01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:44,560
be so evil as to orchestrate parts of
 

5895
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,350
be so evil as to orchestrate parts of
this

5896
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
