coined this new term livewear
which is a system that's constantly

336
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
which is a system that's constantly
 

337
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,350
which is a system that's constantly
reconfiguring itself physically

338
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
reconfiguring itself physically
 

339
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,230
reconfiguring itself physically
as it as it learns and adapts to the

340
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
as it as it learns and adapts to the
 

341
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,469
as it as it learns and adapts to the
world around it it's physically changing

342
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:38,479
world around it it's physically changing
 

343
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,029
world around it it's physically changing
so it's uh live wear meaning like as

344
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
so it's uh live wear meaning like as
 

345
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,310
so it's uh live wear meaning like as
like hardware but

346
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
like hardware but
 

347
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,430
like hardware but
changing yeah exactly well it's the

348
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
changing yeah exactly well it's the
 

349
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,790
changing yeah exactly well it's the
hardware and the software layers are

350
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
hardware and the software layers are
 

351
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,430
hardware and the software layers are
blended

352
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
blended
 

353
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,110
blended
and so um you know typically

354
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
and so um you know typically
 

355
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,950
and so um you know typically
engineers are praised for their

356
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
engineers are praised for their
 

357
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,469
engineers are praised for their
efficiency and making something really

358
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
efficiency and making something really
 

359
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,749
efficiency and making something really
clean and clear like okay here's the

360
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
clean and clear like okay here's the
 

361
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,790
clean and clear like okay here's the
hardware layer then i'm gonna run

362
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
hardware layer then i'm gonna run
 

363
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,230
hardware layer then i'm gonna run
software on top of it there's all sorts

364
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
software on top of it there's all sorts
 

365
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,870
software on top of it there's all sorts
of

366
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
of
 

367
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,029
of
universality that you get out of a piece

368
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
universality that you get out of a piece
 

369
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,629
universality that you get out of a piece
of hardware like that that's useful

370
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
of hardware like that that's useful
 

371
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,990
of hardware like that that's useful
but what the brain is doing is

372
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
but what the brain is doing is
 

373
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,390
but what the brain is doing is
completely different and i

374
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
completely different and i
 

375
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,909
completely different and i
am so excited about where this is all

376
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
am so excited about where this is all
 

377
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,309
am so excited about where this is all
going because i feel like

378
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
going because i feel like
 

379
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,550
going because i feel like
this is where our engineering will go so

380
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
this is where our engineering will go so
 

381
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,670
this is where our engineering will go so
currently we build

382
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
currently we build
 

383
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,309
currently we build
uh all our devices a particular way but

384
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
uh all our devices a particular way but
 

385
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,309
uh all our devices a particular way but
you know i can't tear half the circuitry

386
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
you know i can't tear half the circuitry
 

387
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,749
you know i can't tear half the circuitry
out of your cell phone

388
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
out of your cell phone
 

389
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,230
out of your cell phone
and expect it to still function but you

390
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
and expect it to still function but you
 

391
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,950
and expect it to still function but you
can do that

392
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
can do that
 

393
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,990
can do that
with uh with the brain so just as an

394
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
with uh with the brain so just as an

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,830
about seven years old can get one half
of their brain removed it's called the

400
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
of their brain removed it's called the
 

401
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,270
of their brain removed it's called the
hemispherectomy

402
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
hemispherectomy
 

403
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,110
hemispherectomy
and and they're fine they have a slight

404
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
and and they're fine they have a slight
 

405
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,110
and and they're fine they have a slight
limp on the other side of their body but

406
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
limp on the other side of their body but
 

407
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,430
limp on the other side of their body but
um they can function just fine that way

408
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
um they can function just fine that way
 

409
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,189
um they can function just fine that way
and uh and this is generally true you

410
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
and uh and this is generally true you
 

411
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,710
and uh and this is generally true you
know sometimes children are born without

00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
uh in our skull uh like because you said
 

449
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,390
uh in our skull uh like because you said
uh you kind of look forward to the idea

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,589
uh you kind of look forward to the idea
that uh

that uh
 

453
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,589
that uh
we might be engineering our systems like

00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
we might be engineering our systems like
 

455
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,670
we might be engineering our systems like
this in the future but creating live war

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
how hard do you think is it to create
 

461
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,909
how hard do you think is it to create
systems like that great question it has

00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
systems like that great question it has
 

463
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,589
systems like that great question it has
proven itself to be a difficult

464

proven itself to be a difficult
 

465
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,990
proven itself to be a difficult
challenge but what i mean by that is

466
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
challenge but what i mean by that is
 

467
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,150
challenge but what i mean by that is
even though it's taken evolution

468
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
even though it's taken evolution
 

469
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,390
even though it's taken evolution
a really long time to get where it is

470
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
a really long time to get where it is
 

471
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,350
a really long time to get where it is
now

472
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,360
now
 

473
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,749
now
um we all we have to do now is peek at

474
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
um we all we have to do now is peek at
 

475
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,469
um we all we have to do now is peek at
the

476
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
the
 

477
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,550
the
at the blueprints it's just three pounds

at the blueprints it's just three pounds
this organ and

480
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
this organ and
 

481
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,869
this organ and
and we just figure out how to do it but

482
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
and we just figure out how to do it but
 

483
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,909
and we just figure out how to do it but
that's the part that i mean is a

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
that's the part that i mean is a
 

485
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,830
that's the part that i mean is a
difficult challenge because

486
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
difficult challenge because
 

487
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,150
difficult challenge because
you know uh there are tens of thousands

488
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
you know uh there are tens of thousands
 

489
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,830
you know uh there are tens of thousands
of neuroscientists were all poking and

490
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
of neuroscientists were all poking and
 

491
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,029
of neuroscientists were all poking and
prodding and trying to figure this out

492
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
prodding and trying to figure this out
 

493
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,629
prodding and trying to figure this out
but it's an extremely complicated system

494
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639
but it's an extremely complicated system
 

495
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,189
but it's an extremely complicated system
but

496
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:01,199
but
 

497
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,790
but
it's only going to be complicated until

498
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
it's only going to be complicated until

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,270
it's only going to be complicated until
we figure out the general principles

500
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
we figure out the general principles
 

501
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,950
we figure out the general principles
exactly like if you you know had a magic

502
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
exactly like if you you know had a magic
 

503
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,990
exactly like if you you know had a magic
camera and you could look inside the

504
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
camera and you could look inside the
 

505
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,990
camera and you could look inside the
nucleus of a cell and you'd see

506
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
nucleus of a cell and you'd see
 

507
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,350
nucleus of a cell and you'd see
hundreds of thousands of things moving

508
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
hundreds of thousands of things moving
 

509
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,790
hundreds of thousands of things moving
around whatever and then you know it

510
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
around whatever and then you know it
 

511
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,230

takes crick and watts and say oh you
 

513
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,350
takes crick and watts and say oh you
know you're just trying to maintain the

514
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
know you're just trying to maintain the
 

515
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,189
know you're just trying to maintain the
order of the base pairs and all the rest

516
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
order of the base pairs and all the rest
 

517
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,309
order of the base pairs and all the rest
is details

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,550
is details
then it simplifies it and we come to

520
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
then it simplifies it and we come to
 

521
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,430
then it simplifies it and we come to
understand something

522
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
understand something
 

523
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,189
understand something

i think from my perspective what i've
 

565
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,350
i think from my perspective what i've
heard is there's like been debates over

566
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
heard is there's like been debates over
 

567
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,230
heard is there's like been debates over
decades about

568
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
decades about
 

569
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,509
decades about
how how much neuroplasticity there is in

570
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
how how much neuroplasticity there is in
 

571
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,949
how how much neuroplasticity there is in
the brain and so on

572
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
the brain and so on
 

573
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,710
the brain and so on
and people have learned a lot of things

574
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
and people have learned a lot of things
 

575
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,710
and people have learned a lot of things
and now it's converging towards people

576
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
and now it's converging towards people
 

577
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,070
and now it's converging towards people
that are understanding this

578
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
that are understanding this
 

579
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,230
that are understanding this
much more in europe much more plastic

580
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
much more in europe much more plastic
 

581
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,269
much more in europe much more plastic
than people realize

582
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
than people realize
 

583
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,990
than people realize
but just like linger on that topic like

584
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
but just like linger on that topic like
 

585
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,110
but just like linger on that topic like
how malleable

586
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120
how malleable
 

587
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,310
how malleable
is the hardware of the human brain

588
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
is the hardware of the human brain
 

589
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,350
is the hardware of the human brain
maybe you said children at each stage of

590
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
maybe you said children at each stage of
 

591
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,230
maybe you said children at each stage of
life

592
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
life
 

593
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,910
life
yeah so here's the whole thing i think

594
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
yeah so here's the whole thing i think
 

595
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,870
yeah so here's the whole thing i think
part of the confusion about plasticity

596
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
part of the confusion about plasticity
 

597
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,470
part of the confusion about plasticity
has been that there are studies at all

598
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
has been that there are studies at all
 

599
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,310
has been that there are studies at all
sorts of different ages

600
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
sorts of different ages
 

601
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,829
sorts of different ages
and then people might read that from a

602
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
and then people might read that from a
 

603
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,990
and then people might read that from a
distance and they think oh well

604
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
distance and they think oh well
 

605
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,230
distance and they think oh well
fred didn't recover when half his brain

606
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
fred didn't recover when half his brain
 

607
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,670
fred didn't recover when half his brain
was taken out and so

608
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
was taken out and so
 

609
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,350
was taken out and so
clearly you're not plastic but then you

610
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
clearly you're not plastic but then you
 

611
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,070
clearly you're not plastic but then you
do it with a child and they are plastic

612
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,080
do it with a child and they are plastic
 

613
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,670
do it with a child and they are plastic
and so um part of my goal here was to

614
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
and so um part of my goal here was to
 

615
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,670
and so um part of my goal here was to
pull together the tens of thousands of

616
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
pull together the tens of thousands of
 

617
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,470
pull together the tens of thousands of
papers

618
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
papers
 

619
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,590
papers
on this both from clinical work and from

620
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
on this both from clinical work and from
 

621
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,470
on this both from clinical work and from
you know all the way down to the

622
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
you know all the way down to the
 

623
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,310
you know all the way down to the
molecular and understand what are the

624
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
molecular and understand what are the
 

625
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,550
molecular and understand what are the
principles here the principles are

626
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
principles here the principles are
 

627
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,630
principles here the principles are
that plasticity diminishes that's no

628
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
that plasticity diminishes that's no
 

629
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,910
that plasticity diminishes that's no
surprise by the way we

630
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
surprise by the way we
 

631
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,430

should just define plasticity you know

632
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,440
should just define plasticity you know
 

633
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,190
should just define plasticity you know
it's the ability of a system to

634
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200
it's the ability of a system to
 

635
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,350
it's the ability of a system to
to mold into a new shape and then hold

636
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
to mold into a new shape and then hold
 

637
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,269
to mold into a new shape and then hold
that shape that's why

638
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
that shape that's why
 

639
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,870
that shape that's why
you know we make things that we call

640
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
you know we make things that we call
 

641
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,630
you know we make things that we call
plastic um

642
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
plastic um
 

643
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,550
plastic um
because they are moldable and they can

644
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
because they are moldable and they can
 

645
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,470
because they are moldable and they can
hold that new shape like a plastic toy

646
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
hold that new shape like a plastic toy
 

647
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,110
hold that new shape like a plastic toy
or something

648
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
or something
 

649
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,829
or something
and so maybe we use maybe we'll use a

650
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
and so maybe we use maybe we'll use a
 

651
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,710
and so maybe we use maybe we'll use a
lot of terms that are synonymous so

652
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
lot of terms that are synonymous so
 

653
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,790
lot of terms that are synonymous so
something is plastic something is

654
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
something is plastic something is
 

655
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,069
something is plastic something is
malleable

656
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
malleable
 

657
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,110
malleable

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,670
book is
is like so i'll tell you exactly right

662
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
is like so i'll tell you exactly right
 

663
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,670
is like so i'll tell you exactly right
but i'll tell you why i chose livewire

664
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
but i'll tell you why i chose livewire
 

665
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,750
but i'll tell you why i chose livewire
instead of plasticity so i used the term

666
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
instead of plasticity so i used the term
 

667
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,190
instead of plasticity so i used the term
plasticity in the book but

668
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
plasticity in the book but
 

669
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,470
plasticity in the book but
um but sparingly because

670
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
um but sparingly because
 

671
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,870
um but sparingly because
that was a term coined by william james

672
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
that was a term coined by william james
 

673
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,150
that was a term coined by william james
over 100 years ago

674
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
over 100 years ago
 

675
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,470
over 100 years ago
and and he was of course very impressed

676
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
and and he was of course very impressed
 

677
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,910
and and he was of course very impressed
with plastic manufacturing that you

678
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
with plastic manufacturing that you
 

679
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,710
with plastic manufacturing that you
could

680
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
could
 

681
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,750
could
mold something in shape and then it

682
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
mold something in shape and then it
 

683
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,509
mold something in shape and then it
holds that but that's not what's

684
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
holds that but that's not what's
 

685
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,269
holds that but that's not what's
actually happening in the brain

686
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
actually happening in the brain
 

687
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,350
actually happening in the brain
it's constantly rewiring your entire

688
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
it's constantly rewiring your entire
 

689
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,470
it's constantly rewiring your entire
life you never hit

690
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:04,480
life you never hit
 

691
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,430
life you never hit
an end point the whole point is for it

692
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
an end point the whole point is for it
 

693
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,550
an end point the whole point is for it
to keep changing so

694
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
to keep changing so
 

695
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,310
to keep changing so
even in the you know few minutes of

696
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,320
even in the you know few minutes of
 

697
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,670
even in the you know few minutes of
conversation that we've been having your

698
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
conversation that we've been having your
 

699
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,150
conversation that we've been having your
brain is changing my brain is changing

700
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
brain is changing my brain is changing
 

701
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,190
brain is changing my brain is changing
um next time i see your face

702
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
um next time i see your face
 

703
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,790
um next time i see your face
i will remember oh yeah like that time

704
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
i will remember oh yeah like that time
 

705
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,069
i will remember oh yeah like that time
next time i sat together and we did

706
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:20,079
next time i sat together and we did
 

707
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,269
next time i sat together and we did
these things and

708
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:21,279
these things and
 

709
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,350
these things and
i wonder if your brain will have like a

710
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
i wonder if your brain will have like a
 

711
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,949
i wonder if your brain will have like a
lex thing going on for the next few

712
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
lex thing going on for the next few
 

713
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,550
lex thing going on for the next few
months like you'll stay there until you

714
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
months like you'll stay there until you
 

715
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,670
months like you'll stay there until you
get rid of it

716
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
get rid of it
 

717
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,750
get rid of it
because it was useful for now yeah no

718
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
because it was useful for now yeah no
 

719
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,870
because it was useful for now yeah no
i'll probably never get rid of it let's

720
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
i'll probably never get rid of it let's
 

721
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,150
i'll probably never get rid of it let's
say for some circumstance you and i

722
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,160
say for some circumstance you and i
 

723
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,430
say for some circumstance you and i
don't see each other for the next 35

724
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
don't see each other for the next 35
 

725
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,150
don't see each other for the next 35
years

726
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
years
 

727
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,150
years
when i run into you i'll be like oh yeah

728
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
when i run into you i'll be like oh yeah
 

729
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,430
when i run into you i'll be like oh yeah
that looks familiar

730
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:37,440
that looks familiar
 

731
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,509
that looks familiar
yeah yeah and we yeah we sat down for a

732
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:39,519
yeah yeah and we yeah we sat down for a
 

733
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,670
yeah yeah and we yeah we sat down for a
podcast back when there were podcasts

734
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:41,680
podcast back when there were podcasts
 

735
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,389
podcast back when there were podcasts
yeah

736
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
yeah
 

737
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,150
yeah
exactly back when we lived outside

738
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
exactly back when we lived outside
 

739
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,069
exactly back when we lived outside
virtual reality yeah

740
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
virtual reality yeah
 

741
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,310
virtual reality yeah
exactly so you chose livewire exactly

742
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:50,320
exactly so you chose livewire exactly
 

743
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,949
exactly so you chose livewire exactly
exactly because plastic implies i mean

744
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
exactly because plastic implies i mean
 

745
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,310
exactly because plastic implies i mean
it's the term that's used in the field

746
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
it's the term that's used in the field
 

747
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,509
it's the term that's used in the field
and so that's why

748
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
and so that's why
 

749
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,670
and so that's why
we need to use it still uh for a while

750
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
we need to use it still uh for a while
 

751
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,949
we need to use it still uh for a while
but yeah it implies something gets

752
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
but yeah it implies something gets
 

753
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,150
but yeah it implies something gets
molded in shape and then holds that

754
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
molded in shape and then holds that
 

755
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,750
molded in shape and then holds that
shape forever but in fact the whole

756
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
shape forever but in fact the whole
 

757
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,670
shape forever but in fact the whole
system is completely changing then then

758
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
system is completely changing then then
 

759
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,670
system is completely changing then then
back to uh

760
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
back to uh
 

761
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,910
back to uh
how malleable is the human brain at each

762
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
how malleable is the human brain at each
 

763
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,790
how malleable is the human brain at each
stage of life

764
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:08,800
stage of life
 

765
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,230
stage of life
so what just at a high level

766
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
so what just at a high level
 

767
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,670
so what just at a high level
is it malleable so yes

768
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
is it malleable so yes
 

769
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,750
is it malleable so yes
and plasticity diminishes but one of the

770
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
and plasticity diminishes but one of the
 

771
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,350
and plasticity diminishes but one of the
things that i

772
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
things that i
 

773
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,030
things that i
felt like i was able to put together for

774
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
felt like i was able to put together for
 

775
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,190
felt like i was able to put together for
myself after reading thousands of papers

776
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
myself after reading thousands of papers
 

777
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,990
myself after reading thousands of papers
on this issue

778
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
on this issue
 

779
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,790
on this issue
is that different parts of the brain are

780
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
is that different parts of the brain are
 

781
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,150
is that different parts of the brain are
have different

782
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
have different
 

783
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,670
have different
plasticity windows so for example with

784
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
plasticity windows so for example with
 

785
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,190
plasticity windows so for example with
the visual cortex

786
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
the visual cortex
 

787
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,509
the visual cortex
that cements itself into place pretty

788
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
that cements itself into place pretty
 

789
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,670
that cements itself into place pretty
quickly over the course of a few years

790
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:37,680
quickly over the course of a few years
 

791
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,509
quickly over the course of a few years
and i argue that's because of the

792
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
and i argue that's because of the
 

793
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,030
and i argue that's because of the
stability of the data

794
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
stability of the data
 

795
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,790
stability of the data
in other words what you're getting in

796
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:42,800
in other words what you're getting in
 

797
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,389
in other words what you're getting in
from the world you've got a certain

798
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
from the world you've got a certain
 

799
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,590
from the world you've got a certain
number of angles

800
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,600
number of angles
 

801
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,910
number of angles
colors shapes you know it's essentially

802
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
colors shapes you know it's essentially
 

803
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,629
colors shapes you know it's essentially
the world is

804
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
the world is
 

805
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,269
the world is
visually stable so that hardens around

806
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
visually stable so that hardens around
 

807
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,310
visually stable so that hardens around
that data

808
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
that data
 

809
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,509
that data
as opposed to let's say the

810
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
as opposed to let's say the
 

811
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,590
as opposed to let's say the
somatosensory cortex which is the part

812
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
somatosensory cortex which is the part
 

813
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,949
somatosensory cortex which is the part
that's taking information from your body

814
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
that's taking information from your body
 

815
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,470
that's taking information from your body
or the motor cortex right next to it

816
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
or the motor cortex right next to it
 

817
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,230
or the motor cortex right next to it
which is what drives your body

818
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
which is what drives your body
 

819
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,829
which is what drives your body
the fact is bodies are always changing

820
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
the fact is bodies are always changing
 

821
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,629
the fact is bodies are always changing
you get taller over time you get fatter

822
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
you get taller over time you get fatter
 

823
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,550
you get taller over time you get fatter
thinner over time you you might break a

824
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
thinner over time you you might break a
 

825
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,990
thinner over time you you might break a
leg and have to limp for a while stuff

826
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
leg and have to limp for a while stuff
 

827
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,550
leg and have to limp for a while stuff
like that

828
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
like that
 

829
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,550
like that
so because the data there is always

830
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,560
so because the data there is always
 

831
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,590
so because the data there is always
changing

832
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
changing
 

833
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,790
changing
by the way you might get on a bicycle

834
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:12,800
by the way you might get on a bicycle
 

835
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,829
by the way you might get on a bicycle
you might get a surfboard things like

836
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:13,839
you might get a surfboard things like
 

837
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,590
you might get a surfboard things like
that um

838
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
that um
 

839
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,710
that um
because that data is always changing

840
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:16,720
because that data is always changing
 

841
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,190
because that data is always changing
that stays more malleable

842
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,200
that stays more malleable
 

843
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,949
that stays more malleable
and when you look through the brain you

844
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:20,959
and when you look through the brain you
 

845
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,430
and when you look through the brain you
find that it appears to be this

846
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:23,440
find that it appears to be this
 

847
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,590
find that it appears to be this
you know how stable the data is

848
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
you know how stable the data is
 

849
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,030
you know how stable the data is
determines how fast something

850
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
determines how fast something
 

851
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,949
determines how fast something
hardens into place but the point is

852
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:28,959
hardens into place but the point is
 

853
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,470
hardens into place but the point is
different parts of the brain harden into

854
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
different parts of the brain harden into
 

855
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,829
different parts of the brain harden into
place at different times

856
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
place at different times
 

857
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,870
place at different times
do you think it's possible that uh

858
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
do you think it's possible that uh
 

859
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,710
do you think it's possible that uh
depending on how much data you get on

860
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
depending on how much data you get on
 

861
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,710
depending on how much data you get on
different sensors

862
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
different sensors
 

863
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,590
different sensors
that it stays more malleable longer so

864
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
that it stays more malleable longer so
 

865
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,710
that it stays more malleable longer so
like

866
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
like
 

867
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,670
like
you know if you look at different

868
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
you know if you look at different
 

869
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,829
you know if you look at different
cultures of experience like

870
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
cultures of experience like
 

871
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,829
cultures of experience like
if you keep your eyes closed or maybe

872
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
if you keep your eyes closed or maybe
 

873
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,269
if you keep your eyes closed or maybe
you're blind i don't know but

874
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
you're blind i don't know but
 

875
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,269
you're blind i don't know but
let's say you keep your eyes closed for

876
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
let's say you keep your eyes closed for
 

877
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,790
let's say you keep your eyes closed for
your entire life

878
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
your entire life
 

879
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,829
your entire life
uh it that then the visual cortex might

880
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
uh it that then the visual cortex might
 

881
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,310
uh it that then the visual cortex might
be much

882
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
be much
 

883
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,350
be much
less malleable the reason i bring that

884
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
less malleable the reason i bring that
 

885
00:13:59,360 --> 00:13:59,590
less malleable the reason i bring that
up

886
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
up
 

887
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,910
up
is like you know well maybe we'll talk

888
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
is like you know well maybe we'll talk
 

889
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,430
is like you know well maybe we'll talk
about brain computer interfaces a little

890
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
about brain computer interfaces a little
 

891
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,310
about brain computer interfaces a little
bit and

892
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:04,320
bit and
 

893
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,150
bit and
down the line but you know like is this

894
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
down the line but you know like is this
 

895
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,189
down the line but you know like is this
uh is the malleability a genetic thing

896
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
uh is the malleability a genetic thing
 

897
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,189
uh is the malleability a genetic thing
or is it more about the data like i said

898
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
or is it more about the data like i said
 

899
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,230
or is it more about the data like i said
that comes in

900
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
that comes in
 

901
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,389
that comes in
ah so the malleability itself is a

902
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
ah so the malleability itself is a
 

903
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,829
ah so the malleability itself is a
genetic thing

904
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
genetic thing
 

905
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,030
genetic thing
the big trick that mother nature

906
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
the big trick that mother nature
 

907
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,110
the big trick that mother nature
discovered with humans is

908
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
discovered with humans is
 

909
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,150
discovered with humans is
make a system that's really flexible

910
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
make a system that's really flexible
 

911
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,430
make a system that's really flexible
as opposed to most other creatures to

912
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,440
as opposed to most other creatures to
 

913
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,030
as opposed to most other creatures to
different degrees so if you take a

914
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
different degrees so if you take a
 

915
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,910
different degrees so if you take a
an alligator it's born its brain does

916
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:31,920
an alligator it's born its brain does
 

917
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,069
an alligator it's born its brain does
the same thing every generation

918
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
the same thing every generation
 

919
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,509
the same thing every generation
if you compare an alligator a hundred

920
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
if you compare an alligator a hundred
 

921
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,870
if you compare an alligator a hundred
thousand years ago to an alligator now

922
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
thousand years ago to an alligator now
 

923
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,069
thousand years ago to an alligator now
they're essentially the same

924
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
they're essentially the same
 

925
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,590
they're essentially the same
um we on the other hand as humans drop

926
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:41,600
um we on the other hand as humans drop
 

927
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,790
um we on the other hand as humans drop
into a world with a

928
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
into a world with a
 

929
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,350
into a world with a
half-baked brain and what we require is

930
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
half-baked brain and what we require is
 

931
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,110
half-baked brain and what we require is
to absorb the culture

932
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
to absorb the culture
 

933
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,189
to absorb the culture
around us and the language and the

934
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
around us and the language and the
 

935
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,030
around us and the language and the
beliefs and the customs and so on that's

936
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
beliefs and the customs and so on that's
 

937
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,949
beliefs and the customs and so on that's
what

938
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
what
 

939
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,670
what
mother nature has done with us and it's

940
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
mother nature has done with us and it's
 

941
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,189
mother nature has done with us and it's
been a tremendously successful trick

942
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
been a tremendously successful trick
 

943
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,550
been a tremendously successful trick
we've taken over the whole planet as a

944
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
we've taken over the whole planet as a
 

945
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,990
we've taken over the whole planet as a
result of this

946
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
result of this
 

947
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,509
result of this
so that's an interesting point i mean

948
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
so that's an interesting point i mean
 

949
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,069
so that's an interesting point i mean
just to lingard that i mean this is a

950
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
just to lingard that i mean this is a
 

951
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,389
just to lingard that i mean this is a
nice feature like if you were to design

952
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
nice feature like if you were to design
 

953
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,790
nice feature like if you were to design
a thing to survive in this world

954
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
a thing to survive in this world
 

955
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,230
a thing to survive in this world
do you put it at age zero already

956
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:12,240
do you put it at age zero already
 

957
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,870
do you put it at age zero already
equipped

958
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
equipped
 

959
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,030
equipped
to deal with the world in a like

960
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
to deal with the world in a like
 

961
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,310
to deal with the world in a like
hard-coded way

962
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:16,320
hard-coded way
 

963
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,230
hard-coded way
or do you put it do you make it

964
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
or do you put it do you make it
 

965
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,829
or do you put it do you make it
malleable and just throw it in take the

966
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:19,839
malleable and just throw it in take the
 

967
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,550
malleable and just throw it in take the
risk

968
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
risk
 

969
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,350
risk
that you're maybe going to die but

970
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
that you're maybe going to die but
 

971
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,550
that you're maybe going to die but
you're going to learn a lot in the

972
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:24,560
you're going to learn a lot in the
 

973
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,110
you're going to learn a lot in the
process

974
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
process
 

975
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,110
process
and if you don't die you'll learn a hell

976
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
and if you don't die you'll learn a hell
 

977
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,790
and if you don't die you'll learn a hell
of a lot to be able to survive in the

978
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
of a lot to be able to survive in the
 

979
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,150
of a lot to be able to survive in the
environment so this is the experiment

980
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
environment so this is the experiment
 

981
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,269
environment so this is the experiment
that mother nature ran

982
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
that mother nature ran
 

983
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,990
that mother nature ran
and and it turns out that for better

984
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,000
and and it turns out that for better
 

985
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,870
and and it turns out that for better
worse we've won

986
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
worse we've won
 

987
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,870
worse we've won
i mean yeah we put other animals into

988
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
i mean yeah we put other animals into
 

989
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,990
i mean yeah we put other animals into
the zoos and we

990
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000
the zoos and we
 

991
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,509
the zoos and we
yeah that's right yeah i might do better

992
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:39,519
yeah that's right yeah i might do better
 

993
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,189
yeah that's right yeah i might do better
okay fair enough that's true

994
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,199
okay fair enough that's true
 

995
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,030
okay fair enough that's true
and and maybe what the trick mother

996
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
and and maybe what the trick mother
 

997
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,110
and and maybe what the trick mother
nature did is just the stepping stone to

998
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
nature did is just the stepping stone to
 

999
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,550
nature did is just the stepping stone to
uh to ai but

1000
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
uh to ai but
 

1001
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,550
uh to ai but
so it's that's that's a beautiful

1002
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
so it's that's that's a beautiful
 

1003
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,069
so it's that's that's a beautiful
feature of the human brain

1004
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
feature of the human brain
 

1005
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,550
feature of the human brain
that it's malleable but let's on the

1006
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
that it's malleable but let's on the
 

1007
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,629
that it's malleable but let's on the
topic of mother nature

1008
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:54,639
topic of mother nature
 

1009
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,509
topic of mother nature
what do we start with like how blank is

1010
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:57,519
what do we start with like how blank is
 

1011
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,310
what do we start with like how blank is
the slate

1012
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
the slate
 

1013
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,870
the slate
ah so it's not actually a blank slate

1014
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
ah so it's not actually a blank slate
 

1015
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,430
ah so it's not actually a blank slate
what it's

1016
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
what it's
 

1017
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,150
what it's
it's terrific engineering that's set up

1018
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
it's terrific engineering that's set up
 

1019
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,189
it's terrific engineering that's set up
in there

1020
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
in there
 

1021
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,350
in there
but much of that engineering has to do

1022
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
but much of that engineering has to do
 

1023
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,870
but much of that engineering has to do
with okay just make sure that

1024
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
with okay just make sure that
 

1025
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,230
with okay just make sure that
things get to the right place for

1026
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
things get to the right place for
 

1027
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,150
things get to the right place for
example like the fibers from the eyes

1028
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
example like the fibers from the eyes
 

1029
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,150
example like the fibers from the eyes
getting to the visual cortex or all this

1030
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
getting to the visual cortex or all this
 

1031
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,509
getting to the visual cortex or all this
very complicated machinery in the ear

1032
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
very complicated machinery in the ear
 

1033
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,069
very complicated machinery in the ear
getting

1034
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
getting
 

1035
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,749
getting
to the auditory cortex and so on so

1036
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
to the auditory cortex and so on so
 

1037
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,749
to the auditory cortex and so on so
things first of all there's that

1038
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
things first of all there's that
 

1039
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,430
things first of all there's that
and then what we also come equipped with

1040
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
and then what we also come equipped with
 

1041
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,749
and then what we also come equipped with
is the ability to absorb

1042
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
is the ability to absorb
 

1043
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,590
is the ability to absorb
language and culture and beliefs and so

1044
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
language and culture and beliefs and so
 

1045
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,870
language and culture and beliefs and so
on

1046
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
on
 

1047
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,710
on
so you're already set up for that so no

1048
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
so you're already set up for that so no
 

1049
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,389
so you're already set up for that so no
matter what you're exposed to you will

1050
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
matter what you're exposed to you will
 

1051
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,870
matter what you're exposed to you will
you will absorb some sort of language

1052
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
you will absorb some sort of language
 

1053
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,749
you will absorb some sort of language
that's the trick

1054
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
that's the trick
 

1055
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,430
that's the trick
is how do you engineer something just

1056
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
is how do you engineer something just
 

1057
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,430
is how do you engineer something just
enough that it's then a sponge that's

1058
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
enough that it's then a sponge that's
 

1059
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,910
enough that it's then a sponge that's
ready to take in and fill in the blanks

1060
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
ready to take in and fill in the blanks
 

1061
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,310
ready to take in and fill in the blanks
how much of the malleability is hardware

1062
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
how much of the malleability is hardware
 

1063
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,069
how much of the malleability is hardware
how much software is that useful at all

1064
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
how much software is that useful at all
 

1065
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:44,949
how much software is that useful at all
in the brain

1066
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:44,959
in the brain
 

1067
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,790
in the brain
so like what what are we talking about

1068
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,800
so like what what are we talking about
 

1069
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,150
so like what what are we talking about
so there's like

1070
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
so there's like
 

1071
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,990
so there's like
there's neurons there's uh synapses

1072
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
there's neurons there's uh synapses
 

1073
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,990
there's neurons there's uh synapses
and the all kinds of different synapses

1074
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
and the all kinds of different synapses
 

1075
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,990
and the all kinds of different synapses
and there's chemical communication like

1076
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
and there's chemical communication like
 

1077
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,749
and there's chemical communication like
electrical signals and there's

1078
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
electrical signals and there's
 

1079
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,310
electrical signals and there's
chemical communication from this in the

1080
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320
chemical communication from this in the
 

1081
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,389
chemical communication from this in the
synapses

1082
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:02,399
synapses
 

1083
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,990
synapses
uh what i would say

1084
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
uh what i would say
 

1085
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,189
uh what i would say
the software would be the timing and the

1086
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
the software would be the timing and the
 

1087
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,429
the software would be the timing and the
nature of the electrical signals i guess

1088
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
nature of the electrical signals i guess
 

1089
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,189
nature of the electrical signals i guess
and the hardware would be the actual

1090
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:13,199
and the hardware would be the actual
 

1091
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,350
and the hardware would be the actual
synapses so here's the thing this is why

1092
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
synapses so here's the thing this is why
 

1093
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,069
synapses so here's the thing this is why
i really

1094
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
i really
 

1095
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,669
i really
if we can i want to get away from the

1096
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
if we can i want to get away from the
 

1097
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,789
if we can i want to get away from the
hardware and software metaphor because

1098
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:20,799
hardware and software metaphor because
 

1099
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,789
hardware and software metaphor because
what happens is as activity passes

1100
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
what happens is as activity passes
 

1101
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,069
what happens is as activity passes
through the system

1102
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
through the system
 

1103
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,949
through the system
it changes things now the thing that

1104
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:26,959
it changes things now the thing that
 

1105
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,470
it changes things now the thing that
computer engineers are really used to

1106
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
computer engineers are really used to
 

1107
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,430
computer engineers are really used to
thinking about is

1108
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
thinking about is
 

1109
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,590
thinking about is
is synapses where two neurons connect of

1110
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
is synapses where two neurons connect of
 

1111
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,870
is synapses where two neurons connect of
course each neuron connects with ten

1112
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
course each neuron connects with ten
 

1113
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,909
course each neuron connects with ten
thousands of its neighbors but

1114
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
thousands of its neighbors but
 

1115
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,789
thousands of its neighbors but
at a point where they connect um what

1116
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
at a point where they connect um what
 

1117
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,909
at a point where they connect um what
we're all used to thinking about is the

1118
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
we're all used to thinking about is the
 

1119
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,350
we're all used to thinking about is the
changing of the strength of that

1120
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
changing of the strength of that
 

1121
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,710
changing of the strength of that
connection

1122
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
connection
 

1123
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,470
connection
the the synaptic weight but in fact

1124
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
the the synaptic weight but in fact
 

1125
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,070
the the synaptic weight but in fact
everything is changing the receptor

1126
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
everything is changing the receptor
 

1127
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,909
everything is changing the receptor
distribution inside that

1128
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
distribution inside that
 

1129
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,150
distribution inside that
neuron so that you're more or less

1130
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:50,160
neuron so that you're more or less
 

1131
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,750
neuron so that you're more or less
sensitive to the neurotransmitter

1132
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
sensitive to the neurotransmitter
 

1133
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,390
sensitive to the neurotransmitter
than the structure of the neuron itself

1134
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
than the structure of the neuron itself
 

1135
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,510
than the structure of the neuron itself
and and what's happening there

1136
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
and and what's happening there
 

1137
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,590
and and what's happening there
all the way down to biochemical cascades

1138
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,600
all the way down to biochemical cascades
 

1139
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,870
all the way down to biochemical cascades
inside the cell all the way down to the

1140
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
inside the cell all the way down to the
 

1141
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,070
inside the cell all the way down to the
nucleus

1142
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
nucleus
 

1143
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,230
nucleus
and for example the epigenome which is

1144
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
and for example the epigenome which is
 

1145
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,190
and for example the epigenome which is
the

the
um you know these little proteins that

1148
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
um you know these little proteins that
 

1149
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,870
um you know these little proteins that
are attached to the dna that

1150
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
are attached to the dna that
 

1151
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,110
are attached to the dna that
cause conformational changes that cause

1152
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
cause conformational changes that cause
 

1153
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,310
cause conformational changes that cause
more genes to be

1154
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
more genes to be
 

1155
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,110
more genes to be
expressed or repressed all of these

1156
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
expressed or repressed all of these
 

1157
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,870
expressed or repressed all of these
things are plastic

1158
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
things are plastic
 

1159
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,190
things are plastic
the reason that most people only talk

1160
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
the reason that most people only talk
 

1161
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,789
the reason that most people only talk
about the synaptic weights

1162
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
about the synaptic weights
 

1163
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,789
about the synaptic weights
is because that's really all we can

1164
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799
is because that's really all we can
 

1165
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,909
is because that's really all we can
measure well

1166
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
measure well
 

1167
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,190
measure well
and all this other stuff is really

1168
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
and all this other stuff is really
 

1169
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,310
and all this other stuff is really
really hard to see with our current

1170
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
really hard to see with our current
 

1171
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,909
really hard to see with our current
technology so essentially that just gets

1172
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
technology so essentially that just gets
 

1173
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,870
technology so essentially that just gets
ignored

1174
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
ignored
 

1175
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,190
ignored
but but in fact the system is plastic at

1176
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:29,200
but but in fact the system is plastic at
 

1177
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,230
but but in fact the system is plastic at
all these different levels

1178
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
all these different levels
 

1179
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,270
all these different levels
and my

1180
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
and my
 

1181
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,870
and my
my way of thinking about this is

1182
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
my way of thinking about this is
 

1183
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,190
my way of thinking about this is
an analogy to paste layers so paste

1184
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
an analogy to paste layers so paste
 

1185
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,750
an analogy to paste layers so paste
layers is a concept that stewart brand

1186
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
layers is a concept that stewart brand
 

1187
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,270
layers is a concept that stewart brand
suggested about how to think about

1188
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
suggested about how to think about
 

1189
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,190
suggested about how to think about
cities so you have

1190
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,200
cities so you have
 

1191
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,350
cities so you have
fashion which changes rapidly in cities

1192
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
fashion which changes rapidly in cities
 

1193
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,549
fashion which changes rapidly in cities
you have

1194
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
you have
 

1195
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,870
you have
um governance which changes more slowly

1196
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
um governance which changes more slowly
 

1197
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,510
um governance which changes more slowly
you have

1198
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
you have
 

1199
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,190
you have
the structure the buildings of a city

1200
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
the structure the buildings of a city
 

1201
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,549
the structure the buildings of a city
which changes more slowly all the way

1202
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:56,559
which changes more slowly all the way
 

1203
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,430
which changes more slowly all the way
down to

1204
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:57,440
down to
 

1205
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,590
down to
to nature you've got all these different

1206
00:18:59,590 --> 00:18:59,600
to nature you've got all these different
 

1207
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,190
to nature you've got all these different
layers of things that are changing at

1208
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
layers of things that are changing at
 

1209
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,430
layers of things that are changing at
different paces at different speeds

1210
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
different paces at different speeds
 

1211
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,830
different paces at different speeds
i've taken that idea and and mapped it

1212
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
i've taken that idea and and mapped it
 

1213
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,510
i've taken that idea and and mapped it
onto the brain which is to say you have

1214
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
onto the brain which is to say you have
 

1215
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,230
onto the brain which is to say you have
some

1216
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
some
 

1217
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,909
some
biochemical cascades are just changing

1218
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:09,919
biochemical cascades are just changing
 

1219
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,350
biochemical cascades are just changing
really rapidly when something happens

1220
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
really rapidly when something happens
 

1221
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,789
really rapidly when something happens
all the way down to things that are more

1222
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
all the way down to things that are more
 

1223
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,029
all the way down to things that are more
and more cemented in there

1224
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
and more cemented in there
 

1225
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,549
and more cemented in there
and this is actually uh this actually

1226
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:18,559
and this is actually uh this actually
 

1227
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,150
and this is actually uh this actually
allows us to understand a lot about

1228
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
allows us to understand a lot about
 

1229
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,350
allows us to understand a lot about
particular kinds of things that happen

1230
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
particular kinds of things that happen
 

1231
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,630
particular kinds of things that happen
for example one of the oldest

1232
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
for example one of the oldest
 

1233
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,190
for example one of the oldest
probably the oldest rule in neurology is

1234
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:25,200
probably the oldest rule in neurology is
 

1235
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,710
probably the oldest rule in neurology is
called ribose law

1236
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
called ribose law
 

1237
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,310
called ribose law
which is that older memories are more

1238
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
which is that older memories are more
 

1239
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,070
which is that older memories are more
stable than newer memories

1240
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
stable than newer memories
 

1241
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,110
stable than newer memories
so when you get old and demented

1242
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
so when you get old and demented
 

1243
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,870
so when you get old and demented
you'll be able to remember things from

1244
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
you'll be able to remember things from
 

1245
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,870
you'll be able to remember things from
your your young life maybe you'll

1246
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:36,880
your your young life maybe you'll
 

1247
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,230
your your young life maybe you'll
remember this podcast but you won't

1248
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
remember this podcast but you won't
 

1249
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,590
remember this podcast but you won't
remember what you did

1250
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
remember what you did
 

1251
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,390
remember what you did
a month ago or a year ago and this is a

1252
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:42,400
a month ago or a year ago and this is a
 

1253
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,830
a month ago or a year ago and this is a
very weird structure right

1254
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
very weird structure right
 

1255
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,190
very weird structure right
no other system works this way where

1256
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
no other system works this way where
 

1257
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,190
no other system works this way where
older memories are more stable than

1258
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,200
older memories are more stable than
 

1259
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,710
older memories are more stable than
newer members

1260
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
newer members
 

1261
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,990
newer members
but it's because through

1262
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
but it's because through
 

1263
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,830
but it's because through
time things get more and more cemented

1264
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
time things get more and more cemented
 

1265
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,630
time things get more and more cemented
into deeper layers of the system

1266
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
into deeper layers of the system
 

1267
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,669
into deeper layers of the system
and um and so this is i think the way we

1268
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
and um and so this is i think the way we
 

1269
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,510
and um and so this is i think the way we
have to think about the brain

1270
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:01,520
have to think about the brain
 

1271
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,430
have to think about the brain
not as okay you've got neurons you've

1272
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
not as okay you've got neurons you've
 

1273
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,190
not as okay you've got neurons you've
got synaptic weights and that's it

1274
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
got synaptic weights and that's it
 

1275
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,669
got synaptic weights and that's it
so yeah so the idea of live where and

1276
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
so yeah so the idea of live where and
 

1277
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,270
so yeah so the idea of live where and
live wired

1278
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,280
live wired
 

1279
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,230
live wired
is it is that it's it's like a it's a

1280
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
is it is that it's it's like a it's a
 

1281
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,909
is it is that it's it's like a it's a
gradual

1282
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
gradual
 

1283
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,029
gradual
yeah it's a gradual spectrum between

1284
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
yeah it's a gradual spectrum between
 

1285
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,149
yeah it's a gradual spectrum between
software and hardware

1286
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159
software and hardware
 

1287
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,190
software and hardware
and so the metaphors completely doesn't

1288
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200
and so the metaphors completely doesn't
 

1289
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,909
and so the metaphors completely doesn't
make sense

1290
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
make sense
 

1291
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,110
make sense
because like when you talk about

1292
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:23,120
because like when you talk about
 

1293
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,110
because like when you talk about
software and hardware it's really hard

1294
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,120
software and hardware it's really hard
 

1295
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,390
software and hardware it's really hard
lines

1296
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
lines
 

1297
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,870
lines
i mean of course software

1298
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:30,880
i mean of course software
 

1299
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,390
i mean of course software
is unlike card but even hardware but

1300
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:34,400
is unlike card but even hardware but
 

1301
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,190
is unlike card but even hardware but
like

1302
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:35,200
like
 

1303
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,870
like
so there's two groups but in the

1304
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:36,880
so there's two groups but in the
 

1305
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,149
so there's two groups but in the
software world there's levels of

1306
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
software world there's levels of
 

1307
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,070
software world there's levels of
abstractions right there's the

1308
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
abstractions right there's the
 

1309
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,070
abstractions right there's the
operating system there's machine code

1310
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
operating system there's machine code
 

1311
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,310
operating system there's machine code
and then it gets higher higher levels

1312
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,320
and then it gets higher higher levels
 

1313
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,430
and then it gets higher higher levels
but somehow that's actually

1314
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
but somehow that's actually
 

1315
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,590
but somehow that's actually
fundamentally different than

1316
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
fundamentally different than
 

1317
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,029
fundamentally different than
the layers of abstractions in the

1318
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
the layers of abstractions in the
 

1319
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,789
the layers of abstractions in the
hardware but in the brain

1320
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:50,799
hardware but in the brain
 

1321
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,549
hardware but in the brain
it's all like the same i love the city

1322
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
it's all like the same i love the city
 

1323
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,789
it's all like the same i love the city
the city metaphor i mean yeah it's kind

1324
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:56,799
the city metaphor i mean yeah it's kind
 

1325
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,950
the city metaphor i mean yeah it's kind
of mind-blowing because it

1326
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
of mind-blowing because it
 

1327
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,870
of mind-blowing because it
it's hard to know what to uh think about

1328
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:00,880
it's hard to know what to uh think about
 

1329
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,590
it's hard to know what to uh think about
that like if i were to ask the question

1330
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
that like if i were to ask the question
 

1331
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,270
that like if i were to ask the question
uh this is important question for

1332
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
uh this is important question for
 

1333
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,430
uh this is important question for
machine learning is

1334
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
machine learning is
 

1335
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,710
machine learning is
how does the brain learn so

1336
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
how does the brain learn so
 

1337
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,750
how does the brain learn so
essentially you're saying that

1338
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
essentially you're saying that
 

1339
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,390
essentially you're saying that
i mean it just learns on all of these

1340
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
i mean it just learns on all of these
 

1341
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,070
i mean it just learns on all of these
different levels at all different

1342
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
different levels at all different
 

1343
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,710
different levels at all different
paces exactly right and as a result what

1344
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,720
paces exactly right and as a result what
 

1345
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,350
paces exactly right and as a result what
happens is

1346
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,360
happens is
 

1347
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,950
happens is
as you practice something you get good

1348
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:22,960
as you practice something you get good
 

1349
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,390
as you practice something you get good
at something

1350
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
at something
 

1351
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,549
at something
you're physically changing the circuitry

1352
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
you're physically changing the circuitry
 

1353
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,630
you're physically changing the circuitry
you're you're adapting your brain

1354
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
you're you're adapting your brain
 

1355
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,190
you're you're adapting your brain
around the thing that is relevant to you

1356
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
around the thing that is relevant to you
 

1357
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,270
around the thing that is relevant to you
so let's say you take up

1358
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
so let's say you take up
 

1359
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,510
so let's say you take up
um do you know how to surf no okay great

1360
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
um do you know how to surf no okay great
 

1361
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,110
um do you know how to surf no okay great
so let's say you take up surfing

1362
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
so let's say you take up surfing
 

1363
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,830
so let's say you take up surfing
yeah now at this age um what happens is

1364
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
yeah now at this age um what happens is
 

1365
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,029
yeah now at this age um what happens is
you know you'll be terrible at first you

1366
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039
you know you'll be terrible at first you
 

1367
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,070
you know you'll be terrible at first you
know how to operate your body you know

1368
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,080
know how to operate your body you know
 

1369
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,830
know how to operate your body you know
how to read the waves things like that

1370
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:43,840
how to read the waves things like that
 

1371
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,149
how to read the waves things like that
and

1372
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
and
 

1373
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,590
and
through time you get better and better

1374
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
through time you get better and better
 

1375
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,870
through time you get better and better
what you're doing is you're burning that

1376
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:46,880
what you're doing is you're burning that
 

1377
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,549
what you're doing is you're burning that
into the actual circuitry of your brain

1378
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
into the actual circuitry of your brain
 

1379
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,270
into the actual circuitry of your brain
you're of course

1380
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
you're of course
 

1381
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,710
you're of course
conscious when you're first doing it

1382
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:50,720
conscious when you're first doing it
 

1383
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,830
conscious when you're first doing it
you're thinking about okay where am i

1384
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
you're thinking about okay where am i
 

1385
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,110
you're thinking about okay where am i
doing what's my body weight

1386
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
doing what's my body weight
 

1387
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,950
doing what's my body weight
um but eventually when you become a pro

1388
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
um but eventually when you become a pro
 

1389
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,110
um but eventually when you become a pro
at it you are not conscious of it at all

1390
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
at it you are not conscious of it at all
 

1391
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,070
at it you are not conscious of it at all
in fact you can't even

1392
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,080
in fact you can't even
 

1393
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,230
in fact you can't even
unpack what it is that you did think

1394
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,240
unpack what it is that you did think
 

1395
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,830
unpack what it is that you did think
about riding a bicycle you

1396
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:01,840
about riding a bicycle you
 

1397
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,990
about riding a bicycle you
you can't describe how you're doing

1398
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,000
you can't describe how you're doing
 

1399
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,110
you can't describe how you're doing
you're just doing you're changing your

1400
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
you're just doing you're changing your
 

1401
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,390
you're just doing you're changing your
balance when you come you know you do

1402
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:06,400
balance when you come you know you do
 

1403
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,990
balance when you come you know you do
this to go to a stop and so

1404
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,000
this to go to a stop and so
 

1405
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,470
this to go to a stop and so
so um this is what we're constantly

1406
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
so um this is what we're constantly
 

1407
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,029
so um this is what we're constantly
doing is

1408
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,039
doing is
 

1409
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,549
doing is
actually shaping our own circuitry based

1410
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
actually shaping our own circuitry based
 

1411
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,909
actually shaping our own circuitry based
on what is relevant for us

1412
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:15,919
on what is relevant for us
 

1413
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,909
on what is relevant for us
survival of course being the the top

1414
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
survival of course being the the top
 

1415
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,669
survival of course being the the top
thing that's relevant but interestingly

1416
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
thing that's relevant but interestingly
 

1417
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,830
thing that's relevant but interestingly
especially with humans we have these

1418
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:21,840
especially with humans we have these
 

1419
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,830
especially with humans we have these
particular goals in our lives computer

1420
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:23,840
particular goals in our lives computer
 

1421
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,510
particular goals in our lives computer
science neuroscience whatever

1422
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
science neuroscience whatever
 

1423
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,270
science neuroscience whatever
and so we actually shape our circuitry

1424
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,280
and so we actually shape our circuitry
 

1425
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,549
and so we actually shape our circuitry
around that

1426
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:28,559
around that
 

1427
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,909
around that
i mean you mentioned this gets slower

1428
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:29,919
i mean you mentioned this gets slower
 

1429
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,310
i mean you mentioned this gets slower
and slower with age but is there

1430
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,320
and slower with age but is there
 

1431
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,789
and slower with age but is there
like i've i think i've uh read and

1432
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
like i've i think i've uh read and
 

1433
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:35,350
like i've i think i've uh read and
spoken

1434
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,360
spoken
 

1435
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,870
spoken
offline even on this podcast

1436
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
offline even on this podcast
 

1437
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,510
offline even on this podcast
developmental neurobiologist i guess

1438
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:41,520
developmental neurobiologist i guess
 

1439
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,270
developmental neurobiologist i guess
would be the right terminology

1440
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,280
would be the right terminology
 

1441
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,750
would be the right terminology
is like looking at the very early like

1442
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
is like looking at the very early like
 

1443
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,230
is like looking at the very early like
from from embryonic stem cells to like

1444
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
from from embryonic stem cells to like
 

1445
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,549
from from embryonic stem cells to like
to the to the creation of the brain and

1446
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
to the to the creation of the brain and
 

1447
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,149
to the to the creation of the brain and
like that's like

1448
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:52,159
like that's like
 

1449
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,390
like that's like
what that's mind-blowing how much stuff

1450
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:54,400
what that's mind-blowing how much stuff
 

1451
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,190
what that's mind-blowing how much stuff
happens there

1452
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
happens there
 

1453
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,149
happens there
so it's very malleable at that stage uh

1454
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
so it's very malleable at that stage uh
 

1455
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,190
so it's very malleable at that stage uh
it's

1456
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,200
it's
 

1457
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,149
it's
and then but after that at which point

1458
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
and then but after that at which point
 

1459
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,230
and then but after that at which point
does it stop being malleable

1460
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
does it stop being malleable
 

1461
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,149
does it stop being malleable
so so that's the interesting thing is

1462
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
so so that's the interesting thing is
 

1463
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,390
so so that's the interesting thing is
that it remains valuable your whole life

1464
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
that it remains valuable your whole life
 

1465
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,190
that it remains valuable your whole life
so even

1466
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,200
so even
 

1467
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,549
so even
when you're an old person you'll be able

1468
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
when you're an old person you'll be able
 

1469
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,190
when you're an old person you'll be able
to remember new faces and names you'll

1470
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
to remember new faces and names you'll
 

1471
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,750
to remember new faces and names you'll
be able to learn new sorts of tasks

1472
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
be able to learn new sorts of tasks
 

1473
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,110
be able to learn new sorts of tasks
and thank goodness because the world is

1474
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
and thank goodness because the world is
 

1475
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,789
and thank goodness because the world is
changing rapidly in terms of technology

1476
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:18,799
changing rapidly in terms of technology
 

1477
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:19,510
changing rapidly in terms of technology
and so on

1478
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:19,520
and so on
 

1479
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,750
and so on
i just sent my mother and alexa and she

1480
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
i just sent my mother and alexa and she
 

1481
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,950
i just sent my mother and alexa and she
you know figured out how to go on the

1482
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
you know figured out how to go on the
 

1483
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,990
you know figured out how to go on the
settings and do the thing and i was

1484
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
settings and do the thing and i was
 

1485
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,590
settings and do the thing and i was
really yeah i was really impressed by

1486
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600
really yeah i was really impressed by
 

1487
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,830
really yeah i was really impressed by
that she was able to do it so there are

1488
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
that she was able to do it so there are
 

1489
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,350
that she was able to do it so there are
parts of the brain that remain malleable

1490
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
parts of the brain that remain malleable
 

1491
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,470
parts of the brain that remain malleable
their whole life

1492
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
their whole life
 

1493
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,669
their whole life
the interesting part is that really your

1494
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
the interesting part is that really your
 

1495
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,149
the interesting part is that really your
goal

1496
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
goal
 

1497
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,669
goal
is to make an internal model of the

1498
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
is to make an internal model of the
 

1499
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,310
is to make an internal model of the
world your goal is to say

1500
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,320
world your goal is to say
 

1501
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,510
world your goal is to say
okay the brain uh is trapped in silence

1502
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
okay the brain uh is trapped in silence
 

1503
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,789
okay the brain uh is trapped in silence
and darkness and it's trying to

1504
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
and darkness and it's trying to
 

1505
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,430
and darkness and it's trying to
understand

1506
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440
understand
 

1507
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,070
understand
how the world works out there right i

1508
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
how the world works out there right i
 

1509
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,029
how the world works out there right i
love that image

1510
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
love that image
 

1511
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,590
love that image
yeah i guess it is yeah you forget you

1512
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
yeah i guess it is yeah you forget you
 

1513
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,310
yeah i guess it is yeah you forget you
forget

1514
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
forget
 

1515

forget
it's like this this lonely thing is

1516
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,120
it's like this this lonely thing is
 

1517
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,190
it's like this this lonely thing is
sitting in its own container and uh

1518
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
sitting in its own container and uh
 

1519
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,149
sitting in its own container and uh
trying to actually

1520
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:56,159
trying to actually
 

1521
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,830
trying to actually
throw a few sensors figure out what the

1522
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
throw a few sensors figure out what the
 

1523
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,029
throw a few sensors figure out what the
what the hell's going on you know what i

1524
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
what the hell's going on you know what i
 

1525
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,710
what the hell's going on you know what i
sometimes think about is um

1526
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:00,720
sometimes think about is um
 

1527
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,470
sometimes think about is um
the that movie the martian with matt

1528
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480
the that movie the martian with matt
 

1529
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,390
the that movie the martian with matt
damon the um

damon the um
 

1531
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,669
damon the um
it was written in a book of course but

1532
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:05,679
it was written in a book of course but
 

1533
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,390
it was written in a book of course but
the the movie poster shows matt damon

1534
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
the the movie poster shows matt damon
 

1535
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,310
the the movie poster shows matt damon
all alone on the red planet and i think

1536
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
all alone on the red planet and i think
 

1537
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,470
all alone on the red planet and i think
god that's actually what it's like

1538
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
god that's actually what it's like
 

1539
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,590
god that's actually what it's like
to be inside your head and my head and

1540
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
to be inside your head and my head and
 

1541
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,830
to be inside your head and my head and
anybody's head is that

1542
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:17,840
anybody's head is that
 

1543
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,590
anybody's head is that
you're essentially on your own planet in

1544
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
you're essentially on your own planet in
 

1545
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,350
you're essentially on your own planet in
there and i'm essentially on my own

1546
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,360
there and i'm essentially on my own
 

1547
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,669
there and i'm essentially on my own
planet everyone's got their own

1548
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:23,679
planet everyone's got their own
 

1549
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,990
planet everyone's got their own
world where you've absorbed all of your

1550
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,000
world where you've absorbed all of your
 

1551
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,789
world where you've absorbed all of your
experiences

1552
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:26,799
experiences
 

1553
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,390
experiences
up to this moment in your life that made

1554
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,400
up to this moment in your life that made
 

1555
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,990
up to this moment in your life that made
you exactly who you are and

1556
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,000
you exactly who you are and
 

1557
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,350
you exactly who you are and
same for me and everyone and um

1558
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,360
same for me and everyone and um
 

1559
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,029
same for me and everyone and um
and we've got this very thin bandwidth

1560
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
and we've got this very thin bandwidth
 

1561
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,789
and we've got this very thin bandwidth
of communication

1562
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
of communication
 

1563
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,350
of communication
and i'll say something like oh yeah that

1564
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:39,360
and i'll say something like oh yeah that
 

1565
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,830
and i'll say something like oh yeah that
tastes

1566
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
tastes
 

1567
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,590
tastes
just like peaches and you'll say oh i

1568
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,600
just like peaches and you'll say oh i
 

1569
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,870
just like peaches and you'll say oh i
know what you mean

1570
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
know what you mean
 

1571
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,789
know what you mean
but the experience of course might be

1572
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
but the experience of course might be
 

1573
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,070
but the experience of course might be
might be vastly different for

1574
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,080
might be vastly different for
 

1575
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,110
might be vastly different for
us um but anyway yes so the brain is

1576
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
us um but anyway yes so the brain is
 

1577
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,950
us um but anyway yes so the brain is
trapped in silence and darkness each one

1578
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:50,960
trapped in silence and darkness each one
 

1579
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,750
trapped in silence and darkness each one
of us

1580
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:51,760
of us
 

1581
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,590
of us
and what it's trying to do this is the

1582
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
and what it's trying to do this is the
 

1583
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,870
and what it's trying to do this is the
important part is trying to make an

1584
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
important part is trying to make an
 

1585
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,310
important part is trying to make an
internal model of what's going on out

1586
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
internal model of what's going on out
 

1587
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,510
internal model of what's going on out
there as in how do i function in the

1588
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,520
there as in how do i function in the
 

1589
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,789
there as in how do i function in the
world

1590
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
world
 

1591
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,470
world
how do i how do i interact with other

1592
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
how do i how do i interact with other
 

1593
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,990
how do i how do i interact with other
people do i say something

1594
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,000
people do i say something
 

1595
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,190
people do i say something
nice and polite or do i say something

1596
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,200
nice and polite or do i say something
 

1597
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,950
nice and polite or do i say something
aggressive and mean do i you know all

1598
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
aggressive and mean do i you know all
 

1599
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,549
aggressive and mean do i you know all
these things that it's putting together

1600
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:06,559
these things that it's putting together
 

1601
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,710
these things that it's putting together
about the world

1602
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
about the world
 

1603
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,870
about the world
and i think what happens when people get

1604
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:10,880
and i think what happens when people get
 

1605
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,310
and i think what happens when people get
older and older

1606
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
older and older
 

1607
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,870
older and older
it may not be that plasticity is

1608
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:14,880
it may not be that plasticity is
 

1609
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,230
it may not be that plasticity is
diminishing it may be that their

1610
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,240
diminishing it may be that their
 

1611
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,149
diminishing it may be that their
internal model essentially

1612
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
internal model essentially
 

1613
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,070
internal model essentially
has set itself up in a way where it says

1614
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,080
has set itself up in a way where it says
 

1615
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,669
has set itself up in a way where it says
okay i've pretty much got a really good

1616
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:21,679
okay i've pretty much got a really good
 

1617
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,950
okay i've pretty much got a really good
understanding of the world now and i

1618
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960
understanding of the world now and i
 

1619
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,110
understanding of the world now and i
don't really need to change

1620
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
don't really need to change
 

1621
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,750
don't really need to change
right so when old when when much older

1622
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:27,760
right so when old when when much older
 

1623
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,350
right so when old when when much older
people find themselves in a situation

1624
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
people find themselves in a situation
 

1625
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,789
people find themselves in a situation
where they need to change

1626
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
where they need to change
 

1627
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,350
where they need to change
they can actually are able to do it it's

1628
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
they can actually are able to do it it's
 

1629
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,950
they can actually are able to do it it's
just that i think this notion that we

1630

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,830
just that i think this notion that we
all have that

all have that
 

1633
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,230
all have that

um but if you were 80 and you got fired

1640
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
um but if you were 80 and you got fired
 

1641
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,110
um but if you were 80 and you got fired
from your job and suddenly had to

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
from your job and suddenly had to
 

1643
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,870
from your job and suddenly had to
figure out how to program a wordpress

1644
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
figure out how to program a wordpress
 

1645
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,950
figure out how to program a wordpress

but let me ask the the highest challenge

1652
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
but let me ask the the highest challenge

00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
at the very basic applications and then
 

1679
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,870
at the very basic applications and then
like the futuristic kind of thoughts

1680
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
like the futuristic kind of thoughts
 

1681
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,029
like the futuristic kind of thoughts
yeah first of all it's terrific that

1682
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,039
yeah first of all it's terrific that
 

1683
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,310
yeah first of all it's terrific that
people are jumping and doing that

people are jumping and doing that
 

1685
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,669
people are jumping and doing that
because it's clearly the

1686
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:33,679
because it's clearly the
 

1687
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,590
because it's clearly the
the future the interesting part is our

1688
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
the future the interesting part is our
 

1689
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,350
the future the interesting part is our
brains have pretty good methods of

so maybe it's your fat thumbs on a cell

1694
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:40,960
so maybe it's your fat thumbs on a cell
 

1695
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,230
so maybe it's your fat thumbs on a cell
phone or something but

phone or something but
 

1697
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,149
phone or something but
um or maybe it's watching a youtube

1698
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:44,159
um or maybe it's watching a youtube
 

1699
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,750
um or maybe it's watching a youtube
video getting into your eye that way

1700
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
video getting into your eye that way
 

1701
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,750
video getting into your eye that way
but we have pretty rapid ways of

1702
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
but we have pretty rapid ways of
 

1703
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,029
but we have pretty rapid ways of
communicating with technology and

1704
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
communicating with technology and
 

1705
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:49,990
communicating with technology and
getting data

1706
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,000
getting data
 

1707
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,789
getting data
so if you actually crack open the skull

1708
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:52,799
so if you actually crack open the skull
 

1709
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,870
so if you actually crack open the skull
and go into the inner sanctum of the

1710
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
and go into the inner sanctum of the
 

1711
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,909
and go into the inner sanctum of the
brain

1712

brain
 

1713
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,750
brain
um you might be able to get a little bit

1714
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:57,760
um you might be able to get a little bit
 

1715
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,269
um you might be able to get a little bit
faster but i'll tell you

1716
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:01,279

 

1717
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,110

i i'm i'm not so sanguine on the

1718
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
i i'm i'm not so sanguine on the
 

1719
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,789
i i'm i'm not so sanguine on the
future of that as a business and i'll

1720
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:06,799
future of that as a business and i'll
 

1721
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,950
future of that as a business and i'll
tell you why it's because

1722
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:08,960
tell you why it's because
 

1723
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,470
tell you why it's because
there are various ways of getting data

1724
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
there are various ways of getting data
 

1725
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,230
there are various ways of getting data
in and out and

1726
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,240
in and out and
 

1727
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,390
in and out and
an open head surgery is a big deal

1728
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:14,400
an open head surgery is a big deal
 

1729
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,390
an open head surgery is a big deal
neurosurgeons don't want to do it

1730
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:16,400
neurosurgeons don't want to do it
 

1731
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,990
neurosurgeons don't want to do it
because there's always risk of death and

1732
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,000
because there's always risk of death and
 

1733
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,750
because there's always risk of death and
infection on the table

1734
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
infection on the table
 

1735
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,470
infection on the table
and also it's not clear how many people

1736
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:22,480
and also it's not clear how many people
 

1737
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,149
and also it's not clear how many people
would say i'm going to volunteer to get

1738
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:24,159
would say i'm going to volunteer to get
 

1739
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,909
would say i'm going to volunteer to get
something in my head

1740
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:25,919
something in my head
 

1741
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,789
something in my head
so that i can text faster you know 20

1742
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:28,799
so that i can text faster you know 20
 

1743
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,669
so that i can text faster you know 20
faster

1744
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
faster
 

1745
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,389
faster
so i think it's you know mother nature

1746
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:32,399
so i think it's you know mother nature
 

1747
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,149
so i think it's you know mother nature
surrounds the brain with this

armored you know bunker of the skull
 

1751
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,510
armored you know bunker of the skull
because it's a very delicate material

1752
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,520
because it's a very delicate material
 

1753

um about

1758
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
um about
 

1759
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,950
um about
the brain is you know the person is

1760
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
the brain is you know the person is
 

1761
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,630
the brain is you know the person is
never the same after you open up their

1762
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,640
never the same after you open up their
 

1763
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,070
never the same after you open up their
skull now whether or not that's true or

1764
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
skull now whether or not that's true or
 

1765
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,029

whatever
 

1767
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,269
whatever
who cares but it's a big deal to do in

1768
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
who cares but it's a big deal to do in
 

1769
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,630
who cares but it's a big deal to do in
open head surgery so

1770
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
open head surgery so
 

1771
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,789
open head surgery so
what i'm interested in is how can we get

1772
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,799
what i'm interested in is how can we get
 

1773
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,149
what i'm interested in is how can we get
information in and out of the brain

1774
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
information in and out of the brain
 

1775
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,549
information in and out of the brain
without having to crack the skull open

1776
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:00,559
without having to crack the skull open
 

1777
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,990
without having to crack the skull open
got it without messing with the

1778
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
got it without messing with the
 

1779
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,830
got it without messing with the
biologicals the part like

1780
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
biologicals the part like
 

1781
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,549
biologicals the part like
directly uh connecting or messing with

1782
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:06,559
directly uh connecting or messing with
 

1783
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,669
directly uh connecting or messing with
the with the

1784
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:07,679
the with the
 

1785
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,830
the with the
intricate biological thing that we got

1786
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
intricate biological thing that we got
 

1787
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,750
intricate biological thing that we got
going on it seems to be working

1788
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:11,760
going on it seems to be working
 

1789
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,470
going on it seems to be working
yeah exactly and by the way where neural

1790
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:14,480
yeah exactly and by the way where neural
 

1791
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,389
yeah exactly and by the way where neural
link is going which is wonderful is

1792
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:16,399
link is going which is wonderful is
 

1793
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,029
link is going which is wonderful is
going to be

1794
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
going to be
 

1795
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,269
going to be
in patient cases it really matters for

1796
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
in patient cases it really matters for
 

1797
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,269
in patient cases it really matters for
all kinds of surgeries that a person

1798
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
all kinds of surgeries that a person
 

1799
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,710
all kinds of surgeries that a person
needs whether for parkinson's or

1800
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:22,720
needs whether for parkinson's or
 

1801
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,830
needs whether for parkinson's or
epilepsy or whatever

1802
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
epilepsy or whatever
 

1803
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,909
epilepsy or whatever
it's a terrific new technology for

1804
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:25,919
it's a terrific new technology for
 

1805
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,590
it's a terrific new technology for
essentially sowing electrodes in there

1806
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:27,600
essentially sowing electrodes in there
 

1807
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,710
essentially sowing electrodes in there
and getting more

1808
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:28,720
and getting more
 

1809
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,230
and getting more
higher density of electrodes so that's

1810
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
higher density of electrodes so that's
 

1811
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,310
higher density of electrodes so that's
great i just don't think as far as the

1812
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
great i just don't think as far as the
 

1813
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,230
great i just don't think as far as the
future of bci goes

1814
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,240
future of bci goes
 

1815
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,990
future of bci goes
i don't suspect that people will go in

1816
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,000
i don't suspect that people will go in
 

1817
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,590
i don't suspect that people will go in
and say yeah drill a hole in my head and

1818
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
and say yeah drill a hole in my head and
 

1819
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,470
and say yeah drill a hole in my head and
do that

1820
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
do that
 

1821
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,950
do that
well it's interesting because uh i think

1822
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:42,960
well it's interesting because uh i think
 

1823
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,470
well it's interesting because uh i think
there's a similar intuition but

1824
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
there's a similar intuition but
 

1825
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,630
there's a similar intuition but
say in the world of autonomous vehicles

1826
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
say in the world of autonomous vehicles
 

1827
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,830
say in the world of autonomous vehicles
that folks

1828
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
that folks
 

1829
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,710
that folks
know how hard it is and it seems damn

1830
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
know how hard it is and it seems damn
 

1831
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,350
know how hard it is and it seems damn
impossible

1832
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:51,360
impossible

the similar intuition about i'm sticking
on the elon musk thing is just a good

1836
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
on the elon musk thing is just a good
 

1837
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,830
on the elon musk thing is just a good
easy example uh similar intuition about

colonizing mars

1840
00:28:59,590 --> 00:28:59,600
colonizing mars
 

1841
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,510
colonizing mars
it like if you really think about it it

1842
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:01,520
it like if you really think about it it
 

1843
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,350
it like if you really think about it it
seems extremely

1844
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,360
seems extremely
 

1845
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,630
seems extremely
difficult and uh and almost

1846
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:06,640
difficult and uh and almost
 

1847
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,269
difficult and uh and almost
i mean just technically difficult to the

1848
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
i mean just technically difficult to the
 

1849
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,389
i mean just technically difficult to the
to a degree

1850

where you want to ask is it really worth

1852
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,960
where you want to ask is it really worth
 

1853
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,990
where you want to ask is it really worth
doing

1854
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,000
doing
 

1855
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,990
doing
worth trying and then the same the same

1856
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,000
worth trying and then the same the same
 

1857
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,990

is applied with bci
 

1859
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,669
is applied with bci
but the thing about the future

1860
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:21,679
but the thing about the future
 

1861
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,909
but the thing about the future
is it's hard to predict uh the the

1862
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
is it's hard to predict uh the the
 

1863
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,669
is it's hard to predict uh the the
exciting thing to me

1864
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
exciting thing to me
 

1865
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,710
exciting thing to me
with uh so once it does once

1866
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
with uh so once it does once

if successful it's able to help patients
 

1869
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,549
if successful it's able to help patients
it may be

1870
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:32,559
it may be
 

1871
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,669
it may be
able to discover something uh

1872
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:35,679
able to discover something uh
 

1873
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,830
able to discover something uh
very surprising about our ability to

1874
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
very surprising about our ability to
 

1875
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,990
very surprising about our ability to
directly communicate with the brain so

1876
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
directly communicate with the brain so
 

1877
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,510
directly communicate with the brain so
exactly what you're interested in is

1878

exactly what you're interested in is
 

1879
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,590
exactly what you're interested in is
figuring out how to

figuring out how to
 

1881
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,870
figuring out how to
uh play with this malleable brain but

1882
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
uh play with this malleable brain but
 

1883
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,990
uh play with this malleable brain but
like help assist it somehow i mean it's

1884
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
like help assist it somehow i mean it's
 

1885
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,149
like help assist it somehow i mean it's
such a compelling notion to me

1886
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:52,159
such a compelling notion to me
 

1887
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,909
such a compelling notion to me
that we're now working on all these

1888
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:53,919
that we're now working on all these
 

1889
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,830
that we're now working on all these
exciting machine learning systems

1890
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:55,840
exciting machine learning systems
 

1891
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,950
exciting machine learning systems
that are able to learn you know

1892
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:58,960
that are able to learn you know
 

1893
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,149
that are able to learn you know
from data and then if we can

1894
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
from data and then if we can
 

1895
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,710
from data and then if we can
have this other brain that's a learning

1896
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
have this other brain that's a learning
 

1897
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,510
have this other brain that's a learning
system

them to be able to communicate it's like

1904
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:11,919
them to be able to communicate it's like
 

1905
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,029
them to be able to communicate it's like
a

00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
go so they can play with each other the
 

1913
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,350
go so they can play with each other the

computer and the brain
like when you sleep i mean there's a lot

1916
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
like when you sleep i mean there's a lot
 

1917
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,870
like when you sleep i mean there's a lot
of futuristic kind of things that

1918
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:24,880
of futuristic kind of things that
 

1919
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,830
of futuristic kind of things that
it's just um exciting possibilities but

1920
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:27,840
it's just um exciting possibilities but
 

1921
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,710
it's just um exciting possibilities but
i hear you

1922
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:28,720
i hear you
 

1923
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,230
i hear you
we understand so little about the actual

1924
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,240
we understand so little about the actual
 

1925
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,230
we understand so little about the actual
intricacies of the communication of the

1926
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
intricacies of the communication of the
 

1927
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,549
intricacies of the communication of the
brain that it's hard to

1928
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
brain that it's hard to
 

1929
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,909
brain that it's hard to
find the common language well

1930
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:39,919
find the common language well
 

1931
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,950
find the common language well
interestingly the

1932
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
interestingly the
 

1933
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,990
interestingly the
technologies that have been built don't

1934
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,000
technologies that have been built don't
 

1935
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,830
technologies that have been built don't
actually require the perfect common

1936
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:47,840
actually require the perfect common
 

1937
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,389
actually require the perfect common
language so for example hundreds of

1938
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:50,399
language so for example hundreds of
 

1939
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,430
language so for example hundreds of
thousands of people are walking around

1940
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,440
thousands of people are walking around
 

1941
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,430
thousands of people are walking around
with artificial ears and artificial eyes

1942
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,440
with artificial ears and artificial eyes
 

1943
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,310
with artificial ears and artificial eyes
meaning cochlear implants or retinal

1944
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
meaning cochlear implants or retinal
 

1945
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,669
meaning cochlear implants or retinal
implants so this is

1946
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
implants so this is
 

1947
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,430
implants so this is
you know you take uh essentially digital

1948
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,440
you know you take uh essentially digital
 

1949
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,509
you know you take uh essentially digital
microphone you slip an electrode strip

1950
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:01,519
microphone you slip an electrode strip
 

1951
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,190
microphone you slip an electrode strip
into the inner ear

1952

kind of
 

2123
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,870
kind of
it's you know we're not probably not

2124
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
it's you know we're not probably not
 

2125

it's you know we're not probably not
giving the brain enough credit like

2126
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,120
giving the brain enough credit like
 

2127
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,430
giving the brain enough credit like
this this thing this thing is just fine

2128
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:39,440
this this thing this thing is just fine
 

2129
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,389
this this thing this thing is just fine
with new tech oh

2130
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:40,399
with new tech oh
 

2131
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,909
with new tech oh
exactly it wraps itself around by the

2132
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
exactly it wraps itself around by the

way wait till you have kids you'll see

2134
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600
way wait till you have kids you'll see
 

2135
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,750
way wait till you have kids you'll see
the ease with which they pick up on

2136
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:45,760
the ease with which they pick up on
 

2137
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,350
the ease with which they pick up on
stuff and

2138
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,360
stuff and
 

2139
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,430
stuff and
yeah as kevin kelly said um technology

2140
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
yeah as kevin kelly said um technology
 

2141
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,310
yeah as kevin kelly said um technology
is what gets invented after you're born

2142
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:54,320
is what gets invented after you're born
 

2143
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,830
is what gets invented after you're born
but the stuff that already exists when

2144
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:55,840
but the stuff that already exists when
 

2145
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,950
but the stuff that already exists when
you're born that's not even tech that's

2146
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:56,960
you're born that's not even tech that's
 

2147
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,470
you're born that's not even tech that's
just background furniture like the fact

2148
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:58,480
just background furniture like the fact
 

2149
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,389
just background furniture like the fact
that the ipad exists for my son and

2150
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:00,399
that the ipad exists for my son and
 

2151
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,750
that the ipad exists for my son and
daughter like that's just background

2152
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:01,760
daughter like that's just background
 

2153
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,110
daughter like that's just background
furniture so

2154
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
furniture so
 

2155
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,310
furniture so
um yeah it's um because we have this

2156
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:06,320
um yeah it's um because we have this
 

2157
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,110
um yeah it's um because we have this
incredibly

2158
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,120
incredibly
 

2159
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,190
incredibly
malleable system it just absorbs

2160
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
malleable system it just absorbs
 

2161
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,550
malleable system it just absorbs
whatever is going on in the world and

2162
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:10,560
whatever is going on in the world and
 

2163
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,669
whatever is going on in the world and
learns what to do with it

2164
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:11,679
learns what to do with it
 

2165
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,310
learns what to do with it
so do you think just to linger for for a

2166
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,320
so do you think just to linger for for a
 

2167
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,510
so do you think just to linger for for a
little bit more

2168
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:15,520
little bit more
 

2169
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,669
little bit more
do you think it's possible to

2170
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:20,679
do you think it's possible to
 

2171
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,629
do you think it's possible to
co-adjust like

2172
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:22,639
co-adjust like
 

2173
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,589
co-adjust like
we're kind of uh you know for the

2174
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
we're kind of uh you know for the
 

2175
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,389
we're kind of uh you know for the
machine

2176
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
machine
 

2177
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,310
machine
to adjust to the brain for the brain to

2178
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:28,320
to adjust to the brain for the brain to
 

2179
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,909
to adjust to the brain for the brain to
adjust the machine i guess that's what's

2180
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:29,919
adjust the machine i guess that's what's
 

2181
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:31,030
adjust the machine i guess that's what's
already happening

2182
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
already happening
 

2183
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,470
already happening
sure that is what's happening so for

2184
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:32,480
sure that is what's happening so for
 

2185
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,550
sure that is what's happening so for
example when when you put electrodes in

2186
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:34,560
example when when you put electrodes in
 

2187
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,790
example when when you put electrodes in
the motor cortex to control a robotic

2188
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:36,800
the motor cortex to control a robotic
 

2189
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,030
the motor cortex to control a robotic
arm for somebody who's paralyzed

2190
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,040
arm for somebody who's paralyzed
 

2191
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,790
arm for somebody who's paralyzed
the engineers do a lot of work to figure

2192
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:40,800
the engineers do a lot of work to figure
 

2193
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,069
the engineers do a lot of work to figure
out okay what can we do with the

2194
00:34:42,069 --> 00:34:42,079
out okay what can we do with the
 

2195
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,430
out okay what can we do with the
algorithm here so that we can detect

2196
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:43,440
algorithm here so that we can detect
 

2197
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,510
algorithm here so that we can detect
what's going on from these cells

2198
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:45,520
what's going on from these cells
 

2199
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,389
what's going on from these cells
and figure out how to best program the

2200
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:48,399
and figure out how to best program the
 

2201
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,470
and figure out how to best program the
robotic arm to move given the data that

2202
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,480
robotic arm to move given the data that
 

2203
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,829
robotic arm to move given the data that
we're measuring from these cells

2204
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:51,839
we're measuring from these cells
 

2205
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,790
we're measuring from these cells
but also the brain is learning too so

2206
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:54,800
but also the brain is learning too so
 

2207
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,869
but also the brain is learning too so
you know the paralyzed woman says

2208
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
you know the paralyzed woman says
 

2209
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,870
you know the paralyzed woman says
wait i'm trying to grab this thing and

2210
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:58,880
wait i'm trying to grab this thing and
 

2211
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,030
wait i'm trying to grab this thing and
by the way it's all about relevance so

2212
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,040
by the way it's all about relevance so
 

2213
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,630
by the way it's all about relevance so
if there's a piece of food there and

2214
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
if there's a piece of food there and
 

2215
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,910
if there's a piece of food there and
she's hungry

2216
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:03,920
she's hungry
 

2217
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,349
she's hungry
she'll figure out how to get this food

2218
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:07,359
she'll figure out how to get this food
 

2219
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,190
she'll figure out how to get this food
into her mouth with the robotic arm

2220
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,200
into her mouth with the robotic arm
 

2221
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,670
into her mouth with the robotic arm
because

2222
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
because
 

2223
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,030
because
that is what matters

2224
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,040

 

2225
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,589

well that's uh okay first of all that

2226
00:35:15,589 --> 00:35:15,599
well that's uh okay first of all that
 

2227
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,150
well that's uh okay first of all that
pain's

2228
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,160
pain's
 

2229
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,829
pain's
really promising and beautiful for some

00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
really promising and beautiful for some
 

2231
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,069
really promising and beautiful for some
reason really optimistic picture

2232
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
reason really optimistic picture
 

2233
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,349
reason really optimistic picture
that you know our brain is able to

2234
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:23,359
that you know our brain is able to
 

2235
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,390
that you know our brain is able to
to adjust to so much um

2236
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,400
to adjust to so much um
 

2237
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,230
to adjust to so much um
you know so many things happen this year

2238
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
you know so many things happen this year
 

2239
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,430
you know so many things happen this year
2020

2240
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:29,440
2020
 

2241
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,270
2020
that you think like how we're ever going

2242
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:31,280
that you think like how we're ever going
 

2243
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,790
that you think like how we're ever going
to deal with it

2244
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:32,800
to deal with it
 

2245
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,750
to deal with it
and it's somehow encouraging and

2246
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:37,760
and it's somehow encouraging and
 

2247
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,829
and it's somehow encouraging and
inspiring that like we're going to be

2248
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:39,839
inspiring that like we're going to be
 

2249
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,030
inspiring that like we're going to be
okay

2250
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:41,040
okay
 

2251
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,870
okay
well that's right i actually think so

2252
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:42,880
well that's right i actually think so
 

2253
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,150
well that's right i actually think so
2020 has been an

2254
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:44,160
2020 has been an
 

2255
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,550
2020 has been an
awful year for almost everybody in many

2256
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:46,560
awful year for almost everybody in many
 

2257
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,670
awful year for almost everybody in many
ways but

2258
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
ways but
 

2259
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,510
ways but
the one silver lining has to do with

2260
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:49,520
the one silver lining has to do with
 

2261
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,750
the one silver lining has to do with
brain plasticity which is to say

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:00,720
models are all about
 

2273
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,710
models are all about
how do you maximally succeed how do you

2274
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:02,720
how do you maximally succeed how do you
 

2275
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,470
how do you maximally succeed how do you
optimize your operation

2276
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:04,480
optimize your operation
 

2277
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,190
optimize your operation
in this circumstance where you are right

2278
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,200
in this circumstance where you are right
 

2279
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,950
in this circumstance where you are right
and then all of a sudden bang 2020 comes

2280
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
and then all of a sudden bang 2020 comes
 

2281
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,870
and then all of a sudden bang 2020 comes
we're completely off our wheels

2282
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:10,880
we're completely off our wheels
 

2283
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,310
we're completely off our wheels
where having to create new things all

2284
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:14,320
where having to create new things all
 

2285
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,990
where having to create new things all
the time and figure out how to do it

2286
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,000
the time and figure out how to do it
 

2287
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,430
the time and figure out how to do it
and that is terrific for brain

2288
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,440
and that is terrific for brain
 

2289
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,270
and that is terrific for brain
plasticity because and we know this

2290
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
plasticity because and we know this
 

2291
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,910
plasticity because and we know this
because

2292
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:19,920
because
 

2293
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,430
because
um there are very large studies

2294
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:23,440
um there are very large studies
 

2295
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,990
um there are very large studies
on older people who stay cognitively

2296
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,000
on older people who stay cognitively
 

2297
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,910
on older people who stay cognitively
active their whole lives

2298
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:27,920
active their whole lives
 

2299
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,630

some some fraction of them have

2300
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:30,640
some some fraction of them have
 

2301
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,750
some some fraction of them have
alzheimer's disease

2302
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:31,760
alzheimer's disease
 

2303
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,430
alzheimer's disease
physically but nobody knows that when

2304
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:33,440
physically but nobody knows that when
 

2305
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,270
physically but nobody knows that when
they're alive even though their brain is

2306
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
they're alive even though their brain is
 

2307
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,270
they're alive even though their brain is
getting chewed up with the ravages of

2308
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:37,280
getting chewed up with the ravages of
 

2309
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,430
getting chewed up with the ravages of
alzheimer's cognitively they're doing

2310
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:39,440
alzheimer's cognitively they're doing
 

2311
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,310
alzheimer's cognitively they're doing
just fine why

2312
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
just fine why
 

2313
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,390
just fine why
it's because they're they're they're

2314
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,400
it's because they're they're they're
 

2315
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,910
it's because they're they're they're
challenged all the time

2316
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:43,920
challenged all the time
 

2317
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,270
challenged all the time
they've got all these new things going

2318
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,280
they've got all these new things going
 

2319
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,390
they've got all these new things going
on all this novelty all these

2320
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,400
on all this novelty all these
 

2321
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,230
on all this novelty all these
responsibilities chores social life all

2322
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
responsibilities chores social life all
 

2323
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,510
responsibilities chores social life all
these things happening

2324
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:49,520
these things happening
 

2325
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,670
these things happening
and as a result they're constantly

2326
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
and as a result they're constantly
 

2327
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,349
and as a result they're constantly
building new roadways even as parts

2328
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:53,359
building new roadways even as parts
 

2329
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,550
building new roadways even as parts
degrade

2330
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:54,560
degrade
 

2331
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,270
degrade
and and and that's the only good news is

2332
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,280
and and and that's the only good news is
 

2333
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,670
and and and that's the only good news is
that

2334
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:57,680
that
 

2335
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,589
that
we are in a situation where suddenly we

2336
00:36:59,589 --> 00:36:59,599
we are in a situation where suddenly we
 

2337
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,510
we are in a situation where suddenly we
can't just operate like automaton

2338
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:01,520
can't just operate like automaton
 

2339
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,030
can't just operate like automaton
anymore we have to

2340
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,040
anymore we have to
 

2341
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,710
anymore we have to
think of completely new ways to do

2342
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:04,720
think of completely new ways to do
 

2343
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,950
think of completely new ways to do
things and that's wonderful i don't know

2344
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:08,960
things and that's wonderful i don't know
 

2345
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,030
things and that's wonderful i don't know
why this question popped into my head

2346
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,040
why this question popped into my head
 

2347
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,870
why this question popped into my head
it's quite absurd but

2348
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:12,880
it's quite absurd but
 

2349
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,990
it's quite absurd but
uh are we going to be okay

2350
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
uh are we going to be okay
 

2351
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,870
uh are we going to be okay
yeah you say this is the promising

2352
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:18,880
yeah you say this is the promising
 

2353
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,390
yeah you say this is the promising
silver lining just from your own because

2354
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:20,400
silver lining just from your own because
 

2355
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,349
silver lining just from your own because
you've written about

2356
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
you've written about
 

2357
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,270
you've written about
this and thought about this outside of

2358
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:23,280
this and thought about this outside of
 

2359
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,190
this and thought about this outside of
maybe even the plasticity of the brain

2360
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
maybe even the plasticity of the brain
 

2361
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,310
maybe even the plasticity of the brain
but

2362
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,320
but
 

2363
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,109
but
just this uh this whole pandemic kind of

2364
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:29,119
just this uh this whole pandemic kind of
 

2365
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:29,990
just this uh this whole pandemic kind of
changed the way

2366
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
changed the way
 

2367
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,430
changed the way
it knocked us out of this uh hamster

2368
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:33,440
it knocked us out of this uh hamster
 

2369
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:33,990
it knocked us out of this uh hamster

like that of habit a lot of people had

2372
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:37,280
like that of habit a lot of people had
 

2373
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,349
like that of habit a lot of people had
had to reinvent themselves

2374
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:39,359
had to reinvent themselves
 

2375
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,750
had to reinvent themselves
unfortunately and i have a lot of

2376
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:41,760
unfortunately and i have a lot of
 

2377
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,349
unfortunately and i have a lot of
friends who

00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:00,400
will no longer be possible you have to
 

2393
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,230
will no longer be possible you have to
find something new

2394
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,240
find something new
 

2395
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,990
find something new
what are your are we gonna be okay

2396
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
what are your are we gonna be okay
 

2397
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,069
what are your are we gonna be okay
yeah we'll be okay in the sense that i

2398
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:08,079
yeah we'll be okay in the sense that i
 

2399
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,630
yeah we'll be okay in the sense that i
mean it's gonna be a rough time for

2400
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:10,640
mean it's gonna be a rough time for
 

2401
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,190
mean it's gonna be a rough time for
many or most people but in the sense

2402
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,200
many or most people but in the sense
 

2403
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,990
many or most people but in the sense
that it is

2404
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,000
that it is
 

2405
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,790
that it is
sometimes useful to find that

2406
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:18,800
sometimes useful to find that
 

2407
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,670
sometimes useful to find that
what you thought was your dream was was

2408
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:21,680
what you thought was your dream was was
 

2409
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,910
what you thought was your dream was was
not the thing that you're going to do

2410
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:23,920
not the thing that you're going to do
 

2411
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,990
not the thing that you're going to do
um this is obviously the plot in lots of

2412
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
um this is obviously the plot in lots of
 

2413
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,349
um this is obviously the plot in lots of
hollywood movies that someone says i'm

2414
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
hollywood movies that someone says i'm
 

2415
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,710
hollywood movies that someone says i'm
going to do this and then that gets

2416
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:28,720
going to do this and then that gets
 

2417
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,470
going to do this and then that gets
foiled and they end up doing something

2418
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:30,480
foiled and they end up doing something
 

2419
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:30,950
foiled and they end up doing something
better

2420
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:30,960
better
 

2421
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,310
better
but this is true in life i mean um

2422
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,320
but this is true in life i mean um
 

2423
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,670
but this is true in life i mean um
in general even though we plan

2424
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
in general even though we plan
 

2425
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,470
in general even though we plan
our lives as best we can it's predicated

on
 

2429
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,030
on
our notion of okay given everything

2430
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
our notion of okay given everything
 

2431
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,630
our notion of okay given everything
that's around me this is what's possible

2432
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640

back to plasticity the way that we
 

2593
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,470
back to plasticity the way that we
the way our brain gets molded is by

2594
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:22,480
the way our brain gets molded is by
 

2595
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,309
the way our brain gets molded is by
absorbing everything from the world

2596
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:24,319
absorbing everything from the world
 

2597
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,710
absorbing everything from the world
all of the all of the knowledge and the

2598
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:26,720
all of the all of the knowledge and the
 

2599
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,390
all of the all of the knowledge and the
data and so on that it can get

2600
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400
data and so on that it can get
 

2601
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,829
data and so on that it can get
and then um and then springboarding off

2602
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:31,839
and then um and then springboarding off
 

2603
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:32,870
and then um and then springboarding off
of that

2604
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:32,880
of that
 

2605
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,309
of that
and we're in a very lucky time now

2606
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:34,319
and we're in a very lucky time now
 

2607
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,069
and we're in a very lucky time now
because

2608
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:36,079
because
 

2609
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,829
because
we grew up with a lot of just in case

2610
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:39,839
we grew up with a lot of just in case
 

2611
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,270
we grew up with a lot of just in case
learning so you know just in case you

2612
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,280
learning so you know just in case you
 

2613
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,630
learning so you know just in case you
ever need to know these dates in

2614
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:42,640
ever need to know these dates in
 

2615
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,230
ever need to know these dates in
mongolian history here there

2616
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,240
mongolian history here there
 

2617
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,150
mongolian history here there
um but what kids are growing up with now

2618
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:46,160
um but what kids are growing up with now
 

2619
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,390
um but what kids are growing up with now
like my kids is tons of just in time

00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
like my kids is tons of just in time
 

2621
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,589
like my kids is tons of just in time
learning so as soon as they're curious

2622
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:49,599
learning so as soon as they're curious
 

2623
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,790
learning so as soon as they're curious
about something they ask alex or they

2624
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:50,800
about something they ask alex or they
 

2625
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,589
about something they ask alex or they
ask google home

2626
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:51,599
ask google home
 

2627
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,270
ask google home
they get the answer right there in the

2628
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:53,280
they get the answer right there in the
 

2629
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,190
they get the answer right there in the
context of the curiosity the reason this

2630
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
context of the curiosity the reason this
 

2631
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,190
context of the curiosity the reason this
matters is because

2632
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
matters is because
 

2633
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,069
matters is because
for plasticity to happen you need to

2634
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:00,079
for plasticity to happen you need to
 

2635
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,430
for plasticity to happen you need to
care you need to be curious about

2636
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
care you need to be curious about
 

2637
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,390
care you need to be curious about
something

2638
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:02,400
something
 

2639
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,750
something
and this is something by the way that

2640
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:03,760
and this is something by the way that
 

2641
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,230
and this is something by the way that
the ancient romans had had noted

2642
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:06,240
the ancient romans had had noted
 

2643
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,910
the ancient romans had had noted
they had outlined seven different levels

2644
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:07,920
they had outlined seven different levels
 

2645
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,950
they had outlined seven different levels
of learning and the highest level is

2646
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:08,960
of learning and the highest level is
 

2647
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,550
of learning and the highest level is
when you're curious about a topic

2648
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:10,560
when you're curious about a topic
 

2649
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,109
when you're curious about a topic
but anyway so kids now are getting tons

2650
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:13,119
but anyway so kids now are getting tons
 

2651
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,790
but anyway so kids now are getting tons
of just in time learning

2652
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:14,800
of just in time learning
 

2653
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,550
of just in time learning
and as a result they're going to be so

2654
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:16,560
and as a result they're going to be so
 

2655
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,309
and as a result they're going to be so
much smarter than we are

2656
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:18,319
much smarter than we are
 

2657
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,670
much smarter than we are
they're just and we can already see that

2658
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
they're just and we can already see that
 

2659
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,430
they're just and we can already see that
i mean my boy is eight years old my girl

2660
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,440
i mean my boy is eight years old my girl
 

2661
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,069
i mean my boy is eight years old my girl
is five

2662
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:22,079
is five
 

2663
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,950
is five
but i mean the things that he knows are

2664
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:24,960
but i mean the things that he knows are
 

2665
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,950
but i mean the things that he knows are
amazing because it's not just

2666
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:26,960
amazing because it's not just
 

2667
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,790
amazing because it's not just
him having to do the rote memorization

2668
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:28,800
him having to do the rote memorization
 

2669
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,710
him having to do the rote memorization
stuff that we did yeah that's

2670
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:30,720
stuff that we did yeah that's
 

2671
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,150
stuff that we did yeah that's
it's just fascinating what the brain

2672
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,160
it's just fascinating what the brain
 

2673
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,670
it's just fascinating what the brain
what young brains look like now because

2674
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:33,680
what young brains look like now because
 

2675
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,589
what young brains look like now because
of all those ted talks just

2676
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:35,599
of all those ted talks just
 

2677
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,510
of all those ted talks just
just loaded in there and there's there's

2678
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:37,520
just loaded in there and there's there's
 

2679
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,430
just loaded in there and there's there's
also i mean a lot of people

2680
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:39,440
also i mean a lot of people
 

2681
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,069
also i mean a lot of people
write kind of there's a sense that our

2682
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
write kind of there's a sense that our
 

2683
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,710
write kind of there's a sense that our
attention span is growing shorter

2684
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:44,720
attention span is growing shorter
 

2685
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,589
attention span is growing shorter
but you know it's complicated because um

2686
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:47,599
but you know it's complicated because um
 

2687
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,630
but you know it's complicated because um
you know for example

2688
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:48,640
you know for example
 

2689
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,630
you know for example
you know most people majority of people

2690
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:50,640
you know most people majority of people
 

2691
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,470
you know most people majority of people
it's the 80 plus percent of people

2692
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480
it's the 80 plus percent of people

two three hours forward podcast long

2698
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:56,800
two three hours forward podcast long
 

2699
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,230
two three hours forward podcast long
long-form podcasts

2700
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,240
long-form podcasts
 

2701
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,030
long-form podcasts
or are becoming more and more popular so

2702
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,040
or are becoming more and more popular so
 

2703
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,990
or are becoming more and more popular so
like that's that's

2704
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,000
like that's that's
 

2705
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,150
like that's that's
it's all really giant complicated mess

2706
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
it's all really giant complicated mess
 

2707
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,190
it's all really giant complicated mess
and the point is

2708
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
and the point is
 

2709
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,349
and the point is
that the brain is able to adjust to it

2710
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:07,359
that the brain is able to adjust to it
 

2711
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,870
that the brain is able to adjust to it
and somehow like

2712
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:08,880
and somehow like
 

2713
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,630
and somehow like
form a world view within this

2714
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:12,640
form a world view within this
 

2715
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,309
form a world view within this
new medium of like information that we

2716
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:16,319
new medium of like information that we
 

2717
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:16,950
new medium of like information that we
have

2718
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:16,960
have
 

2719
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,150
have
you have like these short tweets and you

2720
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,160
you have like these short tweets and you
 

2721
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,790
you have like these short tweets and you
have these three four hour podcasts

2722
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:22,800
have these three four hour podcasts
 

2723
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,190
have these three four hour podcasts
and you have netflix movie i mean it's

2724
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:25,200
and you have netflix movie i mean it's
 

2725
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,190
and you have netflix movie i mean it's
just it's adjusting to the entirety

2726
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,200
just it's adjusting to the entirety
 

2727
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,750
just it's adjusting to the entirety
and just absorbing it and taking it all

2728
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:29,760
and just absorbing it and taking it all
 

2729
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,710
and just absorbing it and taking it all
in and then

2730
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:30,720
in and then
 

2731
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,829
in and then
pops up kovid that forces us all to be

2732
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
pops up kovid that forces us all to be
 

2733
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:34,470
pops up kovid that forces us all to be

and it all just adjusts and and uh and
 

2737
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,309
and it all just adjusts and and uh and
figures it out yeah yeah it's

2738
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:40,319
figures it out yeah yeah it's
 

2739
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,510
figures it out yeah yeah it's
fascinating

2740
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
fascinating
 

2741
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,990
fascinating
you know been talking about the brain as

2742
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,000
you know been talking about the brain as
 

2743
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,550
you know been talking about the brain as
if it's

2744
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:44,560
if it's
 

2745
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,309
if it's
something separate from the human

2746
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:48,319
something separate from the human
 

2747
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,309
something separate from the human
that carries it a little bit like

2748
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
that carries it a little bit like
 

2749
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,230
that carries it a little bit like
whenever you talk about the brain

2750
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,240
whenever you talk about the brain
 

2751
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,750
whenever you talk about the brain
it's easy to forget that that that's

2752
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
it's easy to forget that that that's
 

2753
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,910
it's easy to forget that that that's
like that's us

2754
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
like that's us
 

2755
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,510
like that's us
um like how much do you

2756
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
um like how much do you
 

2757
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,230
um like how much do you
how much is the whole thing like

2758
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,240
how much is the whole thing like
 

2759
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,710
how much is the whole thing like
predetermined

2760
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:04,720
predetermined
 

2761
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,109
predetermined
like how much is it already encoded in

2762
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119
like how much is it already encoded in
 

2763
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,390
like how much is it already encoded in
there

2764
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:08,400
there
 

2765
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,430
there
and how much is it the

2766
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:11,440
and how much is it the
 

2767
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,630
and how much is it the
what's the uh

2768
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:14,640
what's the uh
 

2769
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,150
what's the uh
the the actions

2770
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,160
the the actions
 

2771
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,430
the the actions
the decisions the judgments

2772
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,440
the decisions the judgments
 

2773
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,589
the decisions the judgments
this you mean like who you are who you

2774
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
this you mean like who you are who you
 

2775
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,670
this you mean like who you are who you
are oh yeah yeah okay great question

2776
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:25,680
are oh yeah yeah okay great question
 

2777
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,270
are oh yeah yeah okay great question
right so there used to be a big debate

2778
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:27,280
right so there used to be a big debate
 

2779
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,349
right so there used to be a big debate
about nature versus nurture and we now

2780
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:29,359
about nature versus nurture and we now
 

2781
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,550
about nature versus nurture and we now
know that it's

2782
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:30,560
know that it's
 

2783
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,630
know that it's
always both you can't even separate them

2784
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:32,640
always both you can't even separate them
 

2785
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,750
always both you can't even separate them
because

2786
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:33,760
because
 

2787
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,870
because
you come to the table with a certain

2788
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
you come to the table with a certain
 

2789
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,069
you come to the table with a certain
amount nature for example your whole

2790
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:36,079
amount nature for example your whole
 

2791
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:36,870
amount nature for example your whole
genome

2792
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:36,880
genome
 

2793
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,030
genome
and so on the experiences you have in

2794
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,040
and so on the experiences you have in
 

2795
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,390
and so on the experiences you have in
the womb like whether your mother is

2796
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:40,400
the womb like whether your mother is
 

2797
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,670
the womb like whether your mother is
smoking or drinking

2798
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:41,680
smoking or drinking
 

2799
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,950
smoking or drinking
things like that whether she's stressed

2800
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
things like that whether she's stressed
 

2801
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,950
things like that whether she's stressed
so on those all influence

2802
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,960
so on those all influence
 

2803
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,190
so on those all influence
how you're going to pop out of the womb

2804
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:47,200
how you're going to pop out of the womb
 

2805
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,870
how you're going to pop out of the womb
from there

2806
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
from there
 

2807
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,630
from there
everything is an interaction between all

2808
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,640
everything is an interaction between all
 

2809
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,950
everything is an interaction between all
of your experiences

2810
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:52,960
of your experiences
 

2811
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,910
of your experiences
and the and the nature what i mean is

2812
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:57,920
and the and the nature what i mean is
 

2813
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,750
and the and the nature what i mean is
i think of it like a space time cone

2814
00:44:59,750 --> 00:44:59,760
i think of it like a space time cone
 

2815
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,950
i think of it like a space time cone
where you have

2816
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
where you have
 

2817
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,230
where you have
you drop in the world depending on the

2818
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240
you drop in the world depending on the
 

2819
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,430
you drop in the world depending on the
experience that you have you might go

2820
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:03,440
experience that you have you might go
 

2821
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,710
experience that you have you might go
off in this direction or that direction

2822
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
off in this direction or that direction
 

2823
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,910
off in this direction or that direction
in that direction

2824
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:05,920
in that direction
 

2825
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,390
in that direction
because there's interaction all the way

2826
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:08,400
because there's interaction all the way
 

2827
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,309
because there's interaction all the way
your experiences determine

2828
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
your experiences determine
 

2829
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,910
your experiences determine
what happens with the expression of your

2830
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:11,920
what happens with the expression of your
 

2831
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,750
what happens with the expression of your
genes so some genes get repressed

2832
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:13,760
genes so some genes get repressed
 

2833
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,230
genes so some genes get repressed
some get expressed and so on and you

2834
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:16,240
some get expressed and so on and you
 

2835
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,750
some get expressed and so on and you
actually become a different person based

2836
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:17,760
actually become a different person based
 

2837
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,790
actually become a different person based
on your experiences

2838
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:18,800
on your experiences
 

2839
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,150
on your experiences
there's a whole field called uh

2840
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,160
there's a whole field called uh
 

2841
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,230
there's a whole field called uh
epigenomics which is or epi

2842
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:22,240
epigenomics which is or epi
 

2843
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,470
epigenomics which is or epi
epigenetics i should say which is about

2844
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:24,480
epigenetics i should say which is about
 

2845
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,309
epigenetics i should say which is about
the epigenome

2846
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:26,319
the epigenome
 

2847
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,710
the epigenome
and that is the you know sort of the

2848
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:28,720
and that is the you know sort of the
 

2849
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,470
and that is the you know sort of the
layer that sits on top of the dna and

2850
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:30,480
layer that sits on top of the dna and
 

2851
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,390
layer that sits on top of the dna and
causes the genes to express differently

2852
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
causes the genes to express differently
 

2853
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,829
causes the genes to express differently
that is directly related to the

2854
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
that is directly related to the
 

2855
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,309
that is directly related to the
experiences that you have so if

2856
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:36,319
experiences that you have so if
 

2857
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,829
experiences that you have so if
you know just as an example they take

2858
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:37,839
you know just as an example they take
 

2859
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,829
you know just as an example they take
rat pups and you know one group is sort

2860
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:39,839
rat pups and you know one group is sort
 

2861
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,430
rat pups and you know one group is sort
of placed away from their parents and

2862
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
of placed away from their parents and
 

2863
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,550
of placed away from their parents and
the other group is

2864
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:42,560
the other group is
 

2865
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,150
the other group is
groomed and licked and taken good care

2866
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,160
groomed and licked and taken good care
 

2867
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,910
groomed and licked and taken good care
of that changes their gene expression

2868
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:45,920
of that changes their gene expression
 

2869
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,109
of that changes their gene expression
for the rest of their life they go off

2870
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:47,119
for the rest of their life they go off
 

2871
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,390
for the rest of their life they go off
in different directions in this

2872
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:48,400
in different directions in this
 

2873
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,630
in different directions in this
in the space time cone um so

2874
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:52,640
in the space time cone um so
 

2875
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,109
in the space time cone um so
yeah this is this is of course why it

2876
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:55,119
yeah this is this is of course why it
 

2877
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,630
yeah this is this is of course why it
matters that we

2878
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
matters that we
 

2879
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,230
matters that we
take care of children and pour money

2880
00:45:58,230 --> 00:45:58,240
take care of children and pour money
 

2881
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,990
take care of children and pour money
into things like education and good

2882
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,000
into things like education and good
 

2883
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,710
into things like education and good
child care and so on for children

2884
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:02,720
child care and so on for children
 

2885
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,670
child care and so on for children
broadly

2886
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,680
broadly
 

2887
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,309
broadly
um because these formative years matter

2888
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,319
um because these formative years matter
 

2889
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:06,870
um because these formative years matter
so

2890
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
so
 

2891
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,510
so
much so is there a free will

2892
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
much so is there a free will
 

2893
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,309
much so is there a free will
this is this is a great apologize for

2894
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
this is this is a great apologize for
 

2895
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,109
this is this is a great apologize for
the

2896
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:15,119
the
 

2897
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,950
the
for the absurd high-level philosophical

2898
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:16,960
for the absurd high-level philosophical
 

2899
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,230
for the absurd high-level philosophical
questions no these are my favorite kind

2900
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
questions no these are my favorite kind
 

2901
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,950
questions no these are my favorite kind
of questions

2902
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
of questions
 

2903
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,030
of questions
here's the thing here's the thing we

2904
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:21,040
here's the thing here's the thing we
 

2905
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,470
here's the thing here's the thing we
don't know if you ask most

2906
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
don't know if you ask most
 

2907
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,230
don't know if you ask most
neuroscientists they'll say

2908
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:24,240
neuroscientists they'll say
 

2909
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,510
neuroscientists they'll say
that we can't really think of how you

2910
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:27,520
that we can't really think of how you
 

2911
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,870
that we can't really think of how you
would get free will in there because as

2912
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
would get free will in there because as
 

2913
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,550
would get free will in there because as

that's not being driven by

00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,710
that's not being driven by
something else then it seems it's hard

something else then it seems it's hard
 

2955
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,589
something else then it seems it's hard
to

2956
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:09,599
to
 

2957
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,270
to
understand where free will would come

00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:11,280
understand where free will would come
 

2959
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,510
understand where free will would come
from so that's the camp that

2960
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:13,520
from so that's the camp that
 

2961
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,109
from so that's the camp that
pretty much all of us fall into but i

2962
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:15,119
pretty much all of us fall into but i
 

2963
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,270
pretty much all of us fall into but i
will say our science is still quite

2964
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,280
will say our science is still quite
 

2965
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:17,990
will say our science is still quite

young
 

2967
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,309
young
and you know i'm a fan of the history of

2968
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:20,319
and you know i'm a fan of the history of
 

2969
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,270
and you know i'm a fan of the history of
science and what

2970
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:21,280
science and what
 

2971
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,390
science and what
the thing that always strikes me is

2972
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
the thing that always strikes me is
 

2973
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,470
the thing that always strikes me is
interesting is when you look back at any

2974
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,480
interesting is when you look back at any
 

2975
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,990
interesting is when you look back at any
moment in science

2976
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,000
moment in science
 

2977
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,630
moment in science
everybody believes something is true and

2978
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:28,640
everybody believes something is true and
 

2979
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,470
everybody believes something is true and
they just they simply didn't know about

2980
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
they just they simply didn't know about
 

2981
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,630
they just they simply didn't know about
you know what einstein revealed or

00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:32,640
you know what einstein revealed or
 

2983
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,309
you know what einstein revealed or
whatever and so

2984
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
whatever and so
 

2985
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,470
whatever and so
who knows and they all feel like that

2986
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:36,480
who knows and they all feel like that
 

2987
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,069
who knows and they all feel like that
we've at any moment in

00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:38,079
we've at any moment in
 

2989
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,270
we've at any moment in
history they all feel like we've

converted to the final answer exactly

2992
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:41,359
converted to the final answer exactly
 

2993
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,630
converted to the final answer exactly
exactly like all the pieces of the

2994
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,640
exactly like all the pieces of the
 

2995
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,750
exactly like all the pieces of the
puzzle are there

2996
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
puzzle are there
 

2997
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,510
puzzle are there
and i think that's a funny illusion

2998
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:45,520
and i think that's a funny illusion
 

2999
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,109
and i think that's a funny illusion
that's worth getting rid of

3000
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:47,119
that's worth getting rid of
 

3001
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,109
that's worth getting rid of
and and in fact this is what drives good

3002
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:49,119
and and in fact this is what drives good
 

3003
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,470
and and in fact this is what drives good
science is recognizing that we don't

science is recognizing that we don't
 

3005
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,549
science is recognizing that we don't
have most of the puzzle pieces

have most of the puzzle pieces
 

3007
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,790
have most of the puzzle pieces
so as far as the free will question goes

3008
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:54,800
so as far as the free will question goes
 

3009
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,589
so as far as the free will question goes
i don't know

3010
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:55,599
i don't know
 

3011
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,190
i don't know
at the moment it seems wow it would be

3012
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:57,200
at the moment it seems wow it would be
 

3013
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,790
at the moment it seems wow it would be
really impossible to figure out how

3014
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:58,800
really impossible to figure out how
 

3015
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,309
really impossible to figure out how
something else could fit in there but

something else could fit in there but
 

3017
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,549

00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:04,559
our textbooks might be very different
 

3021
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,230
our textbooks might be very different
than they are now i mean

3022
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:06,240
than they are now i mean
 

3023
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,990
than they are now i mean
could i ask you to speculate where do

3024
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,000
could i ask you to speculate where do
 

3025
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,349
could i ask you to speculate where do
you think free will

00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:09,359
you think free will
 

3027
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,990
you think free will
could be squeezed into there like what's

3051
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,190
listeners podcast don't quote me on this
i'm not saying this is what i believe to

3052
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,200
i'm not saying this is what i believe to
 

3053
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,630
i'm not saying this is what i believe to
be true but let me just give an example

3054
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
be true but let me just give an example
 

3055
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,430
be true but let me just give an example
i gave this

3056
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:37,440
i gave this
 

3057
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,349
i gave this
the end of my book incognito so the

3058
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:39,359
the end of my book incognito so the
 

3059
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,190
the end of my book incognito so the
whole book of incognito is about you

3060
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:41,200
whole book of incognito is about you
 

3061
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,470
whole book of incognito is about you
know all the what's happening in the

3062
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:42,480
know all the what's happening in the
 

3063
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,990
know all the what's happening in the
brain and essentially i'm saying look

3064
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,000
brain and essentially i'm saying look
 

3065
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,790
brain and essentially i'm saying look
here's all the

3066
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:44,800
here's all the
 

3067
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,069
here's all the
reasons to think that free will probably

3068
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:46,079
reasons to think that free will probably
 

3069
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,349
reasons to think that free will probably
does not exist but at the very end i say

3070
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
does not exist but at the very end i say
 

3071
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,390
does not exist but at the very end i say
look imagine that you are

3072
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:52,400
look imagine that you are
 

3073
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,790
look imagine that you are
um you know imagine that you're a

3074
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:54,800
um you know imagine that you're a
 

3075
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,150
um you know imagine that you're a
kalahari bushman

3076
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:56,160
kalahari bushman
 

3077
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,950
kalahari bushman
and you find a radio in the sand and

3078
00:48:58,950 --> 00:48:58,960
and you find a radio in the sand and
 

3079
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,030
and you find a radio in the sand and
you've never seen anything like this

3080
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:01,040
you've never seen anything like this
 

3081
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,750
you've never seen anything like this
and you you look at this radio and and

3082
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:03,760
and you you look at this radio and and
 

3083
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,829
and you you look at this radio and and
you realize that when you turn this knob

3084
00:49:05,829 --> 00:49:05,839
you realize that when you turn this knob
 

3085
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,670
you realize that when you turn this knob
you hear voices coming from their voices

3086
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:07,680
you hear voices coming from their voices
 

3087
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,710
you hear voices coming from their voices
coming from it

3088
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:08,720
coming from it
 

3089
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,670
coming from it
so being a you know a radio materialist

3090
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:11,680
so being a you know a radio materialist
 

3091
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,069
so being a you know a radio materialist
you

3092
00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:12,079
you
 

3093
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,510
you
try to figure out like how does this

3094
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:13,520
try to figure out like how does this
 

3095
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,950
try to figure out like how does this
thing operate so you take off the back

3096
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:14,960
thing operate so you take off the back
 

3097
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,430
thing operate so you take off the back
cover

3098
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:15,440
cover
 

3099
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,870
cover
and you realize there's all these wires

3100
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:16,880
and you realize there's all these wires
 

3101
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,750
and you realize there's all these wires
and when you take out some wires

3102
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:19,760
and when you take out some wires
 

3103
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,589
and when you take out some wires
the voices get garbled or stop or

3104
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:21,599
the voices get garbled or stop or
 

3105
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,109
the voices get garbled or stop or
whatever and so what you end up

3106
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:23,119
whatever and so what you end up
 

3107
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,630
whatever and so what you end up
developing is a whole theory about

3108
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:24,640
developing is a whole theory about
 

3109
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,870
developing is a whole theory about
how this connections pattern of wires

3110
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:26,880
how this connections pattern of wires
 

3111
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,870
how this connections pattern of wires
gives rise to voices

3112
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:28,880
gives rise to voices
 

3113
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,870
gives rise to voices
but it would never strike you that in

3114
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:30,880
but it would never strike you that in
 

3115
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,790
but it would never strike you that in
distant cities there's a radio tower and

3116
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:32,800
distant cities there's a radio tower and
 

3117
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,549
distant cities there's a radio tower and
there's invisible stuff beaming

3118
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:34,559
there's invisible stuff beaming
 

3119
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,309
there's invisible stuff beaming
and that's actually the origin of the

3120
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:36,319
and that's actually the origin of the
 

3121
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,710
and that's actually the origin of the
voices and this is just necessary for it

3122
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:38,720
voices and this is just necessary for it
 

3123
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,910
voices and this is just necessary for it
so i mentioned this just as a

3124
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:41,920
so i mentioned this just as a
 

3125
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,109
so i mentioned this just as a
speculation saying look

3126
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:43,119
speculation saying look
 

3127
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,790
speculation saying look
how would we know what we know about the

3128
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:44,800
how would we know what we know about the
 

3129
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,470
how would we know what we know about the
brain for absolutely certain is that if

3130
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
brain for absolutely certain is that if
 

3131
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,470
brain for absolutely certain is that if
when you damage pieces and parts of it

3132
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:48,480
when you damage pieces and parts of it
 

3133
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,950
when you damage pieces and parts of it
things get jumbled up but how would you

3134
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:50,960
things get jumbled up but how would you
 

3135
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,549
things get jumbled up but how would you
know if there's something else going on

3136
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
know if there's something else going on
 

3137
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,309
know if there's something else going on
that we can't see like electromagnetic

3138
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,319
that we can't see like electromagnetic
 

3139
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,190
that we can't see like electromagnetic
radiation

3140
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:55,200
radiation
 

3141
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,069
radiation
that is what's actually generating this

3142
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
that is what's actually generating this
 

3143
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,109
that is what's actually generating this
yeah

3144
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
yeah
 

3145
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,430
yeah
you paint a beautiful example of uh

3146
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:03,440
you paint a beautiful example of uh
 

3147
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,430
you paint a beautiful example of uh
of how totally because we don't know

3148
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:07,440
of how totally because we don't know
 

3149
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,549
of how totally because we don't know
most of how our universe works how

3150
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:10,559
most of how our universe works how
 

3151
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,710
most of how our universe works how
totally off-base we might be with our

3152
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:12,720
totally off-base we might be with our
 

3153
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,829
totally off-base we might be with our
science yeah

3154
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:13,839
science yeah
 

3155
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,270
science yeah
until i mean we i mean um yeah i mean

3156
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:17,280
until i mean we i mean um yeah i mean
 

3157
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,670
until i mean we i mean um yeah i mean
that's

just to recognize is that of course

3168
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:27,680
just to recognize is that of course

00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:29,440
we're in the position of having
 

3171
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,790
we're in the position of having
massive unknowns and you know

3172
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:32,800
massive unknowns and you know
 

3173
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,230
massive unknowns and you know
we have of course the known unknowns and

3174
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,240
we have of course the known unknowns and
 

3175
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,750
we have of course the known unknowns and
that's all the things we're pursuing in

that's all the things we're pursuing in
 

3177
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,109
that's all the things we're pursuing in
our labs and trying to figure out that

3178
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:39,119
our labs and trying to figure out that
 

3179
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:39,990
our labs and trying to figure out that
but there's this whole

but there's this whole
 

3181
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,589
but there's this whole

let me kind of ask a weird maybe a
 

3189
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,589
let me kind of ask a weird maybe a
difficult question

3193
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,990
part of the it has to do with i've been
recently reading a lot about world war

3194
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:54,000
recently reading a lot about world war
 

3195

00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
uh uh as a jew it's been difficult to
 

3201
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,510
uh uh as a jew it's been difficult to
read but uh

3202

so let me just ask about like the nature

3206
00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:07,599
so let me just ask about like the nature
 

3207
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,710
so let me just ask about like the nature
of genius

3208
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:08,720
of genius
 

3209
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,870
of genius
the nature of evil if we look at

the nature of evil if we look at
 

3211
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,870
the nature of evil if we look at
somebody like

this person's brain or that person's
brain he obviously got

3372
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:49,760
brain he obviously got
 

3373
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,829
brain he obviously got
feedback for what he was doing the other

3374
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
feedback for what he was doing the other
 

3375

we are very you know engineered
 

3393
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,349
we are very you know engineered
to care about in-groups versus

3394
00:54:15,349 --> 00:54:15,359
to care about in-groups versus
 

3395
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,190
to care about in-groups versus
out-groups and this seems to be like a

3396
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:17,200
out-groups and this seems to be like a
 

3397
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,549
out-groups and this seems to be like a
really fundamental thing

3398
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:18,559
really fundamental thing
 

3399
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,790
really fundamental thing
so we did this experiment lab where we

3400
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:20,800
so we did this experiment lab where we
 

3401
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,910
so we did this experiment lab where we
brought people in we stick them in the

3402
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:21,920
brought people in we stick them in the
 

3403
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,270
brought people in we stick them in the
scanner

3404
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,280
scanner
 

3405
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,549
scanner
and we i don't know it's something if

3406
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:24,559
and we i don't know it's something if
 

3407
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,109
and we i don't know it's something if
you know this but uh we show them on the

3408
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:27,119
you know this but uh we show them on the
 

3409
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,069
you know this but uh we show them on the
hand

3410
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:28,079
hand
 

3411
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,589
hand
sorry we showed them on the screen six

3412
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:29,599
sorry we showed them on the screen six
 

3413
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,230
sorry we showed them on the screen six
hands and uh the computer boop

3414
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:32,240
hands and uh the computer boop
 

3415
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,349
hands and uh the computer boop
goes around randomly picks a hand and

3416
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:33,359
goes around randomly picks a hand and
 

3417
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,950
goes around randomly picks a hand and
then you see that hand gets stabbed with

3418
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:34,960
then you see that hand gets stabbed with
 

3419
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,470
then you see that hand gets stabbed with
a syringe needle so you actually see a

3420
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:36,480
a syringe needle so you actually see a
 

3421
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,150
a syringe needle so you actually see a
syringe needle enter the hand

3422
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,160
syringe needle enter the hand
 

3423
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,230
syringe needle enter the hand
and come out and it's really uh what

3424
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:40,240
and come out and it's really uh what
 

3425
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,390
and come out and it's really uh what
that does is that triggers

3426
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:42,400
that does is that triggers
 

3427
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,109
that does is that triggers
uh parts of the pain matrix this areas

3428
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
uh parts of the pain matrix this areas
 

3429
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,630
uh parts of the pain matrix this areas
in your brain that involved in feeling

3430
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:46,640
in your brain that involved in feeling
 

3431
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,829
in your brain that involved in feeling
physical pain now the interesting thing

3432
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:47,839
physical pain now the interesting thing
 

3433
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,829
physical pain now the interesting thing
is it's not your hand that was stabbed

3434
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:49,839
is it's not your hand that was stabbed
 

3435
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,750
is it's not your hand that was stabbed
so what you're seeing is is empathy this

3436
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:51,760
so what you're seeing is is empathy this
 

3437
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,750
so what you're seeing is is empathy this
is you seeing someone else's hand get

3438
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:53,760
is you seeing someone else's hand get
 

3439
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,589
is you seeing someone else's hand get
stabbed you feel like oh god this is

3440
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
stabbed you feel like oh god this is
 

3441
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,309
stabbed you feel like oh god this is
awful right okay um we contrast that by

3442
00:54:58,309 --> 00:54:58,319
awful right okay um we contrast that by
 

3443
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,430
awful right okay um we contrast that by
the way with somebody's hand getting

3444
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,440
the way with somebody's hand getting
 

3445
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,309
the way with somebody's hand getting
poked as a

3446
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:00,319
poked as a
 

3447
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,069
poked as a
q-tip which is you know looks visually

3448
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:02,079
q-tip which is you know looks visually
 

3449
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,589
q-tip which is you know looks visually
the same but it's um

3450
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:03,599
the same but it's um
 

3451
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,870
the same but it's um
you don't have that same level of

3452
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:04,880
you don't have that same level of
 

3453
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,990
you don't have that same level of
response now what we do is we label each

3454
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,000
response now what we do is we label each
 

3455
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:08,710
response now what we do is we label each
hand with a

3456
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
hand with a
 

3457
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,069
hand with a
with a one word label christian jewish

3458
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:12,079
with a one word label christian jewish
 

3459
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:14,390
with a one word label christian jewish
muslim atheist scientologist hindu and

3460
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:14,400
muslim atheist scientologist hindu and
 

3461
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,190
muslim atheist scientologist hindu and
now

3462
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,200
now
 

3463
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,950
now
the computer goes around picks a hand

3464
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:16,960
the computer goes around picks a hand
 

3465
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,109
the computer goes around picks a hand
stabs the hand and the question is

3466
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
stabs the hand and the question is
 

3467
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,230
stabs the hand and the question is
how much does your brain care about all

3468
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:22,240
how much does your brain care about all
 

3469
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,589
how much does your brain care about all
the people in your out group versus the

3470
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:23,599
the people in your out group versus the
 

3471
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,190
the people in your out group versus the
one label that happens to match

3472
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
one label that happens to match
 

3473
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,750
one label that happens to match
you and it turns out for everybody

3474
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:27,760
you and it turns out for everybody
 

3475
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,030
you and it turns out for everybody
across all religions

3476
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:29,040
across all religions
 

3477
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,870
across all religions
they care much more about their in group

3478
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:30,880
they care much more about their in group
 

3479
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,069
they care much more about their in group
than their accurate and when i say they

3480
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:32,079
than their accurate and when i say they
 

3481
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,270
than their accurate and when i say they
care what i mean is

3482
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:33,280
care what i mean is
 

3483
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,109
care what i mean is
you get a bigger response from their

3484
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:35,119
you get a bigger response from their
 

3485
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,549
you get a bigger response from their
brain everything's the same it's the

3486
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:36,559
brain everything's the same it's the
 

3487
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:37,109

same
 

3489
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,470
same
hands it's just a one-word label

3490
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:40,480
hands it's just a one-word label
 

3491
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,589
hands it's just a one-word label
you care much more about your in-group

3492
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:41,599
you care much more about your in-group
 

3493
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,589
you care much more about your in-group
than your outgroup and i wish this

3494
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
than your outgroup and i wish this
 

3495
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:45,589
than your outgroup and i wish this
weren't true but this is how humans are

3496
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:45,599
weren't true but this is how humans are
 

3497
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,069
weren't true but this is how humans are
i wonder how fundamental that is or if

3498
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:48,079
i wonder how fundamental that is or if
 

3499
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,349
i wonder how fundamental that is or if
it's a

3500
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:49,359
it's a
 

3501
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:53,109
it's a
it's the emergent thing about culture

3502
00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:53,119
it's the emergent thing about culture
 

3503
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,829
it's the emergent thing about culture
like if we lived alone with like if it's

3504
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:55,839
like if we lived alone with like if it's
 

3505
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,589
like if we lived alone with like if it's
genetically built into the brain like

3506
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:57,599
genetically built into the brain like
 

3507
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,470
genetically built into the brain like
this

3508
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:58,480
this
 

3509
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,109
this
this longing for tribe so i'll so i'll

3510
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:01,119
this longing for tribe so i'll so i'll
 

3511
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,630
this longing for tribe so i'll so i'll
tell you we addressed that so here's

3512
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
tell you we addressed that so here's
 

3513
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,720
tell you we addressed that so here's
what we did there are two

3514
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:03,730
what we did there are two
 

3515
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,510
what we did there are two
[Music]

3516
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520
[Music]
 

3517
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,789
[Music]
actually there are two other things we

3518
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
actually there are two other things we
 

3519
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,230
actually there are two other things we
did as part of this study that i think

3520
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:08,240
did as part of this study that i think
 

3521
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,589
did as part of this study that i think
matter for this point

3522
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:09,599
matter for this point
 

3523
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,589
matter for this point
one is so okay so we show that you have

3524
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
one is so okay so we show that you have
 

3525
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,510
one is so okay so we show that you have
a much bigger response by the way this

3526
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:13,520
a much bigger response by the way this
 

3527
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,190
a much bigger response by the way this
is not a cognitive thing it's a very low

3528
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,200
is not a cognitive thing it's a very low
 

3529
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,390
is not a cognitive thing it's a very low
level

3530
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:16,400
level
 

3531
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,150
level
basic response to seeing pain in

3532
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
basic response to seeing pain in
 

3533
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,990
basic response to seeing pain in
somebody okay great study by the way

3534
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
somebody okay great study by the way
 

3535
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,030
somebody okay great study by the way
thanks thanks what we did next is

3536
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,040
thanks thanks what we did next is
 

3537
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,190
thanks thanks what we did next is
we we next have it where we say okay the

3538
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:25,200
we we next have it where we say okay the
 

3539
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,950
we we next have it where we say okay the
year is 2025

3540
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:26,960
year is 2025
 

3541
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,270
year is 2025
and these three religions are now in a

3542
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,280
and these three religions are now in a
 

3543
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,789
and these three religions are now in a
war against these three religions and

3544
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:30,799
war against these three religions and
 

3545
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,069
war against these three religions and
it's all randomized right but what you

3546
00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:32,079
it's all randomized right but what you
 

3547
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,510
it's all randomized right but what you
see is your thing

3548
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:33,520
see is your thing
 

3549
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,190
see is your thing
and you have two allies now against

3550
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:35,200

3577
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,270
but then what i wanted to do was look at
how ingrained is this or how arbitrary

3578
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:57,280
how ingrained is this or how arbitrary
 

3579
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:57,990
how ingrained is this or how arbitrary
is it so we brought

3580

is it so we brought
 

3581
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,670
is it so we brought
new participants in and we said here's a

3582
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,680
new participants in and we said here's a
 

3583
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,270
new participants in and we said here's a
coin toss the coin if it's heads you're

um and they get in the scanner and they
 

3601
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,549
um and they get in the scanner and they
see a thing on the screen that says the

3602
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:18,559
see a thing on the screen that says the

00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,789
and now you care more about whichever
team you're on than the other team even

3614
00:57:28,789 --> 00:57:28,799
team you're on than the other team even
 

3615
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:29,990
team you're on than the other team even
though it's totally after and you know

3616
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:30,000
though it's totally after and you know
 

3617
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,030
though it's totally after and you know
is arbitrary because you're the one to

3618
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,040
is arbitrary because you're the one to
 

3619
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,910
is arbitrary because you're the one to
toss the coin

yeah so it's it it's a state that's very
 

3623
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,309
yeah so it's it it's a state that's very
easy to find ourselves in in other words

3624
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:38,319
easy to find ourselves in in other words
 

3625
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,510
easy to find ourselves in in other words
just before walking in the door they'd

3626
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:39,520
just before walking in the door they'd
 

3627
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,190
just before walking in the door they'd
never even heard of augustinian versus

3633
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,430
their brain is representing it simply
because they're told they're on this

3634
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:45,440
because they're told they're on this
 

3635

because they're told they're on this
team

3636
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:46,319
team
 

3637

you know uh now i did my own personal
study of this

00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:49,440
study of this
 

3641
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,470
study of this
uh it's uh

3642
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:52,480

adjusting the enemy we're in august how
 

3673
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,109
adjusting the enemy we're in august how
sticky it is but there are studies of

3674
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:23,119
sticky it is but there are studies of
 

3675
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,309
sticky it is but there are studies of
this

3676
00:58:24,309 --> 00:58:24,319
this
 

3677
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,670
this
of monkey troops uh on some

3678
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:27,680
of monkey troops uh on some
 

3679
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,789
of monkey troops uh on some
island um and

3680
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:30,799
island um and
 

3681
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,549
island um and
what happens is they look at the way

3682
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:32,559
what happens is they look at the way
 

3683
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,069
what happens is they look at the way
monkeys behave when they're part of this

3684
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:34,079
monkeys behave when they're part of this
 

3685
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,910
monkeys behave when they're part of this
tribe and how they treat members of the

3686
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:35,920
tribe and how they treat members of the
 

3687
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,750
tribe and how they treat members of the
other tribe of monkeys

and then what they do i forgotten how
 

3691
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,950
and then what they do i forgotten how
they do that exactly but they end up

3692
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:40,960
they do that exactly but they end up
 

3693
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,630
they do that exactly but they end up
switching a monkey so he ends up in the

3694
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:42,640
switching a monkey so he ends up in the
 

3695
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,390
switching a monkey so he ends up in the
other troop and very quickly they end up

3696
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,400
other troop and very quickly they end up
 

3697
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,069
other troop and very quickly they end up

you know is there hope for psychiatry
 

3741
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,589
you know is there hope for psychiatry
for somebody else to help

3742
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599
for somebody else to help
 

3743

this live wired brain to adjust

3744
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119
this live wired brain to adjust
 

3745
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:40,150
this live wired brain to adjust
oh yeah i mean in the sense that and

3746
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:40,160
oh yeah i mean in the sense that and
 

3747
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,430
oh yeah i mean in the sense that and
this has to do with this issue about us

3748
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:41,440
this has to do with this issue about us
 

3749
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,390
this has to do with this issue about us
being trapped on our own planet

3750
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:44,400
being trapped on our own planet
 

3751

forget psychiatrists just think of like

3752
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:45,760
forget psychiatrists just think of like
 

3753
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,030
forget psychiatrists just think of like
when you're talking with a friend and

3754
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:47,040
when you're talking with a friend and
 

3755
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,870
when you're talking with a friend and
you say oh i'm so upset about this

3756
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:48,880
you say oh i'm so upset about this
 

3757
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,230
you say oh i'm so upset about this
and your friend says hey just look at it

3758
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:50,240
and your friend says hey just look at it
 

3759
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,910
and your friend says hey just look at it
this way

3760
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:51,920
this way
 

3761
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,789
this way
uh you know all we have access to under

3762
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:54,799
uh you know all we have access to under
 

3763
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,309
uh you know all we have access to under
normal circumstances is just the way

3764
00:59:56,309 --> 00:59:56,319
normal circumstances is just the way
 

3765
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,069
normal circumstances is just the way
we're seeing something and so

3766
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:58,079
we're seeing something and so
 

3767
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,430
we're seeing something and so
it's super helpful to have friends and

3768
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:01,440
it's super helpful to have friends and
 

3769
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,430
it's super helpful to have friends and
communities and psychiatrists and so on

3770
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:03,440
communities and psychiatrists and so on
 

3771
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:03,910
communities and psychiatrists and so on
to

3772
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:03,920
to
 

3773
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,829
to
help things change that way so that's

3774
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:05,839
help things change that way so that's
 

3775
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,589
help things change that way so that's
just like interesting of help to us but

3776
01:00:07,589 --> 01:00:07,599
just like interesting of help to us but
 

3777
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,430
just like interesting of help to us but
but more importantly the role that

3778
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:09,440
but more importantly the role that
 

3779
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,309
but more importantly the role that
psychiatrists have played is that

3780
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:12,319
psychiatrists have played is that
 

3781
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:13,829
psychiatrists have played is that
there's this sort of naive assumption

3782
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:13,839
there's this sort of naive assumption
 

3783
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:15,190
there's this sort of naive assumption
that we all come to the table with which

3784
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:15,200
that we all come to the table with which
 

3785
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,789
that we all come to the table with which
is that everyone is fundamentally just

3786
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:16,799
is that everyone is fundamentally just
 

3787
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:19,990
is that everyone is fundamentally just
like us and when you're a kid you you

3788
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:20,000
like us and when you're a kid you you
 

3789
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,589
like us and when you're a kid you you
believe this entirely but as you get

3790
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:21,599
believe this entirely but as you get
 

3791
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,589
believe this entirely but as you get
older and you start realizing okay

3792
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599
older and you start realizing okay
 

3793
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,190
older and you start realizing okay
there's something called schizophrenia

3794
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:25,200
there's something called schizophrenia
 

3795
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,270
there's something called schizophrenia
and that's a real thing and to be inside

3796
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:27,280
and that's a real thing and to be inside
 

3797
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,069
and that's a real thing and to be inside
that person's head

3798
01:00:28,069 --> 01:00:28,079
that person's head
 

3799
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,589
that person's head
is totally different than what it is to

3800
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:29,599
is totally different than what it is to
 

3801
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,069
is totally different than what it is to
be inside my head or their psychopathy

3802
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:32,079
be inside my head or their psychopathy
 

3803
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,430
be inside my head or their psychopathy
and and to be inside

3804
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:33,440
and and to be inside
 

3805
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,510
and and to be inside
this psychopath's head he doesn't care

3806
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:35,520
this psychopath's head he doesn't care
 

3807
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,789
this psychopath's head he doesn't care
about other people he doesn't care about

3808
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:36,799
about other people he doesn't care about
 

3809
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,069
about other people he doesn't care about
hurting other people he's just doing

3810
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:38,079
hurting other people he's just doing
 

3811
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,390
hurting other people he's just doing
what he needs to do to get what he needs

3812
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:40,400
what he needs to do to get what he needs
 

3813
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,870
what he needs to do to get what he needs
um that's a different head there's a

3814
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:42,880
um that's a different head there's a
 

3815
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,349
um that's a different head there's a
million different things going on

3816
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:45,359
million different things going on
 

3817
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,109
million different things going on
and it is different to be inside those

3818
01:00:47,109 --> 01:00:47,119
and it is different to be inside those
 

3819
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,470
and it is different to be inside those
heads

3820
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:48,480
heads
 

3821
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,670
heads
that this is where the field of

3822
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:49,680
that this is where the field of
 

3823
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,750
that this is where the field of
psychiatry comes in now

3824
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:51,760
psychiatry comes in now
 

3825
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,270
psychiatry comes in now
i think it's an interesting question

3826
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:53,280
i think it's an interesting question
 

3827
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,510
i think it's an interesting question
about the degree to which

3828
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:55,520
about the degree to which
 

3829
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,589
about the degree to which
is leaking into and taking over

3830
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
is leaking into and taking over
 

3831
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:58,549
is leaking into and taking over
psychiatry

3832
01:00:58,549 --> 01:00:58,559
psychiatry
 

3833
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:00,230
psychiatry
and what the landscape will look like 50

3834
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:00,240
and what the landscape will look like 50
 

3835
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,829
and what the landscape will look like 50
years from now it may be that

3836
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:01,839
years from now it may be that
 

3837
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:04,870
years from now it may be that
psychiatry as a profession

3838
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:04,880
psychiatry as a profession
 

3839
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,870
psychiatry as a profession
you know changes a lot or maybe goes

3840
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:06,880
you know changes a lot or maybe goes
 

3841
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,710
you know changes a lot or maybe goes
away entirely and neuroscience will

3842
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:08,720
away entirely and neuroscience will
 

3843
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,270
away entirely and neuroscience will
essentially

3844
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:09,280
essentially
 

3845
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,390
essentially
be able to take over some of these

3846
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:10,400
be able to take over some of these
 

3847
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,309
be able to take over some of these
functions but it has been extremely

3848
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:12,319
functions but it has been extremely
 

3849
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,349
functions but it has been extremely
useful

3850
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
useful
 

3851
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:17,430
useful
to understand the differences between

3852
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:17,440
to understand the differences between
 

3853
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,030
to understand the differences between
how people behave and why and what you

3854
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:19,040
how people behave and why and what you
 

3855
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,230
how people behave and why and what you
can tell about what's going on inside

3856
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:20,240
can tell about what's going on inside
 

3857
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,190
can tell about what's going on inside
their brain

3858
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:21,200
their brain
 

3859
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,030
their brain
just based on observation of their

3860
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,040
just based on observation of their
 

3861
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,309
just based on observation of their
behavior

3862
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:24,319
behavior
 

3863
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,349
behavior
you uh this this might be years ago

3864
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:27,359
you uh this this might be years ago
 

3865
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:29,670
you uh this this might be years ago
but i'm not sure there's an atlantic

3866
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:29,680
but i'm not sure there's an atlantic
 

3867
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,030
but i'm not sure there's an atlantic
article you've written

3868
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:33,040

 

3869
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,870

3880
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:46,720
so on that topic how do you think about
 

3881
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,870
so on that topic how do you think about
this gray area yeah this is exactly this

3882
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:48,880
this gray area yeah this is exactly this
 

3883
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,710
this gray area yeah this is exactly this
is exactly the evolution that things are

3884
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:50,720
is exactly the evolution that things are
 

3885
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,309
is exactly the evolution that things are
going is you know there was psychiatry

3886
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:52,319
going is you know there was psychiatry
 

3887
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,910
going is you know there was psychiatry
and then there were guys

3888
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:53,920
and then there were guys
 

3889
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,309
and then there were guys
and gals in labs poking cells and so on

3890
01:01:56,309 --> 01:01:56,319
and gals in labs poking cells and so on
 

3891
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:57,349
and gals in labs poking cells and so on
those are the neurosciences

3892
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:57,359
those are the neurosciences
 

3893
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,870
those are the neurosciences
but yeah i think these are moving

3894
01:01:58,870 --> 01:01:58,880
but yeah i think these are moving
 

3895
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,069
but yeah i think these are moving
together for exactly the reason you

3896
01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:00,079
together for exactly the reason you
 

3897
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,029
together for exactly the reason you
decided

3898
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:01,039
decided
 

3899
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:03,109
decided
and where this matters a lot the

3900
01:02:03,109 --> 01:02:03,119
and where this matters a lot the

uh that i wrote was called the brain on

3904
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,000
uh that i wrote was called the brain on
 

3905
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,109
uh that i wrote was called the brain on
trial

3906
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:07,119
trial
 

3907
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,109
trial
where this matters a lot is it's the

3908
01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:09,119
where this matters a lot is it's the
 

3909
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,510
where this matters a lot is it's the
legal system because

3910
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,520
legal system because
 

3911
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,190
legal system because
the way we run our legal system now and

3912
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,200
the way we run our legal system now and
 

3913
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,630
the way we run our legal system now and
this is true everywhere in the world is

3914
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:14,640
this is true everywhere in the world is
 

3915
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,549
this is true everywhere in the world is
you know someone shows up in front of

3916
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:16,559
you know someone shows up in front of
 

3917
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,470
you know someone shows up in front of
the judge's bench or let's say there's

3918
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
the judge's bench or let's say there's
 

3919
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,589
the judge's bench or let's say there's
five people in front of the judge's

3920
01:02:19,589 --> 01:02:19,599
five people in front of the judge's
 

3921
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,510
five people in front of the judge's
bench and they've all committed the same

3922
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:21,520
bench and they've all committed the same
 

3923
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,390
bench and they've all committed the same
crime what we do

3924
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:22,400
crime what we do
 

3925
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,470
crime what we do
because we feel like hey this is fair is

3926
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
because we feel like hey this is fair is
 

3927
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,589
because we feel like hey this is fair is
alright you're gonna get the same

3928
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:25,599
alright you're gonna get the same
 

3929
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:26,870
alright you're gonna get the same
sentence you'll all get three years in

3930
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:26,880
sentence you'll all get three years in
 

3931
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,069
sentence you'll all get three years in
prison or whatever it is

3932
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:28,079
prison or whatever it is
 

3933
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,069
prison or whatever it is
but in fact brains can be so different

3934
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:30,079
but in fact brains can be so different
 

3935
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,430
but in fact brains can be so different
this guy's got schizophrenia this guy's

3936
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:31,440
this guy's got schizophrenia this guy's
 

3937
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,710
this guy's got schizophrenia this guy's
a psychopath this guy's tweaked down on

3938
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:32,720
a psychopath this guy's tweaked down on
 

3939
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,990
a psychopath this guy's tweaked down on
drugs and so on so

3940
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:34,000
drugs and so on so
 

3941
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,109
drugs and so on so
that um it actually doesn't make sense

3942
01:02:37,109 --> 01:02:37,119
that um it actually doesn't make sense
 

3943
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:38,710
that um it actually doesn't make sense
to keep doing that and what we what we

3944
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
to keep doing that and what we what we
 

3945
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,910
to keep doing that and what we what we
do

3946
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:39,920
do
 

3947
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,670
do
in this country more than anywhere in

3948
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:41,680
in this country more than anywhere in
 

3949
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,190
in this country more than anywhere in
the world is we

3950
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
the world is we
 

3951
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,549
the world is we
imagine that incarceration is a

3952
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:44,559
imagine that incarceration is a
 

3953
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,069
imagine that incarceration is a
one-size-fits-all solution and you may

3954
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079
one-size-fits-all solution and you may
 

3955
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,589
one-size-fits-all solution and you may
know we have the

3956
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:47,599
know we have the
 

3957
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,270
know we have the
america has the highest incarceration

3958
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:49,280
america has the highest incarceration
 

3959
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,710
america has the highest incarceration
rate in the whole world in terms of the

3960
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:50,720
rate in the whole world in terms of the
 

3961
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,069
rate in the whole world in terms of the
percentage of our population we put

3962
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:52,079
percentage of our population we put
 

3963
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:53,270
percentage of our population we put
behind bars

3964
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:53,280
behind bars
 

3965
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,390
behind bars
so um there's a much more refined thing

3966
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
so um there's a much more refined thing
 

3967
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:56,950
so um there's a much more refined thing
we can do

3968
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960
we can do
 

3969
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:59,829
we can do
as neuroscience comes in and changes and

3970
01:02:59,829 --> 01:02:59,839
as neuroscience comes in and changes and
 

3971
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,510
as neuroscience comes in and changes and
has the opportunity to change the legal

3972
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:01,520
has the opportunity to change the legal
 

3973
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,230
has the opportunity to change the legal
system

3974
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:02,240
system
 

3975
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,910
system
which is to say this doesn't let anybody

3976
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:03,920
which is to say this doesn't let anybody
 

3977
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,190
which is to say this doesn't let anybody
off the hook it doesn't say oh it's not

3978
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,200
off the hook it doesn't say oh it's not
 

3979
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,470
off the hook it doesn't say oh it's not
your fault and so on

3980
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
your fault and so on
 

3981
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,109
your fault and so on
but what it does is it changes the

3982
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119
but what it does is it changes the
 

3983
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,430
but what it does is it changes the
equation so it's not about

3984
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:11,440
equation so it's not about
 

3985
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,910
equation so it's not about
hey how blameworthy are you but instead

3986
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:13,920
hey how blameworthy are you but instead
 

3987
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,630
hey how blameworthy are you but instead
is about

3988
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:14,640
is about
 

3989
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,750
is about
hey what do we do from here what's the

3990
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:15,760
hey what do we do from here what's the
 

3991
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,870
hey what do we do from here what's the
best thing to do from here so if you

3992
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:16,880
best thing to do from here so if you
 

3993
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,309
best thing to do from here so if you
take somebody with schizophrenia and you

3994
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
take somebody with schizophrenia and you
 

3995
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,270
take somebody with schizophrenia and you
have them

3996
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:19,280
have them
 

3997
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,750
have them
break rocks in the hot summer sun in a

3998
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:21,760
break rocks in the hot summer sun in a
 

3999
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,710
break rocks in the hot summer sun in a
chain gang all

4000
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:22,720
chain gang all
 

4001
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,390
chain gang all
yeah that that doesn't help the

4002
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:24,400
yeah that that doesn't help the
 

4003
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,670
yeah that that doesn't help the
schizophrenia that doesn't fix the

4004
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:25,680
schizophrenia that doesn't fix the
 

4005
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,190
schizophrenia that doesn't fix the
problem

4006
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:27,200
problem
 

4007
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,710
problem
um if you take somebody with a drug

4008
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
um if you take somebody with a drug
 

4009
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,109
um if you take somebody with a drug
addiction who's in jail for you know

4010
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:31,119
addiction who's in jail for you know
 

4011
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:32,710
addiction who's in jail for you know
being caught two ounces of some illegal

4012
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:32,720
being caught two ounces of some illegal
 

4013
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,710
being caught two ounces of some illegal
substance

4014
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:34,720
substance
 

4015
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,390
substance
and you put him in prison it doesn't

4016
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:36,400
and you put him in prison it doesn't
 

4017
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,829
and you put him in prison it doesn't
actually fix the addiction it doesn't

4018
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:37,839
actually fix the addiction it doesn't
 

4019
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:40,230
actually fix the addiction it doesn't
help anything

4020
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,240
help anything
 

4021
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,309
help anything
happily what neuroscience and psychiatry

4022
01:03:42,309 --> 01:03:42,319
happily what neuroscience and psychiatry
 

4023
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,349
happily what neuroscience and psychiatry
bring to the table

4024
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:43,359
bring to the table
 

4025
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,109
bring to the table
is lots of really useful things you can

4026
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
is lots of really useful things you can
 

4027
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,789
is lots of really useful things you can
do with schizophrenia with drug

4028
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:46,799
do with schizophrenia with drug
 

4029
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,390
do with schizophrenia with drug
addiction things like this

4030
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:48,400
addiction things like this
 

4031
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,470
addiction things like this
um and that's why so i i don't know if

4032
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
um and that's why so i i don't know if
 

4033
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,069
um and that's why so i i don't know if
he knows but i run a national non-profit

4034
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:52,079
he knows but i run a national non-profit
 

4035
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,750
he knows but i run a national non-profit
called the center for science and law

4036
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:53,760
called the center for science and law
 

4037
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,270
called the center for science and law
and it's all about this intersection of

4038
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:55,280
and it's all about this intersection of
 

4039
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,190
and it's all about this intersection of
neuroscience and legal system

4040
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:57,200
neuroscience and legal system
 

4041
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,190
neuroscience and legal system
and we're trying to implement changes in

4042
01:03:59,190 --> 01:03:59,200
and we're trying to implement changes in
 

4043
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,510
and we're trying to implement changes in
every county and every state

4044
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
every county and every state
 

4045
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,069
every county and every state
um i'll just without going down that

4046
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:04,079
um i'll just without going down that
 

4047
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,510
um i'll just without going down that
rabbit hole i'll just say one of the

4048
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
rabbit hole i'll just say one of the
 

4049
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,990
rabbit hole i'll just say one of the
very simplest things to do is to set up

4050
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,000
very simplest things to do is to set up
 

4051
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,510
very simplest things to do is to set up
specialized court systems where you have

4052
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:09,520
specialized court systems where you have
 

4053
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,549
specialized court systems where you have
a

4054
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559
a
 

4055
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,349
a
mental health court that has judges and

4056
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
mental health court that has judges and
 

4057
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:13,990
mental health court that has judges and
juries with

4058
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,000
juries with
 

4059
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,910
juries with
expertise in mental illness because if

4060
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
expertise in mental illness because if
 

4061
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,829
expertise in mental illness because if
you go by the way to a regular court and

4062
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:17,839
you go by the way to a regular court and
 

4063
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,430
you go by the way to a regular court and
the person says

4064
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
the person says
 

4065
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,270
the person says
um or the the defense lawyer says this

4066
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:21,280
um or the the defense lawyer says this
 

4067
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,789
um or the the defense lawyer says this
person is schizophrenia

4068
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:22,799
person is schizophrenia
 

4069
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,029
person is schizophrenia
most of the jury will say man i call

4070
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:25,039
most of the jury will say man i call
 

4071
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,069
most of the jury will say man i call
[\h__\h] on that why

4072
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:26,079
[\h__\h] on that why
 

4073
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,990
[\h__\h] on that why
because they don't know about because

4074
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,000
because they don't know about because
 

4075
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,190
because they don't know about because
they don't they don't

4076
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,200
they don't they don't
 

4077
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,270
they don't they don't
know what it's about and it turns out

4078
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:31,280
know what it's about and it turns out
 

4079
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,710
know what it's about and it turns out
people who

4080
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:32,720
people who
 

4081
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,870
people who
who know about schizophrenia feel very

4082
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:34,880
who know about schizophrenia feel very
 

4083
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,630
who know about schizophrenia feel very
differently as a juror than someone who

4084
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
differently as a juror than someone who
 

4085
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,589
differently as a juror than someone who
happens not to know anybody

4086
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:37,599
happens not to know anybody
 

4087
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,430
happens not to know anybody
schizophrenia they think it's an excuse

4088
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:39,440
schizophrenia they think it's an excuse
 

4089
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,630
schizophrenia they think it's an excuse
so

4090
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
so
 

4091
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,829
so
um you have judge injuries with

4092
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:41,839
um you have judge injuries with
 

4093
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,109
um you have judge injuries with
expertise in mental illness and they

4094
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
expertise in mental illness and they
 

4095
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,710
expertise in mental illness and they
know the rehabilitative strategies that

4096
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:44,720
know the rehabilitative strategies that
 

4097
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,589
know the rehabilitative strategies that
are available

4098
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:45,599
are available
 

4099
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,430
are available
that's one thing having a drug court

4100
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,440
that's one thing having a drug court
 

4101
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,549
that's one thing having a drug court
where you have judges and jurors with

4102
01:04:48,549 --> 01:04:48,559
where you have judges and jurors with
 

4103
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,390
where you have judges and jurors with
expertise and rehabilitative strategies

4104
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,400
expertise and rehabilitative strategies
 

4105
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,829
expertise and rehabilitative strategies
and what can be done and so on a

4106
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:51,839
and what can be done and so on a
 

4107
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:53,270
and what can be done and so on a
specialized prostitution core

4108
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:53,280
specialized prostitution core
 

4109
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,589
specialized prostitution core
and so on all these different uh things

4110
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:55,599
and so on all these different uh things
 

4111
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,109
and so on all these different uh things
by the way this is very easy for

4112
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:57,119
by the way this is very easy for
 

4113
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,190
by the way this is very easy for
counties to implement this sort of thing

4114
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,200
counties to implement this sort of thing
 

4115
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,190
counties to implement this sort of thing
and this is this is i think where this

4116
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:01,200
and this is this is i think where this
 

4117
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,309
and this is this is i think where this
matters to get

4118
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
matters to get
 

4119
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,109
matters to get
neuroscience into public policy what's

4120
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:05,119
neuroscience into public policy what's
 

4121
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,309
neuroscience into public policy what's
the process of

4122
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:06,319
the process of
 

4123
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,789
the process of
injecting expertise into this so yeah

4124
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:08,799
injecting expertise into this so yeah
 

4125
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,390
injecting expertise into this so yeah
i'll tell you exactly what it is

4126
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:10,400
i'll tell you exactly what it is
 

4127
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,309
i'll tell you exactly what it is
a county needs to run out of money first

4128
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:12,319
a county needs to run out of money first
 

4129
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,309
a county needs to run out of money first
i've seen this happen over and over

4130
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:14,319
i've seen this happen over and over
 

4131
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,069
i've seen this happen over and over
so what happens is a county has a

4132
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:16,079
so what happens is a county has a
 

4133
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:17,589
so what happens is a county has a
completely full jail and they say you

4134
01:05:17,589 --> 01:05:17,599
completely full jail and they say you
 

4135
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:18,390
completely full jail and they say you
know what

4136
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,400
know what
 

4137
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,910
know what
we need to build another jail and then

4138
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:19,920
we need to build another jail and then
 

4139
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,190
we need to build another jail and then
they realize god we don't have any money

4140
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
they realize god we don't have any money
 

4141
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:21,990
they realize god we don't have any money
we can't afford

4142
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,000
we can't afford
 

4143
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,430
we can't afford
this we've got too many people in jail

4144
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:23,440
this we've got too many people in jail
 

4145
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,349
this we've got too many people in jail
and that's when they turn to

4146
01:05:25,349 --> 01:05:25,359
and that's when they turn to
 

4147
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,870
and that's when they turn to
god we need something smarter and that's

4148
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:26,880
god we need something smarter and that's
 

4149
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,910
god we need something smarter and that's
when they set up specialized court

4150
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:27,920
when they set up specialized court
 

4151
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,309
when they set up specialized court
systems

4152
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:30,319

 

4153
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:33,109

oh we all function best when when our

4154
01:05:33,109 --> 01:05:33,119
oh we all function best when when our
 

4155
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,230
oh we all function best when when our
back is against the wall

4156
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:34,240
back is against the wall
 

4157
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,069
back is against the wall
and that's what kovit is good for yeah

4158
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:36,079
and that's what kovit is good for yeah
 

4159
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,829
and that's what kovit is good for yeah
it's because we we've all had our

4160
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:37,839
it's because we we've all had our
 

4161
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:38,789
it's because we we've all had our
routines and we are

4162
01:05:38,789 --> 01:05:38,799
routines and we are
 

4163
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,870
routines and we are
optimized for the things we do and

4164
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
optimized for the things we do and
 

4165
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,309
optimized for the things we do and
suddenly our backs are against the wall

4166
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:42,319
suddenly our backs are against the wall
 

4167
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:42,870
suddenly our backs are against the wall
all of us

4168
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:42,880
all of us
 

4169
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,950
all of us
yeah it's really i mean one of the

4170
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:44,960
yeah it's really i mean one of the
 

4171
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,309
yeah it's really i mean one of the
exciting things about

4172
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:46,319
exciting things about
 

4173
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:50,230
exciting things about
uh kovet i mean i'm a big believer in

4174
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,240
uh kovet i mean i'm a big believer in
 

4175
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,670
uh kovet i mean i'm a big believer in
the the possibility of what government

4176
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:53,680
the the possibility of what government
 

4177
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,950
the the possibility of what government
can do for the people and uh

4178
01:05:56,950 --> 01:05:56,960
can do for the people and uh
 

4179
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,029
can do for the people and uh
when it becomes too big of a bureaucracy

4180
01:05:59,029 --> 01:05:59,039
when it becomes too big of a bureaucracy
 

4181
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,870
when it becomes too big of a bureaucracy
it starts functioning poorly starts

4182
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:00,880
it starts functioning poorly starts
 

4183
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,470
it starts functioning poorly starts
wasting money

4184
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:02,480
wasting money
 

4185
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,750
wasting money
it's nice to uh i mean covers and

4186
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:05,760
it's nice to uh i mean covers and
 

4187
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,029
it's nice to uh i mean covers and
reveals that nicely and lessons to be

4188
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:09,039
reveals that nicely and lessons to be
 

4189
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:10,069
reveals that nicely and lessons to be
learned

4190
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:10,079
learned
 

4191
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,430
learned
about who gets elected and who goes into

4192
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
about who gets elected and who goes into
 

4193
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,150
about who gets elected and who goes into
government

4194
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160
government
 

4195
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,349
government
hopefully this hopefully this inspires

4196
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:17,359
hopefully this hopefully this inspires
 

4197
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,230
hopefully this hopefully this inspires
talented and young people to go into

4198
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:20,240
talented and young people to go into
 

4199
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,910
talented and young people to go into
government to revolutionize different

4200
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:21,920
government to revolutionize different
 

4201
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,510
government to revolutionize different
aspects of it

4202
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:23,520
aspects of it
 

4203
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,390
aspects of it
yeah so it's uh this that's the positive

4204
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
yeah so it's uh this that's the positive
 

4205
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,589
yeah so it's uh this that's the positive
silver lining of

4206
01:06:27,589 --> 01:06:27,599
silver lining of
 

4207
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,910
silver lining of
of covid i mean i thought it'd be fun to

4208
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:29,920
of covid i mean i thought it'd be fun to
 

4209
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,630
of covid i mean i thought it'd be fun to
ask you

4210
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:30,640
ask you
 

4211
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:31,829
ask you
i don't know if you're paying attention

4212
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:31,839
i don't know if you're paying attention
 

4213
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:36,950
i don't know if you're paying attention
to machine learning world and gpt3

4214
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:36,960

 

4215
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,270

so the gpt3 is this language model this

4216
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,280
so the gpt3 is this language model this
 

4217
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,029
so the gpt3 is this language model this
neural network that's able to uh

4218
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
neural network that's able to uh
 

4219
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,870
neural network that's able to uh
it has 175 billion parameters

4220
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:44,880
it has 175 billion parameters
 

4221
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,829
it has 175 billion parameters
so it's very large and it's trained in

4222
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:47,839
so it's very large and it's trained in
 

4223
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,230
so it's very large and it's trained in
an unsupervised

4224
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:50,240
an unsupervised
 

4225
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,750
an unsupervised
way on the internet it just reads a lot

4226
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:53,760
way on the internet it just reads a lot
 

4227
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,230
way on the internet it just reads a lot
of

4228
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,240
of
 

4229
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,549
of
unstructured text and it's able to

4230
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:56,559
unstructured text and it's able to
 

4231
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,270
unstructured text and it's able to
generate some pretty impressive things

4232
01:06:59,270 --> 01:06:59,280
generate some pretty impressive things
 

4233
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,510
generate some pretty impressive things
the human brain compared to that has

4234
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:01,520
the human brain compared to that has
 

4235
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,309
the human brain compared to that has
about you know

4236
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:02,319
about you know
 

4237
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:05,910
about you know
a thousand times more synapses

4238
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:05,920
a thousand times more synapses
 

4239
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,029
a thousand times more synapses
people get so upset when machine

4240
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:09,039
people get so upset when machine
 

4241
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:09,990
people get so upset when machine
learning people

4242
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,000
learning people
 

4243
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,190
learning people
compare the brain and we know

4244
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:13,200
compare the brain and we know
 

4245
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,870
compare the brain and we know
synapses are different it was very

4246
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:14,880
synapses are different it was very
 

4247
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,390
synapses are different it was very
different very different

4248
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:16,400
different very different
 

4249
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,230
different very different
right but like do you um what do you

4250
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
right but like do you um what do you
 

4251
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,470
right but like do you um what do you
think about gpt3

4252
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:20,480
think about gpt3
 

4253
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,829
think about gpt3
here's what i think here's what i think

4254
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:21,839
here's what i think here's what i think
 

4255
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,150
here's what i think here's what i think
a few things what gpt 3 is doing is

4256
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160
a few things what gpt 3 is doing is
 

4257
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,990
a few things what gpt 3 is doing is
extremely impressive but it's very

4258
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:26,000
extremely impressive but it's very
 

4259
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,470
extremely impressive but it's very
different from what the brain does so

4260
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:28,480
different from what the brain does so
 

4261
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,670
different from what the brain does so
um it's a good impersonator but just as

4262
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:31,680
um it's a good impersonator but just as
 

4263
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:32,950
um it's a good impersonator but just as
one example

4264
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:32,960
one example
 

4265
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,069
one example
everybody takes a passage that gpt

4266
01:07:36,069 --> 01:07:36,079
everybody takes a passage that gpt
 

4267
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,069
everybody takes a passage that gpt
three has has written and they say wow

4268
01:07:38,069 --> 01:07:38,079
three has has written and they say wow
 

4269
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,230
three has has written and they say wow
look at this and it's pretty good right

4270
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:40,240
look at this and it's pretty good right
 

4271
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,349
look at this and it's pretty good right
but it's already gone through a

4272
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:41,359
but it's already gone through a
 

4273
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,190
but it's already gone through a
filtering process of humans looking at

4274
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:43,200
filtering process of humans looking at
 

4275
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,470
filtering process of humans looking at
it and saying okay well that's crap

4276
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:44,480
it and saying okay well that's crap
 

4277
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,750
it and saying okay well that's crap
that's correct okay oh here's

4278
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:45,760
that's correct okay oh here's
 

4279
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,510
that's correct okay oh here's
here's a sentence that's pretty cool now

4280
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:47,520
here's a sentence that's pretty cool now
 

4281
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,789
here's a sentence that's pretty cool now
here's the thing

4282
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:48,799
here's the thing
 

4283
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,710
here's the thing
human creativity is about absorbing

4284
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:50,720
human creativity is about absorbing
 

4285
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,549
human creativity is about absorbing
everything around it and remixing that

4286
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:52,559
everything around it and remixing that
 

4287
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:53,750
everything around it and remixing that
and coming up with stuff so in that

4288
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:53,760
and coming up with stuff so in that
 

4289
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,589
and coming up with stuff so in that
sense we're sort of like gpt3 you know

4290
01:07:55,589 --> 01:07:55,599
sense we're sort of like gpt3 you know
 

4291
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:55,990
sense we're sort of like gpt3 you know
we're

4292
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:56,000
we're
 

4293
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,069
we're
we're remixing what we've gotten in

4294
01:07:58,069 --> 01:07:58,079
we're remixing what we've gotten in
 

4295
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,589
we're remixing what we've gotten in
before

4296
01:07:59,589 --> 01:07:59,599
before
 

4297
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,710
before
but we also know we also have very good

4298
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:02,720
but we also know we also have very good
 

4299
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,870
but we also know we also have very good
models of what it is to be another human

4300
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:04,880
models of what it is to be another human
 

4301
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,190
models of what it is to be another human
and so um you know i don't know if you

4302
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:07,200
and so um you know i don't know if you
 

4303
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,710
and so um you know i don't know if you
speak uh french or something but i'm not

4304
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:08,720
speak uh french or something but i'm not
 

4305
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,829
speak uh french or something but i'm not
gonna start speaking in french because

4306
01:08:09,829 --> 01:08:09,839
gonna start speaking in french because
 

4307
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:10,630
gonna start speaking in french because
then you'll say

4308
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:10,640
then you'll say
 

4309
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,670
then you'll say
wait what are you doing i don't

4310
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:11,680
wait what are you doing i don't
 

4311
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,990
wait what are you doing i don't
understand it instead everything coming

4312
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:14,000
understand it instead everything coming
 

4313
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,309
understand it instead everything coming
out of my mouth is meant for your ears i

4314
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:16,319
out of my mouth is meant for your ears i
 

4315
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,110
out of my mouth is meant for your ears i
know

4316
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:17,120
know
 

4317
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,630
know
what you'll understand i know the

4318
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:18,640
what you'll understand i know the
 

4319
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,070
what you'll understand i know the
vocabulary that you know and don't know

4320
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:20,080
vocabulary that you know and don't know
 

4321
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,669
vocabulary that you know and don't know
i know what parts you care about

4322
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679

 

4323
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,829

that's a huge part of it and so of all

4324
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
that's a huge part of it and so of all
 

4325
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,269
that's a huge part of it and so of all
the possible sentences i could say

4326
01:08:29,269 --> 01:08:29,279
the possible sentences i could say
 

4327
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,829
the possible sentences i could say
i'm navigating this thin bandwidth so

4328
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:31,839
i'm navigating this thin bandwidth so
 

4329
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,590
i'm navigating this thin bandwidth so
that it's something useful for our

4330
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:33,600
that it's something useful for our
 

4331
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,749
that it's something useful for our
conversation yeah in real time but also

4332
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:35,759
conversation yeah in real time but also
 

4333
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:37,590
conversation yeah in real time but also
throughout your life i mean you're

4334
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:37,600
throughout your life i mean you're
 

4335
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,590
throughout your life i mean you're
you're coval we're co-evolving together

4336
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:39,600
you're coval we're co-evolving together
 

4337
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,669
you're coval we're co-evolving together
we're learning exactly how to uh

4338
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:41,679
we're learning exactly how to uh
 

4339
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,829
we're learning exactly how to uh
communicate together exactly but this is

4340
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:43,839
communicate together exactly but this is
 

4341
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:45,030
communicate together exactly but this is
this is what gpt

4342
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,040
this is what gpt
 

4343
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,030
this is what gpt
does not do all it's doing is saying

4344
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,040
does not do all it's doing is saying
 

4345
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,550
does not do all it's doing is saying
okay i'm gonna take all these senses

4346
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:48,560
okay i'm gonna take all these senses
 

4347
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,030
okay i'm gonna take all these senses
and remix stuff and pop some stuff out

4348
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040
and remix stuff and pop some stuff out
 

4349
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:51,990
and remix stuff and pop some stuff out
but it doesn't know how

4350
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
but it doesn't know how
 

4351
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,910
but it doesn't know how
to make it so that you lex will feel

4352
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:53,920
to make it so that you lex will feel
 

4353
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,269
to make it so that you lex will feel
like oh yeah that's exactly what i

4354
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:55,279
like oh yeah that's exactly what i
 

4355
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,309
like oh yeah that's exactly what i
needed to hear

4356
01:08:56,309 --> 01:08:56,319
needed to hear
 

4357
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,550
needed to hear
um that's the next sentence that i

4358
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:58,560
um that's the next sentence that i
 

4359
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,309
um that's the next sentence that i
needed to know about for something

4360
01:09:00,309 --> 01:09:00,319
needed to know about for something
 

4361
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,110
needed to know about for something
well of course it could be all the

4362
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:03,120
well of course it could be all the
 

4363
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,309
well of course it could be all the
impressive results we'll see the

4364
01:09:04,309 --> 01:09:04,319
impressive results we'll see the
 

4365
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,229
impressive results we'll see the
question is when if you raise the number

4366
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
question is when if you raise the number
 

4367
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:07,669
question is when if you raise the number
of parameters

4368
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:07,679
of parameters
 

4369
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,910
of parameters
whether it's going to be after something

4370
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:09,920
whether it's going to be after something
 

4371
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:10,950
whether it's going to be after something
it will not be

4372
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:10,960
it will not be
 

4373
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,309
it will not be
it will not be no raising more

4374
01:09:12,309 --> 01:09:12,319
it will not be no raising more
 

4375
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,990
it will not be no raising more
parameters won't

4376
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,000
parameters won't
 

4377
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,829
parameters won't
here's the thing it's not that i don't

4378
01:09:15,829 --> 01:09:15,839
here's the thing it's not that i don't
 

4379
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,590
here's the thing it's not that i don't
think neural networks can't be like the

4380
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:17,600
think neural networks can't be like the
 

4381
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,189
think neural networks can't be like the
human brain as i suspect they will be at

4382
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,199
human brain as i suspect they will be at
 

4383
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:20,950

some point 50 years you know who knows

4384
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:20,960
some point 50 years you know who knows
 

4385
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,149
some point 50 years you know who knows
but what we are missing

4386
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:24,159
but what we are missing
 

4387
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:26,550
but what we are missing
in artificial neural networks is we've

4388
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:26,560
in artificial neural networks is we've
 

4389
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,070
in artificial neural networks is we've
got this basic structure

4390
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:28,080
got this basic structure
 

4391
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,749
got this basic structure
where you've got units and you've got

4392
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:29,759
where you've got units and you've got
 

4393
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,309
where you've got units and you've got
synapses they're connected

4394
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:32,319
synapses they're connected
 

4395
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:33,910
synapses they're connected
and and that's great and it's done

4396
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:33,920
and and that's great and it's done
 

4397
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,430
and and that's great and it's done
incredibly mind-blowing impressive

incredibly mind-blowing impressive
 

4399
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,950
incredibly mind-blowing impressive
things but

4400
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:36,960
things but
 

4401
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,950
things but
it's not doing the same algorithms as a

4402
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:38,960
it's not doing the same algorithms as a

right now but we also know the things
that they can't

it's uh to me it's it's possible they'll
be surprised

4511
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,950
what's relevant to you that we encode um
this is very useful computers at the

4512
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:20,960
this is very useful computers at the
 

4513
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,630
this is very useful computers at the
moment don't have that they don't have a

4514
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:22,640
moment don't have that they don't have a
 

4515
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,790
moment don't have that they don't have a
yen to survive and things like that so

4516
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:24,800
yen to survive and things like that so
 

4517
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,390
yen to survive and things like that so
we filter out a bunch of the junk we

4518
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:26,400
we filter out a bunch of the junk we
 

4519
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,430
we filter out a bunch of the junk we
don't need

4520
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:27,440
don't need
 

4521
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,229
don't need
we're really good at efficiently zooming

4522
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:30,239
we're really good at efficiently zooming
 

4523
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,470
we're really good at efficiently zooming
into the things we need

4524
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:32,480
into the things we need
 

4525
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,630
into the things we need
again could be argued you know let me

4526
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:34,640
again could be argued you know let me
 

4527
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,910
again could be argued you know let me
put on my freud hat

4528
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:35,920
put on my freud hat
 

4529
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,310
put on my freud hat
maybe it's uh i mean that's our

4530
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:38,320
maybe it's uh i mean that's our
 

4531
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,990
maybe it's uh i mean that's our
conscious mind uh

4532
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:40,000
conscious mind uh
 

4533
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,870
conscious mind uh
you know we're not you know there's no

4534
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:42,880
you know we're not you know there's no
 

4535
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,470
you know we're not you know there's no
reason that neural networks aren't doing

4536
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:44,480
reason that neural networks aren't doing
 

4537
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,990
reason that neural networks aren't doing
the same kind of filtration

4538
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,000
the same kind of filtration
 

4539
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,390
the same kind of filtration
i mean in the sense what gpt3 is doing

4540
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:48,400
i mean in the sense what gpt3 is doing
 

4541
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,669
i mean in the sense what gpt3 is doing
so there's a priming

4542
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:49,679
so there's a priming
 

4543
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,630
so there's a priming
step it's doing an essential kind of

4544
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:52,640
step it's doing an essential kind of
 

4545
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,630
step it's doing an essential kind of
filtration when you

4546
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
filtration when you
 

4547
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,750
filtration when you
ask it to generate tweets from

4548
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:57,760
ask it to generate tweets from
 

4549
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,590
ask it to generate tweets from
from i don't know from from an elon musk

4550
01:11:59,590 --> 01:11:59,600
from i don't know from from an elon musk
 

4551
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,910
from i don't know from from an elon musk
or something like that it's doing

4552
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:01,920
or something like that it's doing
 

4553
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,149
or something like that it's doing
a filtration of it's throwing away all

4554
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:04,159
a filtration of it's throwing away all
 

4555
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,910
a filtration of it's throwing away all
the parameters it doesn't need for this

4556
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:05,920
the parameters it doesn't need for this
 

4557
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,870
the parameters it doesn't need for this
task

4558
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:06,880
task
 

4559
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,030
task
and it's figuring out how to do that

4560
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:09,040
and it's figuring out how to do that
 

4561
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,229
and it's figuring out how to do that
successfully and then

4562
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:10,239
successfully and then
 

4563
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,750
successfully and then
ultimately it's not doing a very good

4564
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
ultimately it's not doing a very good
 

4565
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,669
ultimately it's not doing a very good
job right now but it's doing a lot

4566
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:13,679
job right now but it's doing a lot
 

4567
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,350
job right now but it's doing a lot
better job than we expected

4568
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:15,360
better job than we expected
 

4569
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,350
better job than we expected
but it won't ever do a really good job

4570
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:17,360
but it won't ever do a really good job
 

4571
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,430
but it won't ever do a really good job
and i'll tell you why i mean so so

4572
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:19,440
and i'll tell you why i mean so so
 

4573
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,030
and i'll tell you why i mean so so
let's say we say hey produce an elon

4574
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
let's say we say hey produce an elon
 

4575
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,270
let's say we say hey produce an elon
musk tweet and we see like oh wow it

4576
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:23,280
musk tweet and we see like oh wow it
 

4577
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,470
musk tweet and we see like oh wow it
produced these three that's great but

4578
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:24,480
produced these three that's great but
 

4579
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:24,950
produced these three that's great but
again

4580
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
again
 

4581
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,310
again
it's not we're not seeing the three

4582
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:26,320
it's not we're not seeing the three
 

4583
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,910
it's not we're not seeing the three
thousand that produce that didn't really

4584
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:27,920
thousand that produce that didn't really
 

4585
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:28,870
thousand that produce that didn't really
make any sense

4586
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:28,880
make any sense
 

4587
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,189
make any sense
it's because it has no idea what it is

4588
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:31,199
it's because it has no idea what it is
 

4589
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:32,790
it's because it has no idea what it is
like to be a human

4590
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:32,800
like to be a human
 

4591
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,229
like to be a human
and all the things that you might want

4592
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:34,239
and all the things that you might want
 

4593
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:35,270
and all the things that you might want
to say and all the reasons you wouldn't

4594
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
to say and all the reasons you wouldn't
 

4595
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,189
to say and all the reasons you wouldn't
like when you go to write a tweet

4596
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
like when you go to write a tweet
 

4597
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,790
like when you go to write a tweet
you might write something yeah it's not

4598
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
you might write something yeah it's not
 

4599
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,149
you might write something yeah it's not
going to come off quite right in this

4600
01:12:40,149 --> 01:12:40,159
going to come off quite right in this
 

4601
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:41,510
going to come off quite right in this
modern political climate or whatever

4602
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520
modern political climate or whatever
 

4603
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,350
modern political climate or whatever
like you know you can change things

4604
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,360
like you know you can change things
 

4605
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,910
like you know you can change things
so and it somehow boils down to fear and

4606
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:45,920
so and it somehow boils down to fear and
 

4607
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,110
so and it somehow boils down to fear and
mortality and

4608
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:47,120
mortality and
 

4609
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,270
mortality and
all of these human things at the end of

4610
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:49,280
all of these human things at the end of
 

4611
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,669
all of these human things at the end of
the day all contained with that tweeting

4612
01:12:51,669 --> 01:12:51,679
the day all contained with that tweeting
 

4613
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,669
the day all contained with that tweeting
experience

4614
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:53,679
experience
 

4615
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:55,510
experience
well interestingly the fear of mortality

4616
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:55,520
well interestingly the fear of mortality
 

4617
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,350
well interestingly the fear of mortality
is at the bottom of this but you've got

4618
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
is at the bottom of this but you've got
 

4619
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,350
is at the bottom of this but you've got
all these more things like you know

4620
01:12:59,350 --> 01:12:59,360
all these more things like you know
 

4621
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,149
all these more things like you know
oh i want to just in case the chairman

4622
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:02,159
oh i want to just in case the chairman
 

4623
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,430
oh i want to just in case the chairman
of my department reads this i wanted to

4624
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
of my department reads this i wanted to
 

4625
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,149
of my department reads this i wanted to
come off there

4626
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:04,159
come off there
 

4627
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:05,669
come off there
just in case my mom looks at this tweet

4628
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:05,679
just in case my mom looks at this tweet
 

4629
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,430

01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440
i want to make sure she you know
 

4631
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,189
i want to make sure she you know
and so on so that those are all the

4632
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:09,199
and so on so that those are all the
 

4633
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,550
and so on so that those are all the
things that humans are able to

4634
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:10,560
things that humans are able to
 

4635
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,350
things that humans are able to
sort of throw into the calculation but i

4636
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:13,360
sort of throw into the calculation but i
 

4637
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:13,830
sort of throw into the calculation but i
mean

4638
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:13,840
mean
 

4639
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:16,310
mean
uh what it required what it requires

4640
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:16,320
uh what it required what it requires
 

4641
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,990
uh what it required what it requires
though is having a model

4642
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,000
though is having a model
 

4643
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,590
though is having a model
of your chairman having a model of your

01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:24,000
you know the person you want to go on a
 

4649

you know the person you want to go on a
date with who might look at your tweet

4650
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:25,520
date with who might look at your tweet
 

4651
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:26,070

and so on

4652
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080
and so on
 

4653
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,229
and so on
all these things are uh you're running

4654
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:28,239
all these things are uh you're running
 

4655
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:29,990
all these things are uh you're running
the reason about what it is like to be

4656
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:30,000
the reason about what it is like to be
 

4657
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:30,950
the reason about what it is like to be
them

4658
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:30,960
them
 

4659
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,510
them
so in terms of the structure of the

4660
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:33,520
so in terms of the structure of the
 

4661
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,470
so in terms of the structure of the
brain

4662
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,480
brain
 

4663
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,630
brain
again this may be going into speculation

4664
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:36,640
again this may be going into speculation
 

4665
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,910
again this may be going into speculation
land i hope you

4666
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
land i hope you
 

4667
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,910
land i hope you
go along with me is uh

4668
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
go along with me is uh
 

4669
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,590
go along with me is uh
okay so the brain seems to be

4670
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:43,600
okay so the brain seems to be
 

4671
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,189
okay so the brain seems to be
intelligent

4672
01:13:45,189 --> 01:13:45,199
intelligent
 

4673
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:48,310
intelligent
and our ai systems aren't very currently

4674
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:48,320
and our ai systems aren't very currently
 

4675
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,709
and our ai systems aren't very currently
so where do you think intelligence

4676
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:50,719
so where do you think intelligence
 

4677
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,790
so where do you think intelligence
arises in the brain

4678
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:52,800
arises in the brain
 

4679
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,390
arises in the brain
like what what is it about the brain so

4680
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:56,400
like what what is it about the brain so
 

4681
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,270
like what what is it about the brain so
if you mean where location wise it's no

4682
01:13:59,270 --> 01:13:59,280
if you mean where location wise it's no
 

4683
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:00,790
if you mean where location wise it's no
single spot it would be equivalent to

4684
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:00,800
single spot it would be equivalent to
 

4685
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,830
single spot it would be equivalent to
asking

4686
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:01,840
asking
 

4687
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,510
asking
i'm looking at new york city where

4688
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,520
i'm looking at new york city where
 

4689
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,430
i'm looking at new york city where
is the economy the answer is you can't

4690
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:07,440
is the economy the answer is you can't
 

4691
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,030
is the economy the answer is you can't
point to anywhere the economy is all

4692
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:09,040
point to anywhere the economy is all
 

4693
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,149
point to anywhere the economy is all
about the interaction of

4694
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:10,159
about the interaction of
 

4695
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,149
about the interaction of
all of the pieces and parts of the city

4696
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:12,159
all of the pieces and parts of the city
 

4697
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:13,990
all of the pieces and parts of the city
and that's what you know intelligence

4698
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:14,000
and that's what you know intelligence
 

4699
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,590
and that's what you know intelligence
whatever we mean by that in the brain is

4700
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:15,600
whatever we mean by that in the brain is
 

4701
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,390
whatever we mean by that in the brain is
interacting from

4702
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,400
interacting from
 

4703
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,709
interacting from
everything going on at once in terms of

4704
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:18,719
everything going on at once in terms of
 

4705
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,709
everything going on at once in terms of
a structure so we look humans are much

4706
01:14:20,709 --> 01:14:20,719
a structure so we look humans are much
 

4707
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:22,070
a structure so we look humans are much
smarter than

4708
01:14:22,070 --> 01:14:22,080
smarter than
 

4709
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,510
smarter than
fish maybe not dolphins but

4710
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:25,520
fish maybe not dolphins but
 

4711
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,110
fish maybe not dolphins but
dolphins are mammals right but i assert

4712
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:27,120
dolphins are mammals right but i assert
 

4713
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,950
dolphins are mammals right but i assert
that what we mean by smarter has to do

4714
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
that what we mean by smarter has to do
 

4715
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:29,990
that what we mean by smarter has to do
with live wiring

4716
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
with live wiring
 

4717
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,750
with live wiring
so so what we mean when we say oh we're

4718
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:31,760
so so what we mean when we say oh we're
 

4719
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,350
so so what we mean when we say oh we're
smarter is oh you can figure out a new

4720
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:33,360
smarter is oh you can figure out a new
 

4721
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,790
smarter is oh you can figure out a new
thing and figure out a new pathway to

4722
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
thing and figure out a new pathway to
 

4723
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,790
thing and figure out a new pathway to
get where we need to go

4724
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:36,800
get where we need to go
 

4725
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,790
get where we need to go
and that's because fish are essentially

4726
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:38,800
and that's because fish are essentially
 

4727
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,229
and that's because fish are essentially
coming to the table with you know okay

4728
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:40,239
coming to the table with you know okay
 

4729
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:41,510
coming to the table with you know okay
here's the hardware

4730
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:41,520
here's the hardware
 

4731
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,790
here's the hardware
go swim mate eat but we

4732
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:44,800
go swim mate eat but we
 

4733
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,470
go swim mate eat but we
have the capacity to say okay look i'm

4734
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:46,480
have the capacity to say okay look i'm
 

4735
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,990
have the capacity to say okay look i'm
gonna absorb oh oh but you know i saw

4736
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:48,000
gonna absorb oh oh but you know i saw
 

4737
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,669
gonna absorb oh oh but you know i saw
someone else do this thing and

4738
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:49,679
someone else do this thing and
 

4739
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,430
someone else do this thing and
and i read once that you could do this

4740
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:51,440
and i read once that you could do this
 

4741
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,189
and i read once that you could do this
other thing and so on so do you think

4742
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:53,199
other thing and so on so do you think
 

4743
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:53,669
other thing and so on so do you think
there's

4744
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:53,679
there's
 

4745
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:55,990
there's
is there something i know the these are

4746
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:56,000
is there something i know the these are
 

4747
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,270
is there something i know the these are
mysteries but

4748
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:57,280
mysteries but
 

4749
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,390
mysteries but
like architecturally speaking what

4750
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:00,400
like architecturally speaking what
 

4751
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,669
like architecturally speaking what
feature of the brain

4752
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:01,679
feature of the brain
 

4753
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,990
feature of the brain
of uh of the live wire aspect of it

4754
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:06,000
of uh of the live wire aspect of it
 

4755
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,990
of uh of the live wire aspect of it
that is really useful for intelligence

4756
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:08,000
that is really useful for intelligence
 

4757
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,910
that is really useful for intelligence
so like is it the ability of

4758
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:11,920
so like is it the ability of
 

4759
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,950
so like is it the ability of
neurons to reconnect

4760
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:14,960
neurons to reconnect
 

4761
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,790
neurons to reconnect
like is there something is there any

4762
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:16,800
like is there something is there any
 

4763
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,470
like is there something is there any
lessons about the human brain you

4764
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:18,480
lessons about the human brain you
 

4765
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,910
lessons about the human brain you
think might be inspiring for us and

4766
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:21,920
think might be inspiring for us and
 

4767
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,950
think might be inspiring for us and

know if you want to build a robot

4776
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:31,280
know if you want to build a robot
 

4777
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,189
know if you want to build a robot
start with the stomach and what i mean

4778
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:33,199
start with the stomach and what i mean
 

4779
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,189
start with the stomach and what i mean
by that what i mean by that is

4780
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:35,199
by that what i mean by that is
 

4781
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,790
by that what i mean by that is
a robot has to care it has to have

4782
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:36,800
a robot has to care it has to have
 

4783
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,350
a robot has to care it has to have
hunger it has to care about surviving

4784
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360
hunger it has to care about surviving
 

4785
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,510
hunger it has to care about surviving
that kind of thing here's an example so

4786
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:41,520
that kind of thing here's an example so
 

4787
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,669
that kind of thing here's an example so
the penultimate chapter in my book

the penultimate chapter in my book
 

4789
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,070
the penultimate chapter in my book
um i titled the the wolf in the mars

4790
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:46,080
um i titled the the wolf in the mars
 

4791
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,189
um i titled the the wolf in the mars
rover and i

4792
01:15:47,189 --> 01:15:47,199
rover and i
 

4793
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,110
rover and i
just look at this simple comparison of

4794
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,120
just look at this simple comparison of
 

4795
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,030
just look at this simple comparison of
you look at a wolf

4796
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:51,040
you look at a wolf
 

4797
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,630
you look at a wolf
it gets its leg caught in a trap what

4798
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:52,640
it gets its leg caught in a trap what
 

4799
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,149
it gets its leg caught in a trap what
does it do it gnaws

4800
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:54,159
does it do it gnaws
 

4801
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,390
does it do it gnaws
its leg off and then it figures out how

4802
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
its leg off and then it figures out how
 

4803
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,149
its leg off and then it figures out how
to walk on three legs

4804
01:15:58,149 --> 01:15:58,159
to walk on three legs
 

4805
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:00,550
to walk on three legs
no problem now the mars rover curiosity

4806
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560
no problem now the mars rover curiosity
 

4807
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,470
no problem now the mars rover curiosity
got its front wheel stuck in some

4808
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:02,480
got its front wheel stuck in some
 

4809
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,910
got its front wheel stuck in some
martian soil

4810
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
martian soil
 

4811
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,110
martian soil
and it died this project that cost

4812
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:07,120
and it died this project that cost
 

4813
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,350
and it died this project that cost
billions of dollars died because guys

4814
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:09,360
billions of dollars died because guys
 

4815
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,630
billions of dollars died because guys
wheels so wouldn't it be

4816
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:10,640
wheels so wouldn't it be
 

4817
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,950
wheels so wouldn't it be
terrific if we could build a robot that

4818
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:12,960
terrific if we could build a robot that
 

4819
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,470
terrific if we could build a robot that
chewed off its front wheel

4820
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:14,480
chewed off its front wheel
 

4821
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:15,990
chewed off its front wheel
and figured out how to operate with a

4822
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:16,000
and figured out how to operate with a
 

4823
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,669
and figured out how to operate with a
slightly different body plan

4824
01:16:17,669 --> 01:16:17,679
slightly different body plan
 

4825
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,030
slightly different body plan
that's the kind of thing that we want to

4826
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,040
that's the kind of thing that we want to
 

4827
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,390
that's the kind of thing that we want to
be able to build and to get there

4828
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:22,400
be able to build and to get there
 

4829
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:24,149
be able to build and to get there
what we need the whole reason the wolf

4830
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
what we need the whole reason the wolf
 

4831
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,990
what we need the whole reason the wolf
is able to do that is because

4832
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
is able to do that is because
 

4833
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,990
is able to do that is because
its motor and somatosensory systems are

4834
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,000
its motor and somatosensory systems are
 

4835
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,830
its motor and somatosensory systems are
live wired so it says oh you know what

4836
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:29,840
live wired so it says oh you know what
 

4837
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,189
live wired so it says oh you know what
turns out i've got a body plan that's

4838
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:31,199
turns out i've got a body plan that's
 

4839
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,390
turns out i've got a body plan that's
different than what i thought a few

4840
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,400
different than what i thought a few
 

4841
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,149
different than what i thought a few
minutes ago

4842
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:34,159
minutes ago
 

4843
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:37,510
minutes ago
but i i have a yen to survive

4844
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:37,520
but i i have a yen to survive
 

4845
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,110
but i i have a yen to survive
and i care about relevance which in this

4846
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,120
and i care about relevance which in this
 

4847
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,110
and i care about relevance which in this
case is getting to food getting back to

4848
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:41,120
case is getting to food getting back to
 

4849
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,470
case is getting to food getting back to
my pack and so on

4850
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
my pack and so on
 

4851
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,070
my pack and so on
so i'm just gonna figure out how to

4852
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:44,080
so i'm just gonna figure out how to
 

4853
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,270
so i'm just gonna figure out how to
operate with this oh oops that didn't

4854
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:45,280
operate with this oh oops that didn't
 

4855
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:45,830
operate with this oh oops that didn't
work

4856
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:45,840
work
 

4857
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,310
work
oh okay i'm kind of getting it to work

4858
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:48,320
oh okay i'm kind of getting it to work
 

4859
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,910
oh okay i'm kind of getting it to work
but the mars rover doesn't do that it

4860
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:49,920
but the mars rover doesn't do that it
 

4861
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,510
but the mars rover doesn't do that it
just says oh geez i was pre-programmed

4862
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:51,520
just says oh geez i was pre-programmed
 

4863
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,870
just says oh geez i was pre-programmed
to have four wheels and i have three i'm

4864
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:52,880
to have four wheels and i have three i'm
 

4865
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:53,910
to have four wheels and i have three i'm
screwed

4866
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:53,920
screwed
 

4867
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,350
screwed
yeah you know i i don't know if you're

4868
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:55,360
yeah you know i i don't know if you're
 

4869
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,189
yeah you know i i don't know if you're
familiar with a philosopher named

4870
01:16:57,189 --> 01:16:57,199
familiar with a philosopher named
 

4871

solomon i think he i just

4878
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
solomon i think he i just
 

4879
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,350
solomon i think he i just
spoke with him on his podcast who

4880
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:07,360
spoke with him on his podcast who
 

4881
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,229
spoke with him on his podcast who
developed

4882
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
developed
 

4883
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:11,350
developed
terror management theory which is uh

4884
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:11,360
terror management theory which is uh
 

4885
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,950
terror management theory which is uh
like ernest becker is a philosopher that

4886
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
like ernest becker is a philosopher that
 

4887
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,189
like ernest becker is a philosopher that
basically said that

4888
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:15,199
basically said that
 

4889
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,430
basically said that
uh mortality fear of mortality is at the

4890
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:17,440
uh mortality fear of mortality is at the
 

4891
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,790
uh mortality fear of mortality is at the
core of it yeah

4892
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
core of it yeah
 

4893
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,270
core of it yeah
and so i i don't know if it sounds

4894
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:21,280
and so i i don't know if it sounds
 

4895
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,189
and so i i don't know if it sounds
compelling as an idea

4896
01:17:23,189 --> 01:17:23,199
compelling as an idea
 

4897
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:25,110
compelling as an idea
that we're all i mean that all of the

4898
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:25,120
that we're all i mean that all of the
 

4899
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:26,950
that we're all i mean that all of the
civilization we've constructed

4900
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:26,960
civilization we've constructed
 

4901
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,430
civilization we've constructed
is based on this but it's i'm familiar

4902
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:29,440
is based on this but it's i'm familiar
 

4903
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,390
is based on this but it's i'm familiar
with his work

4904
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:30,400
with his work
 

4905
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,630
with his work
here's what i think i think that yes

4906
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:32,640
here's what i think i think that yes
 

4907
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,910
here's what i think i think that yes
fundamentally

4908
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:33,920
fundamentally
 

4909
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,149
fundamentally
this desire to survive is at the core of

4910
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:36,159
this desire to survive is at the core of
 

4911
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,350
this desire to survive is at the core of
it i would agree with that

4912
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:37,360
it i would agree with that
 

4913
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,830
it i would agree with that
but but how that expresses itself in

4914
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:39,840
but but how that expresses itself in
 

4915
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,550
but but how that expresses itself in
your life

4916
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:40,560
your life
 

4917
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:41,830
your life
it ends up being very different the

4918
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:41,840
it ends up being very different the
 

4919
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,310
it ends up being very different the
reason you do what you do

4920
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:44,320
reason you do what you do
 

4921
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:47,110
reason you do what you do
is i mean you could list the 100 reasons

4922
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:47,120
is i mean you could list the 100 reasons
 

4923
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,550
is i mean you could list the 100 reasons
why you chose to write your tweet this

4924
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
why you chose to write your tweet this
 

4925
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,350
why you chose to write your tweet this
way and that way

4926
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:49,360
way and that way
 

4927
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,550
way and that way
and it really has nothing to do with the

4928
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:50,560
and it really has nothing to do with the
 

4929
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,149
and it really has nothing to do with the
survival part it has to do with you know

4930
01:17:52,149 --> 01:17:52,159
survival part it has to do with you know
 

4931
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:53,430
survival part it has to do with you know
trying to impress fellow humans and

4932
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:53,440
trying to impress fellow humans and
 

4933
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,110
trying to impress fellow humans and
surprise them and say something

4934
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:55,120
surprise them and say something
 

4935
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,630
surprise them and say something
yeah so many things built on top of each

4936
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
yeah so many things built on top of each
 

4937
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,709
yeah so many things built on top of each
other but it's it's fascinating to think

4938
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
other but it's it's fascinating to think
 

4939
01:17:58,719 --> 01:17:59,189
other but it's it's fascinating to think
that

4940
01:17:59,189 --> 01:17:59,199
that
 

4941
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:00,950
that
in artificial intelligence systems we

4942
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:00,960
in artificial intelligence systems we
 

4943
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,790
in artificial intelligence systems we
want to be able to somehow

4944
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:02,800
want to be able to somehow
 

4945
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,470
want to be able to somehow
engineer this drive for survival for

4946
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:06,480
engineer this drive for survival for
 

4947
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,350
engineer this drive for survival for
immortality i mean because as humans

4948
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:09,360
immortality i mean because as humans
 

4949
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,390
immortality i mean because as humans
we're not just

4950
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:10,400
we're not just
 

4951
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,870
we're not just
about survival we're aware of the fact

4952
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:12,880
about survival we're aware of the fact
 

4953
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,550
about survival we're aware of the fact
that we're going to die

4954
01:18:14,550 --> 01:18:14,560
that we're going to die
 

4955
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,870
that we're going to die
which is a very kind of where we're like

4956
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:16,880
which is a very kind of where we're like
 

4957
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:17,750
which is a very kind of where we're like
space-time

4958
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:17,760
space-time
 

4959
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,870
space-time
by the way aren't all right confucius

4960
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:20,880
by the way aren't all right confucius
 

4961
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,270
by the way aren't all right confucius
said

4962
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:21,280
said
 

4963
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,630
said
uh he said each person

4964
01:18:24,630 --> 01:18:24,640
uh he said each person
 

4965
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,430
uh he said each person
has two lives the second one begins when

4966
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:27,440
has two lives the second one begins when
 

4967
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,350
has two lives the second one begins when
you realize that you have just one

4968
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:29,360
you realize that you have just one
 

4969
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,950
you realize that you have just one
yeah but but most people it takes a long

4970
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
yeah but but most people it takes a long
 

4971
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,470
yeah but but most people it takes a long
time for most people to get there

4972
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:32,480
time for most people to get there
 

4973
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,990
time for most people to get there
i mean you could argue this kind of

4974
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:34,000
i mean you could argue this kind of
 

4975
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,149
i mean you could argue this kind of
freudian thing which ernest becker

4976
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:36,159
freudian thing which ernest becker
 

4977
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:39,590
freudian thing which ernest becker
uh argues is they it's they

4978
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:39,600
uh argues is they it's they
 

4979
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,630
uh argues is they it's they
they actually figured it out early on

4980
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,640
they actually figured it out early on
 

4981
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,350
they actually figured it out early on
and the terror they felt was like the

4982
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:45,360
and the terror they felt was like the
 

4983
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:45,830
and the terror they felt was like the
reason

4984
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
reason
 

4985
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,310
reason
it's been suppressed and the reason most

4986

people when i ask them about whether
they're afraid of death they basically

they're afraid of death they basically
 

4991
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,950
they're afraid of death they basically
say no

4992

say no
 

4993
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,149
say no
they basically say like um i'm afraid i

4994
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
they basically say like um i'm afraid i
 

4995
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:56,790
they basically say like um i'm afraid i
won't get

4996
01:18:56,790 --> 01:18:56,800
won't get
 

4997
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,070
won't get
like submit the paper before i die like

4998
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:00,080
like submit the paper before i die like
 

4999
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,990
like submit the paper before i die like
they kind of see they see death as a

5000
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
they kind of see they see death as a
 

5001
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,110
they kind of see they see death as a
kind of uh

5002
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
kind of uh
 

5003
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,669
kind of uh
inconvenient deadline for a particular

5004
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:05,679
inconvenient deadline for a particular
 

5005
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:06,149
inconvenient deadline for a particular
set of

set of
 

5007
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,229
set of
like a book you're writing yeah it's as

5008

like a book you're writing yeah it's as
 

5009
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:09,750
like a book you're writing yeah it's as
opposed to like

what the hell this thing ends this
 

5013
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,390
what the hell this thing ends this
at any moment like most people as if i

5014
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:16,400
at any moment like most people as if i
 

5015
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,390
at any moment like most people as if i
have encountered do not meditate on the

5016
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
have encountered do not meditate on the
 

5017
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,750
have encountered do not meditate on the
idea that like

5018
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:19,760
idea that like
 

5019
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:22,870
idea that like
right now you could die like right now

5020
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:22,880
right now you could die like right now
 

5021
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,750
right now you could die like right now
like it it's like it in in the next five

5022
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:25,760
like it it's like it in in the next five
 

5023
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,669
like it it's like it in in the next five
minutes it could be all over

5024
01:19:27,669 --> 01:19:27,679
minutes it could be all over
 

5025
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,709
minutes it could be all over
and you know meditate on that idea

5026
01:19:30,709 --> 01:19:30,719
and you know meditate on that idea
 

5027
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:32,550
and you know meditate on that idea
i think that somehow brings you closer

5028
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
i think that somehow brings you closer
 

5029
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,830
i think that somehow brings you closer
to like

5030
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:33,840
to like
 

5031
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,870
to like
the core of the motivations and

5032
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:36,880
the core of the motivations and
 

5033
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,669
the core of the motivations and
the core of the human cognition

5034
01:19:39,669 --> 01:19:39,679
the core of the human cognition
 

5035
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:40,470
the core of the human cognition
condition

5036
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:40,480
condition
 

5037
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,750
condition
but like i said it is not

5038
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:43,760
but like i said it is not
 

5039
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,430
but like i said it is not
yeah there's so many things on top of it

5040
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:45,440
yeah there's so many things on top of it
 

5041
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,030
yeah there's so many things on top of it
but it is interesting i mean

5042
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:47,040
but it is interesting i mean
 

5043
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,910
but it is interesting i mean
as the ancient poet said uh death

5044
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:49,920
as the ancient poet said uh death
 

5045
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,590
as the ancient poet said uh death
whispers at my ear

5046
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:51,600
whispers at my ear
 

5047
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,790
whispers at my ear
live for i come so it's

5048
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:54,800
live for i come so it's
 

5049
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,790
live for i come so it's
it is certainly motivating when we think

5050
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:56,800
it is certainly motivating when we think
 

5051
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:57,990
it is certainly motivating when we think
about that

5052
01:19:57,990 --> 01:19:58,000
about that
 

5053
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,430
about that
okay i've got some deadline i don't know

5054
01:19:59,430 --> 01:19:59,440
okay i've got some deadline i don't know
 

5055
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,030
okay i've got some deadline i don't know
exactly what it is but i better make

5056
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:01,040
exactly what it is but i better make
 

5057
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:01,350
exactly what it is but i better make
stuff

5058
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,360
stuff
 

5059
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,350
stuff
happen it is motivating but i don't

5060
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:03,360
happen it is motivating but i don't
 

5061
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,270
happen it is motivating but i don't
think uh i mean i know for just

5062
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:05,280
think uh i mean i know for just
 

5063
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,430
think uh i mean i know for just
speaking for me personally that's not

5064
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:07,440
speaking for me personally that's not
 

5065
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,030
speaking for me personally that's not
what motivates me day to day it's

5066
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:09,040
what motivates me day to day it's
 

5067
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,070
what motivates me day to day it's
instead

5068
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:10,080
instead

oh i want to get this you know

5070
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:13,280
oh i want to get this you know
 

5071
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,870
oh i want to get this you know
program up and running before this or i

program up and running before this or i

want to make sure my co-author isn't mad
 

5075
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,070
want to make sure my co-author isn't mad
at me because i haven't gotten this in

01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:18,080
at me because i haven't gotten this in
 

5077
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,110
at me because i haven't gotten this in
there i don't want to miss this grant

5078
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:19,120
there i don't want to miss this grant
 

5079
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:19,830
there i don't want to miss this grant
deadline or

5080
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:19,840
deadline or
 

5081
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,750
deadline or
you know whatever the thing is yeah it's

5082
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:21,760
you know whatever the thing is yeah it's
 

5083
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,990
you know whatever the thing is yeah it's
too it's too distant in a sense

5084
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:24,000
too it's too distant in a sense
 

5085
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,550
too it's too distant in a sense
nevertheless it is good to reconnect but

5086
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:26,560
nevertheless it is good to reconnect but
 

5087
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,870
nevertheless it is good to reconnect but
for the ai systems

5088
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:28,880
for the ai systems
 

5089
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,669
for the ai systems
none of that is there uh like a neural

5090
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:31,679
none of that is there uh like a neural
 

5091
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,229
none of that is there uh like a neural
network does not fear it's mortality

5092
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:34,239
network does not fear it's mortality
 

5093
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:37,110
network does not fear it's mortality
uh and that that seems to be somehow

5094
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,120
uh and that that seems to be somehow
 

5095
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,669
uh and that that seems to be somehow
fundamentally missing the point

5096
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:39,679
fundamentally missing the point
 

5097
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:40,950
fundamentally missing the point
i think that's missing the point but i

5098
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:40,960
i think that's missing the point but i
 

5099
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,310
i think that's missing the point but i
wonder it's an interesting speculation

5100
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:42,320
wonder it's an interesting speculation
 

5101
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,590
wonder it's an interesting speculation
about whether you can build an ai system

5102
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:43,600
about whether you can build an ai system
 

5103
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,669
about whether you can build an ai system
that is much closer to being a human

5104
01:20:45,669 --> 01:20:45,679
that is much closer to being a human
 

5105
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,310
that is much closer to being a human
without the mortality and survival piece

5106
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
without the mortality and survival piece
 

5107
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,310
without the mortality and survival piece
but just the thing of

5108
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,320
but just the thing of
 

5109
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,470
but just the thing of
relevance just i care about this versus

5110
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480
relevance just i care about this versus
 

5111
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,070
relevance just i care about this versus
that right now if you have a robot roll

5112
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:54,080
that right now if you have a robot roll
 

5113
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:54,709
that right now if you have a robot roll
into the room

5114
01:20:54,709 --> 01:20:54,719
into the room
 

5115
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:55,750
into the room
it's going to be frozen because it

5116
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:55,760
it's going to be frozen because it
 

5117
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,030
it's going to be frozen because it
doesn't have any reason to go there

5118
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,040
doesn't have any reason to go there

01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,830
doesn't have any reason to go there

particular
set of things about

5124
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:03,440
set of things about
 

5125
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,350
set of things about
this is how i should navigate my next

5126
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,360
this is how i should navigate my next
 

5127
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,470
this is how i should navigate my next
move because i want

5128
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:06,480
move because i want
 

5129
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,030
move because i want
something yeah there's a that's the

5130
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,040
something yeah there's a that's the
 

5131
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,790
something yeah there's a that's the
thing about humans

thing about humans
 

5133
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,910
thing about humans
is they seem to generate goals they're

5134
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:13,920
is they seem to generate goals they're
 

5135
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,390
is they seem to generate goals they're
like

5136
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,400
like
 

5137
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,830
like
you said live wired i mean it it's very

5138
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:17,840
you said live wired i mean it it's very
 

5139
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,070
you said live wired i mean it it's very
flexible in terms of the goals and

5140
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,080
flexible in terms of the goals and
 

5141
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,350
flexible in terms of the goals and
creative in terms of the goals you

5142
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:21,360
creative in terms of the goals you
 

5143
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,590
creative in terms of the goals you
generate when we enter a room

5144
01:21:23,590 --> 01:21:23,600
generate when we enter a room
 

5145
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,510
generate when we enter a room
you show up to a party without a goal

5146
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:25,520
you show up to a party without a goal
 

5147
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,629
you show up to a party without a goal
usually

5148
01:21:26,629 --> 01:21:26,639
usually
 

5149
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:28,229
usually
and then you figure it out alone yes but

5150
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:28,239
and then you figure it out alone yes but
 

5151
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:29,350
and then you figure it out alone yes but
this goes back to the question about

5152
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:29,360
this goes back to the question about
 

5153
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,110
this goes back to the question about
free will which is when i walk into the

5154
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,120
free will which is when i walk into the
 

5155
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,270
free will which is when i walk into the
party

5156
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:33,280
party
 

5157
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,830
party
if you rewound it 10 000 times would i

5158
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:35,840
if you rewound it 10 000 times would i
 

5159
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,910
if you rewound it 10 000 times would i
go and talk to that couple over there

5160
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:37,920
go and talk to that couple over there
 

5161
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,990
go and talk to that couple over there
versus that person like

5162
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:40,000
versus that person like
 

5163
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,430
versus that person like
i might do this exact same thing every

5164
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,440
i might do this exact same thing every
 

5165
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,669
i might do this exact same thing every
time because i've got some goal stack

5166
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:43,679
time because i've got some goal stack
 

5167
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,910
time because i've got some goal stack
and i think okay well at this party i

5168
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:45,920
and i think okay well at this party i
 

5169
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,709
and i think okay well at this party i
really want to meet

5170
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
really want to meet
 

5171
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,550
really want to meet
these kind of people or i feel awkward

5172
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:48,560
these kind of people or i feel awkward
 

5173
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:50,470
these kind of people or i feel awkward
or i whatever you know whatever my goals

5174
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:50,480
or i whatever you know whatever my goals
 

5175
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:51,189
or i whatever you know whatever my goals
are

5176
01:21:51,189 --> 01:21:51,199
are
 

5177
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,790
are
by the way so there was something that i

5178
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
by the way so there was something that i
 

5179
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,550
by the way so there was something that i
meant to mention earlier

5180
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:54,560
meant to mention earlier
 

5181
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,390
meant to mention earlier
if you don't mind going back which is

5182
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:56,400
if you don't mind going back which is
 

5183
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,870
if you don't mind going back which is
this when we were talking about bci

5184
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
this when we were talking about bci
 

5185
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,550
this when we were talking about bci
um so i don't know if you know this but

5186
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:00,560
um so i don't know if you know this but
 

5187
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:01,990
um so i don't know if you know this but
what i'm spending ninety percent of my

5188
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:02,000
what i'm spending ninety percent of my
 

5189
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,669
what i'm spending ninety percent of my
time doing now is running a company

5190
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:03,679
time doing now is running a company
 

5191
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:06,070
time doing now is running a company
do you know about this yes i wasn't sure

5192
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:06,080
do you know about this yes i wasn't sure
 

5193
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,270
do you know about this yes i wasn't sure
what the company

5194
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:07,280
what the company
 

5195
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,350
what the company
is involved in right so talk about it

5196
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
is involved in right so talk about it
 

5197
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:10,709
is involved in right so talk about it
yeah yeah

5198
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:10,719
yeah yeah
 

5199
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:14,470
yeah yeah
so when it comes to the future of bci um

5200
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:14,480
so when it comes to the future of bci um
 

5201
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:16,550
so when it comes to the future of bci um
you know you can put stuff into the

5202
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:16,560
you know you can put stuff into the
 

5203
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:17,510
you know you can put stuff into the
brain

5204
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,520
brain
 

5205
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,629
brain
invasively but my interest has been

5206
01:22:20,629 --> 01:22:20,639
invasively but my interest has been
 

5207
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,390
invasively but my interest has been
how you can get data streams into the

5208
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:22,400
how you can get data streams into the
 

5209
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,790
how you can get data streams into the
brain non-invasively so i run a company

5210
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:24,800
brain non-invasively so i run a company
 

5211
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,310
brain non-invasively so i run a company
called neosensory

5212
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:26,320
called neosensory
 

5213
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,950
called neosensory
and what we build is this little um

5214
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:28,960
and what we build is this little um
 

5215
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,229
and what we build is this little um
wristband we've built this in many

5216
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:30,239
wristband we've built this in many
 

5217
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,189
wristband we've built this in many
different oh wow

5218
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:31,199
different oh wow
 

5219
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,189
different oh wow
that's it yeah this is it and it's got

5220
01:22:33,189 --> 01:22:33,199
that's it yeah this is it and it's got
 

5221
01:22:33,199 --> 01:22:35,350
that's it yeah this is it and it's got
these vibratory motors in it

5222
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:35,360
these vibratory motors in it
 

5223
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,669
these vibratory motors in it
so these things as i'm speaking for

5224
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:37,679
so these things as i'm speaking for
 

5225
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:38,709
so these things as i'm speaking for
example it's

5226
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:38,719
example it's
 

5227
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:40,390
example it's
you know capturing my voice and running

5228
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:40,400
you know capturing my voice and running
 

5229
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:41,910
you know capturing my voice and running
algorithms and then turning that into

5230
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:41,920
algorithms and then turning that into
 

5231
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,390
algorithms and then turning that into
patterns of vibration here

5232
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:44,400
patterns of vibration here
 

5233
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:48,709
patterns of vibration here
so people who are deaf for example

5234
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:48,719
so people who are deaf for example
 

5235
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:51,110
so people who are deaf for example
learn to hear through their skin so the

5236
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:51,120
learn to hear through their skin so the
 

5237
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,030
learn to hear through their skin so the
information is getting up to their brain

5238
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
information is getting up to their brain
 

5239
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,149
information is getting up to their brain
this way

5240
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
this way
 

5241
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,229
this way
and they learn how to hear so it turns

5242
01:22:56,229 --> 01:22:56,239
and they learn how to hear so it turns
 

5243
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:57,910
and they learn how to hear so it turns
out on day one people are pretty good

5244
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
out on day one people are pretty good
 

5245
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,430
out on day one people are pretty good
like better than you would expect at

5246
01:22:59,430 --> 01:22:59,440
like better than you would expect at
 

5247
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,470
like better than you would expect at
being able to say

5248
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:00,480
being able to say
 

5249
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,990
being able to say
oh that's weird it was that was that a

5250
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:02,000
oh that's weird it was that was that a
 

5251
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:03,350
oh that's weird it was that was that a
dog barking was that a baby crying was

5252
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:03,360
dog barking was that a baby crying was
 

5253
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,709
dog barking was that a baby crying was
that a door knock a doorbell

5254
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:04,719
that a door knock a doorbell
 

5255
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,550
that a door knock a doorbell
like people are pretty good at it but

5256
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:06,560
like people are pretty good at it but
 

5257
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,110
like people are pretty good at it but
with time they get better and better

5258
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,120
with time they get better and better
 

5259
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,390
with time they get better and better
and what it becomes is a new qualia in

5260
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:12,400
and what it becomes is a new qualia in
 

5261
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,470
and what it becomes is a new qualia in
other words a new subjective internal

5262
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:14,480
other words a new subjective internal
 

5263
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,350
other words a new subjective internal
experience

5264
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:15,360
experience
 

5265
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,910
experience
so on day one they they say whoa what

5266
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:17,920
so on day one they they say whoa what
 

5267
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:18,390
so on day one they they say whoa what
was that

5268
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,400
was that
 

5269
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:21,270
was that
oh oh that was the dog barking but by

5270
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:21,280
oh oh that was the dog barking but by
 

5271
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:21,669
oh oh that was the dog barking but by
you know

5272
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:21,679
you know
 

5273
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:23,669
you know
three months later they say oh there's

5274
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:23,679
three months later they say oh there's
 

5275
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,430
three months later they say oh there's
dog barking somewhere oh there's the dog

5276
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:25,440
dog barking somewhere oh there's the dog
 

5277
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,870
dog barking somewhere oh there's the dog
that's fascinating and by the way that's

5278
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:26,880
that's fascinating and by the way that's
 

5279
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,149
that's fascinating and by the way that's
exactly how you learn how to use your

5280
01:23:28,149 --> 01:23:28,159
exactly how you learn how to use your
 

5281
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,270
exactly how you learn how to use your
ears

5282
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:29,280
ears
 

5283
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,310
ears
so what you of course need to remember

5284
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
so what you of course need to remember
 

5285
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,229
so what you of course need to remember
this but when you're an infant all you

5286
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:32,239
this but when you're an infant all you
 

5287
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,470
this but when you're an infant all you
have are you know your eardrum vibrating

5288
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:34,480
have are you know your eardrum vibrating
 

5289
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,110
have are you know your eardrum vibrating
causes spikes to go down your auditory

5290
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:37,120
causes spikes to go down your auditory
 

5291
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,629
causes spikes to go down your auditory
nerves and impinging your

5292
01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:38,639
nerves and impinging your
 

5293
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:41,270
nerves and impinging your
you know auditory cortex your brain

5294
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:41,280
you know auditory cortex your brain
 

5295
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,229
you know auditory cortex your brain
doesn't know what those mean

5296
01:23:42,229 --> 01:23:42,239
doesn't know what those mean
 

5297
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,070
doesn't know what those mean
automatically but what happens is you

5298
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,080
automatically but what happens is you
 

5299
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,270
automatically but what happens is you
learn how to hear by looking for

5300
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:45,280
learn how to hear by looking for
 

5301
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,950
learn how to hear by looking for
correlations you know you clap your

5302
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:46,960
correlations you know you clap your
 

5303
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,629
correlations you know you clap your
hands as a baby

5304
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
hands as a baby
 

5305
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,149
hands as a baby
you know you look at your mother's mouth

5306
01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:50,159
you know you look at your mother's mouth
 

5307
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,310
you know you look at your mother's mouth
moving and and that correlates with

5308
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
moving and and that correlates with
 

5309
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,270
moving and and that correlates with
what's going on there

5310
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:53,280
what's going on there
 

5311
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,030
what's going on there
and eventually your brain says i'm just

5312
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,040
and eventually your brain says i'm just
 

5313
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,629
and eventually your brain says i'm just
going to summarize this as

5314
01:23:56,629 --> 01:23:56,639
going to summarize this as
 

5315
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,470
going to summarize this as
an internal experience as a conscious

5316
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
an internal experience as a conscious
 

5317
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,149
an internal experience as a conscious
experience and that's exactly what

5318
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
experience and that's exactly what
 

5319
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,189
experience and that's exactly what
happens here

5320
01:24:01,189 --> 01:24:01,199
happens here
 

5321
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,189
happens here
the weird part is that you can feed data

5322
01:24:03,189 --> 01:24:03,199
the weird part is that you can feed data
 

5323
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:04,229
the weird part is that you can feed data
into the brain

5324
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:04,239
into the brain
 

5325
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,830
into the brain
not through the ears but through any

5326
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:05,840
not through the ears but through any
 

5327
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,669
not through the ears but through any
channel that gets there as long as the

5328
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:07,679
channel that gets there as long as the
 

5329
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:08,950
channel that gets there as long as the
information gets there your brain

5330
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:08,960
information gets there your brain
 

5331
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,390
information gets there your brain
figures out what to do with it that's

5332
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:10,400
figures out what to do with it that's
 

5333
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:11,270
figures out what to do with it that's
fascinating

5334
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,280
fascinating
 

5335
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,709
fascinating
like expanding the set of sensors

5336
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:14,719
like expanding the set of sensors
 

5337
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,830
like expanding the set of sensors
it could be could be arbitrarily uh

5338
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:17,840
it could be could be arbitrarily uh
 

5339
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,189
it could be could be arbitrarily uh
could could it could yeah it could

5340
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:19,199
could could it could yeah it could
 

5341
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:21,189
could could it could yeah it could
expand arbitrarily which is fascinating

5342
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:21,199
expand arbitrarily which is fascinating
 

5343
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,709
expand arbitrarily which is fascinating
well exactly and by the way

5344
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:22,719
well exactly and by the way
 

5345
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,470
well exactly and by the way
the reason i use this skin you know

5346
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:24,480
the reason i use this skin you know
 

5347
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,229
the reason i use this skin you know
there's all kinds of cool stuff going on

5348
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:26,239
there's all kinds of cool stuff going on
 

5349

other stuff
but you're covered with the skin which

5360
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800
but you're covered with the skin which
 

5361
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,790
but you're covered with the skin which
is this incredible computational

with which you can feed information and
 

5367
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,350
with which you can feed information and
we don't use our skin for much of

5368
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:41,360
we don't use our skin for much of
 

5369
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,629
we don't use our skin for much of
anything nowadays

um my joke in the lab is that i say we

5372
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:44,800
um my joke in the lab is that i say we
 

5373
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,070
um my joke in the lab is that i say we
don't call this the waste for nothing

5374
01:24:46,070 --> 01:24:46,080
don't call this the waste for nothing
 

5375
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,669
don't call this the waste for nothing
because originally we built as the vest

5376
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
because originally we built as the vest
 

5377
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:48,870
because originally we built as the vest
and you know you're passing in all this

5378

5387
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,270
community
is is what's called sensory substitution

5388
01:24:59,270 --> 01:24:59,280
is is what's called sensory substitution
 

5389
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,110
is is what's called sensory substitution
where i'm capturing sound and scent you

5390
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,120
where i'm capturing sound and scent you
 

5391
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,950
where i'm capturing sound and scent you
know i'm just replacing the ears with

5392
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:02,960
know i'm just replacing the ears with
 

5393
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:03,830
know i'm just replacing the ears with
the skin

5394
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:03,840
the skin
 

5395
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,629
the skin
and that works um one of the things i

5396
01:25:06,629 --> 01:25:06,639
and that works um one of the things i
 

5397
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:08,870
and that works um one of the things i
talk about in livewire is sensory

5398
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:08,880
talk about in livewire is sensory
 

5399
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:10,950
talk about in livewire is sensory
expansion so what if you took something

5400
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:10,960
expansion so what if you took something
 

5401
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,990
expansion so what if you took something
like your your visual

5402
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
like your your visual
 

5403
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,430
like your your visual
system which picks up on a very thin

5404
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:13,440
system which picks up on a very thin
 

5405
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,590
system which picks up on a very thin
slice of the electromagnetic spectrum

5406
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:15,600
slice of the electromagnetic spectrum
 

5407
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,310
slice of the electromagnetic spectrum
and you could see infrared or

5408
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:18,320
and you could see infrared or
 

5409
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,590
and you could see infrared or
ultraviolet so we've hooked that up

5410
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:19,600
ultraviolet so we've hooked that up
 

5411
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,510
ultraviolet so we've hooked that up
infrared and ultraviolet detectors

5412
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:21,520
infrared and ultraviolet detectors
 

5413
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,030
infrared and ultraviolet detectors
and you know i can feel what's going on

5414
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:23,040
and you know i can feel what's going on
 

5415
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,550
and you know i can feel what's going on
so just as an example the first night i

5416
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:24,560
so just as an example the first night i
 

5417
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:25,510
so just as an example the first night i
built the infrared

5418
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:25,520
built the infrared
 

5419
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,629
built the infrared
one of my engineers built at the

5420
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:26,639
one of my engineers built at the
 

5421
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,629
one of my engineers built at the
infrared detector i was walking in the

5422
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:28,639
infrared detector i was walking in the
 

5423
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:30,229
infrared detector i was walking in the
dark between two houses and suddenly i

5424
01:25:30,229 --> 01:25:30,239
dark between two houses and suddenly i
 

5425
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:30,870
dark between two houses and suddenly i
felt

5426
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:30,880
felt
 

5427
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,229
felt
all this infrared radiation i was like

5428
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:32,239
all this infrared radiation i was like
 

5429
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:33,430
all this infrared radiation i was like
where does that come from and i just

5430
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:33,440
where does that come from and i just
 

5431
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:34,790
where does that come from and i just
followed my wrist and i found a

5432
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:34,800
followed my wrist and i found a
 

5433
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,629
followed my wrist and i found a
um an infrared camera a night vision

5434
01:25:36,629 --> 01:25:36,639
um an infrared camera a night vision
 

5435
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:38,070
um an infrared camera a night vision
camera that was

5436
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:38,080
camera that was
 

5437
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,430
camera that was
but like you know i immediately oh there

5438
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:39,440
but like you know i immediately oh there
 

5439
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,110
but like you know i immediately oh there
there's that thing there but

5440
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:41,120
there's that thing there but
 

5441
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,629
there's that thing there but
of course i would have never seen it but

5442
01:25:42,629 --> 01:25:42,639
of course i would have never seen it but
 

5443
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:44,629
of course i would have never seen it but
now it's just part of my

5444
01:25:44,629 --> 01:25:44,639
now it's just part of my
 

5445
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,950
now it's just part of my
reality that's fascinating yeah and then

5446
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:46,960
reality that's fascinating yeah and then
 

5447
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,149
reality that's fascinating yeah and then
of course what i'm really interested in

5448
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:48,159
of course what i'm really interested in
 

5449
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:49,270
of course what i'm really interested in
is sensory

5450
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:49,280
is sensory
 

5451
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,110
is sensory
addition what if you could pick up on

5452
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,120
addition what if you could pick up on
 

5453
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,110
addition what if you could pick up on
stuff that

5454
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:53,120
stuff that
 

5455
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,110
stuff that
isn't even part of what we normally pick

5456
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,120
isn't even part of what we normally pick
 

5457
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,950
isn't even part of what we normally pick
up on like you know like the magnetic

5458
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:56,960
up on like you know like the magnetic
 

5459
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,629
up on like you know like the magnetic
field of the earth or

5460
01:25:58,629 --> 01:25:58,639
field of the earth or
 

5461
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:00,470
field of the earth or
twitter or stock market or things like

5462
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:00,480
twitter or stock market or things like
 

5463
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,390
twitter or stock market or things like
that or the i don't know some weird

5464
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:02,400
that or the i don't know some weird
 

5465
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,990
that or the i don't know some weird
stuff like the moods of other people or

5466
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:04,000
stuff like the moods of other people or
 

5467
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,030
stuff like the moods of other people or
something like that sure

5468
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:05,040
something like that sure
 

5469
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:06,550
something like that sure
now what you need is a way to measure

5470
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:06,560
now what you need is a way to measure
 

5471
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,830
now what you need is a way to measure
that so as long as there's a machine

5472
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:07,840
that so as long as there's a machine
 

5473
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,030
that so as long as there's a machine
that can measure it it's easy it's

5474
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:09,040
that can measure it it's easy it's
 

5475
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,709
that can measure it it's easy it's
trivial to feed this in here and you

5476
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:10,719
trivial to feed this in here and you
 

5477
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:11,830
trivial to feed this in here and you
come to be

5478
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:11,840
come to be
 

5479
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,790
come to be
it comes to be part of your reality it's

5480
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:14,800
it comes to be part of your reality it's
 

5481
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,550
it comes to be part of your reality it's
like you have another sensor

5482
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:16,560
like you have another sensor
 

5483
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,030
like you have another sensor
and that that kind of thing is without

5484
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:19,040
and that that kind of thing is without
 

5485
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,470
and that that kind of thing is without
doing like if you look in your link

5486
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:20,480
doing like if you look in your link
 

5487
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:21,110
doing like if you look in your link
without

5488
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,120
without
 

5489
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,790
without
i forgot how you put it but it was

5490
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:22,800
i forgot how you put it but it was
 

5491
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,950
i forgot how you put it but it was
eloquent you know without getting

5492
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:24,960
eloquent you know without getting
 

5493
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,709
eloquent you know without getting
cutting into the brain basically yeah

5494
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:26,719
cutting into the brain basically yeah
 

5495
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:28,390
cutting into the brain basically yeah
exactly exactly so this this

5496
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:28,400
exactly exactly so this this
 

5497
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,110
exactly exactly so this this
costs at the moment 399 dollars that's

5498
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:31,120
costs at the moment 399 dollars that's
 

5499
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:31,990
costs at the moment 399 dollars that's
not going to kill you

5500
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:32,000
not going to kill you
 

5501
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,750
not going to kill you
and yeah it's not going to kill you it's

5502
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:33,760
and yeah it's not going to kill you it's
 

5503
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,189
and yeah it's not going to kill you it's
you just put it on and when you're done

5504
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
you just put it on and when you're done
 

5505
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:36,229
you just put it on and when you're done
you take it off yeah

5506
01:26:36,229 --> 01:26:36,239
you take it off yeah
 

5507
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,870
you take it off yeah
um yeah and so uh and the name of the

5508
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:38,880
um yeah and so uh and the name of the
 

5509
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,870
um yeah and so uh and the name of the
company by the way is neo sensory for

5510
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:40,880
company by the way is neo sensory for
 

5511
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:41,189
company by the way is neo sensory for
new

5512
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:41,199
new
 

5513
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:42,950
new
senses because the whole idea is

5514
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:42,960
senses because the whole idea is
 

5515
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,709
senses because the whole idea is
beautiful you can

5516
01:26:44,709 --> 01:26:44,719
beautiful you can
 

5517
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:46,229
beautiful you can
as i said you know you come to the table

5518
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:46,239
as i said you know you come to the table
 

5519
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:47,830
as i said you know you come to the table
with certain plug and play devices and

5520
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:47,840
with certain plug and play devices and
 

5521
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,030
with certain plug and play devices and
then that's it like i can pick up on

5522
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:49,040
then that's it like i can pick up on
 

5523
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,070
then that's it like i can pick up on
this little bit of the electromagnetic

5524
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,080
this little bit of the electromagnetic
 

5525
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,270
this little bit of the electromagnetic
radiation you can pick up on

5526
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:51,280
radiation you can pick up on
 

5527
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,830
radiation you can pick up on
on this little frequency band for

5528
01:26:53,830 --> 01:26:53,840
on this little frequency band for
 

5529
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:54,870
on this little frequency band for
hearing and so on

5530
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:54,880
hearing and so on
 

5531
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,790
hearing and so on
but but but i'm stuck there and there's

5532
01:26:56,790 --> 01:26:56,800
but but but i'm stuck there and there's
 

5533
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,310
but but but i'm stuck there and there's
no reason we have to be stuck there we

5534
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:58,320
no reason we have to be stuck there we
 

5535
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,229
no reason we have to be stuck there we
can expand our oom velt

5536
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:00,239
can expand our oom velt
 

5537
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:03,189
can expand our oom velt
by adding new senses yeah what's um oh

5538
01:27:03,189 --> 01:27:03,199
by adding new senses yeah what's um oh
 

5539
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:04,550
by adding new senses yeah what's um oh
i'm sorry the umvelt

5540
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:04,560
i'm sorry the umvelt
 

5541
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,709
i'm sorry the umvelt
is the slice of reality that you pick up

5542
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:06,719
is the slice of reality that you pick up
 

5543
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:08,390
is the slice of reality that you pick up
on so each animal has its own

5544
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:08,400
on so each animal has its own
 

5545
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,430
on so each animal has its own
hell of a word umvelt yeah exactly

5546
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:11,440
hell of a word umvelt yeah exactly
 

5547
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,629
hell of a word umvelt yeah exactly
so i'm sorry i forgot to define it

5548
01:27:12,629 --> 01:27:12,639
so i'm sorry i forgot to define it
 

5549
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:14,550
so i'm sorry i forgot to define it
before it's it's it's such an important

5550
01:27:14,550 --> 01:27:14,560
before it's it's it's such an important
 

5551
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,950
before it's it's it's such an important
concept which is to say

5552
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:16,960
concept which is to say
 

5553
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,070
concept which is to say
um for example if you are a a tick

5554
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:20,080
um for example if you are a a tick
 

5555
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,550
um for example if you are a a tick
you pick up on uh butyric acid you pick

5556
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:22,560
you pick up on uh butyric acid you pick
 

5557
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,590
you pick up on uh butyric acid you pick
up on odor and you pick up on

5558
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:23,600
up on odor and you pick up on
 

5559
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,390
up on odor and you pick up on
temperature that's it

5560
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:24,400
temperature that's it
 

5561
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,149
temperature that's it
that's how you construct your reality is

5562
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:26,159
that's how you construct your reality is
 

5563
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,750
that's how you construct your reality is
with those two sensors if you are a

5564
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:27,760
with those two sensors if you are a
 

5565
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,669
with those two sensors if you are a
blind echolocating bat you're picking up

5566
01:27:29,669 --> 01:27:29,679
blind echolocating bat you're picking up
 

5567
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:30,550
blind echolocating bat you're picking up
on

5568
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:30,560
on
 

5569
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,830
on
air compression waves coming back you

5570
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:31,840
air compression waves coming back you
 

5571
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,590
air compression waves coming back you
know echolocation if you are

5572
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:33,600
know echolocation if you are
 

5573
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,270
know echolocation if you are
the black ghost knife fish you're

5574
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,280
the black ghost knife fish you're
 

5575
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,990
the black ghost knife fish you're
picking up on changes in the electrical

5576
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,000
picking up on changes in the electrical
 

5577
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,270
picking up on changes in the electrical
field around you

5578
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:39,280
field around you
 

5579
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,110
field around you
with electro reception that's how they

5580
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:41,120
with electro reception that's how they
 

5581
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,470
with electro reception that's how they
swim around and tell there's a rock

5582
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:42,480
swim around and tell there's a rock
 

5583
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:43,270
swim around and tell there's a rock
there and so on

5584
01:27:43,270 --> 01:27:43,280
there and so on
 

5585
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,270
there and so on
but but that's that's all they pick up

5586
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:45,280
but but that's that's all they pick up
 

5587
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,790
but but that's that's all they pick up
on that's their umvelt

5588
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:46,800
on that's their umvelt
 

5589
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,510
on that's their umvelt
it's that's their the signals they get

5590
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,520
it's that's their the signals they get
 

5591
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,030
it's that's their the signals they get
from the world from which to construct

5592
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,040
from the world from which to construct
 

5593
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,390
from the world from which to construct
their reality and they can be totally

5594
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:52,400
their reality and they can be totally
 

5595
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,390
their reality and they can be totally
different ooh belts

5596
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:54,400
different ooh belts
 

5597
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,430
different ooh belts
and so our human umvelt is

5598
01:27:57,430 --> 01:27:57,440
and so our human umvelt is
 

5599
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,950
and so our human umvelt is
you know we've got little bits that we

5600
01:27:58,950 --> 01:27:58,960
you know we've got little bits that we
 

5601
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,550
you know we've got little bits that we
can pick up on one of the things i like

5602
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:00,560
can pick up on one of the things i like
 

5603
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,229
can pick up on one of the things i like
to do with my students is talk about

5604
01:28:02,229 --> 01:28:02,239
to do with my students is talk about
 

5605
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:05,830
to do with my students is talk about
um imagine that you are a bloodhound dog

5606
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:05,840
um imagine that you are a bloodhound dog
 

5607
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,030
um imagine that you are a bloodhound dog
right you are a blendhead dog with a

5608
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:07,040
right you are a blendhead dog with a
 

5609
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,790
right you are a blendhead dog with a
huge snout with 200 million scent

5610
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:08,800
huge snout with 200 million scent
 

5611
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,830
huge snout with 200 million scent
receptors in it

5612
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:09,840
receptors in it
 

5613
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,390
receptors in it
and your whole world is about smelling

5614
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:12,400
and your whole world is about smelling
 

5615
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:13,669
and your whole world is about smelling
you know you've got slits in your

5616
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:13,679
you know you've got slits in your
 

5617
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,030
you know you've got slits in your
nostrils like big nose fulls of air and

5618
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:15,040
nostrils like big nose fulls of air and
 

5619
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:15,590
nostrils like big nose fulls of air and
so on

5620
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:15,600
so on
 

5621
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,270
so on
do you have a dog do you nope you used

5622
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:17,280
do you have a dog do you nope you used
 

5623
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,030
do you have a dog do you nope you used
to used to okay so you know you walk

5624
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:19,040
to used to okay so you know you walk
 

5625
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,470
to used to okay so you know you walk
your dog around and your dog is smelling

5626
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:20,480
your dog around and your dog is smelling
 

5627
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:21,270
your dog around and your dog is smelling
everything

5628
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:21,280
everything
 

5629
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,870
everything
the whole world is full of signals that

5630
01:28:22,870 --> 01:28:22,880
the whole world is full of signals that
 

5631
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,790
the whole world is full of signals that
you do not pick up on it so imagine if

5632
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:24,800
you do not pick up on it so imagine if
 

5633
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,310
you do not pick up on it so imagine if
you were that dog and you looked at your

5634
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:26,320
you were that dog and you looked at your
 

5635
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,910
you were that dog and you looked at your
human master and thought my god what is

5636
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:27,920
human master and thought my god what is
 

5637
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,350
human master and thought my god what is
it like to have the pitiful little nose

5638
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:29,360
it like to have the pitiful little nose
 

5639
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:30,709
it like to have the pitiful little nose
of a human yeah

5640
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:30,719
of a human yeah
 

5641
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:31,990
of a human yeah
how could you not know that there's a

5642
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:32,000
how could you not know that there's a
 

5643
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,510
how could you not know that there's a
cat 100 yards away or that your friend

5644
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:33,520
cat 100 yards away or that your friend
 

5645
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,790
cat 100 yards away or that your friend
was here six hours ago

5646
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:34,800
was here six hours ago
 

5647
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,510
was here six hours ago
and so the idea is because we're stuck

5648
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:37,520
and so the idea is because we're stuck
 

5649
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,709
and so the idea is because we're stuck
in our own belt because we have this

5650
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:38,719
in our own belt because we have this
 

5651
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:40,310
in our own belt because we have this
little pitiful noses we think

5652
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:40,320
little pitiful noses we think
 

5653
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:42,550
little pitiful noses we think
okay well yeah we're seeing reality but

5654
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:42,560
okay well yeah we're seeing reality but
 

5655
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,310
okay well yeah we're seeing reality but
but you can have very different sorts of

5656
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:44,320
but you can have very different sorts of
 

5657
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,830
but you can have very different sorts of
realities depending on the

5658
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:45,840
realities depending on the
 

5659
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,350
realities depending on the
peripheral plug-and-play devices you're

5660
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:47,360
peripheral plug-and-play devices you're
 

5661
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,790
peripheral plug-and-play devices you're
equipped with it's fascinating to think

5662
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:48,800
equipped with it's fascinating to think
 

5663
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,830
equipped with it's fascinating to think
that like

5664
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:49,840
that like
 

5665
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:51,990
that like
if we're being honest probably our own

5666
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:52,000
if we're being honest probably our own
 

5667
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,510
if we're being honest probably our own
belt is

5668
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:53,520
belt is
 

5669
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,709
belt is
uh you know some infinitely tiny

5670
01:28:56,709 --> 01:28:56,719
uh you know some infinitely tiny
 

5671
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:59,910
uh you know some infinitely tiny
percent of the possibilities of how you

5672
01:28:59,910 --> 01:28:59,920
percent of the possibilities of how you
 

5673
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,270
percent of the possibilities of how you
can sense

5674
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:01,280
can sense
 

5675
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,229
can sense
quote unquote reality even if you could

5676
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
quote unquote reality even if you could
 

5677
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,510
quote unquote reality even if you could
i mean there's a guy named don

5678
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:05,520
i mean there's a guy named don
 

5679
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,550
i mean there's a guy named don
uh donald uh hoffman yeah

5680
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:08,560
uh donald uh hoffman yeah
 

5681
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,229
uh donald uh hoffman yeah
who based basically says uh we're really

5682
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:12,239
who based basically says uh we're really
 

5683
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,750
who based basically says uh we're really
far away from reality

5684
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:13,760
far away from reality
 

5685
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,510
far away from reality
in terms of our ability to sense

5686
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:15,520
in terms of our ability to sense
 

5687
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,030
in terms of our ability to sense
anything like we

5688
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,040
anything like we
 

5689
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,189
anything like we
we're very we're almost like we're

5690
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:19,199
we're very we're almost like we're
 

5691
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,709
we're very we're almost like we're
floating out there

5692
01:29:20,709 --> 01:29:20,719
floating out there
 

5693
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:22,229
floating out there
that's almost like completely attached

5694
01:29:22,229 --> 01:29:22,239
that's almost like completely attached
 

5695
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,070
that's almost like completely attached
to the actual physical reality

5696
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:24,080
to the actual physical reality
 

5697
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,149
to the actual physical reality
it's fascinating that we could have

5698
01:29:26,149 --> 01:29:26,159
it's fascinating that we could have
 

5699
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:27,430
it's fascinating that we could have
extra senses that

5700
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:27,440
extra senses that
 

5701
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,110
extra senses that
could help us get a little bit a little

5702
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:29,120
could help us get a little bit a little
 

5703
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,470
could help us get a little bit a little
bit closer exactly and by the way this

5704
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:30,480
bit closer exactly and by the way this
 

5705
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,590
bit closer exactly and by the way this
has been the

5706
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:31,600
has been the
 

5707
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,270
has been the
the fruits of science is realizing like

5708
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
the fruits of science is realizing like
 

5709
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,709
the fruits of science is realizing like
for example you know you open your eyes

5710
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:36,719
for example you know you open your eyes
 

5711
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,070
for example you know you open your eyes
and there's the world around you right

5712
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,080
and there's the world around you right
 

5713
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:38,390
and there's the world around you right
but

5714
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:38,400
but
 

5715
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,750
but
of course depending on how you calculate

5716
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:39,760
of course depending on how you calculate
 

5717
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,990
of course depending on how you calculate
it it's less than a 10 trillion

5718
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,000
it it's less than a 10 trillion
 

5719
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,430
it it's less than a 10 trillion
of the electromagnetic spectrum that we

5720
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:43,440
of the electromagnetic spectrum that we
 

5721
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:45,350
of the electromagnetic spectrum that we
call visible light

5722
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
call visible light
 

5723
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,629
call visible light
uh the reason i say it depends because

5724
01:29:46,629 --> 01:29:46,639
uh the reason i say it depends because
 

5725
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:47,910
uh the reason i say it depends because
you know it's actually infinite in all

5726
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:47,920
you know it's actually infinite in all
 

5727
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,110
you know it's actually infinite in all
directions

5728
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:49,120
directions
 

5729
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,430
directions
yeah and so that's exactly that and then

5730
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:51,440
yeah and so that's exactly that and then
 

5731
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,950
yeah and so that's exactly that and then
science allows you to

5732
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:52,960
science allows you to
 

5733
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,950
science allows you to
actually look into the rest of it

5734
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:54,960
actually look into the rest of it
 

5735
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,470
actually look into the rest of it
exactly start understanding how big the

5736
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:56,480
exactly start understanding how big the
 

5737
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,910
exactly start understanding how big the
world is out there and the same with the

5738
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:57,920
world is out there and the same with the
 

5739
01:29:57,920 --> 01:29:59,430
world is out there and the same with the
the world of really small and the world

5740
01:29:59,430 --> 01:29:59,440
the world of really small and the world
 

5741
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,950
the world of really small and the world
of really large exactly

5742
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:00,960
of really large exactly
 

5743
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,110
of really large exactly
that's beyond our ability to sense

5744
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:03,120
that's beyond our ability to sense
 

5745
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,470
that's beyond our ability to sense
exactly and so the reason i think this

5746
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:04,480
exactly and so the reason i think this
 

5747
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,070
exactly and so the reason i think this
kind of thing matters is because

5748
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:06,080
kind of thing matters is because
 

5749
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:08,070
kind of thing matters is because
we now have an opportunity for that

5750
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:08,080
we now have an opportunity for that
 

5751
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,310
we now have an opportunity for that
first time in human history

5752
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:10,320
first time in human history
 

5753
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,070
first time in human history
to say okay well i'm just going to

5754
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,080
to say okay well i'm just going to
 

5755
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,750
to say okay well i'm just going to
include other things in my umvelt so i'm

5756
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:13,760
include other things in my umvelt so i'm
 

5757
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,669
include other things in my umvelt so i'm
going to include infrared radiation

5758
01:30:15,669 --> 01:30:15,679
going to include infrared radiation
 

5759
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:17,510
going to include infrared radiation
and and have a direct perceptual

5760
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:17,520
and and have a direct perceptual
 

5761
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,950
and and have a direct perceptual
experience of that

5762
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:18,960
experience of that
 

5763
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,590
experience of that
and so i'm very you know i mean so you

5764
01:30:21,590 --> 01:30:21,600
and so i'm very you know i mean so you
 

5765
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,350
and so i'm very you know i mean so you
know i've given up my lab and i run this

5766
01:30:23,350 --> 01:30:23,360
know i've given up my lab and i run this
 

5767
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,149
know i've given up my lab and i run this
company 90

5768
01:30:24,149 --> 01:30:24,159
company 90
 

5769
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,229
company 90
of my time now that's what i'm doing i

5770
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:26,239
of my time now that's what i'm doing i
 

5771
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:27,750
of my time now that's what i'm doing i
still teach at stanford and i'm you know

5772
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:27,760
still teach at stanford and i'm you know
 

5773
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,629
still teach at stanford and i'm you know
teaching courses

5774
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:28,639
teaching courses
 

5775
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:30,790
teaching courses
and stuff like that but this is like

5776
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:30,800
and stuff like that but this is like
 

5777
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,950
and stuff like that but this is like
this is your your passion

5778
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:32,960

01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,229
plasticity in terms of the library
which is this issue that i mentioned

6032

space time cone that we
are in which is that when you dropped

6038
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:33,760
are in which is that when you dropped

could have been
 

6049
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,910
could have been
thousands of different men when you grew

6050
01:34:45,910 --> 01:34:45,920
thousands of different men when you grew
 

6051
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,750
thousands of different men when you grew
up but what you did is

6052
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:47,760
up but what you did is
 

6053
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,430

6077
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,870
but it's a beautiful one because that's
uh all the possible trajectories and you

6078
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:12,880
uh all the possible trajectories and you
 

6079
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:13,990
uh all the possible trajectories and you
pick one you walk down

6080
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:14,000
pick one you walk down
 

6081
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,470
pick one you walk down
that road it's the robert frost poem but

6082
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:16,480
that road it's the robert frost poem but
 

6083
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,070
that road it's the robert frost poem but
on that topic let me ask the

6084
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:18,080
on that topic let me ask the
 

6085
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,830
on that topic let me ask the
the biggest and the most ridiculous

6086
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:19,840
the biggest and the most ridiculous
 

6087
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,350
the biggest and the most ridiculous
question

6088
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:21,360
question
 

6089
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,510
question
so in this live wide brain when we

6090
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:23,520
so in this live wide brain when we
 

6091
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,950
so in this live wide brain when we
choose all these different trajectories

6092
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:24,960
choose all these different trajectories
 

6093
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,870
choose all these different trajectories
and end up with one what's the meaning

6094
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:26,880
and end up with one what's the meaning
 

6095
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,750
and end up with one what's the meaning
of it all what's uh

6096
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:29,760
of it all what's uh
 

6097
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,470
of it all what's uh
is there is there a why here what's the

way of attacking that question
 

6121
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,790
way of attacking that question
obviously i i don't know i abstain on

6122
01:35:58,790 --> 01:35:58,800
obviously i i don't know i abstain on
 

6123
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,109
obviously i i don't know i abstain on
that question

6124
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:01,119
that question
 

6125
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:02,950
that question
i mean i think one of the fundamental

6126
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:02,960
i mean i think one of the fundamental
 

6127
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,550
i mean i think one of the fundamental
things i guess in that

6128
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:04,560
things i guess in that
 

6129
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,189
things i guess in that
in all those possible trajectories is uh

6130
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:07,199
in all those possible trajectories is uh
 

6131
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,030
in all those possible trajectories is uh
you're always asking

6132
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,040
you're always asking
 

6133
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,070
you're always asking
i mean that's the act of asking what the

6134
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:12,080
i mean that's the act of asking what the
 

6135
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:13,030
i mean that's the act of asking what the
heck is this thing

6136
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:13,040
heck is this thing
 

6137
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:16,709
heck is this thing
for is equivalent to

6138
01:36:16,709 --> 01:36:16,719
for is equivalent to
 

6139
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,950
for is equivalent to
or at least runs in parallel to all the

6140
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:18,960
or at least runs in parallel to all the
 

6141
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:20,709
or at least runs in parallel to all the
choices that you're making

6142
01:36:20,709 --> 01:36:20,719
choices that you're making
 

6143
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:22,229
choices that you're making
because it's kind of that's the

6144
01:36:22,229 --> 01:36:22,239
because it's kind of that's the
 

6145
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:24,149
because it's kind of that's the
underlying question well that's right

6146
01:36:24,149 --> 01:36:24,159
underlying question well that's right
 

6147
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:25,030
underlying question well that's right
and by the way

6148
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:25,040
and by the way
 

6149
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:26,070
and by the way
you know this is the interesting thing

6150
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:26,080
you know this is the interesting thing
 

6151
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,229
you know this is the interesting thing
about human psychology we've got all

6152
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:28,239
about human psychology we've got all
 

6153
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:28,629
about human psychology we've got all
these

6154
01:36:28,629 --> 01:36:28,639
these
 

6155
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:30,229
these
layers of things at which we can ask

6156
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:30,239
layers of things at which we can ask
 

6157
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:31,990
layers of things at which we can ask
questions and so if you keep asking

6158
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,000
questions and so if you keep asking
 

6159
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,669
questions and so if you keep asking
yourself the question about

6160
01:36:33,669 --> 01:36:33,679
yourself the question about
 

6161
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,830
yourself the question about
what is the optimal way for me to be

6162
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:35,840
what is the optimal way for me to be
 

6163
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,109
what is the optimal way for me to be
spending my time what should i be doing

what charity should i get involved with
and so on

6168
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:38,880
and so on
 

6169
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,470
and so on
if you're asking those big questions

6170
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:42,480
if you're asking those big questions
 

6171
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,709
if you're asking those big questions
that that steers you appropriately if

6172
01:36:44,709 --> 01:36:44,719
that that steers you appropriately if
 

6173
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:45,990
that that steers you appropriately if
you're the type person who never

you're the type person who never
 

6175
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,270
you're the type person who never
asks hey is there something better i

6176

01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:49,040
could be doing with my time then
 

6179
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,109
could be doing with my time then

the the fact is the jobs that will exist

6218
01:37:38,629 --> 01:37:38,639
the the fact is the jobs that will exist
 

6219
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:39,910
the the fact is the jobs that will exist
20 years from now we don't even have

6220
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:39,920
20 years from now we don't even have
 

6221
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,990
20 years from now we don't even have
names for we can't even imagine the jobs

01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:53,119
how to do this and then i'm going to do
 

6237
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:54,390
how to do this and then i'm going to do
that the rest of my career

6238

01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:58,239
with the the exponential speed of things
 

6243
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,310
with the the exponential speed of things
so the important thing is learning how
