00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,990

I would run outside and just lay on the

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,000
I would run outside and just lay on the
 

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,230
I would run outside and just lay on the
ground under the southern Milky Way

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
ground under the southern Milky Way
 

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,650
ground under the southern Milky Way
beautiful right up there and I would

6
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:09,660
beautiful right up there and I would
 

7
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,110
beautiful right up there and I would
just lay there like the snow angel and

8
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,120
just lay there like the snow angel and
 

9
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,910
just lay there like the snow angel and
just kind of let my thoughts sort of

10
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
just kind of let my thoughts sort of
 

11
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,609
just kind of let my thoughts sort of
pass through my brain and this is when I

12
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:16,619
pass through my brain and this is when I
 

13
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,010
pass through my brain and this is when I
personally have the feeling that I'm a

14
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,020
personally have the feeling that I'm a
 

15
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,590
personally have the feeling that I'm a
part of it I I belong here rather than

16
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
part of it I I belong here rather than
 

17
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,810
part of it I I belong here rather than
feeling kind of small yes I'm small but

18
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:23,820
feeling kind of small yes I'm small but
 

19
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,730
feeling kind of small yes I'm small but
there are many other small things and

20
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:25,740
there are many other small things and
 

21
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,990
there are many other small things and
lots of small things make one big hole

22
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000

let's go back to the early days what did

48
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:04,619
let's go back to the early days what did
 

49
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,010
let's go back to the early days what did
the formation of the Milky Way galaxy

50
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,020
the formation of the Milky Way galaxy
 

51
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,170
the formation of the Milky Way galaxy
look like or maybe we want to start even

52
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:09,180
look like or maybe we want to start even
 

53
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,630
look like or maybe we want to start even
before that what did the formation of

54
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:11,640
before that what did the formation of
 

55
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,250
before that what did the formation of
the universe look like

56
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:13,260
the universe look like
 

57
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,530
the universe look like
well we scientists believe there was the

58
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:15,540
well we scientists believe there was the
 

59
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,429
well we scientists believe there was the
Big Bang some big beginning

60
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:18,439
Big Bang some big beginning
 

61
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,010
Big Bang some big beginning
but what is important for my work and I

62
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,020
but what is important for my work and I
 

63
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,149
but what is important for my work and I
think that's what we're going to talk

64
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:23,159
think that's what we're going to talk
 

65
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,670
think that's what we're going to talk
about is what kind of elements were

66
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
about is what kind of elements were
 

67
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,350
about is what kind of elements were
present at that time

68
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
present at that time
 

69
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,990
present at that time
so the Big Bang left a universe behind

70
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
so the Big Bang left a universe behind
 

71
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,910
so the Big Bang left a universe behind
that was made of just hydrogen and

72
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
that was made of just hydrogen and
 

73
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,310
that was made of just hydrogen and
helium and tiny little sprinkles of

74
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
helium and tiny little sprinkles of
 

75
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,569
helium and tiny little sprinkles of
lithium

76
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:35,579
lithium
 

77
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,270
lithium
and that was pretty much it

78
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,280
and that was pretty much it
 

79
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,330
and that was pretty much it
and as it turns out it's actually quite

80
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:41,340
and as it turns out it's actually quite
 

81
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,090
and as it turns out it's actually quite
hard to make stars or any structure from

82
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,100
hard to make stars or any structure from
 

83
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,330
hard to make stars or any structure from
that that's fairly hot gas

84
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:47,340
that that's fairly hot gas
 

85
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,630
that that's fairly hot gas
and so the very first stars that formed

86
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
and so the very first stars that formed
 

87
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,749
and so the very first stars that formed
prior to to any galaxies were very

88
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
prior to to any galaxies were very
 

89
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,109
prior to to any galaxies were very
massive stars big stars 100 times the

90
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
massive stars big stars 100 times the
 

91
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,870
massive stars big stars 100 times the
mass of the Sun and they were made from

92
00:01:59,870 --> 00:01:59,880
mass of the Sun and they were made from
 

93
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,569
mass of the Sun and they were made from
just hydrogen and helium so big stars

94
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:02,579
just hydrogen and helium so big stars
 

95
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,670
just hydrogen and helium so big stars
explode pretty fast after a few million

96
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:04,680
explode pretty fast after a few million
 

97
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,010
explode pretty fast after a few million
years only that's very short on Cosmic

98
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,020
years only that's very short on Cosmic
 

99
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,210
years only that's very short on Cosmic
time scales

100
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,220
time scales
 

101
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,930
time scales
and in their explosions they provided

102
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:11,940
and in their explosions they provided
 

103
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,610
and in their explosions they provided
the first heavier elements to the

104
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:13,620
the first heavier elements to the
 

105
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,890
the first heavier elements to the
universe because in that course All

106
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:15,900
universe because in that course All
 

107
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,589
universe because in that course All
Stars fuse lighter elements like

108
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:18,599
Stars fuse lighter elements like
 

109
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,990
Stars fuse lighter elements like
hydrogen helium into heavier ones

110
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,000
hydrogen helium into heavier ones
 

111
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,330
hydrogen helium into heavier ones
and then that goes all the way up to

112
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:23,340
and then that goes all the way up to
 

113
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,309
and then that goes all the way up to
iron and then all that material gets

114
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:25,319
iron and then all that material gets
 

115
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,710
iron and then all that material gets
ejected in these massive Supernova

116
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:27,720
ejected in these massive Supernova
 

117
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,050
ejected in these massive Supernova
explosions and that marked a really

118
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,060
explosions and that marked a really
 

119
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,050
explosions and that marked a really
really important

120
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:32,060
really important
 

121
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,809
really important
transition in the universe because after

122
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:35,819
transition in the universe because after
 

123
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:38,210
transition in the universe because after
that first explosion

124
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:38,220
that first explosion
 

125
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,809
that first explosion
it was no longer chemically pristine

126
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:41,819
it was no longer chemically pristine
 

127
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,210
it was no longer chemically pristine
and that's at the stage for everything

128
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:44,220
and that's at the stage for everything
 

129
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,610
and that's at the stage for everything
else to happen including us here talking

130
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:46,620
else to happen including us here talking
 

131
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,130
else to happen including us here talking
today so what do you mean by pristine so

132
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:49,140
today so what do you mean by pristine so
 

133
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,170
today so what do you mean by pristine so
there's a whole

134
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,180
there's a whole
 

135
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,070
there's a whole
uh complex soup of elements now as

136
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,080
uh complex soup of elements now as
 

137
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,690
uh complex soup of elements now as
opposed to just hydrogen helium and a

138
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:56,700
opposed to just hydrogen helium and a
 

139
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,330
opposed to just hydrogen helium and a
little bit of lithium yeah so after the

140
00:02:59,330 --> 00:02:59,340
little bit of lithium yeah so after the
 

141
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,610
little bit of lithium yeah so after the
big bang just hydrogen and helium we

142
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:01,620
big bang just hydrogen and helium we
 

143
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,229
big bang just hydrogen and helium we
don't really need to talk too much about

144
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:03,239
don't really need to talk too much about
 

145
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,229
don't really need to talk too much about
lithium because the amount was so small

146
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
lithium because the amount was so small
 

147
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,930
lithium because the amount was so small
um and after these very first stars

148
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:08,940
um and after these very first stars
 

149
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,130
um and after these very first stars
formed and exploded they and the heavier

150
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,140
formed and exploded they and the heavier
 

151
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,410
formed and exploded they and the heavier
elements like carbon oxygen magnesium

152
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:15,420
elements like carbon oxygen magnesium
 

153
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,949
elements like carbon oxygen magnesium
iron all of that stuff was was suddenly

154
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
iron all of that stuff was was suddenly
 

155
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,610
iron all of that stuff was was suddenly
present in the gas clouds

156
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:21,620
present in the gas clouds
 

157
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,610
present in the gas clouds
tiny amounts only very tiny amounts but

158
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:25,620
tiny amounts only very tiny amounts but
 

159
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,649
tiny amounts only very tiny amounts but
and that actually helped especially the

160
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:27,659
and that actually helped especially the
 

161
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,770
and that actually helped especially the
carbon and the oxygen to to make the gas

162
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:30,780
carbon and the oxygen to to make the gas
 

163
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,530
carbon and the oxygen to to make the gas
cool these atoms are more complicated

164
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:33,540
cool these atoms are more complicated
 

165
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,869
cool these atoms are more complicated
than hydrogen that's just a proton and

166
00:03:35,869 --> 00:03:35,879
than hydrogen that's just a proton and
 

167
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,089
than hydrogen that's just a proton and
so it has cooling properties can send

168
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:38,099
so it has cooling properties can send
 

169
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,830
so it has cooling properties can send
out photons outside of the gas cloud so

170
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
out photons outside of the gas cloud so
 

171
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,470
out photons outside of the gas cloud so
the gas can cool and when you have gas

172
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
the gas can cool and when you have gas
 

173
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,270
the gas can cool and when you have gas
that that gets colder and colder you can

174
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:44,280
that that gets colder and colder you can
 

175
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,009
that that gets colder and colder you can
make smaller and smaller Stars so you

176
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:46,019
make smaller and smaller Stars so you
 

177
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,530
make smaller and smaller Stars so you
can fragment it and Clump it and turn it

178
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:48,540
can fragment it and Clump it and turn it
 

179
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,809
can fragment it and Clump it and turn it
into stars like like the sun and the

180
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:50,819
into stars like like the sun and the
 

181
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,270
into stars like like the sun and the
cool thing about that is that

182
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
cool thing about that is that
 

183
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,130
cool thing about that is that
when you have small stars like the sun

184
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,140
when you have small stars like the sun
 

185
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,649
when you have small stars like the sun
they have a really long lifetime so

186
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:57,659
they have a really long lifetime so
 

187
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,809
they have a really long lifetime so
those first low masters that formed back

188
00:03:59,809 --> 00:03:59,819
those first low masters that formed back
 

189
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,390
those first low masters that formed back
then are still observable today

190
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
then are still observable today
 

191
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,729
then are still observable today
that is actually what I do I try to find

192
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:04,739
that is actually what I do I try to find
 

193
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,710
that is actually what I do I try to find
these early survivors

194
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:06,720
these early survivors
 

195
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,570
these early survivors
because they tell us

196
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:08,580
because they tell us
 

197
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,850
because they tell us
what the gas looked like back then they

198
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:10,860
what the gas looked like back then they
 

199
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,190
what the gas looked like back then they
have preserved that composition of these

200
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:13,200
have preserved that composition of these
 

201
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,869
have preserved that composition of these
early gas cloud the chemical

202
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
early gas cloud the chemical
 

203
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,890
early gas cloud the chemical
compositions until today so I don't need

204
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:18,900
compositions until today so I don't need
 

205
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,430
compositions until today so I don't need
to look very far into the universe to

206
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:22,440
to look very far into the universe to
 

207
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,570
to look very far into the universe to
study all the beginnings I can just

208
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:25,580
study all the beginnings I can just
 

209
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,390
study all the beginnings I can just
chemically analyze the older stars and

210
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:29,400
chemically analyze the older stars and
 

211
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,090
chemically analyze the older stars and
it's like unpacking everything that that

212
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,100
it's like unpacking everything that that
 

213
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,670
it's like unpacking everything that that
happened back then it's very exciting so

214
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,680
happened back then it's very exciting so
 

215
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,070
happened back then it's very exciting so
to just reiterate so in the very early

216
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,080
to just reiterate so in the very early
 

217
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,650
to just reiterate so in the very early
days in the first few million years

218
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:39,660
days in the first few million years
 

219
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,469
days in the first few million years
there's giant Stars that's mostly

220
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
there's giant Stars that's mostly
 

221
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,330
there's giant Stars that's mostly
hydrogen helium then they exploded in

222
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:44,340
hydrogen helium then they exploded in
 

223
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,610
hydrogen helium then they exploded in
these Supernova explosions and then they

224
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:46,620
these Supernova explosions and then they
 

225
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,890
these Supernova explosions and then they
made these clumps

226
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:48,900
made these clumps
 

227
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,909
made these clumps
yeah so the first one is pristine

228
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
yeah so the first one is pristine
 

229
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,590
yeah so the first one is pristine
non-pristine clumps yeah pretty much fun

230
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:54,600
non-pristine clumps yeah pretty much fun
 

231
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,210
non-pristine clumps yeah pretty much fun
so it took a few hundred million years

232
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:56,220
so it took a few hundred million years
 

233
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,490
so it took a few hundred million years
for the first stars to emerge and then

234
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:58,500
for the first stars to emerge and then
 

235
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,830
for the first stars to emerge and then
they exploded after a few million years

236
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:00,840
they exploded after a few million years
 

237
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,129
they exploded after a few million years
Kaboom and then it's like I always

238
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:04,139
Kaboom and then it's like I always
 

239
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,290
Kaboom and then it's like I always
consider the universe like a you know a

240
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:06,300
consider the universe like a you know a
 

241
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,189
consider the universe like a you know a
nice soup and then these first Supernova

242
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:10,199
nice soup and then these first Supernova
 

243
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,950
nice soup and then these first Supernova
explosions kind of provided the salt you

244
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
explosions kind of provided the salt you
 

245
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,629
explosions kind of provided the salt you
know just a little sprinkle of heavier

246
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
know just a little sprinkle of heavier
 

247
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,629
know just a little sprinkle of heavier
elements and that made it really tasty

248
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
elements and that made it really tasty
 

249
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,310
elements and that made it really tasty
it's just changed it completely right

250
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:19,320
it's just changed it completely right
 

251
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,189
it's just changed it completely right
and that changed the physics of the gas

252
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:22,199
and that changed the physics of the gas
 

253
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,010
and that changed the physics of the gas
so that meant that these these gas

254
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:25,020
so that meant that these these gas
 

255
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,170
so that meant that these these gas
clouds that were you know surrounding

256
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,180
clouds that were you know surrounding
 

257
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,469
clouds that were you know surrounding
the the Forma first Stars they could now

258
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
the the Forma first Stars they could now
 

259
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,810
the the Forma first Stars they could now
cool down and Clump and form the next

260
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:32,820
cool down and Clump and form the next
 

261
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,510
cool down and Clump and form the next
generation of stars that now included

262
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
generation of stars that now included
 

263
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,430
generation of stars that now included
also little stars

264
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
also little stars
 

265
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,629
also little stars
and as I just mentioned the small stars

266
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:41,639
and as I just mentioned the small stars
 

267
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,310
and as I just mentioned the small stars
have these really long lifetimes the sun

268
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:43,320
have these really long lifetimes the sun
 

269
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,590
have these really long lifetimes the sun
has a lifetime of 10 billion years

270
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
has a lifetime of 10 billion years
 

271
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,230
has a lifetime of 10 billion years
any star that is even less massive will

272
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
any star that is even less massive will
 

273
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,330
any star that is even less massive will
have an even longer lifetime

274
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:50,340
have an even longer lifetime
 

275
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,670
have an even longer lifetime
so that gives us a chance to to still

276
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:52,680
so that gives us a chance to to still
 

277
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,890
so that gives us a chance to to still
observe some of the stats that form back

278
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:54,900
observe some of the stats that form back
 

279
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,529
observe some of the stats that form back
then so we are testing the the

280
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:57,539
then so we are testing the the
 

281
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,029
then so we are testing the the
conditions of chemical and physical

282
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
conditions of chemical and physical
 

283
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,890
conditions of chemical and physical
conditions of the early Universe even

284
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:00,900
conditions of the early Universe even
 

285
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,070
conditions of the early Universe even
before the Galaxy formed so what's the

286
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
before the Galaxy formed so what's the
 

287
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,510
before the Galaxy formed so what's the
timeline that we're talking about what

288
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
timeline that we're talking about what
 

289
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,890
timeline that we're talking about what
is the age of the universe and what is

290
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:06,900
is the age of the universe and what is
 

291
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,409
is the age of the universe and what is
the earliest time we got those salty

292
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:09,419
the earliest time we got those salty
 

293
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,409
the earliest time we got those salty
delicious soup Clump soups with heavier

294
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:12,419
delicious soup Clump soups with heavier
 

295
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:13,490
delicious soup Clump soups with heavier
elements

296
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,500
elements
 

297
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,830
elements
well the universe is 13.8 billion years

298
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
well the universe is 13.8 billion years
 

299
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,930
well the universe is 13.8 billion years
old well legitly yeah

300
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:19,940

 

301
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,850

when I was in high school the universe

302
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:22,860
when I was in high school the universe
 

303
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,010
when I was in high school the universe
was 20 billion years old yeah so the

304
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,020
was 20 billion years old yeah so the
 

305
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,930
was 20 billion years old yeah so the
estimate did you change do you think

306
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:26,940
estimate did you change do you think
 

307
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,550
estimate did you change do you think
that estimate will evolve in interesting

308
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
that estimate will evolve in interesting
 

309
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,070
that estimate will evolve in interesting
ways or no is that is it I think it's

310
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,080
ways or no is that is it I think it's
 

311
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,230
ways or no is that is it I think it's
mostly converged yes because the

312
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,240
mostly converged yes because the
 

313
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,090
mostly converged yes because the
techniques are very different now much

314
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,100
techniques are very different now much
 

315
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,249
techniques are very different now much
more precise the whole business of

316
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:37,259
more precise the whole business of
 

317
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,590
more precise the whole business of
precision cosmology by mapping out the

318
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
precision cosmology by mapping out the
 

319
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,870
precision cosmology by mapping out the
cosmic microf background you know that

320
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:41,880
cosmic microf background you know that
 

321
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,870
cosmic microf background you know that
that's a marvelous feat

322
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
that's a marvelous feat
 

323
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,390
that's a marvelous feat
um maybe you know the digits will still

324
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,400
um maybe you know the digits will still
 

325
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,370
um maybe you know the digits will still
move around a little bit but that's all

326
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:49,380
move around a little bit but that's all
 

327
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,770
move around a little bit but that's all
right plus the gravitational waves and

328
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:51,780
right plus the gravitational waves and
 

329
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,450
right plus the gravitational waves and
all that all the different sources of

330
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:53,460
all that all the different sources of
 

331
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,670
all that all the different sources of
data yeah kind of mapping out this

332
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
data yeah kind of mapping out this
 

333
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,110
data yeah kind of mapping out this
detailed picture of the early Universe

334
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
detailed picture of the early Universe
 

335
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,930
detailed picture of the early Universe
yeah totally and so we think the

336
00:06:59,930 --> 00:06:59,940
yeah totally and so we think the
 

337
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,809
yeah totally and so we think the
earliest little stars formed I don't

338
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:02,819
earliest little stars formed I don't
 

339
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,430
earliest little stars formed I don't
know maybe half a billion years after

340
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:04,440
know maybe half a billion years after
 

341
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,290
know maybe half a billion years after
the big bang right again a few hundred

342
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,300
the big bang right again a few hundred
 

343
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,749
the big bang right again a few hundred
million years for the first stars to

344
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:08,759
million years for the first stars to
 

345
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,490
million years for the first stars to
emerge and then you know took some time

346
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:10,500
emerge and then you know took some time
 

347
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,409
emerge and then you know took some time
so give or take half a billion years and

348
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:15,419
so give or take half a billion years and
 

349
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,210
so give or take half a billion years and
um that was the time when sort of the

350
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:17,220
um that was the time when sort of the
 

351
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,270
um that was the time when sort of the
very first pro photo galaxies formed

352
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,280
very first pro photo galaxies formed
 

353
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,629
very first pro photo galaxies formed
early Stella structures Stella systems

354
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:23,639
early Stella structures Stella systems
 

355
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,089
early Stella structures Stella systems
from which the Milky Way eventually

356
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:26,099
from which the Milky Way eventually
 

357
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,890
from which the Milky Way eventually
formed right so it was the Mickey was

358
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:27,900
formed right so it was the Mickey was
 

359
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,490
formed right so it was the Mickey was
probably a bigger slightly bigger one

360
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:30,500
probably a bigger slightly bigger one
 

361
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,710
probably a bigger slightly bigger one
and we know today that galaxies grow

362
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:33,720
and we know today that galaxies grow
 

363
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,809
and we know today that galaxies grow
hierarchically which means they eat

364
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:35,819
hierarchically which means they eat
 

365
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,790
hierarchically which means they eat
their smaller neighbors so if you're the

366
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:37,800
their smaller neighbors so if you're the
 

367
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,430
their smaller neighbors so if you're the
bigger one and have a few a few friends

368
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,440
bigger one and have a few a few friends
 

369
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,529
bigger one and have a few a few friends
around you're just gonna

370
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:42,539
around you're just gonna
 

371
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,070
around you're just gonna
um eat them absorb them and then you

372
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
um eat them absorb them and then you
 

373
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,990
um eat them absorb them and then you
grow bigger and

374
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
grow bigger and
 

375
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,390
grow bigger and
um so all these these little early Stars

376
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
um so all these these little early Stars
 

377
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,249
um so all these these little early Stars
you know kind of came into the Mickey

378
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:52,259
you know kind of came into the Mickey
 

379
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,469
you know kind of came into the Mickey
way through that kind of process

380
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
way through that kind of process
 

381
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,570
way through that kind of process
and that's why we find them in the outer

382
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580
and that's why we find them in the outer
 

383
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,029
and that's why we find them in the outer
parts of the Galaxy today because

384
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
parts of the Galaxy today because
 

385
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,430
parts of the Galaxy today because
they're just kind of deaf and just left

386
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
they're just kind of deaf and just left
 

387
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,890
they're just kind of deaf and just left
there since so the old stuff is on the

388
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:03,900
there since so the old stuff is on the
 

389
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,450
there since so the old stuff is on the
outskirts of the Galaxy and the new

390
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:05,460
outskirts of the Galaxy and the new
 

391
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,309
outskirts of the Galaxy and the new
stuff is in closer to the middle is

392
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:07,319
stuff is in closer to the middle is
 

393
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,770
stuff is in closer to the middle is
there broadly speaking okay yes because

394
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:09,780
there broadly speaking okay yes because
 

395
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,089
there broadly speaking okay yes because
that's where you would look for it so

396
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:11,099
that's where you would look for it so
 

397
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,249
that's where you would look for it so
maybe it's just a step back like what is

398
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:13,259
maybe it's just a step back like what is
 

399
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,629
maybe it's just a step back like what is
a Galaxy what is the part of the Galaxy

400
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
a Galaxy what is the part of the Galaxy
 

401
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,770
a Galaxy what is the part of the Galaxy
I love that question so the Galaxy is

402
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:18,780
I love that question so the Galaxy is
 

403
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,809
I love that question so the Galaxy is
um

404
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:20,819

 

405
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,369

assembly of

406
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:22,379
assembly of
 

407
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,010
assembly of
Stars the Milky Way contains something

408
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,020
Stars the Milky Way contains something
 

409
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,570
Stars the Milky Way contains something
like 200 to 400 billion stars and most

410
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:29,580
like 200 to 400 billion stars and most
 

411
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,909
like 200 to 400 billion stars and most
of the material and the stars are in the

412
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
of the material and the stars are in the
 

413
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,850
of the material and the stars are in the
disk and when we look at the night sky

414
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:34,860
disk and when we look at the night sky
 

415
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,570
disk and when we look at the night sky
what we see as The Milky Way band on the

416
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:38,580
what we see as The Milky Way band on the
 

417
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,990
what we see as The Milky Way band on the
sky that is actually the it more the

418
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
sky that is actually the it more the
 

419
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,110
sky that is actually the it more the
inner the next inner spiral arm because

420
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
inner the next inner spiral arm because
 

421
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,030
inner the next inner spiral arm because
we actually live in a spiral this

422
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
we actually live in a spiral this
 

423
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,829
we actually live in a spiral this
galaxies are the Mickey who has a spiral

424
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:48,839
galaxies are the Mickey who has a spiral
 

425
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:50,930
galaxies are the Mickey who has a spiral
disc Galaxy

426
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:50,940
disc Galaxy
 

427
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,690
disc Galaxy
um and we're looking

428
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:53,700
um and we're looking
 

429
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,430
um and we're looking
um actually depends a little bit in the

430
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
um actually depends a little bit in the
 

431
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,530
um actually depends a little bit in the
northern hemisphere we're looking out of

432
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:57,540
northern hemisphere we're looking out of
 

433
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,750
northern hemisphere we're looking out of
the Galaxy so we're seeing the next

434
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
the Galaxy so we're seeing the next
 

435
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,389
the Galaxy so we're seeing the next
outer spiral arm

436
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
outer spiral arm
 

437
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,030
outer spiral arm
and as you can imagine there's only dark

438
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,040
and as you can imagine there's only dark
 

439
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,690
and as you can imagine there's only dark
space behind that so we don't see it all

440
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:08,700
space behind that so we don't see it all
 

441
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,910
space behind that so we don't see it all
that nice on the sky but if you travel

442
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:10,920
that nice on the sky but if you travel
 

443
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,009
that nice on the sky but if you travel
to South uh to the southern hemisphere

444
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:13,019
to South uh to the southern hemisphere
 

445
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,949
to South uh to the southern hemisphere
let's say South America you see the make

446
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:15,959
let's say South America you see the make
 

447
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,110
let's say South America you see the make
you and it looks so different on the sky

448
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,120
you and it looks so different on the sky
 

449
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,090
you and it looks so different on the sky
because that's the next inner spiral arm

450
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:20,100
because that's the next inner spiral arm
 

451
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,769
because that's the next inner spiral arm
and that's backlit by the galactic

452
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:21,779
and that's backlit by the galactic
 

453
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,329
and that's backlit by the galactic
center

454
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:23,339
center
 

455
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,970
center
the galactic center is is a very big

456
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:25,980
the galactic center is is a very big
 

457
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,829
the galactic center is is a very big
puffy

458
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
puffy
 

459
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,230
puffy
you know region of gas there's a lot of

460
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
you know region of gas there's a lot of
 

461
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,810
you know region of gas there's a lot of
star formation that the galactic party

462
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:32,820
star formation that the galactic party
 

463
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,610
star formation that the galactic party
is happening there so it's very bright

464
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:34,620
is happening there so it's very bright
 

465
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,730
is happening there so it's very bright
and it it makes for this very beautiful

466
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:36,740
and it it makes for this very beautiful
 

467
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,230
and it it makes for this very beautiful
Milky Way on the night sky that we see

468
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:39,240
Milky Way on the night sky that we see
 

469
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,570
Milky Way on the night sky that we see
so actually if you if you ever get the

470
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:41,580
so actually if you if you ever get the
 

471
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,610
so actually if you if you ever get the
chance to experience that I encourage

472
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:43,620
chance to experience that I encourage
 

473
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,850
chance to experience that I encourage
you to almost like close your eyes while

474
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:46,860
you to almost like close your eyes while
 

475
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,650
you to almost like close your eyes while
seeing this and imagining that you're

476
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:48,660
seeing this and imagining that you're
 

477
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,630
seeing this and imagining that you're
sitting in this kind of disc in this

478
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
sitting in this kind of disc in this
 

479
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,970
sitting in this kind of disc in this
pancake and you're just kind of looking

480
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:52,980
pancake and you're just kind of looking
 

481
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,310
pancake and you're just kind of looking
right into it and you can you can really

482
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,320
right into it and you can you can really
 

483
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,790
right into it and you can you can really
feel that we're in this 2D disc

484
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
feel that we're in this 2D disc
 

485
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,530
feel that we're in this 2D disc
and then you can imagine that there's a

486
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:00,540
and then you can imagine that there's a
 

487
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,030
and then you can imagine that there's a
top and the bottom and that that we

488
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,040
top and the bottom and that that we
 

489
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,370
top and the bottom and that that we
really part of the Galaxy you can really

490
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:04,380
really part of the Galaxy you can really
 

491
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,430
really part of the Galaxy you can really
experience that we're just not not just

492
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
experience that we're just not not just
 

493
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,470
experience that we're just not not just
lost in space somewhere but we're really

494
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:09,480
lost in space somewhere but we're really
 

495
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,570
lost in space somewhere but we're really
a part of it and you know knowing a

496
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:11,580
a part of it and you know knowing a
 

497
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,769
a part of it and you know knowing a
little bit about the structure of the

498
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:12,779
little bit about the structure of the
 

499
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,990
little bit about the structure of the
Mickey wear really helps do you feel

500
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,000
Mickey wear really helps do you feel
 

501
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,509
Mickey wear really helps do you feel
small when you think about that when you

502
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
small when you think about that when you
 

503
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,970
small when you think about that when you
look on that spiral on the inside of the

504
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:19,980
look on that spiral on the inside of the
 

505
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,710
look on that spiral on the inside of the
Milky Way and then you look out to the

506
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:21,720
Milky Way and then you look out to the
 

507
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,070
Milky Way and then you look out to the
outside like how are we supposed to feel

508
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,080
outside like how are we supposed to feel
 

509
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,949
outside like how are we supposed to feel
I I don't know I I don't feel small

510
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:27,959
I I don't know I I don't feel small
 

511
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:31,730
I I don't know I I don't feel small
necessarily I feel in awe and I feel I'm

512
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:31,740
necessarily I feel in awe and I feel I'm
 

513
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,710
necessarily I feel in awe and I feel I'm
a part of it because I can really feel

514
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:33,720
a part of it because I can really feel
 

515
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,290
a part of it because I can really feel
that I'm a part of it

516
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:36,300
that I'm a part of it
 

517
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,269
that I'm a part of it
um I think for many people they think

518
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:38,279
um I think for many people they think
 

519
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,490
um I think for many people they think
like oh that's just the planet and then

520
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:40,500
like oh that's just the planet and then
 

521
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,490
like oh that's just the planet and then
there's nothing and

522
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:43,500
there's nothing and
 

523
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,670
there's nothing and
that's almost a little bit sad but

524
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
that's almost a little bit sad but
 

525
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,170
that's almost a little bit sad but
that's really not the case right because

526
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:48,180
that's really not the case right because
 

527
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,329
that's really not the case right because
there's there's so much more and I

528
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:50,339
there's there's so much more and I
 

529
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,310
there's there's so much more and I
really like to imagine wow I'm I'm

530
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
really like to imagine wow I'm I'm
 

531
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,110
really like to imagine wow I'm I'm
sitting in this big Galactic

532
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,120
sitting in this big Galactic
 

533
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,910
sitting in this big Galactic
Merry-Go-Round and we're going around

534
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
Merry-Go-Round and we're going around
 

535
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,530
Merry-Go-Round and we're going around
the center and I can see the center

536
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:57,540
the center and I can see the center
 

537
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,930
the center and I can see the center
above me right and I can almost feel

538
00:10:59,930 --> 00:10:59,940
above me right and I can almost feel
 

539
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,170
above me right and I can almost feel
like we're going going there

540
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,180
like we're going going there
 

541
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,170
like we're going going there
um of course we can't really feel that

542
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:05,180
um of course we can't really feel that
 

543
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,509
um of course we can't really feel that
but the sun does Circle the galactic

544
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:08,519
but the sun does Circle the galactic
 

545
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,509
but the sun does Circle the galactic
center but there's a kind of sadness to

546
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
center but there's a kind of sadness to
 

547
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,610
center but there's a kind of sadness to
like looking pictures of a nice vacation

548
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:13,620
like looking pictures of a nice vacation
 

549
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,509
like looking pictures of a nice vacation
place

550
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:14,519
place
 

551
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,009
place
all we get is that light and old light

552
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:19,019
all we get is that light and old light
 

553
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,710
all we get is that light and old light
is do you feel like sad that we don't

554
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,720
is do you feel like sad that we don't
 

555
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,290
is do you feel like sad that we don't
get to travel or you and I will not get

556
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,300
get to travel or you and I will not get
 

557
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,449
get to travel or you and I will not get
to travel there and maybe humans will

558
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:26,459
to travel there and maybe humans will
 

559
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,490
to travel there and maybe humans will
never get to travel there yeah I always

560
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:28,500
never get to travel there yeah I always
 

561
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,410
never get to travel there yeah I always
wanted to travel to space and see the

562
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:30,420
wanted to travel to space and see the
 

563
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,269
wanted to travel to space and see the
Earth and other things from from up

564
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:32,279
Earth and other things from from up
 

565
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,170
Earth and other things from from up
there there's there's certainly that but

566
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,180
there there's there's certainly that but
 

567
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,810
there there's there's certainly that but
I don't know it's it's also okay it

568
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:38,820
I don't know it's it's also okay it
 

569
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,810
I don't know it's it's also okay it
would just be at our vantage point and

570
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:41,820
would just be at our vantage point and
 

571
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,329
would just be at our vantage point and
and see it from from here with the

572
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:44,339
and see it from from here with the
 

573
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:45,889
and see it from from here with the
sensors with the telescopes that we have

574
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:45,899
sensors with the telescopes that we have
 

575
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,810
sensors with the telescopes that we have
and explore the possibilities yeah I

576
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:47,820
and explore the possibilities yeah I
 

577
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,430
and explore the possibilities yeah I
mean there is a kind of wander to the

578
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
mean there is a kind of wander to the
 

579
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,470
mean there is a kind of wander to the
mystery of it all what what's out there

580
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:51,480
mystery of it all what what's out there
 

581
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,690
mystery of it all what what's out there
what interesting things that we can't

582
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:53,700
what interesting things that we can't
 

583
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,850
what interesting things that we can't
possibly imagine you know there could be

584
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:55,860
possibly imagine you know there could be
 

585
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,769
possibly imagine you know there could be
all kinds of life forms bacteria all

586
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:57,779
all kinds of life forms bacteria all
 

587
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,329
all kinds of life forms bacteria all
this kind of stuff I tend to believe

588
00:11:59,329 --> 00:11:59,339
this kind of stuff I tend to believe
 

589
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:00,470
this kind of stuff I tend to believe
that

590
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
that
 

591
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,430
that
um

592
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
um
 

593
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,710
um
you know it depends on the day I tend to

594
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:03,720
you know it depends on the day I tend to
 

595
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,150
you know it depends on the day I tend to
believe there's just a lot of very

596
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,160
believe there's just a lot of very
 

597
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,069
believe there's just a lot of very
primitive organisms just spread out

598
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:07,079
primitive organisms just spread out
 

599
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,170
primitive organisms just spread out
throughout and they build their little

600
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:09,180
throughout and they build their little
 

601
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,230
throughout and they build their little
things like bacteria type organisms

602
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
things like bacteria type organisms
 

603
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,130
things like bacteria type organisms
um

604
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:13,140
um
 

605
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,810
um
I used to think what kind of Worlds

606
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:14,820
I used to think what kind of Worlds
 

607
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,889
I used to think what kind of Worlds
there are because they're probably

608
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:15,899
there are because they're probably
 

609
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,110
there are because they're probably
really creative living organisms

610
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,120
really creative living organisms
 

611
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,910
really creative living organisms
because the conditions I guess the

612
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
because the conditions I guess the
 

613
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,990
because the conditions I guess the
question I'm

614
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,000
question I'm
 

615
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,730
question I'm
wondering to myself when I look out

616
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:22,740
wondering to myself when I look out
 

617
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,829
wondering to myself when I look out
there to the Stars how different are the

618
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:24,839
there to the Stars how different are the
 

619
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:26,630
there to the Stars how different are the
conditions on the different planets that

620
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:26,640
conditions on the different planets that
 

621
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,030
conditions on the different planets that
orbit those Stars it will definitely be

622
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
orbit those Stars it will definitely be
 

623
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,190
orbit those Stars it will definitely be
very different I mean the variety out

624
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
very different I mean the variety out
 

625
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,569
very different I mean the variety out
there is is huge we know now that I

626
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:35,579
there is is huge we know now that I
 

627
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:39,110
there is is huge we know now that I
think it's about every other star has at

628
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
think it's about every other star has at
 

629
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,630
think it's about every other star has at
least one planet

630
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:41,640
least one planet
 

631
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,250
least one planet
I I already mentioned the number of

632
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:43,260
I I already mentioned the number of
 

633
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,290
I I already mentioned the number of
stars in the galaxy I mean you know

634
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:45,300
stars in the galaxy I mean you know
 

635
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,250
stars in the galaxy I mean you know
that's it's a huge number of planets out

636
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:49,260
that's it's a huge number of planets out
 

637
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,949
that's it's a huge number of planets out
there so who knows what that looks like

638
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:51,959
there so who knows what that looks like
 

639
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,930
there so who knows what that looks like
all we know is that there's

640
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:53,940
all we know is that there's
 

641
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,930
all we know is that there's
there is a lot of variety we don't quite

642
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:56,940
there is a lot of variety we don't quite
 

643
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,150
there is a lot of variety we don't quite
yet understand

644
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
yet understand

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,320
what drives that what governs that why
 

647
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,530
what drives that what governs that why
that is the case why is it not all one

648
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:03,540
that is the case why is it not all one
 

649
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,930
that is the case why is it not all one
size fits all right maybe the Dynamics

650
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:05,940
size fits all right maybe the Dynamics
 

651
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,329
size fits all right maybe the Dynamics
of Planet formation like exoplanet

652
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:08,339
of Planet formation like exoplanet
 

653

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
all of it all of it
 

657
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,350
all of it all of it
our formation is remains a much research

658
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
our formation is remains a much research
 

659
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,550
our formation is remains a much research
topic

660
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
topic
 

661
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,170
topic
it kind of we definitely know that it

662
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,180
it kind of we definitely know that it
 

663
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,750
it kind of we definitely know that it
works because all the stars are there

664
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:20,760
works because all the stars are there
 

665
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,829
works because all the stars are there
same for the planets but the details are

666
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:24,839
same for the planets but the details are
 

667
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,490
same for the planets but the details are
so varied per gas cloud right

668
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:28,500
so varied per gas cloud right
 

669
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,030
so varied per gas cloud right
um it's very hard to to come up with

670
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,040
um it's very hard to to come up with
 

671
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,610
um it's very hard to to come up with
very detailed prescriptions broadly we

672
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:34,620
very detailed prescriptions broadly we
 

673
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,290
very detailed prescriptions broadly we
have figured it out you need a gas cloud

674
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:36,300
have figured it out you need a gas cloud
 

675
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,269
have figured it out you need a gas cloud
you need to cool it

676
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:38,279
you need to cool it
 

677
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,610
you need to cool it
something clumps and fragments and

678
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:40,620
something clumps and fragments and
 

679
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,850
something clumps and fragments and
somehow it makes a star with planets or

680
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:43,860
somehow it makes a star with planets or
 

681
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,710
somehow it makes a star with planets or
without but the Dynamics of the clumping

682
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:45,720
without but the Dynamics of the clumping
 

683
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,509
without but the Dynamics of the clumping
process is not fully understood no no

684
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
process is not fully understood no no
 

685
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,750
process is not fully understood no no
and and the local conditions are so

686
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:50,760
and and the local conditions are so
 

687
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,150
and and the local conditions are so
varied right I mean it's the same with

688
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,160
varied right I mean it's the same with
 

689
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,730
varied right I mean it's the same with
you know all people look like people but

690
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:55,740
you know all people look like people but
 

691
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,069
you know all people look like people but
individually we look very different so

692
00:13:58,069 --> 00:13:58,079
individually we look very different so
 

693
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,690
individually we look very different so
even the subtle diversity of the

694
00:13:59,690 --> 00:13:59,700
even the subtle diversity of the
 

695
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,610
even the subtle diversity of the
formation process creates all kinds of

696
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:01,620
formation process creates all kinds of
 

697
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,970
formation process creates all kinds of
fun yes so you we just don't know how

698
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:04,980
fun yes so you we just don't know how
 

699
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,009
fun yes so you we just don't know how
this turned out in an individual case

700
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:07,019
this turned out in an individual case
 

701
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,190
this turned out in an individual case
and it's kind of hard to

702
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,200
and it's kind of hard to
 

703
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,410
and it's kind of hard to
to figure it all out and and to take a

704
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:12,420
to figure it all out and and to take a
 

705
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,629
to figure it all out and and to take a
look certainly with planets right the

706
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
look certainly with planets right the
 

707
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,990
look certainly with planets right the
chance forever to ever actually take a

708
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
chance forever to ever actually take a
 

709
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,269
chance forever to ever actually take a
picture of a planet is minuscule because

710
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:20,279
picture of a planet is minuscule because
 

711
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,050
picture of a planet is minuscule because
they don't shine so they're really dark

712
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,060
they don't shine so they're really dark
 

713
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,090
they don't shine so they're really dark
yeah so I'd say there's there's a lot of

714
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,100
yeah so I'd say there's there's a lot of
 

715
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,490
yeah so I'd say there's there's a lot of
possibility out there

716
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:28,500
possibility out there
 

717
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,110
possibility out there
but we have to be a little bit more

718
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,120
but we have to be a little bit more
 

719
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,629
but we have to be a little bit more
patient before we come up with

720
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
patient before we come up with
 

721
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,449
patient before we come up with
Technologies where patience becomes less

722
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:35,459
Technologies where patience becomes less
 

723
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,930
Technologies where patience becomes less
necessary by extending our lifetimes or

724
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:38,940
necessary by extending our lifetimes or
 

725
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,810
necessary by extending our lifetimes or
or increasing the speed of space travel

726
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:41,820
or increasing the speed of space travel
 

727
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,550
or increasing the speed of space travel
all the kind of stuff he was a pretty

728
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:43,560
all the kind of stuff he was a pretty
 

729
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,769
all the kind of stuff he was a pretty
pretty intelligent they're pretty uh

730
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:45,779
pretty intelligent they're pretty uh
 

731
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,250
pretty intelligent they're pretty uh
sometimes yeah for the most part I hope

732
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:49,260
sometimes yeah for the most part I hope
 

733
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,009
sometimes yeah for the most part I hope
and now when I'm on the optimistic days

734
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:52,019
and now when I'm on the optimistic days
 

735
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:54,949
and now when I'm on the optimistic days
well maybe just to linger on the on the

736
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
well maybe just to linger on the on the
 

737
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,410
well maybe just to linger on the on the
what a galaxy is

738
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:57,420
what a galaxy is
 

739
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,110
what a galaxy is
um what should we know about our

740
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,120
um what should we know about our
 

741
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,670
um what should we know about our
understanding of black holes in the

742
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
understanding of black holes in the
 

743
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,650
understanding of black holes in the
formation is that an important thing to

744
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:03,660
formation is that an important thing to
 

745
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,269
formation is that an important thing to
understand in the formation of a galaxy

746
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
understand in the formation of a galaxy
 

747
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,269
understand in the formation of a galaxy
like uh so all the orbiting all the

748
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:08,279
like uh so all the orbiting all the
 

749
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,009
like uh so all the orbiting all the
Sparling that's going on how important

750
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:10,019
Sparling that's going on how important
 

751
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,670
Sparling that's going on how important
is that to understand all of the above

752
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:12,680
is that to understand all of the above
 

753
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,170
is that to understand all of the above
that's what makes astronomy really hard

754
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,180
that's what makes astronomy really hard
 

755
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,930
that's what makes astronomy really hard
but also really interesting right no day

756
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:17,940
but also really interesting right no day
 

757
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,610
but also really interesting right no day
is like another because we always find

758
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:19,620
is like another because we always find
 

759
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,250
is like another because we always find
something new I want to come back to the

760
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,260
something new I want to come back to the
 

761
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,930
something new I want to come back to the
the idea of the Proto Galaxy because

762
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:23,940
the idea of the Proto Galaxy because
 

763
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,269
the idea of the Proto Galaxy because
it's actually matches or you know

764
00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:26,279
it's actually matches or you know
 

765
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,009
it's actually matches or you know
relates to to the black hole formation

766
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:28,019
relates to to the black hole formation
 

767
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,069
relates to to the black hole formation
so most large gal well pretty much all

768
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:31,079
so most large gal well pretty much all
 

769
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:33,230
so most large gal well pretty much all
large Galaxies have a supermassive black

770
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,240
large Galaxies have a supermassive black
 

771
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,569
large Galaxies have a supermassive black
hole in the center and we don't actually

772
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:35,579
hole in the center and we don't actually
 

773
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,790
hole in the center and we don't actually
know don't we don't really know where

774
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:37,800
know don't we don't really know where
 

775
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,889
know don't we don't really know where
they come from again we know that they

776
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:39,899
they come from again we know that they
 

777
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,430
they come from again we know that they
are there but how how do we get there so

778
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,440
are there but how how do we get there so
 

779
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,290
are there but how how do we get there so
if we go back to the to the early

780
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,300
if we go back to the to the early
 

781
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,910
if we go back to the to the early
Universe right we had a a little Galaxy

782
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:48,920
Universe right we had a a little Galaxy
 

783
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,949
Universe right we had a a little Galaxy
that just sort of you know I don't know

784
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:51,959
that just sort of you know I don't know
 

785
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,069
that just sort of you know I don't know
had some small number of stars it was a

786
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:55,079
had some small number of stars it was a
 

787
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,470
had some small number of stars it was a
first gravitationally bound structure

788
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,480
first gravitationally bound structure
 

789
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,629
first gravitationally bound structure
that that was held together by dark

790
00:15:59,629 --> 00:15:59,639
that that was held together by dark
 

791
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,610
that that was held together by dark
matter because Dark Matter actually kind

792
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:01,620
matter because Dark Matter actually kind
 

793
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,670
matter because Dark Matter actually kind
of structured up you know first before

794
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:04,680
of structured up you know first before
 

795
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,949
of structured up you know first before
the Luminous matter could because that's

796
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
the Luminous matter could because that's
 

797
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,290
the Luminous matter could because that's
what Dark Matter kind of does and it it

798
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:09,300
what Dark Matter kind of does and it it
 

799
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,389
what Dark Matter kind of does and it it
started to hold

800
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:11,399
started to hold
 

801
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,490
started to hold
um gas and then Stars sort of together

802
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,500
um gas and then Stars sort of together
 

803
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,610
um gas and then Stars sort of together
in this first very shallow

804
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:16,620
in this first very shallow
 

805
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,530
in this first very shallow
um what we call potential well so these

806
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:18,540
um what we call potential well so these
 

807
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,750
um what we call potential well so these
gravitationally bound systems

808
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:20,760
gravitationally bound systems
 

809
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,750
gravitationally bound systems
and then the Milky Way Grew From

810
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:22,760
and then the Milky Way Grew From
 

811
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,670
and then the Milky Way Grew From
absorbing neighboring smaller even

812
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
absorbing neighboring smaller even
 

813
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,610
absorbing neighboring smaller even
smaller systems and somewhere in that

814
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:28,620
smaller systems and somewhere in that
 

815
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,730
smaller systems and somewhere in that
process

816
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:31,740

 

817
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,310

there must have been a seed for one of

818
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
there must have been a seed for one of
 

819
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,170
there must have been a seed for one of
these supermassive black holes and I'm

820
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,180
these supermassive black holes and I'm
 

821
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,030
these supermassive black holes and I'm
I'm not actually sure that it's clear

822
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,040
I'm not actually sure that it's clear
 

823
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,870
I'm not actually sure that it's clear
right now kind of what was there first

824
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
right now kind of what was there first
 

825
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,389
right now kind of what was there first
the Supermassive Black Hole uh or the

826
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
the Supermassive Black Hole uh or the
 

827
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,329
the Supermassive Black Hole uh or the
Galaxy so lots of people are trying to

828
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:47,339
Galaxy so lots of people are trying to
 

829
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,129
Galaxy so lots of people are trying to
study that and of course the black hole

830
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:49,139
study that and of course the black hole
 

831
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:50,810
study that and of course the black hole
wasn't as massive back then as it is

832
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:50,820
wasn't as massive back then as it is
 

833
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,610
wasn't as massive back then as it is
these days

834
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:52,620
these days
 

835
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,189
these days
um but it's that's a it's a big area of

836
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
um but it's that's a it's a big area of
 

837
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,370
um but it's that's a it's a big area of
research and the new um James Webb the

838
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:58,380
research and the new um James Webb the
 

839
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,670
research and the new um James Webb the
jwc the telescope the infrared telescope

840
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:01,680
jwc the telescope the infrared telescope
 

841
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,909
jwc the telescope the infrared telescope
in space is um is working on many people

842
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:04,919
in space is um is working on many people
 

843
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,289
in space is um is working on many people
are working on that

844
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:06,299
are working on that
 

845
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,650
are working on that
to to figure out exactly what what

846
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:09,660
to to figure out exactly what what
 

847
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,150
to to figure out exactly what what
happened and there are some some

848
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,160
happened and there are some some
 

849
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,829
happened and there are some some
surprising results

850
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:12,839
surprising results
 

851
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,809
surprising results
um that we really don't understand right

852
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:14,819
um that we really don't understand right
 

853
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,449
um that we really don't understand right
now so so to solve the uh the chicken or

854
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:17,459
now so so to solve the uh the chicken or
 

855
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,789
now so so to solve the uh the chicken or
the egg problem of uh do you need a

856
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:19,799
the egg problem of uh do you need a
 

857
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,289
the egg problem of uh do you need a
supermassive black hole to form a Galaxy

858
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:21,299
supermassive black hole to form a Galaxy
 

859
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,510
supermassive black hole to form a Galaxy
or does the Galaxy naturally create the

860
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
or does the Galaxy naturally create the
 

861
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,429
or does the Galaxy naturally create the
supermassive black girl yeah yeah I mean

862
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
supermassive black girl yeah yeah I mean
 

863
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,350
supermassive black girl yeah yeah I mean
I

864
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
I
 

865
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,090
I
we can't answer that because there are

866
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,100
we can't answer that because there are
 

867
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,490
we can't answer that because there are
lots of little dwarf galaxies out there

868
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:31,500
lots of little dwarf galaxies out there
 

869
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,169
lots of little dwarf galaxies out there
you know the Milky Way remains

870
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:33,179
you know the Milky Way remains
 

871
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,049
you know the Milky Way remains
surrounded by many

872
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:35,059
surrounded by many
 

873
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:38,330
surrounded by many
dozens of of small dwarf galaxies I have

874
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,340
dozens of of small dwarf galaxies I have
 

875
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,270
dozens of of small dwarf galaxies I have
studied a bunch of them and to the

876
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
studied a bunch of them and to the
 

877
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,710
studied a bunch of them and to the
extent that we can tell they do not

878
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
extent that we can tell they do not
 

879
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,390
extent that we can tell they do not
contain black holes

880
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
contain black holes
 

881
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,010
contain black holes
so they are certainly were

882
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,020
so they are certainly were
 

883
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,230
so they are certainly were
gravitationally bound structures so

884
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
gravitationally bound structures so
 

885
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,210
gravitationally bound structures so
either you can call them proto-galaxies

886
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:50,220
either you can call them proto-galaxies
 

887
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,909
either you can call them proto-galaxies
or dwarf galaxies or first galaxies they

888
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:52,919
or dwarf galaxies or first galaxies they
 

889
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,470
or dwarf galaxies or first galaxies they
were definitely there

890
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,480
were definitely there
 

891
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,230
were definitely there
but there must have been bigger things

892
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,240
but there must have been bigger things
 

893
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,510
but there must have been bigger things
like the Proto Mickey way where

894
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
like the Proto Mickey way where
 

895
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,610
like the Proto Mickey way where
something was different right what made

896
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:01,620
something was different right what made
 

897
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,190
something was different right what made
them more massive so that you know they

898
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:04,200
them more massive so that you know they
 

899
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,289
them more massive so that you know they
would gravitationally attract these

900
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:06,299
would gravitationally attract these
 

901
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,409
would gravitationally attract these
smaller systems to to integrate them

902
00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:09,419
smaller systems to to integrate them
 

903
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,590
smaller systems to to integrate them
so we'll have to see how do we look into

904
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:12,600
so we'll have to see how do we look into
 

905
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,350
so we'll have to see how do we look into
that the into the the Dynamics of the

906
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
that the into the the Dynamics of the
 

907
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,150
that the into the the Dynamics of the
formation the evolution of the portal

908
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,160
formation the evolution of the portal
 

909
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,850
formation the evolution of the portal
galaxies is it possible that they shine

910
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:19,860
galaxies is it possible that they shine
 

911
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,370
galaxies is it possible that they shine
I mean what what are the

912
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:22,380
I mean what what are the
 

913
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,169
I mean what what are the
set of data that we can possibly look at

914
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:24,179
set of data that we can possibly look at
 

915
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,690
set of data that we can possibly look at
so we've got gravitational ways

916
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:26,700
so we've got gravitational ways
 

917
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,150
so we've got gravitational ways
which is really insane that we could

918
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,160
which is really insane that we could
 

919
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,130
which is really insane that we could
even detect this

920
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,140
even detect this
 

921
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,510
even detect this
um there's the light

922
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:32,520
um there's the light
 

923
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,390
um there's the light
what else can we uh so that that would

924
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:35,400
what else can we uh so that that would
 

925
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,370
what else can we uh so that that would
fall into the category of observational

926
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:37,380
fall into the category of observational
 

927
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,909
fall into the category of observational
cosmology and the the jwst is is the

928
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:40,919
cosmology and the the jwst is is the
 

929
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,029
cosmology and the the jwst is is the
prime telescope right now to any

930
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:44,039
prime telescope right now to any
 

931
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,630
prime telescope right now to any
promises big big steps forward this is

932
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:47,640
promises big big steps forward this is
 

933
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,909
promises big big steps forward this is
in its early days because it's only been

934
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
in its early days because it's only been
 

935
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,210
in its early days because it's only been
online like a year or so

936
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:53,220
online like a year or so
 

937
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,090
online like a year or so
um but that collects the infrared light

938
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,100
um but that collects the infrared light
 

939
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,549
um but that collects the infrared light
from the farthest

940
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
from the farthest

947
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,610

949
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,830

um and folks are trying to you know

um and folks are trying to you know
 

951
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,350
um and folks are trying to you know
again study the early the onset of these

952
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
again study the early the onset of these
 

953
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,930
again study the early the onset of these
early supermassive black holes how they

954
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:17,940
early supermassive black holes how they
 

955
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,330
early supermassive black holes how they
shape Galaxy so they're they're seeing

956
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:20,340
shape Galaxy so they're they're seeing
 

957
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,909
shape Galaxy so they're they're seeing
that they are they were there you know

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,150
ideally I'd like for for my colleagues
to push a little bit further hopefully

964
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,160
to push a little bit further hopefully
 

965
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,850
to push a little bit further hopefully
that will eventually happen in terms of

966
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:31,860
that will eventually happen in terms of
 

967
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,350
that will eventually happen in terms of
looking towards the older and older ones

968
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
looking towards the older and older ones
 

969
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,029
looking towards the older and older ones
yeah yeah more and more sort of

970
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
yeah yeah more and more sort of
 

971
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,850
yeah yeah more and more sort of
primitive in terms of the structure but

972
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:37,860
primitive in terms of the structure but
 

973
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,950
primitive in terms of the structure but
of course as you can imagine if you make

974
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:39,960
of course as you can imagine if you make
 

975
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,169
of course as you can imagine if you make
your system smaller and smaller it

976
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:42,179
your system smaller and smaller it
 

977
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,570
your system smaller and smaller it
becomes dimmer and dimmer and it's

978
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:44,580
becomes dimmer and dimmer and it's
 

979
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,310
becomes dimmer and dimmer and it's
further and further that way so we're

980
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
further and further that way so we're
 

981
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,990
further and further that way so we're
reaching the end of the line from a

982
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,000
reaching the end of the line from a
 

983
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,150
reaching the end of the line from a
technical perspective pretty quickly but

984
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
technical perspective pretty quickly but
 

985
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,890
technical perspective pretty quickly but
it's dimmer and dimmer means older and

986
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:51,900
it's dimmer and dimmer means older and
 

987
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,090
it's dimmer and dimmer means older and
older

988
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,100
older
 

989
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,750
older
um

990
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
um
 

991
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,750
um
yes in a sense because it it all started

992
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:56,760
yes in a sense because it it all started
 

993
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,430
yes in a sense because it it all started
really small

994
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:58,440
really small
 

995
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,310
really small
or smaller yeah

996
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,320
or smaller yeah
 

997
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,870
or smaller yeah
in that phase of the universe it would

998
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:02,880
in that phase of the universe it would
 

999
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,289
in that phase of the universe it would
otherwise it it doesn't yeah uh just to

1000
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:06,299
otherwise it it doesn't yeah uh just to
 

1001
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,150
otherwise it it doesn't yeah uh just to
take a small attention about black holes

1002
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:08,160
take a small attention about black holes
 

1003
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,950
take a small attention about black holes
and

1004
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:09,960
and
 

1005
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,350
and
you know because you do quite a bit of

1006
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:12,360
you know because you do quite a bit of
 

1007
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,510
you know because you do quite a bit of
observational cosmology and maybe

1008
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:14,520
observational cosmology and maybe
 

1009
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,610
observational cosmology and maybe
experimental

1010
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:16,620
experimental
 

1011
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,650

um
 

1015
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,169
um
what's the difference to you between

1016
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:21,179
what's the difference to you between
 

1017
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,930
what's the difference to you between
theoretical physics and experimental so

1018
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:23,940
theoretical physics and experimental so
 

1019
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,250
theoretical physics and experimental so
there's a lot of really interesting

1020
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,260
there's a lot of really interesting
 

1021
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,289
there's a lot of really interesting
Explorations about

1022
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:27,299
Explorations about
 

1023
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,330
Explorations about
paradoxes around black holes and all

1024

paradoxes around black holes and all
 

1025
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,310

do those worlds intermixed to you when

1030
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:36,480
do those worlds intermixed to you when
 

1031
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,970
do those worlds intermixed to you when
you especially when you step away from

1032
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:37,980
you especially when you step away from
 

1033
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,289
you especially when you step away from
your work and kind of think about the

1034
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:39,299
your work and kind of think about the
 

1035
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,690
your work and kind of think about the
mystery of it all

1036
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:41,700
mystery of it all
 

1037
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,850
mystery of it all
um well at first

1038
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:43,860
um well at first
 

1039
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,210
um well at first
adversely much crosstalk

1040
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:47,220

 

1041
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,210

personally I mostly observe Stars so I

1042
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:50,220
personally I mostly observe Stars so I
 

1043
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,770
personally I mostly observe Stars so I
don't usually actually think too much of

1044
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:51,780
don't usually actually think too much of
 

1045
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,169
don't usually actually think too much of
black holes about black holes and stars

1046
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:54,179
black holes about black holes and stars
 

1047
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,150
black holes about black holes and stars
is a fundamental kind of chemical

1048
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:56,160
is a fundamental kind of chemical
 

1049
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,130
is a fundamental kind of chemical
physical phenomena that doesn't that's

1050
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:58,140
physical phenomena that doesn't that's
 

1051
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,630
physical phenomena that doesn't that's
right the physics is kind of different

1052
00:20:59,630 --> 00:20:59,640
right the physics is kind of different
 

1053
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,330
right the physics is kind of different
it's not extreme yeah um I mean you know

1054
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:02,340
it's not extreme yeah um I mean you know
 

1055
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,730
it's not extreme yeah um I mean you know
you could consider a nuclear fusion sort

1056
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:04,740
you could consider a nuclear fusion sort
 

1057
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,810
you could consider a nuclear fusion sort
of be perhaps extreme you need to tunnel

1058
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:08,820
of be perhaps extreme you need to tunnel
 

1059
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,610
of be perhaps extreme you need to tunnel
there's some interesting physics there

1060
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:10,620
there's some interesting physics there
 

1061
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,650
there's some interesting physics there
yeah but it's it's just a different

1062
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:12,660
yeah but it's it's just a different
 

1063
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,870
yeah but it's it's just a different
flavor and I don't I don't do these

1064
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
flavor and I don't I don't do these
 

1065
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,870
flavor and I don't I don't do these
kinds of calculations myself either

1066
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:17,880
kinds of calculations myself either
 

1067
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,490
kinds of calculations myself either
um

1068
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:18,500
um
 

1069
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,409
um
I I very much like to talk with my

1070
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:21,419
I I very much like to talk with my
 

1071
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:22,850
I I very much like to talk with my
theory colleagues about these things

1072
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:22,860
theory colleagues about these things
 

1073
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,010
theory colleagues about these things
though because I find there's always an

1074
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:25,020
though because I find there's always an
 

1075
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,650
though because I find there's always an
interesting intersection and

1076
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:27,660
interesting intersection and
 

1077
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,830
interesting intersection and
often it's it's just I've written a

1078
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:30,840
often it's it's just I've written a
 

1079
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,070
often it's it's just I've written a
number of um papers with colleagues who

1080
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,080
number of um papers with colleagues who
 

1081
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,830
number of um papers with colleagues who
do like simulations about galaxies and

1082
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:36,840
do like simulations about galaxies and
 

1083
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,270
do like simulations about galaxies and
so they're they're not quite as far

1084
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:38,280
so they're they're not quite as far
 

1085
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,549
so they're they're not quite as far
removed as let's say the the black hole

1086
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
removed as let's say the the black hole
 

1087
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,610
removed as let's say the the black hole
you know pen and paper folks but um even

1088
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:43,620
you know pen and paper folks but um even
 

1089
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,490
you know pen and paper folks but um even
in those cases we had the same interests

1090
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:46,500
in those cases we had the same interests
 

1091
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,169
in those cases we had the same interests
in the same topics but it was almost

1092
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:48,179
in the same topics but it was almost
 

1093
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,370
in the same topics but it was almost
like we're speaking two different

1094
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:49,380
like we're speaking two different
 

1095
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,110
like we're speaking two different
languages and we weren't even that far

1096
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120
languages and we weren't even that far
 

1097
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,210
languages and we weren't even that far
removed you know both astronomers and

1098
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:53,220
removed you know both astronomers and
 

1099
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,350
removed you know both astronomers and
all

1100
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:54,360
all
 

1101
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,810
all
um and it was really interesting just to

1102
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:56,820
um and it was really interesting just to
 

1103
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,870
um and it was really interesting just to
take that time and really try to

1104
00:21:59,870 --> 00:21:59,880
take that time and really try to
 

1105
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,810
take that time and really try to
to talk to each other

1106
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:01,820
to talk to each other
 

1107
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,110
to talk to each other
and it's it's amazing how

1108
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,120
and it's it's amazing how
 

1109
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,270
and it's it's amazing how
how hard that is

1110
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,280
how hard that is
 

1111
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,490
how hard that is
you know even amongst scientists we

1112
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:10,500
you know even amongst scientists we
 

1113
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,870
you know even amongst scientists we
already have trouble talking to each

1114
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:11,880
already have trouble talking to each
 

1115
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,909
already have trouble talking to each
other imagine how hard it is to talk to

1116
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
other imagine how hard it is to talk to
 

1117
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,730
other imagine how hard it is to talk to
non-scientists and other people to try

1118
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:16,740
non-scientists and other people to try
 

1119
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,289
non-scientists and other people to try
you know to

1120
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:18,299
you know to
 

1121
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,570
you know to
we're all interested in the same things

1122
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:20,580
we're all interested in the same things
 

1123
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,190
we're all interested in the same things
as humans at the end of the day right

1124
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:22,200
as humans at the end of the day right
 

1125
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,890
as humans at the end of the day right
but everyone has sort of a different

1126
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:23,900
but everyone has sort of a different
 

1127
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,450
but everyone has sort of a different
angle about it and different questions

1128
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:26,460
angle about it and different questions
 

1129
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,789
angle about it and different questions
and way of formulating things and

1130
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:28,799
and way of formulating things and
 

1131
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,890
and way of formulating things and
sometimes really takes a while to to

1132
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:30,900
sometimes really takes a while to to
 

1133
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,830
sometimes really takes a while to to
converge and to to get you know to the

1134
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
converge and to to get you know to the
 

1135
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,930
converge and to to get you know to the
common ground but if you take the time

1136
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:35,940
common ground but if you take the time
 

1137
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,090
common ground but if you take the time
it's so interesting to participate in

1138
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,100
it's so interesting to participate in
 

1139
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,430
it's so interesting to participate in
that process and it feels so good in the

1140
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:40,440
that process and it feels so good in the
 

1141
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,470
that process and it feels so good in the
end to say like yes we tackled this

1142
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:42,480
end to say like yes we tackled this
 

1143
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,450
end to say like yes we tackled this
together right we overcame our our

1144
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:44,460
together right we overcame our our
 

1145
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,850
together right we overcame our our
differences not not so much in opinion

1146
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:46,860
differences not not so much in opinion
 

1147
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,830
differences not not so much in opinion
but just in expressing ourselves about

1148
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:48,840
but just in expressing ourselves about
 

1149
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,690
but just in expressing ourselves about
this and how we go about solving a

1150
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:50,700
this and how we go about solving a
 

1151
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,570
this and how we go about solving a
problem and these were some of my most

1152
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:53,580
problem and these were some of my most
 

1153
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,610
problem and these were some of my most
successful papers and I certainly

1154
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:55,620
successful papers and I certainly
 

1155
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,590
successful papers and I certainly
enjoyed them the most it could also lead

1156
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:57,600
enjoyed them the most it could also lead
 

1157
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,049
enjoyed them the most it could also lead
to Big discoveries I mean there's a I

1158
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:00,059
to Big discoveries I mean there's a I
 

1159
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,270
to Big discoveries I mean there's a I
think you put it really well in saying

1160
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:02,280
think you put it really well in saying
 

1161
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,890
think you put it really well in saying
that we're all kind of studying the same

1162
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:03,900
that we're all kind of studying the same
 

1163
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,350
that we're all kind of studying the same
kind of mysteries and problems I mean I

1164
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:06,360
kind of mysteries and problems I mean I
 

1165
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,610
kind of mysteries and problems I mean I
see this in the space of artificial

1166
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:07,620
see this in the space of artificial
 

1167
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,649
see this in the space of artificial
intelligence you have a community maybe

1168
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:09,659
intelligence you have a community maybe
 

1169
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,169
intelligence you have a community maybe
it seems very far away artificial

1170
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:12,179
it seems very far away artificial
 

1171
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,970
it seems very far away artificial
intelligence and Neuroscience

1172
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:13,980
intelligence and Neuroscience
 

1173
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,350
intelligence and Neuroscience
you know you would think that they're

1174
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,360
you know you would think that they're
 

1175
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,149
you know you would think that they're
studying very different things but one

1176
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:17,159
studying very different things but one
 

1177
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,250
studying very different things but one
is trying to engineer intelligence

1178
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:19,260
is trying to engineer intelligence
 

1179
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,049
is trying to engineer intelligence
and in so doing try to understand

1180
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:21,059
and in so doing try to understand
 

1181
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,649
and in so doing try to understand
intelligence and the other is trying to

1182
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:24,659
intelligence and the other is trying to
 

1183
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:27,710
intelligence and the other is trying to
understand intelligence and cognition in

1184
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:27,720
understand intelligence and cognition in
 

1185
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,090
understand intelligence and cognition in
the human mind and they're just doing it

1186
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:29,100
the human mind and they're just doing it
 

1187
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,370
the human mind and they're just doing it
from a different set of data a different

1188
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:31,380
from a different set of data a different
 

1189
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,870
from a different set of data a different
set of backgrounds and the researchers

1190
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880
set of backgrounds and the researchers
 

1191
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,250
set of backgrounds and the researchers
that do that kind of work and probably

1192
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:34,260
that do that kind of work and probably
 

1193
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,450
that do that kind of work and probably
the same is true in um

1194
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:37,460
the same is true in um
 

1195
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,270
the same is true in um
observational cosmology and simulation

1196
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:41,280
observational cosmology and simulation
 

1197
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,730
observational cosmology and simulation
so it's a it's a it's like a

1198
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:43,740
so it's a it's a it's like a
 

1199
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,710
so it's a it's a it's like a
fundamentally different approach to

1200
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:45,720
fundamentally different approach to
 

1201
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,270
fundamentally different approach to
understanding the universe

1202
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,280
understanding the universe
 

1203
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,390
understanding the universe
let me use for simulation let me use

1204
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
let me use for simulation let me use
 

1205
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,370
let me use for simulation let me use
the things I know to create a bunch of

1206
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:52,380
the things I know to create a bunch of
 

1207
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,950
the things I know to create a bunch of
parameters and create some

1208
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
parameters and create some
 

1209
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,770
parameters and create some
just play with it play with the universe

1210
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:57,780
just play with it play with the universe
 

1211
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,289
just play with it play with the universe
play God create create a bunch of

1212
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:00,299
play God create create a bunch of
 

1213
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,870
play God create create a bunch of
universes and see in a way that matches

1214
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:02,880
universes and see in a way that matches
 

1215
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,409
universes and see in a way that matches
experimental data as a as a fun it's

1216
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:06,419
experimental data as a as a fun it's
 

1217
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,810
experimental data as a as a fun it's
like playing Sims but at the cosmic

1218
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:08,820
like playing Sims but at the cosmic
 

1219
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,630
like playing Sims but at the cosmic
level yeah so but and then probably the

1220
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:11,640
level yeah so but and then probably the
 

1221
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,070
level yeah so but and then probably the
set of terminology used there is very

1222
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,080
set of terminology used there is very
 

1223
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,049
set of terminology used there is very
different and uh maybe you're allowed to

1224
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:15,059
different and uh maybe you're allowed to
 

1225
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:16,490
different and uh maybe you're allowed to
break the rules a little bit more let's

1226
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:16,500
break the rules a little bit more let's
 

1227
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,710
break the rules a little bit more let's
have you know yeah take the Drake

1228
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:18,720
have you know yeah take the Drake
 

1229
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,690
have you know yeah take the Drake
equation yeah you don't really know you

1230
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:20,700
equation yeah you don't really know you
 

1231
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,010
equation yeah you don't really know you
kind of come up with a bunch of values

1232
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:22,020
kind of come up with a bunch of values
 

1233
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,350
kind of come up with a bunch of values
here and there and and just see how it

1234
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:24,360
here and there and and just see how it
 

1235
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,390
here and there and and just see how it
evolves and from that kind of into it

1236
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
evolves and from that kind of into it
 

1237
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,669
evolves and from that kind of into it
the different possibilities the Dynamics

1238
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:28,679
the different possibilities the Dynamics
 

1239
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,950
the different possibilities the Dynamics
of the evolution of a galaxy for example

1240
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
of the evolution of a galaxy for example
 

1241
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,010
of the evolution of a galaxy for example
yeah but it's cool to play between those

1242
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,020
yeah but it's cool to play between those
 

1243
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,169
yeah but it's cool to play between those
two because we it seems like we

1244
00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:36,179
two because we it seems like we
 

1245
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,810
two because we it seems like we
understand so little about our Cosmos so

1246
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:38,820
understand so little about our Cosmos so
 

1247
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,149
understand so little about our Cosmos so
it's good to play yes it's like a big

1248
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:41,159
it's good to play yes it's like a big
 

1249
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,210
it's good to play yes it's like a big
sandbox right and everyone kind of has

1250
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:44,220
sandbox right and everyone kind of has
 

1251
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,649
sandbox right and everyone kind of has
that little corner and they do things

1252
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:45,659
that little corner and they do things
 

1253
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,510
that little corner and they do things
but we're all in the same sandbox

1254
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:47,520
but we're all in the same sandbox
 

1255
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,909
but we're all in the same sandbox
together at the end of the day but in

1256
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
together at the end of the day but in
 

1257
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,190
together at the end of the day but in
that sandbox does have super powerful

1258
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:52,200
that sandbox does have super powerful
 

1259
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,830
that sandbox does have super powerful
and super expensive telescopes that

1260
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:54,840
and super expensive telescopes that
 

1261
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,110
and super expensive telescopes that
everybody's also all the children are

1262
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,120
everybody's also all the children are
 

1263
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,789
everybody's also all the children are
fighting for the resources to to make

1264
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
fighting for the resources to to make
 

1265
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,470
fighting for the resources to to make
sure they guess get to ask the right

1266
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
sure they guess get to ask the right
 

1267
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,990
sure they guess get to ask the right
questions using that uh big cool tool

1268
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,000
questions using that uh big cool tool
 

1269
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,570
questions using that uh big cool tool
well can we actually step back on the

1270
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:05,580
well can we actually step back on the
 

1271
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,950
well can we actually step back on the
the The Big Field of Stellar archeology

1272
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:08,960
the The Big Field of Stellar archeology
 

1273
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,330
the The Big Field of Stellar archeology
uh what is this process can you just

1274
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:11,340
uh what is this process can you just
 

1275
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,590
uh what is this process can you just
speak to it again you've been speaking

1276
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:12,600
speak to it again you've been speaking
 

1277
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,990
speak to it again you've been speaking
to it but what what is this process of

1278
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,000
to it but what what is this process of
 

1279
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,870
to it but what what is this process of
archeology in the cosmos yeah it's uh

1280
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:17,880
archeology in the cosmos yeah it's uh
 

1281
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,450
archeology in the cosmos yeah it's uh
it's it's really fascinating so

1282
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:20,460
it's it's really fascinating so
 

1283
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,409
it's it's really fascinating so
um I mentioned the the lesser the mass

1284
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:24,419
um I mentioned the the lesser the mass
 

1285
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,289
um I mentioned the the lesser the mass
of the star the longer it lives yes

1286
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:27,299
of the star the longer it lives yes
 

1287
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,330
of the star the longer it lives yes
yes and again for reference

1288
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:29,340
yes and again for reference
 

1289
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,370
yes and again for reference
um for the next dinner party the son's

1290
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:31,380
um for the next dinner party the son's
 

1291
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,830
um for the next dinner party the son's
lifetime is 10 billion years so if you

1292
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
lifetime is 10 billion years so if you
 

1293
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,470
lifetime is 10 billion years so if you
have a star that's 0.6 or 0.8 solar

1294
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
have a star that's 0.6 or 0.8 solar
 

1295
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,430
have a star that's 0.6 or 0.8 solar
masses then its lifetime is going to be

1296
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,440
masses then its lifetime is going to be
 

1297
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,649
masses then its lifetime is going to be
15 to 20 billion years

1298
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:42,659
15 to 20 billion years
 

1299
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,990
15 to 20 billion years
and that's that's an important range for

1300
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,000
and that's that's an important range for
 

1301
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,730
and that's that's an important range for
our conversation because even if you

1302
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:46,740
our conversation because even if you
 

1303
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,370
our conversation because even if you
assume that such a small star formed

1304
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:49,380
assume that such a small star formed
 

1305
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,529
assume that such a small star formed
soon after the big bang then it is still

1306
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:51,539
soon after the big bang then it is still
 

1307
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,289
soon after the big bang then it is still
observable today you mentioned old light

1308
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:54,299
observable today you mentioned old light
 

1309
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:56,870
observable today you mentioned old light
before yeah that light is like a few

1310
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
before yeah that light is like a few
 

1311
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,029
before yeah that light is like a few
thousand years old but compared to the

1312
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
thousand years old but compared to the
 

1313
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,909
thousand years old but compared to the
age of these stars is nothing

1314
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
age of these stars is nothing
 

1315
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,090
age of these stars is nothing
so to me that's Young

1316
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,100
so to me that's Young
 

1317
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,549
so to me that's Young
oh it comes straight from from our

1318
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:07,559
oh it comes straight from from our
 

1319
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,950
oh it comes straight from from our
galaxy or you know it's not far these

1320
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:09,960
galaxy or you know it's not far these
 

1321
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,330
galaxy or you know it's not far these
stars are not far away they're in our

1322
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:11,340
stars are not far away they're in our
 

1323
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,470
stars are not far away they're in our
galaxy

1324
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,480
galaxy
 

1325
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,289
galaxy
in the outskirts they probably did not

1326
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:15,299
in the outskirts they probably did not
 

1327
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,630
in the outskirts they probably did not
form in the galaxy

1328
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:17,640
form in the galaxy
 

1329
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,130
form in the galaxy
because again hierarchical assembly of a

1330
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,140
because again hierarchical assembly of a
 

1331
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,010
because again hierarchical assembly of a
Milky Way Bend exactly they're formed in

1332
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:25,020
Milky Way Bend exactly they're formed in
 

1333
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,409
Milky Way Bend exactly they're formed in
a little other galaxy in the vicinity

1334
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:27,419
a little other galaxy in the vicinity
 

1335
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,510
a little other galaxy in the vicinity
and at some point the Milky Way ate that

1336
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,520
and at some point the Milky Way ate that
 

1337
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,549
and at some point the Milky Way ate that
which means it absorbed all the stars

1338
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:31,559
which means it absorbed all the stars
 

1339
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,750
which means it absorbed all the stars
including you know these little old

1340
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:32,760
including you know these little old
 

1341
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,250
including you know these little old
stars that are now on the outskirts of

1342
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,260
stars that are now on the outskirts of
 

1343
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,470
stars that are now on the outskirts of
the Milky Way That I Used to point my

1344
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,480
the Milky Way That I Used to point my
 

1345
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,029
the Milky Way That I Used to point my
telescope to

1346
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:38,039
telescope to
 

1347
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,130
telescope to
so

1348
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,140
so
 

1349
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,810
so
what can we learn from these Stars why

1350
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:41,820
what can we learn from these Stars why
 

1351
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,669
what can we learn from these Stars why
should we study them now these little

1352
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:43,679
should we study them now these little
 

1353
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,490
should we study them now these little
stars are really really efficient

1354
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:46,500
stars are really really efficient
 

1355
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,950
stars are really really efficient
um with their energy consumption they

1356
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
um with their energy consumption they
 

1357
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,990
um with their energy consumption they
are still burning for the experts just

1358
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:51,000
are still burning for the experts just
 

1359
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,850
are still burning for the experts just
burning hydrogen to helium in their

1360
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:52,860
burning hydrogen to helium in their
 

1361
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,490
burning hydrogen to helium in their
cores and they have done so for the past

1362
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:55,500
cores and they have done so for the past
 

1363
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,549
cores and they have done so for the past
12 13 billion years however all they are

1364
00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:58,559
12 13 billion years however all they are
 

1365
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,470
12 13 billion years however all they are
and they're going to keep doing that for

1366
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
and they're going to keep doing that for
 

1367
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,570
and they're going to keep doing that for
another few billion years same as the

1368
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:02,580
another few billion years same as the
 

1369
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,610
another few billion years same as the
sun the same Sun also just does hydrogen

1370
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:04,620
sun the same Sun also just does hydrogen
 

1371
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,350
sun the same Sun also just does hydrogen
helium burning and we'll continue that

1372
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,360
helium burning and we'll continue that
 

1373
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,549
helium burning and we'll continue that
for a while

1374
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:07,559
for a while
 

1375
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:11,710
for a while
which means the outer parts of the star

1376
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:11,720
which means the outer parts of the star
 

1377
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,450
which means the outer parts of the star
well pretty much actually most of the

1378
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:14,460
well pretty much actually most of the
 

1379
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,850
well pretty much actually most of the
star that gas

1380
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:16,860
star that gas
 

1381
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,010
star that gas
doesn't talk to the Core

1382
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,020
doesn't talk to the Core
 

1383
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,269
doesn't talk to the Core
so

1384
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:20,279
so
 

1385
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,850
so
whatever composition that that star has

1386
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:22,860
whatever composition that that star has
 

1387
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,390
whatever composition that that star has
you know in in its outer layers

1388
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,400
you know in in its outer layers
 

1389
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,850
you know in in its outer layers
is exactly the same as the gas

1390
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:28,860
is exactly the same as the gas
 

1391
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,909
is exactly the same as the gas
composition from which the star formed

1392
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:31,919
composition from which the star formed
 

1393
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,990
composition from which the star formed
which means it has perfectly preserved

1394
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,000
which means it has perfectly preserved
 

1395
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,810
which means it has perfectly preserved
that information from way back then all

1396
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:38,820
that information from way back then all
 

1397
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,930
that information from way back then all
the way to the day and going forward

1398
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:41,940
the way to the day and going forward
 

1399
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,690
the way to the day and going forward
so I'm a Stella archaeologist because I

1400
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:44,700
so I'm a Stella archaeologist because I
 

1401
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,630
so I'm a Stella archaeologist because I
don't dig in the dirt to find remnants

1402
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:47,640
don't dig in the dirt to find remnants
 

1403
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,529
don't dig in the dirt to find remnants
of past civilizations and and whatnot

1404
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:51,539
of past civilizations and and whatnot
 

1405
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,049
of past civilizations and and whatnot
I dig for the staff or the old stars in

1406
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:54,059
I dig for the staff or the old stars in
 

1407
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,330
I dig for the staff or the old stars in
the sky because they have preserved that

1408
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:56,340
the sky because they have preserved that
 

1409
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,409
the sky because they have preserved that
information from this first billion year

1410
00:27:59,409 --> 00:27:59,419
information from this first billion year
 

1411
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:01,370
information from this first billion year
uh years

1412
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:01,380
uh years
 

1413
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,470
uh years
um in their in their outer Stellar

1414
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:03,480
um in their in their outer Stellar
 

1415
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,269
um in their in their outer Stellar
atmosphere which is what I'm observing

1416
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
atmosphere which is what I'm observing
 

1417
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,850
atmosphere which is what I'm observing
with telescopes so I'm getting the best

1418
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:07,860
with telescopes so I'm getting the best
 

1419
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,070
with telescopes so I'm getting the best
look at the chemical composition early

1420
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
look at the chemical composition early
 

1421
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,330
look at the chemical composition early
on

1422
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:11,340
on
 

1423
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,210
on
that you could possibly wish for what

1424
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:14,220
that you could possibly wish for what
 

1425
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,549
that you could possibly wish for what
kind of age are we talking about here or

1426
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:16,559
kind of age are we talking about here or
 

1427
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,110
kind of age are we talking about here or
talking about

1428
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,120
talking about
 

1429
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,330
talking about
something that's close to that you know

1430
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:20,340
something that's close to that you know
 

1431
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,330
something that's close to that you know
like a 13 billion 12 13 billion age

1432
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:23,340
like a 13 billion 12 13 billion age
 

1433
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,570
like a 13 billion 12 13 billion age
range that's what we what we think now

1434
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:26,580
range that's what we what we think now
 

1435
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,870
range that's what we what we think now
it has a small caveat here we can not

1436
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:29,880
it has a small caveat here we can not
 

1437
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,930
it has a small caveat here we can not
accurately date these tasks but we use a

1438
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:32,940
accurately date these tasks but we use a
 

1439
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,110
accurately date these tasks but we use a
trick to say oh these tests must have

1440
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,120
trick to say oh these tests must have
 

1441
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,669
trick to say oh these tests must have
formed as some of the earliest

1442
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
formed as some of the earliest
 

1443
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,250
formed as some of the earliest
generations of stars because we need to

1444
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:40,260
generations of stars because we need to
 

1445
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,350
generations of stars because we need to
talk about the chemical evolution of the

1446
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,360
talk about the chemical evolution of the
 

1447
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,930
talk about the chemical evolution of the
universe and the Milky Way for a second

1448
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:43,940
universe and the Milky Way for a second
 

1449
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,870
universe and the Milky Way for a second
so already mentioned the

1450
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:47,880
so already mentioned the
 

1451
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,390
so already mentioned the
uh the pristineness of of the universe

1452
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:50,400
uh the pristineness of of the universe
 

1453
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,250
uh the pristineness of of the universe
after the big bang right just hydrogen

1454
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:52,260
after the big bang right just hydrogen
 

1455
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,350
after the big bang right just hydrogen
and helium then the first stars formed

1456
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:54,360
and helium then the first stars formed
 

1457
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,350
and helium then the first stars formed
they produced a Sprinkle of heavier

1458
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,360
they produced a Sprinkle of heavier
 

1459
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,810
they produced a Sprinkle of heavier
elements up to iron than the next

1460
00:28:59,810 --> 00:28:59,820
elements up to iron than the next
 

1461
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,269
elements up to iron than the next
generation of stars formed that included

1462
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:02,279
generation of stars formed that included
 

1463
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,909
generation of stars formed that included
again massive stars that they would

1464
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:04,919
again massive stars that they would
 

1465
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,430
again massive stars that they would
explode again but also the little ones

1466
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
explode again but also the little ones
 

1467
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,789
explode again but also the little ones
that keep on living right so and then

1468
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
that keep on living right so and then
 

1469
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,529
that keep on living right so and then
the massive ones again exploded

1470
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:12,539
the massive ones again exploded
 

1471
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,450
the massive ones again exploded
Supernova so they provide again another

1472
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:14,460
Supernova so they provide again another
 

1473
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,510
Supernova so they provide again another
sprinkle of heavier elements and so over

1474
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,520
sprinkle of heavier elements and so over
 

1475
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,210
sprinkle of heavier elements and so over
time all the elements in the periodic

1476
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,220
time all the elements in the periodic
 

1477
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,090
time all the elements in the periodic
table have been built up there have been

1478
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,100
table have been built up there have been
 

1479
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,730
table have been built up there have been
other processes for example neutron star

1480
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:25,740
other processes for example neutron star
 

1481
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,070
other processes for example neutron star
mergers and other exotic supernovae that

1482
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,080
mergers and other exotic supernovae that
 

1483
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,350
mergers and other exotic supernovae that
have provided elements heavier than iron

1484
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,360
have provided elements heavier than iron
 

1485
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,750
have provided elements heavier than iron
all the way up to uranium from Fair

1486
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:32,760
all the way up to uranium from Fair
 

1487
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,669
all the way up to uranium from Fair
early on we're still trying to figure

1488
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:34,679
early on we're still trying to figure
 

1489
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,909
early on we're still trying to figure
out those details but

1490
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
out those details but
 

1491
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,370
out those details but
I always say pretty much all the

1492
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:40,380
I always say pretty much all the
 

1493
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,970
I always say pretty much all the
elements were done from like day three

1494
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:43,980
elements were done from like day three
 

1495
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,430
elements were done from like day three
so iron is where like once you get to

1496
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:46,440
so iron is where like once you get to
 

1497
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,010
so iron is where like once you get to
iron you got all the fun you need

1498
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,020
iron you got all the fun you need
 

1499
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,389
iron you got all the fun you need
most of the fun

1500
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:50,399
most of the fun
 

1501
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,010
most of the fun
yes I know

1502
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,020
yes I know
 

1503
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,409
yes I know
uh I I really like the heavier elements

1504
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:54,419
uh I I really like the heavier elements
 

1505
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,110
uh I I really like the heavier elements
you know gold silver Platinum that kind

1506
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,120
you know gold silver Platinum that kind
 

1507
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,029
you know gold silver Platinum that kind
of stuff

1508
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:58,039
of stuff
 

1509
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:00,169
of stuff
for person reasons they're for Star

1510
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:00,179
for person reasons they're for Star
 

1511
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:03,070
for person reasons they're for Star
formation well both okay

1512
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,080
formation well both okay
 

1513
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,149
formation well both okay
I mean like what's the importance of

1514
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:05,159
I mean like what's the importance of
 

1515
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:07,070
I mean like what's the importance of
these heavier Metals in uh in the

1516
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,080
these heavier Metals in uh in the
 

1517
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:13,610
these heavier Metals in uh in the
evolution of the Stars

1518
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:13,620

 

1519
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,950

every Supernova gives you elements up to

1520
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:15,960
every Supernova gives you elements up to
 

1521
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,590
every Supernova gives you elements up to
iron that's cool but at some point it

1522
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:18,600
iron that's cool but at some point it
 

1523
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,230
iron that's cool but at some point it
gets a little bit boring because that

1524
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:21,240
gets a little bit boring because that
 

1525
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,690
gets a little bit boring because that
always works but that's the Baseline we

1526
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:23,700
always works but that's the Baseline we
 

1527
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,190
always works but that's the Baseline we
need that

1528
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
need that
 

1529
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,049
need that
um and that's certainly what came out of

1530
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:27,059
um and that's certainly what came out of
 

1531
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,049
um and that's certainly what came out of
the first stars and then all the other

1532
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:29,059
the first stars and then all the other
 

1533
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:31,430
the first stars and then all the other
Supernova explosions that you know

1534
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
Supernova explosions that you know
 

1535
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,110
Supernova explosions that you know
followed with every generation and it

1536
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,120
followed with every generation and it
 

1537
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,029
followed with every generation and it
took about a thousand Generations give

1538
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:35,039
took about a thousand Generations give
 

1539
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,690
took about a thousand Generations give
or take until the sun was made so the

1540
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:38,700
or take until the sun was made so the
 

1541
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,149
or take until the sun was made so the
sun formed from a gas cloud that was

1542
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:41,159
sun formed from a gas cloud that was
 

1543
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,610
sun formed from a gas cloud that was
enriched by roughly a thousand

1544
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:43,620
enriched by roughly a thousand
 

1545
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,370
enriched by roughly a thousand
generations of supernova explosions

1546
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:46,380
generations of supernova explosions
 

1547
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,590
generations of supernova explosions
and that's why the sun has its its

1548
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:48,600
and that's why the sun has its its
 

1549
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,269
and that's why the sun has its its
chemical the chemical composition that

1550
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:50,279
chemical the chemical composition that
 

1551
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,310
chemical the chemical composition that
it has including you know and somehow

1552
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,320
it has including you know and somehow
 

1553
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,049
it has including you know and somehow
the planets were were made from that as

1554
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:54,059
the planets were were made from that as
 

1555
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,510
the planets were were made from that as
well so the Supernova explosions the

1556
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:56,520
well so the Supernova explosions the
 

1557
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,130
well so the Supernova explosions the
many generations are creating more and

1558
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,140
many generations are creating more and
 

1559
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,769
many generations are creating more and
more complex

1560
00:30:59,769 --> 00:30:59,779
more complex
 

1561
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:02,510
more complex
elements no it just goes all the way up

1562
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:02,520
elements no it just goes all the way up
 

1563
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,549
elements no it just goes all the way up
to iron yeah and then it's just it's a

1564
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:04,559
to iron yeah and then it's just it's a
 

1565
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,470
to iron yeah and then it's just it's a
little bit more of of all of these

1566
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:06,480
little bit more of of all of these
 

1567
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,930
little bit more of of all of these
elements just more yeah just yeah it's

1568
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:08,940
elements just more yeah just yeah it's
 

1569
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,610
elements just more yeah just yeah it's
one sprinkle then another and it just

1570
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:10,620
one sprinkle then another and it just
 

1571
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,190
one sprinkle then another and it just
kind of adds up right now the heavy

1572
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
kind of adds up right now the heavy
 

1573
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,870
kind of adds up right now the heavy
elements form in very different ways

1574
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
elements form in very different ways
 

1575
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,750
elements form in very different ways
they are not Fusion made they are made

1576
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
they are not Fusion made they are made
 

1577
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,490
they are not Fusion made they are made
typically through Neutron capture

1578
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:19,500
typically through Neutron capture
 

1579
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,470
typically through Neutron capture
processes but for that you need seed

1580
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:21,480
processes but for that you need seed
 

1581
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,669
processes but for that you need seed
nuclei

1582
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:22,679
nuclei
 

1583
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:25,370
nuclei
ideally you know iron or carbon or

1584
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:25,380
ideally you know iron or carbon or
 

1585
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:28,190
ideally you know iron or carbon or
something so the Supernova made elements

1586
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,200
something so the Supernova made elements
 

1587
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,049
something so the Supernova made elements
are a very good seed nuclear for other

1588
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:30,059
are a very good seed nuclear for other
 

1589
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,389
are a very good seed nuclear for other
processes that then create heavy

1590
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
processes that then create heavy
 

1591
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,370
processes that then create heavy
elements and because they cannot be made

1592
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:34,380
elements and because they cannot be made
 

1593
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,610
elements and because they cannot be made
everywhere they when you when you know

1594
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:37,620
everywhere they when you when you know
 

1595
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,610
everywhere they when you when you know
so I my sum of my stars have huge

1596
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:40,620
so I my sum of my stars have huge
 

1597
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,470
so I my sum of my stars have huge
amounts of these heavy elements in them

1598
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:42,480
amounts of these heavy elements in them
 

1599
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,450
amounts of these heavy elements in them
and they tell us

1600
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:44,460
and they tell us
 

1601
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,490
and they tell us
in much more detail

1602
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:46,500
in much more detail
 

1603
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,250
in much more detail
something really interesting happened

1604
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:49,260
something really interesting happened
 

1605
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,350
something really interesting happened
somewhere well wait I thought I thought

1606
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
somewhere well wait I thought I thought
 

1607
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,750
somewhere well wait I thought I thought
the really old ones we would not have so

1608
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
the really old ones we would not have so
 

1609
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,669
the really old ones we would not have so
what does that mean if if the old yes

1610
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:55,679
what does that mean if if the old yes
 

1611
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,470
what does that mean if if the old yes
important clarification

1612
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:57,480
important clarification
 

1613
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,330
important clarification
um so

1614
00:31:59,330 --> 00:31:59,340
um so
 

1615
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,010
um so
the stars that we are observing today

1616
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,020
the stars that we are observing today
 

1617
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,029
the stars that we are observing today
these old ones they formed from the gas

1618
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
these old ones they formed from the gas
 

1619
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,269
these old ones they formed from the gas
and the question is what enriched that

1620
00:32:08,269 --> 00:32:08,279
and the question is what enriched that
 

1621
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:11,450
and the question is what enriched that
gas ah so it could have been just a

1622
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:11,460
gas ah so it could have been just a
 

1623
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,049
gas ah so it could have been just a
first star dumping their elements into

1624
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:15,059
first star dumping their elements into
 

1625
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,830
first star dumping their elements into
that gas all the way up to iron

1626
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:18,840

 

1627
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,990

and we have found some stars that we

1628
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,000
and we have found some stars that we
 

1629
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,450
and we have found some stars that we
think are second generation Stars so

1630
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:23,460
think are second generation Stars so
 

1631
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,750
think are second generation Stars so
they form from gas enriched by just one

1632
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:26,760
they form from gas enriched by just one
 

1633
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:30,289
they form from gas enriched by just one
first star that's super cool yeah

1634
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:30,299
first star that's super cool yeah
 

1635
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:33,409
first star that's super cool yeah
then we find other old stars that have a

1636
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:33,419
then we find other old stars that have a
 

1637
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,289
then we find other old stars that have a
much more complicated

1638
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:36,299
much more complicated
 

1639
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,570
much more complicated
um heavy element signature and that

1640
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:38,580
um heavy element signature and that
 

1641
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,909
um heavy element signature and that
means okay they are probably formed in a

1642
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:40,919
means okay they are probably formed in a
 

1643
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:41,930
means okay they are probably formed in a
gas cloud

1644
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:41,940
gas cloud
 

1645
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,289
gas cloud
that had a few things going on

1646
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:45,299
that had a few things going on
 

1647
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:49,010
that had a few things going on
such as maybe a first star maybe another

1648
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,020
such as maybe a first star maybe another
 

1649
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,830
such as maybe a first star maybe another
more normal Supernova and maybe

1650
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
more normal Supernova and maybe
 

1651
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,110
more normal Supernova and maybe
some kind of special process like a

1652
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,120
some kind of special process like a
 

1653
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,730
some kind of special process like a
neutron star merger that would make

1654
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:55,740
neutron star merger that would make
 

1655
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,250
neutron star merger that would make
heavy elements

1656
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:58,260
heavy elements
 

1657
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,610
heavy elements
and so they created a local chemical

1658
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:01,620
and so they created a local chemical
 

1659
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,950
and so they created a local chemical
signature from which the Next Generation

1660
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:03,960
signature from which the Next Generation
 

1661
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,350
signature from which the Next Generation
star then formed

1662
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:06,360
star then formed
 

1663
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,510
star then formed
and that is what we're observing today

1664
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:08,520
and that is what we're observing today
 

1665
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,630
and that is what we're observing today
so all these old Stars basically carry

1666
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:11,640
so all these old Stars basically carry
 

1667
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,269
so all these old Stars basically carry
the signature from all their this these

1668
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:14,279
the signature from all their this these
 

1669
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,549
the signature from all their this these
progenitor events

1670
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
progenitor events
 

1671
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,850
progenitor events
and it's it's our job then to unravel

1672
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:19,860
and it's it's our job then to unravel
 

1673
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,250
and it's it's our job then to unravel
okay which processes and which events

1674
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,260
okay which processes and which events
 

1675
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,529
okay which processes and which events
and how many you know may have occurred

1676
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:24,539
and how many you know may have occurred
 

1677
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,389
and how many you know may have occurred
in the early universe that led to

1678
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:26,399
in the early universe that led to
 

1679
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,610
in the early universe that led to
exactly that signature that we observed

1680
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:28,620
exactly that signature that we observed
 

1681
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,710
exactly that signature that we observed
13 billion years later is it possible to

1682
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
13 billion years later is it possible to
 

1683
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,669
13 billion years later is it possible to
figure out like the number of

1684
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:31,679
figure out like the number of
 

1685
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,490
figure out like the number of
generations that resulted in this

1686
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:34,500
generations that resulted in this
 

1687
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,149
generations that resulted in this
um in these Stars well we can we we

1688
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
um in these Stars well we can we we
 

1689
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,009
um in these Stars well we can we we
think we can sort of say okay this was

1690
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:40,019
think we can sort of say okay this was
 

1691
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,409
think we can sort of say okay this was
like second generation or third because

1692
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:42,419
like second generation or third because
 

1693
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:45,110
like second generation or third because
the amounts of heavy elements in in the

1694
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,120
the amounts of heavy elements in in the
 

1695
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,750
the amounts of heavy elements in in the
cells that we observe

1696
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:47,760
cells that we observe
 

1697
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,409
cells that we observe
um is so tiny one Super One normal

1698
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:51,419
um is so tiny one Super One normal
 

1699
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,330
um is so tiny one Super One normal
Supernova explosion is actually already

1700
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:53,340
Supernova explosion is actually already
 

1701
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,730
Supernova explosion is actually already
basically too much it would give us too

1702
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:55,740
basically too much it would give us too
 

1703
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,190
basically too much it would give us too
much of it and the thing is you can

1704
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,200
much of it and the thing is you can
 

1705
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,110
much of it and the thing is you can
never take away things in the universe

1706
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,120
never take away things in the universe
 

1707
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,210
never take away things in the universe
you can only add there's no Cosmic

1708
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:02,220
you can only add there's no Cosmic
 

1709
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,450
you can only add there's no Cosmic
vacuum cleaner going around sucking

1710
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:05,460
vacuum cleaner going around sucking
 

1711
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,070
vacuum cleaner going around sucking
things away

1712
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,080
things away
 

1713
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,250
things away
the black holes are probably the closest

1714
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,260
the black holes are probably the closest
 

1715
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,930
the black holes are probably the closest
to that but they would have taken the

1716
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:11,940
to that but they would have taken the
 

1717
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,250
to that but they would have taken the
whole stop yeah they'd take the whole

1718
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:13,260
whole stop yeah they'd take the whole
 

1719
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,450
whole stop yeah they'd take the whole
thing not just they wouldn't take up

1720
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:14,460
thing not just they wouldn't take up
 

1721
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,730
thing not just they wouldn't take up
stuff out of the gas you know

1722
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:16,740
stuff out of the gas you know
 

1723
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,869
stuff out of the gas you know
um so we have a

1724
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:19,879
um so we have a
 

1725
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,869
um so we have a
maybe 10 stars or so now where we where

1726
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:23,879
maybe 10 stars or so now where we where
 

1727
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,970
maybe 10 stars or so now where we where
we are saying they're contained so

1728
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:25,980
we are saying they're contained so
 

1729
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,369
we are saying they're contained so
little of these heavy elements that

1730
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:28,379
little of these heavy elements that
 

1731
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,250
little of these heavy elements that
there must be second generation because

1732
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:31,260
there must be second generation because
 

1733
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,530
there must be second generation because
how else would you have made them and

1734
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:33,540
how else would you have made them and
 

1735
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,290
how else would you have made them and
again I wanna I wanna stress that the

1736
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:36,300
again I wanna I wanna stress that the
 

1737
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,669
again I wanna I wanna stress that the
elements that we observe in these stars

1738
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:37,679
elements that we observe in these stars
 

1739
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,470
elements that we observe in these stars
were not made by the Stars themselves

1740
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:39,480
were not made by the Stars themselves
 

1741
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,629
were not made by the Stars themselves
that we observe they that's just a

1742
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:41,639
that we observe they that's just a
 

1743
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,310
that we observe they that's just a
reflection of the gas cloud so we don't

1744
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:43,320
reflection of the gas cloud so we don't
 

1745
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,230
reflection of the gas cloud so we don't
actually I had to say that because I

1746
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:45,240
actually I had to say that because I
 

1747
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,730
actually I had to say that because I
love Stars we don't at the end of the

1748
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:46,740
love Stars we don't at the end of the
 

1749
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,349
love Stars we don't at the end of the
day we don't really care for the stars

1750
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:48,359
day we don't really care for the stars
 

1751
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,089
day we don't really care for the stars
that we're observing we care for the

1752
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:50,099
that we're observing we care for the
 

1753
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,710
that we're observing we care for the
story that they're telling us about the

1754
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:51,720
story that they're telling us about the
 

1755
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,230
story that they're telling us about the
early universe so yeah so the stars are

1756
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,240
early universe so yeah so the stars are
 

1757
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,930
early universe so yeah so the stars are
kind of a small mirror yeah into the the

1758
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:56,940
kind of a small mirror yeah into the the
 

1759
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,030
kind of a small mirror yeah into the the
the earlier yes yeah

1760
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,040
the earlier yes yeah
 

1761
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,710
the earlier yes yeah
and so what are you detecting about

1762
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:00,720
and so what are you detecting about
 

1763
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,030
and so what are you detecting about
those thoughts can you tell me about the

1764
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,040
those thoughts can you tell me about the
 

1765
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,490
those thoughts can you tell me about the
process of archeology here like what

1766
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:04,500
process of archeology here like what
 

1767
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,530
process of archeology here like what
kind of data can we possibly get to tell

1768
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:06,540
kind of data can we possibly get to tell
 

1769
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,270
kind of data can we possibly get to tell
the story about

1770
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,280
the story about
 

1771
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,730
the story about
um these heavy elements on the Stars

1772
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:10,740
um these heavy elements on the Stars
 

1773
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,190
um these heavy elements on the Stars
that depends really on

1774
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,200
that depends really on
 

1775
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,650
that depends really on
um what store you find

1776
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:15,660
um what store you find
 

1777
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,810
um what store you find
um there are many different chemical

1778
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:17,820
um there are many different chemical
 

1779
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,609
um there are many different chemical
signatures

1780
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:19,619
signatures
 

1781
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,250
signatures
um we actually pair up these days our

1782
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:22,260
um we actually pair up these days our
 

1783
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,510
um we actually pair up these days our
our

1784
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,520
our
 

1785
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,150
our
um our element signatures with also

1786
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
um our element signatures with also
 

1787
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,609
um our element signatures with also
kinematic information how the star moves

1788
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:28,619
kinematic information how the star moves
 

1789
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,890
kinematic information how the star moves
about the Galaxy that actually gives us

1790
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:30,900
about the Galaxy that actually gives us
 

1791
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,750
about the Galaxy that actually gives us
Clues

1792
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:32,760
Clues
 

1793
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,210
Clues
um as to where the star might have come

1794
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:35,220
um as to where the star might have come
 

1795
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,550
um as to where the star might have come
from because again all these old stars

1796
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:37,560
from because again all these old stars
 

1797
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,430
from because again all these old stars
in the galaxy but they are not off the

1798
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:40,440
in the galaxy but they are not off the
 

1799
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,250
in the galaxy but they are not off the
Galaxy that's a small but important

1800
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:43,260
Galaxy that's a small but important
 

1801
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,630
Galaxy that's a small but important
distinction so they all came from

1802
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:44,640
distinction so they all came from
 

1803
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,550
distinction so they all came from
somewhere else so you can rewind back in

1804
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:46,560
somewhere else so you can rewind back in
 

1805
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,410
somewhere else so you can rewind back in
time to kind of estimate where it came

1806
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:48,420
time to kind of estimate where it came
 

1807
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,270
time to kind of estimate where it came
from yeah so we can't really say oh it

1808
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:50,280
from yeah so we can't really say oh it
 

1809
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,190
from yeah so we can't really say oh it
came from that and that dwarf Galaxy but

1810
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,200
came from that and that dwarf Galaxy but
 

1811
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,710
came from that and that dwarf Galaxy but
interestingly enough so I'm just I just

1812
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:54,720
interestingly enough so I'm just I just
 

1813
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,750
interestingly enough so I'm just I just
a few days ago I submitted a paper with

1814
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:56,760
a few days ago I submitted a paper with
 

1815
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,810
a few days ago I submitted a paper with
three women undergrads it was so good to

1816
00:35:59,810 --> 00:35:59,820
three women undergrads it was so good to
 

1817
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,230
three women undergrads it was so good to
work together and we found a sample of

1818
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:03,240
work together and we found a sample of
 

1819
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,230
work together and we found a sample of
stars that have very very low abundances

1820
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,240
stars that have very very low abundances
 

1821
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,890
stars that have very very low abundances
in strontium and barium so very heavy

1822
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:09,900
in strontium and barium so very heavy
 

1823
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,030
in strontium and barium so very heavy
elements

1824
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,040
elements
 

1825
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,490
elements
and I had a hunch for a while that these

1826
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:13,500
and I had a hunch for a while that these
 

1827
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,650
and I had a hunch for a while that these
Stars would probably be some of the

1828
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:15,660
Stars would probably be some of the
 

1829
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,990
Stars would probably be some of the
oldest because

1830
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
oldest because
 

1831
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,390
oldest because
as I said heavy elements give you extra

1832
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:20,400
as I said heavy elements give you extra
 

1833
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,089
as I said heavy elements give you extra
information about special events

1834
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:23,099
information about special events
 

1835
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,490
information about special events
and again finding something that's

1836
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:25,500
and again finding something that's
 

1837
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,050
and again finding something that's
really low

1838
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:27,060
really low
 

1839
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,810
really low
means it must have for it that must have

1840
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:29,820
means it must have for it that must have
 

1841
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,650
means it must have for it that must have
happened either really early on or in a

1842
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:33,660
happened either really early on or in a
 

1843
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,870
happened either really early on or in a
very special environment right because

1844
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:35,880
very special environment right because
 

1845
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,970
very special environment right because
we can only ever add so if you find

1846
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:37,980
we can only ever add so if you find
 

1847
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,770
we can only ever add so if you find
something that's that's incredibly low

1848
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:39,780
something that's that's incredibly low
 

1849
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,810
something that's that's incredibly low
in terms of the abundance it

1850
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:41,820
in terms of the abundance it
 

1851
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,270
in terms of the abundance it
maybe just one event contributed that

1852
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:44,280
maybe just one event contributed that
 

1853
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,470
maybe just one event contributed that
Max

1854
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:45,480
Max
 

1855
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,270
Max
so

1856
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
so
 

1857
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,069
so
we looked at the kinematics how are

1858
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:49,079
we looked at the kinematics how are
 

1859
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,410
we looked at the kinematics how are
these Stars moving and they're all going

1860
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:51,420
these Stars moving and they're all going
 

1861
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,430
these Stars moving and they're all going
the wrong way in the galaxy

1862
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440

 

1863
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,190

how how is that possible well it is

1864
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,200
how how is that possible well it is
 

1865
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,250
how how is that possible well it is
possible because consider now we come

1866
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:01,260
possible because consider now we come
 

1867
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,630
possible because consider now we come
back to the Proto Galaxy the Proto

1868
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:02,640
back to the Proto Galaxy the Proto
 

1869
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,430
back to the Proto Galaxy the Proto
Galaxy was like a beehive it just didn't

1870
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:04,440
Galaxy was like a beehive it just didn't
 

1871
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,290
Galaxy was like a beehive it just didn't
really know what it was or what it

1872
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:06,300
really know what it was or what it
 

1873
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,390
really know what it was or what it
wanted to become when I grew up

1874
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
wanted to become when I grew up
 

1875
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,490
wanted to become when I grew up
so and it was absorbing all these little

1876
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:10,500
so and it was absorbing all these little
 

1877
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,349
so and it was absorbing all these little
galaxies to grow fast

1878
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:12,359
galaxies to grow fast
 

1879
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,490
galaxies to grow fast
some galaxies some absorbed galaxies

1880
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:15,500
some galaxies some absorbed galaxies
 

1881
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,190
some galaxies some absorbed galaxies
were thrown in going the main way and

1882
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:19,200
were thrown in going the main way and
 

1883
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,770
were thrown in going the main way and
some came in the wrong way huh happens

1884
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:21,780
some came in the wrong way huh happens
 

1885
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,470
some came in the wrong way huh happens
it happens but this could only happen

1886
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,480
it happens but this could only happen
 

1887
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,770
it happens but this could only happen
early on when you know there wasn't left

1888
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:27,780
early on when you know there wasn't left
 

1889
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,569
early on when you know there wasn't left
and right and up and down

1890
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:29,579
and right and up and down
 

1891
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,790
and right and up and down
so stuff would come in from always so

1892
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:31,800
so stuff would come in from always so
 

1893
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,750
so stuff would come in from always so
now

1894
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:32,760
now
 

1895
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,210
now
13 billion years later we're still doing

1896
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:35,220
13 billion years later we're still doing
 

1897
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,849
13 billion years later we're still doing
it yeah the a they're still doing it and

1898
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:37,859
it yeah the a they're still doing it and
 

1899
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:40,790
it yeah the a they're still doing it and
B we just looked for stars that have low

1900
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:40,800
B we just looked for stars that have low
 

1901
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,430
B we just looked for stars that have low
straw human barium abundances and then

1902
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:43,440
straw human barium abundances and then
 

1903
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,950
straw human barium abundances and then
we look at the kinematics and lo and

1904
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:45,960
we look at the kinematics and lo and
 

1905
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,810
we look at the kinematics and lo and
behold they are at hundreds of

1906
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:47,820
behold they are at hundreds of
 

1907
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,089
behold they are at hundreds of
kilometers per second going the wrong

1908
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:50,099
kilometers per second going the wrong
 

1909
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:52,970
kilometers per second going the wrong
way it's like dude you must have come in

1910
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:52,980
way it's like dude you must have come in
 

1911
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,670
way it's like dude you must have come in
really early on from somewhere else so

1912
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:55,680
really early on from somewhere else so
 

1913
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,790
really early on from somewhere else so
we call this retrograde motion that's a

1914
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
we call this retrograde motion that's a
 

1915
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,950
we call this retrograde motion that's a
clear sign of accretion so something

1916
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
clear sign of accretion so something
 

1917
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,190
clear sign of accretion so something
that has come in to the Galaxy and

1918
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:04,200
that has come in to the Galaxy and
 

1919
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,530
that has come in to the Galaxy and
because they are so fast

1920
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:06,540
because they are so fast
 

1921
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,710
because they are so fast
um and it's really all of them that that

1922
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:09,720
um and it's really all of them that that
 

1923
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,450
um and it's really all of them that that
must have happened early on right you

1924
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:11,460
must have happened early on right you
 

1925
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,609
must have happened early on right you
can't throw a Galaxy into the Mickey

1926
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:13,619
can't throw a Galaxy into the Mickey
 

1927
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,530
can't throw a Galaxy into the Mickey
right now the wrong way it eventually

1928
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:15,540
right now the wrong way it eventually
 

1929
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,050
right now the wrong way it eventually
will turn around can you actually just a

1930
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:18,060
will turn around can you actually just a
 

1931
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,450
will turn around can you actually just a
small tangent speak to the the three

1932
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:20,460
small tangent speak to the the three
 

1933
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,430
small tangent speak to the the three
women undergrads like this little it's

1934
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:22,440
women undergrads like this little it's
 

1935
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,829
women undergrads like this little it's
pretty cool that you were able to

1936
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:24,839
pretty cool that you were able to
 

1937
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:25,550
pretty cool that you were able to
um

1938
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:25,560
um
 

1939
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,250
um
use a hunch to find this really cool

1940
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:28,260
use a hunch to find this really cool
 

1941
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,290
use a hunch to find this really cool
little star

1942
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:30,300
little star
 

1943
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,609
little star
um yeah what's the process of like

1944
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:31,619
um yeah what's the process of like
 

1945
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,050
um yeah what's the process of like
especially with undergrads I think that

1946
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:33,060
especially with undergrads I think that
 

1947
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,430
especially with undergrads I think that
would be very interesting and inspiring

1948
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:34,440
would be very interesting and inspiring
 

1949
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,829
would be very interesting and inspiring
to people yes it was a wonderful little

1950
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:36,839
to people yes it was a wonderful little
 

1951
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:39,230
to people yes it was a wonderful little
collaboration that actually emerged in

1952
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,240
collaboration that actually emerged in
 

1953
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,670
collaboration that actually emerged in
the fall

1954
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:40,680
the fall
 

1955
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,349
the fall
um I

1956
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:42,359
um I
 

1957
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,270
um I
so I like I really like working with

1958
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:44,280
so I like I really like working with
 

1959
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,130
so I like I really like working with
with undergrads and grad students

um and I came up with a New Concept for

1964
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:50,640
um and I came up with a New Concept for
 

1965
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,170
um and I came up with a New Concept for
a class at MIT where I wanted to

1966
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:54,180
a class at MIT where I wanted to
 

1967
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,150
a class at MIT where I wanted to
integrate the research process into the

1968
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,160
integrate the research process into the
 

1969
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,750
integrate the research process into the
classroom because sometimes

1970
00:38:59,750 --> 00:38:59,760
classroom because sometimes
 

1971
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,790
classroom because sometimes
um people find it really hard to called

1972
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:01,800
um people find it really hard to called
 

1973
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,030
um people find it really hard to called

interested in your research could I

1978
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,160
interested in your research could I
 

1979
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,690
interested in your research could I
possibly you know come yes and um I

1980
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:11,700
possibly you know come yes and um I
 

1981
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,870
possibly you know come yes and um I
wanted to to streamline that and give uh

1982
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
wanted to to streamline that and give uh
 

1983
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,150
wanted to to streamline that and give uh
and you know just trial how it would

1984
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:17,160
and you know just trial how it would
 

1985
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,690
and you know just trial how it would
work to provide a sort of a safe

confines of a classroom where you just

1988
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:22,800
confines of a classroom where you just
 

1989
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,670
confines of a classroom where you just
sign up and do research in a very

1990
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:25,680
sign up and do research in a very
 

1991
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,290
sign up and do research in a very
structured way

1992

structured way
 

1993
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,150
structured way
and uh I developed it was a lot of work

1994
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,160
and uh I developed it was a lot of work
 

1995
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,730
and uh I developed it was a lot of work

they could do it again in a very
 

2003
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,990
they could do it again in a very

don't know what the solution is because

2018
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:00,660
don't know what the solution is because
 

2019
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,569
don't know what the solution is because
in research we don't look up the

it's it defines complicated sometimes
 

2039
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,770
it's it defines complicated sometimes
but it's doable right yes but coming up

2040

with a story when you only have three

2042
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,060
with a story when you only have three
 

2043

with a story when you only have three
puzzle pieces what does the puzzle look

2044
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:29,099
puzzle pieces what does the puzzle look
 

2045
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,230
puzzle pieces what does the puzzle look
like

2046
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
like
 

2047
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,390
like
that you have to be a little bit bold

2048
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,400
that you have to be a little bit bold
 

2049
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,510
that you have to be a little bit bold
you need to have some experience

2050
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:35,520
you need to have some experience
 

2051
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,730
you need to have some experience
and you need to you need to kind of see

2052
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:37,740
and you need to you need to kind of see
 

2053
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,890
and you need to you need to kind of see
the universe in 3D you just need to kind

2054
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:39,900
the universe in 3D you just need to kind
 

2055
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,329
the universe in 3D you just need to kind
of go for it and that's the beautiful

2056
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:41,339
of go for it and that's the beautiful
 

2057
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,730
of go for it and that's the beautiful
thing I really love that and so this was

2058
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:43,740
thing I really love that and so this was
 

2059
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,190
thing I really love that and so this was
a story of weird kinematics going the

2060
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:46,200
a story of weird kinematics going the
 

2061
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,410
a story of weird kinematics going the
wrong way combined with this particular

2062
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:48,420
wrong way combined with this particular
 

2063
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,690
wrong way combined with this particular
weird signature in terms of the elements

2064
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:50,700
weird signature in terms of the elements
 

2065
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,250
weird signature in terms of the elements
exactly and you have to come up with a

2066
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:52,260
exactly and you have to come up with a
 

2067
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,650
exactly and you have to come up with a
story yeah and so the story of that

2068
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:54,660
story yeah and so the story of that
 

2069
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,910
story yeah and so the story of that
paper is now usually I don't say I find

2070
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:58,920
paper is now usually I don't say I find
 

2071
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,190
paper is now usually I don't say I find
the older stars you know when I talk to

2072
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,200
the older stars you know when I talk to
 

2073
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,290
the older stars you know when I talk to
my research colleagues I I talk to them

2074
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:03,300
my research colleagues I I talk to them
 

2075
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,970
my research colleagues I I talk to them
about we find the chemically most

2076
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:04,980
about we find the chemically most
 

2077
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,710
about we find the chemically most
pristine stars because that's actually

2078
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:06,720
pristine stars because that's actually
 

2079
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,569
pristine stars because that's actually
what we measure the chemical abundance

2080
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:08,579
what we measure the chemical abundance
 

2081
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,550
what we measure the chemical abundance
that tells us okay it must have been

2082
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
that tells us okay it must have been
 

2083
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,890
that tells us okay it must have been
second or third or fifth generation of

second or third or fifth generation of
 

2085
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,349
second or third or fifth generation of
stars right but these low strong theme

2086
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
stars right but these low strong theme
 

2087
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,089
stars right but these low strong theme
stars that go in the wrong way like

00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:17,099
stars that go in the wrong way like
 

2089
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,150
stars that go in the wrong way like
they're getting paid for it they must be

2090
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,160
they're getting paid for it they must be
 

2091
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,390
they're getting paid for it they must be
the oldest stars that came into the

2092
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:23,400
the oldest stars that came into the
 

2093
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,910
the oldest stars that came into the
Galaxy because they formed before the

00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,480
was the Mickey way right and this is so
 

2099
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,329
was the Mickey way right and this is so
cool and it was so wonderful so this

cool and it was so wonderful so this
 

2101
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:35,450
cool and it was so wonderful so this

00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:46,740
women and they were so into it that I
 

2111
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:47,930
women and they were so into it that I
said okay

2112
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:47,940
said okay

00:41:59,390 --> 00:41:59,400
um you're using the terminology of
 

2123
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,250
um you're using the terminology of
chemically more pristine when I'm

00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:01,260
chemically more pristine when I'm
 

2125
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,569
chemically more pristine when I'm
talking to younger people I'll just say

2126
00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:02,579
talking to younger people I'll just say
 

2127
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:05,450
talking to younger people I'll just say
that I'm more chemically pristine than

2128
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:05,460
that I'm more chemically pristine than
 

2129
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,510
that I'm more chemically pristine than
them I like the description of age so

2130
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:08,520
them I like the description of age so
 

2131
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,810
them I like the description of age so
there's this term of metal poor Stars so

2132
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:11,820
there's this term of metal poor Stars so
 

2133
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,430
there's this term of metal poor Stars so
most of these old stars are going to be

2134
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,440
most of these old stars are going to be
 

2135
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,829
most of these old stars are going to be
metal poor yes I I search for the most

2136
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:15,839
metal poor yes I I search for the most
 

2137
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,930
metal poor yes I I search for the most
metal poor stars and what does that can

2138
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:17,940
metal poor stars and what does that can
 

2139
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,210
metal poor stars and what does that can
we just Define yeah

2140
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:20,220
we just Define yeah
 

2141
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,370
we just Define yeah
I don't know who came up with this I

2142
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:22,380
I don't know who came up with this I
 

2143
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,609
I don't know who came up with this I
would I would love to know but um

2144
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:25,619
would I would love to know but um
 

2145
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:27,950
would I would love to know but um
the universe is a complicated place so

2146
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:27,960
the universe is a complicated place so
 

2147
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,010
the universe is a complicated place so
many decades ago someone clever came up

2148
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,020
many decades ago someone clever came up
 

2149
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,589
many decades ago someone clever came up
with the idea to say

2150
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:33,599
with the idea to say
 

2151
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,510
with the idea to say
let's simplify things a little bit let's

2152
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520
let's simplify things a little bit let's
 

2153
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,109
let's simplify things a little bit let's
call hydrogen X helium Y and all the

2154
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:39,119
call hydrogen X helium Y and all the
 

2155
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,620
call hydrogen X helium Y and all the
other elements combine Metals Z

when I give public talks I always ask us

2160
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:47,880
when I give public talks I always ask us
 

2161
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,910
when I give public talks I always ask us
is there a chemist in the audience

2162
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:49,920
is there a chemist in the audience
 

2163
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,490
is there a chemist in the audience
let me just tell you neon is a wonderful

2164
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:52,500
let me just tell you neon is a wonderful
 

2165
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,670
let me just tell you neon is a wonderful
metal and they're like oh my God what's

2166
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
metal and they're like oh my God what's
 

2167
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,710
metal and they're like oh my God what's
he saying but I'm an astronomer I'm I'm

2168
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:57,720
he saying but I'm an astronomer I'm I'm
 

2169
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,109
he saying but I'm an astronomer I'm I'm
not a chemistor I'll get away with it so

2170
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:00,119
not a chemistor I'll get away with it so
 

2171
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,030
not a chemistor I'll get away with it so
if you just roll with it for a moment

2172
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:02,040
if you just roll with it for a moment
 

2173
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,609
if you just roll with it for a moment
all the elements except hydrogen helium

2174
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:04,619
all the elements except hydrogen helium
 

2175
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,349
all the elements except hydrogen helium
are called metals

2176
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:06,359
are called metals
 

2177
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:09,470
are called metals
now if we look again at chemical or the

2178
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:09,480
now if we look again at chemical or the
 

2179
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,270
now if we look again at chemical or the
concept of chemical Evolution it means

2180
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:11,280
concept of chemical Evolution it means
 

2181
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,150
concept of chemical Evolution it means
more and more of all the elements

2182
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,160
more and more of all the elements
 

2183
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,250
more and more of all the elements
everything heavier than hydrogen helium

2184
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:16,260
everything heavier than hydrogen helium
 

2185
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,829
everything heavier than hydrogen helium
gets produced slowly but surely by

2186
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:18,839
gets produced slowly but surely by
 

2187
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:21,589
gets produced slowly but surely by
different types of stores and events

2188
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
different types of stores and events
 

2189
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,470
different types of stores and events
so that's a you know a monotonously

2190
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
so that's a you know a monotonously
 

2191
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,990
so that's a you know a monotonously
increasing function

2192
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,000
increasing function
 

2193
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,329
increasing function
um and so we look for the stars that

2194
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:29,339
um and so we look for the stars that
 

2195
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,430
um and so we look for the stars that
have the least amounts of heavy elements

2196
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:31,440
have the least amounts of heavy elements
 

2197
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,690
have the least amounts of heavy elements
in them

2198
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:32,700
in them
 

2199
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,030
in them
because that means we are going further

2200
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,040
because that means we are going further
 

2201
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,670
because that means we are going further
and further back in this process in that

2202
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
and further back in this process in that
 

2203
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,690
and further back in this process in that
function

2204
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:38,700
function
 

2205
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,210
function
almost all the way to the very beginning

2206
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:41,220
almost all the way to the very beginning
 

2207
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,490
almost all the way to the very beginning
and that is the first Stars right they

2208
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:43,500
and that is the first Stars right they
 

2209
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,250
and that is the first Stars right they
they started that that process that's

2210
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:46,260
they started that that process that's
 

2211
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,829
they started that that process that's
why I said it was such an important

2212
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:47,839
why I said it was such an important
 

2213
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,349
why I said it was such an important

these days yeah and you're looking at

2230
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:10,500
these days yeah and you're looking at
 

2231
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,990
these days yeah and you're looking at
the very early days in the introduction

2232
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,000
the very early days in the introduction
 

2233
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,550
the very early days in the introduction
of the variety yes exactly when it was

2234
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:15,560
of the variety yes exactly when it was
 

2235
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,030
of the variety yes exactly when it was
still a little bit more organizable

2236
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:20,040
still a little bit more organizable
 

2237
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,589
still a little bit more organizable
um but the the variety of different

2238
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:21,599
um but the the variety of different
 

2239
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,450
um but the the variety of different
types of metal poor stores we have a

2240
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:23,460
types of metal poor stores we have a
 

2241
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,410
types of metal poor stores we have a
stark

2242
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:24,420
stark
 

2243
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,870
stark
um many different types of stars many

2244
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
um many different types of stars many
 

2245
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,849
um many different types of stars many
patterns we have sort of identified but

2246
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:28,859
patterns we have sort of identified but
 

2247
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:31,010
patterns we have sort of identified but
they are so crazy ones out there that

2248
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:31,020
they are so crazy ones out there that
 

2249
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,010
they are so crazy ones out there that
we're still trying to kind of fit in

2250
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:34,020
we're still trying to kind of fit in
 

2251
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,270
we're still trying to kind of fit in
so what kind of stars have been

2252
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
so what kind of stars have been
 

2253
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,849
so what kind of stars have been
discovered so you've uh already a while

2254
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:37,859
discovered so you've uh already a while
 

2255
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:42,290
discovered so you've uh already a while
ago uh helped discover the star he

2256
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:42,300
ago uh helped discover the star he
 

2257
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:50,170
ago uh helped discover the star he
1 3 27 23 26 great name yes and I Chief

2258
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:50,180
1 3 27 23 26 great name yes and I Chief
 

2259
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,910
1 3 27 23 26 great name yes and I Chief
15230901 what can you say about these

2260
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:52,920
15230901 what can you say about these
 

2261
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,890
15230901 what can you say about these
these stars and others that have been

2262
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:54,900
these stars and others that have been
 

2263
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,710
these stars and others that have been
found I love them okay they're my baby

2264
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:57,720
found I love them okay they're my baby
 

2265
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,690
found I love them okay they're my baby
Stars what do you call what do you call

2266
00:44:59,690 --> 00:44:59,700
Stars what do you call what do you call
 

2267
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,609
Stars what do you call what do you call
what do you call your your baby Stars

2268
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:01,619
what do you call your your baby Stars
 

2269
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,829
what do you call your your baby Stars
well I'm probably the only one who can

2270
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:03,839
well I'm probably the only one who can
 

2271
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,450
well I'm probably the only one who can
you know spit out these names without

2272
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:05,460
you know spit out these names without
 

2273
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,849
you know spit out these names without
cheating there's nicknames are there

2274
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:07,859
cheating there's nicknames are there
 

2275
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:10,250
cheating there's nicknames are there
well no that's that's that's not allowed

2276
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:10,260
well no that's that's that's not allowed
 

2277
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,650
well no that's that's that's not allowed
okay uh well some colleagues at

2278
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:12,660
okay uh well some colleagues at
 

2279
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,569
okay uh well some colleagues at
conferences have just called them anasta

2280
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:14,579
conferences have just called them anasta
 

2281
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,490
conferences have just called them anasta
or Freebo staff because they they didn't

2282
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:16,500
or Freebo staff because they they didn't
 

2283
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,069
or Freebo staff because they they didn't
want to learn the the phone number you

2284
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:19,079
want to learn the the phone number you
 

2285
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:21,589
want to learn the the phone number you
know I I get it phone number yeah and

2286
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
know I I get it phone number yeah and
 

2287
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,569
know I I get it phone number yeah and
these numbers are actually based on on

2288
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:23,579
these numbers are actually based on on
 

2289
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,250
these numbers are actually based on on
older sets of coordinates for these

2290
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:25,260
older sets of coordinates for these
 

2291
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,309
older sets of coordinates for these
Stars so they um yes the the minus in

2292
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:28,319
Stars so they um yes the the minus in
 

2293
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,270
Stars so they um yes the the minus in
the middle means that they're in the

2294
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:29,280
the middle means that they're in the
 

2295
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,770
the middle means that they're in the
southern hemisphere so negative is in

2296
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:30,780
southern hemisphere so negative is in
 

2297
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,190
southern hemisphere so negative is in
the southern hemisphere positive

2298
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200
the southern hemisphere positive
 

2299
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,170
the southern hemisphere positive
and then uh 13 and 15 means that sort of

2300
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:36,180
and then uh 13 and 15 means that sort of
 

2301
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,430
and then uh 13 and 15 means that sort of
observable in the middle of the Year

2302
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:37,440
observable in the middle of the Year
 

2303
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,750
observable in the middle of the Year
okay so that's the deal with the

2304
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:38,760
okay so that's the deal with the
 

2305
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,309
okay so that's the deal with the
observation and where it was observed

2306
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:40,319
observation and where it was observed
 

2307
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,250
observation and where it was observed
yes yes but um have very different

2308
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:43,260
yes yes but um have very different
 

2309
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,470
yes yes but um have very different
stores both absolutely significant

2310
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:47,480
stores both absolutely significant
 

2311
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,450
stores both absolutely significant
career defining actually for for me but

2312
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:50,460
career defining actually for for me but
 

2313
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:53,030
career defining actually for for me but
really pushed pushed the envelope in in

2314
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,040
really pushed pushed the envelope in in
 

2315
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,150
really pushed pushed the envelope in in
very different ways so 80 1327 of the

2316
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
very different ways so 80 1327 of the
 

2317
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,130
very different ways so 80 1327 of the
first one that you mentioned that was

2318
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:58,140
first one that you mentioned that was
 

2319
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,410
first one that you mentioned that was
the second second generation star that

2320
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:00,420
the second second generation star that
 

2321
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,950
the second second generation star that
we found and you know usually people say

2322
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:03,960
we found and you know usually people say
 

2323
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,109
we found and you know usually people say
like oh the first one is the big one and

2324
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:06,119
like oh the first one is the big one and
 

2325
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:10,670
like oh the first one is the big one and
the rest is nobody cares but to us it

2326
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:10,680
the rest is nobody cares but to us it
 

2327
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,770
the rest is nobody cares but to us it
proved that yes we can do it because one

2328
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:14,780
proved that yes we can do it because one
 

2329
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,589
proved that yes we can do it because one
astronomers live in a sort of way of you

2330
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:18,599
astronomers live in a sort of way of you
 

2331
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:19,970
astronomers live in a sort of way of you
know there are a lot of serendipitous

2332
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:19,980
know there are a lot of serendipitous
 

2333
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,890
know there are a lot of serendipitous
discoveries and we

2334
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:21,900
discoveries and we
 

2335
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,770
discoveries and we
that's really great but we need to show

2336
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:24,780
that's really great but we need to show
 

2337
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,530
that's really great but we need to show
that we can do it again reliably because

2338
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:27,540
that we can do it again reliably because
 

2339
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,630
that we can do it again reliably because
then then we're on to something it's not

2340
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:29,640
then then we're on to something it's not
 

2341
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,609
then then we're on to something it's not
just some kind of weird Quirk and there

2342
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:31,619
just some kind of weird Quirk and there
 

2343
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:33,470
just some kind of weird Quirk and there
are a lot of quirks in the universe but

2344
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:33,480
are a lot of quirks in the universe but
 

2345
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,510
are a lot of quirks in the universe but
we want to know is is that a real thing

2346
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
we want to know is is that a real thing
 

2347
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,309
we want to know is is that a real thing
does that happen regularly is there

2348
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:37,319
does that happen regularly is there
 

2349
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:38,750
does that happen regularly is there
something that we can learn right is

2350
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:38,760
something that we can learn right is
 

2351
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,109
something that we can learn right is
that a piece of the story

2352
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,119
that a piece of the story
 

2353
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,910
that a piece of the story
and so finding the second one that was

2354
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:43,920
and so finding the second one that was
 

2355
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,530
and so finding the second one that was
even a little bit more extreme than the

2356
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,540
even a little bit more extreme than the
 

2357
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,410
even a little bit more extreme than the
first one really showed yes our search

2358
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:48,420
first one really showed yes our search
 

2359
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,470
first one really showed yes our search
techniques work we can find these Stars

2360
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:51,480
techniques work we can find these Stars
 

2361
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,109
techniques work we can find these Stars
they provide an important part to the

2362
00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:54,119
they provide an important part to the
 

2363
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:55,130
they provide an important part to the
story

2364
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:55,140
story
 

2365
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,589
story
in the sense that

2366
00:46:57,589 --> 00:46:57,599
in the sense that
 

2367
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,410
in the sense that
if we had more than two stars and by now

2368
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:00,420
if we had more than two stars and by now
 

2369
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,050
if we had more than two stars and by now
we have about 10-ish or so

2370
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:03,060
we have about 10-ish or so
 

2371
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,290
we have about 10-ish or so
what do they tell us about the nature of

2372
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:06,300
what do they tell us about the nature of
 

2373
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,050
what do they tell us about the nature of
the very first Stars

2374
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:09,060
the very first Stars
 

2375
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,630
the very first Stars
and what we found

2376
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:11,640
and what we found
 

2377
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,670
and what we found
um again working with a theorists of

2378
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:13,680
um again working with a theorists of
 

2379
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,670
um again working with a theorists of
course who run these Supernova models

2380
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:16,680
course who run these Supernova models
 

2381
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,490
course who run these Supernova models
is that so actually let me let me before

2382
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:19,500
is that so actually let me let me before
 

2383
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,210
is that so actually let me let me before
I get into this these two stars had huge

2384
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:23,220
I get into this these two stars had huge
 

2385
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,349
I get into this these two stars had huge
amounts of carbon relative to iron so we

2386
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
amounts of carbon relative to iron so we
 

2387
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,410
amounts of carbon relative to iron so we
usually use iron as a reference element

2388
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:29,420
usually use iron as a reference element
 

2389
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,510
usually use iron as a reference element
for what we call the metallicity so the

2390
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:32,520
for what we call the metallicity so the
 

2391
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,109
for what we call the metallicity so the
overall metal content the overall amount

2392
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:36,119
overall metal content the overall amount
 

2393
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,930
overall metal content the overall amount
of heavy elements in it so that's why

2394
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:38,940
of heavy elements in it so that's why
 

2395
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,750
of heavy elements in it so that's why
it's called iron deficiency that's right

2396
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
it's called iron deficiency that's right
 

2397
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,790
it's called iron deficiency that's right
so this does an incredibly iron

2398
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:43,800
so this does an incredibly iron
 

2399
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,370
so this does an incredibly iron
deficient which means there must be of

2400
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:46,380
deficient which means there must be of
 

2401
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,589
deficient which means there must be of
the second generation because

2402
00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:48,599
the second generation because
 

2403
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,650
the second generation because
there was and interestingly enough

2404
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:51,660
there was and interestingly enough
 

2405
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,069
there was and interestingly enough
there was this discrepancy

2406
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:55,079
there was this discrepancy
 

2407
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:58,309
there was this discrepancy
a normal Supernova until then we thought

2408
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:58,319
a normal Supernova until then we thought
 

2409
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,790
a normal Supernova until then we thought
would get us so much iron

2410
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:01,800
would get us so much iron
 

2411
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,250
would get us so much iron
you know you would distribute that in

2412
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:04,260
you know you would distribute that in
 

2413
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,510
you know you would distribute that in
the gas cloud and then you would form

2414
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:05,520
the gas cloud and then you would form
 

2415
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,950
the gas cloud and then you would form
this little star that we're observing

2416
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:06,960
this little star that we're observing
 

2417
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,870
this little star that we're observing
but the iron abundance that we measured

2418
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:08,880
but the iron abundance that we measured
 

2419
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,089
but the iron abundance that we measured
was actually much lower than that and I

2420
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:11,099
was actually much lower than that and I
 

2421
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:12,530
was actually much lower than that and I
already mentioned you can't take things

2422
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:12,540
already mentioned you can't take things
 

2423
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:16,250
already mentioned you can't take things
away that must mean these early massive

2424
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:16,260
away that must mean these early massive
 

2425
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,230
away that must mean these early massive
pop three we call them population three

2426
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
pop three we call them population three
 

2427
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,790
pop three we call them population three
the first Stars

2428
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:19,800
the first Stars
 

2429
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,710
the first Stars
they must have exploded in a different

2430
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:21,720
they must have exploded in a different
 

2431
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,990
they must have exploded in a different
way than we previously thought they

2432
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,000
way than we previously thought they
 

2433
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,470
way than we previously thought they
can't output as much iron because

2434
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:27,480
can't output as much iron because
 

2435
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,809
can't output as much iron because
they just can't otherwise it wouldn't

2436
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:29,819
they just can't otherwise it wouldn't
 

2437
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,450
they just can't otherwise it wouldn't
match our observations got it and so

2438
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:32,460
match our observations got it and so
 

2439
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,270
match our observations got it and so
that's when we started to work with uh

2440
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:35,280
that's when we started to work with uh
 

2441
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,609
that's when we started to work with uh
several Theory groups

2442
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:37,619
several Theory groups
 

2443
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:41,270
several Theory groups
on on supernova yields so what comes out

2444
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
on on supernova yields so what comes out
 

2445
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,370
on on supernova yields so what comes out
of from the explosion of the Supernova

2446
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:43,380
of from the explosion of the Supernova
 

2447
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,010
of from the explosion of the Supernova
that's called Supernova yields and so

2448
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:46,020
that's called Supernova yields and so
 

2449
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,470
that's called Supernova yields and so
this one was not yielding much iron well

2450
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:48,480
this one was not yielding much iron well
 

2451
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,309
this one was not yielding much iron well
we needed to concoct a theoretical

2452
00:48:51,309 --> 00:48:51,319
we needed to concoct a theoretical
 

2453
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:54,069
we needed to concoct a theoretical
Supernova that made less

2454
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:54,079
Supernova that made less
 

2455
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,390
Supernova that made less
and it's actually surprisingly difficult

2456
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
and it's actually surprisingly difficult
 

2457
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,910
and it's actually surprisingly difficult
because you can always add more in the

2458
00:48:58,910 --> 00:48:58,920
because you can always add more in the
 

2459
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,890
because you can always add more in the
universe right but you can't take stuff

2460
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:00,900
universe right but you can't take stuff
 

2461
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,670
universe right but you can't take stuff
away so Japanese colleagues kind of came

2462
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:04,680
away so Japanese colleagues kind of came
 

2463
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,050
away so Japanese colleagues kind of came
up with the idea of a fainter Supernova

2464
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:08,060
up with the idea of a fainter Supernova
 

2465
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,730
up with the idea of a fainter Supernova
that just doesn't have a much is enough

2466
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:10,740
that just doesn't have a much is enough
 

2467
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,730
that just doesn't have a much is enough
oomph you know when it explodes so

2468
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:13,740
oomph you know when it explodes so
 

2469
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,950
oomph you know when it explodes so
somehow there's there's less iron coming

2470
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:15,960
somehow there's there's less iron coming
 

2471
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,650
somehow there's there's less iron coming
out but at the same time then these

2472
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:18,660
out but at the same time then these
 

2473
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,530
out but at the same time then these
Stars showed huge over bonuses of carbon

2474
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:21,540
Stars showed huge over bonuses of carbon
 

2475
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,109
Stars showed huge over bonuses of carbon
you know a thousand times more carbon

2476
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:24,119
you know a thousand times more carbon
 

2477
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,750
you know a thousand times more carbon
so how do you now get a thousand times

2478
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:26,760
so how do you now get a thousand times
 

2479
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,230
so how do you now get a thousand times
more carbon out of these poor first

2480
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:29,240
more carbon out of these poor first
 

2481
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,609
more carbon out of these poor first
supernovia that was the theoretical

2482
00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:31,619
supernovia that was the theoretical
 

2483
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:33,770
supernovia that was the theoretical
Challenge and because we didn't have

2484
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:33,780
Challenge and because we didn't have
 

2485
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,309
Challenge and because we didn't have
just one star but two

2486
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:37,319

 

2487
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,770

um that really spurred the field to

2488
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:39,780
um that really spurred the field to
 

2489
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,290
um that really spurred the field to
think about what was the nature of the

2490
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:42,300
think about what was the nature of the
 

2491
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,990
think about what was the nature of the
first Stars how did they explode what

2492
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:45,000
first Stars how did they explode what
 

2493
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,849
first Stars how did they explode what
what are the implications because if

2494
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:46,859
what are the implications because if
 

2495
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,770
what are the implications because if
they are not as as luminous and bright

2496
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:48,780
they are not as as luminous and bright
 

2497
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:52,130
they are not as as luminous and bright
and energetic that has consequences for

2498
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:52,140
and energetic that has consequences for
 

2499
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:55,250
and energetic that has consequences for
for these early proto-galaxies in in

2500
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:55,260
for these early proto-galaxies in in
 

2501
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,750
for these early proto-galaxies in in
which you know they must have been

2502
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:56,760
which you know they must have been
 

2503
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,630
which you know they must have been
located in terms of you know blowing the

2504
00:49:59,630 --> 00:49:59,640
located in terms of you know blowing the
 

2505
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,670
located in terms of you know blowing the
gas out let's say and disrupting the

2506
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:01,680
gas out let's say and disrupting the
 

2507
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,790
gas out let's say and disrupting the
system so much higher chance for the the

2508
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:04,800
system so much higher chance for the the
 

2509
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,130
system so much higher chance for the the
earlier system to stay intact for longer

2510
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:07,140
earlier system to stay intact for longer
 

2511
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,349
earlier system to stay intact for longer
right so there's a whole tale of

2512
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
right so there's a whole tale of
 

2513
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,390
right so there's a whole tale of
consequences and this is what I mean

2514
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:11,400
consequences and this is what I mean
 

2515
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,609
consequences and this is what I mean
with we need to find the story because

2516
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:13,619
with we need to find the story because
 

2517
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:17,329
with we need to find the story because
you do you one thing and it's like The

2518
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:17,339
you do you one thing and it's like The
 

2519
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:19,010
you do you one thing and it's like The
Dominoes the consequences everywhere and

2520
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,020
Dominoes the consequences everywhere and
 

2521
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,510
Dominoes the consequences everywhere and
then you have a different Universe right

2522
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:20,520
then you have a different Universe right
 

2523
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,190
then you have a different Universe right
so what could possibly be a good

2524
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:22,200
so what could possibly be a good
 

2525
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,490
so what could possibly be a good
explanation for something that that

2526
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:25,500
explanation for something that that
 

2527
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,589
explanation for something that that
yields a lot of carbon and doesn't yield

2528
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:27,599
yields a lot of carbon and doesn't yield
 

2529
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,790
yields a lot of carbon and doesn't yield
a lot of iron

2530
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:28,800
a lot of iron
 

2531
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,550
a lot of iron
well it's not so much an explanation

2532
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:31,560
well it's not so much an explanation
 

2533
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,829
well it's not so much an explanation
more like finding a mechanism for what

2534
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:33,839
more like finding a mechanism for what
 

2535
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,710
more like finding a mechanism for what
happens in supernovae and the the

2536
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:36,720
happens in supernovae and the the
 

2537
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,530
happens in supernovae and the the
official term what what was sort of as I

2538
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:39,540
official term what what was sort of as I
 

2539
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,750
official term what what was sort of as I
said cooked up in order to to explain

2540
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:41,760
said cooked up in order to to explain
 

2541
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,190
said cooked up in order to to explain
the observations and we have by the way

2542
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:43,200
the observations and we have by the way
 

2543
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,930
the observations and we have by the way
found a whole bunch more of these tasks

2544
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:44,940
found a whole bunch more of these tasks
 

2545
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,510
found a whole bunch more of these tasks
so that holds and it's called a fallback

2546
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
so that holds and it's called a fallback
 

2547
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,030
so that holds and it's called a fallback
mechanism so actually in in the uh

2548
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:50,040
mechanism so actually in in the uh
 

2549
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,950
mechanism so actually in in the uh
Supernova during the Supernova explosion

2550
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:51,960
Supernova during the Supernova explosion
 

2551
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,190
Supernova during the Supernova explosion
a massive um black hole emerges and so

2552
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,200
a massive um black hole emerges and so
 

2553
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,710
a massive um black hole emerges and so
some of the material falls back onto the

2554
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:57,720
some of the material falls back onto the
 

2555
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,950
some of the material falls back onto the
black hole so here is a a vacuum cleaner

2556
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
black hole so here is a a vacuum cleaner
 

2557
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,589
black hole so here is a a vacuum cleaner
now plopped into the middle right like a

2558
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:03,599
now plopped into the middle right like a
 

2559
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,089
now plopped into the middle right like a
temporary one that just cleans up

2560
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:05,099
temporary one that just cleans up
 

2561
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:06,950
temporary one that just cleans up
somewhere sort of right because if you

2562
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:06,960
somewhere sort of right because if you
 

2563
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,329
somewhere sort of right because if you
think of the we haven't talked about

2564
00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:08,339
think of the we haven't talked about
 

2565
00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:11,089
think of the we haven't talked about
this yet but um if you if you know what

2566
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:11,099
this yet but um if you if you know what
 

2567
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:13,190
this yet but um if you if you know what
a star looks like a master star looks

2568
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:13,200
a star looks like a master star looks
 

2569
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,410
a star looks like a master star looks
like on its on its in its interior

2570
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:15,420
like on its on its in its interior
 

2571
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,569
like on its on its in its interior
before it explodes

2572
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:17,579
before it explodes
 

2573
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:19,130
before it explodes
um you have hydrogen helium still on the

2574
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:19,140
um you have hydrogen helium still on the
 

2575
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,589
um you have hydrogen helium still on the
outskirts and then you have your layers

2576
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:21,599
outskirts and then you have your layers
 

2577
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,089
outskirts and then you have your layers
of heavier and heavy elements all the

2578
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:23,099
of heavier and heavy elements all the
 

2579
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:24,829
of heavier and heavy elements all the
way up to iron so you have an iron core

2580
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:24,839
way up to iron so you have an iron core
 

2581
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:26,930
way up to iron so you have an iron core
in the center

2582
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:26,940
in the center
 

2583
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,530
in the center
um

2584
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:27,540
um
 

2585
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,109
um
and because you can't get any energy out

2586
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:30,119
and because you can't get any energy out
 

2587
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,790
and because you can't get any energy out
of iron when you want to fuse to iron

2588
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:31,800
of iron when you want to fuse to iron
 

2589
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,589
of iron when you want to fuse to iron
atoms anymore right that's when the

2590
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:33,599
atoms anymore right that's when the
 

2591
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,230
atoms anymore right that's when the
Supernova explodes what occurs really

2592
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:36,240
Supernova explodes what occurs really
 

2593
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,390
Supernova explodes what occurs really
it's actually an implosion first and

2594
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:38,400
it's actually an implosion first and
 

2595
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,569
it's actually an implosion first and
then you have a balance of of the the

2596
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:41,579
then you have a balance of of the the
 

2597
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:43,670
then you have a balance of of the the
sort of neutron star phase that that

2598
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,680
sort of neutron star phase that that
 

2599
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,890
sort of neutron star phase that that
that occurs in the process and then it's

2600
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:45,900
that occurs in the process and then it's
 

2601
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,890
that occurs in the process and then it's
so awesome gets disrupted yeah it's like

2602
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:48,900
so awesome gets disrupted yeah it's like
 

2603
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,150
so awesome gets disrupted yeah it's like
this giant you know basketball

2604
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:52,160
this giant you know basketball
 

2605
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,650
this giant you know basketball
it all goes up explosion first explosion

2606
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:54,660
it all goes up explosion first explosion
 

2607
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,290
it all goes up explosion first explosion
yeah and so in the process right if you

2608
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:57,300
yeah and so in the process right if you
 

2609
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,790
yeah and so in the process right if you
make your black hole basically big

2610
00:51:58,790 --> 00:51:58,800
make your black hole basically big
 

2611
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,950
make your black hole basically big
enough it will suck away some of the

2612
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
enough it will suck away some of the
 

2613
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,990
enough it will suck away some of the
iron because that's the closest in the

2614
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:03,000
iron because that's the closest in the
 

2615
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,230
iron because that's the closest in the
in terms of the layers you you you hold

2616
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,240
in terms of the layers you you you hold
 

2617
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,750
in terms of the layers you you you hold
on to it you don't let it escape and

2618
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:08,760
on to it you don't let it escape and
 

2619
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,390
on to it you don't let it escape and
carbon is much further out you let it

2620
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:11,400
carbon is much further out you let it
 

2621
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,010
carbon is much further out you let it
all go

2622
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:13,020
all go
 

2623
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,230
all go
and so so that explains why you can have

2624
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:15,240
and so so that explains why you can have
 

2625
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,170
and so so that explains why you can have
a big oomph and not much iron yield yes

2626
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:18,180
a big oomph and not much iron yield yes
 

2627
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,670
a big oomph and not much iron yield yes
yes so is this explain the he 1327

2628
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:22,680
yes so is this explain the he 1327
 

2629
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,089
yes so is this explain the he 1327
correct uh and others like it yes so

2630
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:26,099
correct uh and others like it yes so
 

2631
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:28,130
correct uh and others like it yes so
there's a there's a

2632
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:28,140
there's a there's a
 

2633
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,530
there's a there's a
well well established now that the lower

2634
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:30,540
well well established now that the lower
 

2635
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,170
well well established now that the lower
the iron abundance of the stars are the

2636
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:33,180
the iron abundance of the stars are the
 

2637
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,510
the iron abundance of the stars are the
higher the carbon sort of gets and

2638
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:35,520
higher the carbon sort of gets and
 

2639
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,609
higher the carbon sort of gets and
carbon is is such an interesting element

2640
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:37,619
carbon is is such an interesting element
 

2641
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,309
carbon is is such an interesting element
in that regard

2642
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
in that regard
 

2643
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,250
in that regard
if if we come back to the formation of

2644
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:43,260
if if we come back to the formation of
 

2645
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,130
if if we come back to the formation of
the first Lomas does right so we had the

2646
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:46,140
the first Lomas does right so we had the
 

2647
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,890
the first Lomas does right so we had the
the hotter gas just hydrogen helium that

2648
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:48,900
the hotter gas just hydrogen helium that
 

2649
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,630
the hotter gas just hydrogen helium that
made the first stars there were 100

2650
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:50,640
made the first stars there were 100
 

2651
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,670
made the first stars there were 100
solar masses or so because it could the

2652
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:52,680
solar masses or so because it could the
 

2653
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,130
solar masses or so because it could the
gas couldn't cool enough so they were

2654
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:55,140
gas couldn't cool enough so they were
 

2655
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,230
gas couldn't cool enough so they were
big and puffy

2656
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:57,240
big and puffy
 

2657
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,250
big and puffy
carbon then coming from the first Stars

2658
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:00,260
carbon then coming from the first Stars
 

2659
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,890
carbon then coming from the first Stars
probably led to enough Cooling in these

2660
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:03,900
probably led to enough Cooling in these
 

2661
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,589
probably led to enough Cooling in these
gas clouds that enabled the formation of

2662
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:06,599
gas clouds that enabled the formation of
 

2663
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:09,049
gas clouds that enabled the formation of
the first lawmesters

2664
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:09,059
the first lawmesters
 

2665
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:11,329
the first lawmesters
so think about what happened if there

2666
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:11,339
so think about what happened if there
 

2667
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:13,130
so think about what happened if there
wouldn't have been any carbon or the

2668
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:13,140
wouldn't have been any carbon or the
 

2669
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,870
wouldn't have been any carbon or the
properties of the carbon atom would be

2670
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:14,880
properties of the carbon atom would be
 

2671
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,790
properties of the carbon atom would be
different it would not have cooled the

2672
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:16,800
different it would not have cooled the
 

2673
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,150
different it would not have cooled the
gas in such significant ways perhaps

2674
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,160
gas in such significant ways perhaps
 

2675
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,450
gas in such significant ways perhaps
there wouldn't be any lawmaster

2676
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:23,460
there wouldn't be any lawmaster
 

2677
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,970
there wouldn't be any lawmaster
we wouldn't be here today right and

2678
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:25,980
we wouldn't be here today right and
 

2679
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,430
we wouldn't be here today right and
we're carbon based and so I think carbon

2680
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:28,440
we're carbon based and so I think carbon
 

2681
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,170
we're carbon based and so I think carbon
is really the most important element in

2682
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:30,180
is really the most important element in
 

2683
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,609
is really the most important element in
the universe for for a variety of

2684
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:31,619
the universe for for a variety of
 

2685
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:34,309
the universe for for a variety of
reasons because it is just enabled this

2686
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:34,319
reasons because it is just enabled this
 

2687
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,809
reasons because it is just enabled this
whole Evolution that that we're now

2688
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:35,819
whole Evolution that that we're now
 

2689
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:37,910
whole Evolution that that we're now
observing and literally seeing in the

2690
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,920
observing and literally seeing in the
 

2691
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,690
observing and literally seeing in the
sky

2692
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:38,700
sky
 

2693
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,970
sky
and it's really fascinating so combined

2694
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:40,980
and it's really fascinating so combined
 

2695
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,170
and it's really fascinating so combined
with the fact that you have the iron

2696
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:42,180
with the fact that you have the iron
 

2697
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,970
with the fact that you have the iron
deficient so all of that is probably

2698
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:43,980
deficient so all of that is probably
 

2699
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,309
deficient so all of that is probably
important to creating

2700
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
important to creating
 

2701
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,890
important to creating
humans yeah yeah we need all the

2702
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:48,900
humans yeah yeah we need all the
 

2703
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,349
humans yeah yeah we need all the
elements but if you don't have stars you

2704
00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:51,359
elements but if you don't have stars you
 

2705
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,450
elements but if you don't have stars you
know like the sun small stars that can

2706
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:53,460
know like the sun small stars that can
 

2707
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,609
know like the sun small stars that can
actually host planets that have long

2708
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:55,619
actually host planets that have long
 

2709
00:53:55,619 --> 00:53:57,530
actually host planets that have long
lifetimes you need long long lifetimes

2710
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:57,540
lifetimes you need long long lifetimes
 

2711
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,870
lifetimes you need long long lifetimes
if you want to have a stable planet

2712
00:53:59,870 --> 00:53:59,880
if you want to have a stable planet
 

2713
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,630
if you want to have a stable planet
and and develop humans and carbon is

2714
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640
and and develop humans and carbon is
 

2715
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,930
and and develop humans and carbon is
kind of important in many ways yes yes

2716
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:05,940
kind of important in many ways yes yes
 

2717
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,690
kind of important in many ways yes yes
this is perhaps a

2718
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:08,700
this is perhaps a
 

2719
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,490
this is perhaps a
interesting tangent if I could just

2720
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:10,500
interesting tangent if I could just
 

2721
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,950
interesting tangent if I could just
mention that you interviewed a Mildred

2722
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960
mention that you interviewed a Mildred
 

2723
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,349
mention that you interviewed a Mildred

2729
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,990
Pioneer
um is there something you could say

2730
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,000
um is there something you could say
 

2731
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,609
um is there something you could say
about the magic of carbon and the magic

2732
00:54:22,609 --> 00:54:22,619
about the magic of carbon and the magic
 

2733
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:25,089
about the magic of carbon and the magic
of Millie

2734
00:54:25,089 --> 00:54:25,099
of Millie
 

2735
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:27,970
of Millie
well Millie was certainly magic

2736
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:27,980
well Millie was certainly magic
 

2737
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,589
well Millie was certainly magic
she was a professor at MIT for many

2738
00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:30,599
she was a professor at MIT for many
 

2739
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:34,370
she was a professor at MIT for many
decades I I met her a number of times

2740
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:34,380
decades I I met her a number of times
 

2741
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,670

older Millie is still on the wall every

2744
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:39,780
older Millie is still on the wall every
 

2745
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,410
older Millie is still on the wall every
time I step out of the elevator in one

2746
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:42,420
time I step out of the elevator in one
 

2747
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,329
time I step out of the elevator in one
of the buildings I see it

2748
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:44,339
of the buildings I see it
 

2749
00:54:44,339 --> 00:54:47,990
of the buildings I see it
um she pioneered all sorts of carbon

2750
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
um she pioneered all sorts of carbon
 

2751
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,770
um she pioneered all sorts of carbon
um Nano work so she is a was a material

2752
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:51,780
um Nano work so she is a was a material

scientist
 

2755
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,270
scientist
um very far removed from what I do on a

2756
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:56,280
um very far removed from what I do on a
 

2757
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,069
um very far removed from what I do on a
daily basis

2758
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:58,079
daily basis
 

2759
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,650
daily basis
um but yes carbon has amazing properties

2760
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:00,660
um but yes carbon has amazing properties
 

2761
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,990
um but yes carbon has amazing properties
when you study it and again that's

2762
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:03,000
when you study it and again that's
 

2763
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,109
when you study it and again that's
indeed another aspect of why carbon is

2764
00:55:06,109 --> 00:55:06,119
indeed another aspect of why carbon is
 

2765
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:08,329
indeed another aspect of why carbon is
so fascinating

2766
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:08,339
so fascinating
 

2767
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:11,030
so fascinating
um not just in in the cosmos but also

2768
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
um not just in in the cosmos but also
 

2769
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,329
um not just in in the cosmos but also
for us you know making us creating us um

2770
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:14,339
for us you know making us creating us um
 

2771
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:17,569
for us you know making us creating us um
in the way that we can use it

2772
00:55:17,569 --> 00:55:17,579
in the way that we can use it
 

2773
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:19,670
in the way that we can use it
um it's wonderful you sometimes think

2774
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
um it's wonderful you sometimes think
 

2775
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,650
um it's wonderful you sometimes think
about this chemical evolution

2776
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:21,660
about this chemical evolution
 

2777
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,790
about this chemical evolution
in this big philosophical way that we're

2778
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:25,800
in this big philosophical way that we're
 

2779
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,470
in this big philosophical way that we're
we're the results of that chemical

2780
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:27,480
we're the results of that chemical
 

2781
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,910
we're the results of that chemical
Evolution like we're made of this stuff

2782
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:28,920
Evolution like we're made of this stuff
 

2783
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,609
Evolution like we're made of this stuff
like we're made of carbon yes we're made

2784
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:31,619
like we're made of carbon yes we're made
 

2785
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:35,210
like we're made of carbon yes we're made
of sore stuff yeah and it can go right I

2786
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:35,220
of sore stuff yeah and it can go right I
 

2787
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,829
of sore stuff yeah and it can go right I
mean it's almost like a cliche statement

2788
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:36,839
mean it's almost like a cliche statement
 

2789
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:41,089
mean it's almost like a cliche statement
but it's uh it's also uh a materials a

2790
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:41,099
but it's uh it's also uh a materials a
 

2791
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,670
but it's uh it's also uh a materials a
chemical a physics statement so it came

2792
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
chemical a physics statement so it came
 

2793
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,770
chemical a physics statement so it came
from hydrogen and helium

2794
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:45,780
from hydrogen and helium
 

2795
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,809
from hydrogen and helium
and somehow this formation has created

2796
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:47,819
and somehow this formation has created
 

2797
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:49,670
and somehow this formation has created
these this interesting complexity of

2798
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
these this interesting complexity of
 

2799
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,190
these this interesting complexity of
soup that made us

2800
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:52,200
soup that made us
 

2801
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,589
soup that made us
what are we supposed to make of that

2802
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:54,599
what are we supposed to make of that
 

2803
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,270
what are we supposed to make of that
like what did we just get really lucky

2804
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:56,280
like what did we just get really lucky
 

2805
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,630
like what did we just get really lucky
why why do we get all this cool stuff

2806
00:55:59,630 --> 00:55:59,640
why why do we get all this cool stuff
 

2807
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,690
why why do we get all this cool stuff
yeah that's that's a good question I

2808
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:02,700
yeah that's that's a good question I
 

2809
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,950
yeah that's that's a good question I
don't think it's a question as an answer

2810
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:03,960
don't think it's a question as an answer
 

2811
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,710
don't think it's a question as an answer
I keep just asking why no but it's uh

2812
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:06,720
I keep just asking why no but it's uh
 

2813
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,410
I keep just asking why no but it's uh
it's just this incredible mystery so

2814
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:09,420
it's just this incredible mystery so
 

2815
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,329
it's just this incredible mystery so
much cool stuff had to happen

2816
00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:11,339
much cool stuff had to happen
 

2817
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:14,170
much cool stuff had to happen
so much sorry Hot Stuff had to happen

2818
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:14,180
so much sorry Hot Stuff had to happen
 

2819
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,730
so much sorry Hot Stuff had to happen
right and and so much could have gone

2820
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:16,740
right and and so much could have gone
 

2821
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,650
right and and so much could have gone
wrong and there would have been another

2822
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:18,660
wrong and there would have been another
 

2823
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,049
wrong and there would have been another
outcome you know and it's actually

2824
00:56:21,049 --> 00:56:21,059
outcome you know and it's actually
 

2825
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:23,210
outcome you know and it's actually
amazing how how many things kind of fell

2826
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:23,220
amazing how how many things kind of fell
 

2827
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:27,069
amazing how how many things kind of fell
in place I mean maybe that's all sort of

2828
00:56:27,069 --> 00:56:27,079
in place I mean maybe that's all sort of
 

2829
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:29,150
in place I mean maybe that's all sort of
self-deterministic in some ways right we

2830
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:29,160
self-deterministic in some ways right we
 

2831
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,549
self-deterministic in some ways right we
are who we are because that that was the

2832
00:56:31,549 --> 00:56:31,559
are who we are because that that was the
 

2833
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,250
are who we are because that that was the
path maybe we would have ended up being

2834
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:34,260
path maybe we would have ended up being
 

2835
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,349
path maybe we would have ended up being
robots I don't know

2836
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:36,359
robots I don't know
 

2837
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,690
robots I don't know
um but it's it's it's certainly

2838
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:38,700
um but it's it's it's certainly
 

2839
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,370
um but it's it's it's certainly
wonderful to

2840
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:40,380
wonderful to
 

2841
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,470
wonderful to
you know a scientists for us to to help

2842
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:42,480
you know a scientists for us to to help
 

2843
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,290
you know a scientists for us to to help
contribute unraveling our our Cosmic

2844
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:45,300
contribute unraveling our our Cosmic
 

2845
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,410
contribute unraveling our our Cosmic
history right I always say the

2846
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:48,420
history right I always say the
 

2847
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,530
history right I always say the
biological evolution on Earth was

2848
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:51,540
biological evolution on Earth was
 

2849
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,690
biological evolution on Earth was
you know absolutely facilitated by the

2850
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:53,700
you know absolutely facilitated by the
 

2851
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,190
you know absolutely facilitated by the
chemical evolution of the universe right

2852
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,200
chemical evolution of the universe right
 

2853
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,010
chemical evolution of the universe right
and one doesn't go without the other in

2854
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:58,020
and one doesn't go without the other in
 

2855
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,750
and one doesn't go without the other in
that Evolution from a human perspective

2856
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
that Evolution from a human perspective
 

2857
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,270
that Evolution from a human perspective
that Evolution seems to be creating more

2858
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:02,280
that Evolution seems to be creating more
 

2859
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,250
that Evolution seems to be creating more
and more complexity the kind of

2860
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:04,260
and more complexity the kind of
 

2861
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,069
and more complexity the kind of
interesting clumping of cool stuff

2862
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:07,079
interesting clumping of cool stuff
 

2863
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:10,370
interesting clumping of cool stuff
seems to be accelerating and increasing

2864
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:10,380
seems to be accelerating and increasing
 

2865
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,609
seems to be accelerating and increasing
it it's hard not to see as humans that

2866
00:57:13,609 --> 00:57:13,619
it it's hard not to see as humans that
 

2867
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:15,349
it it's hard not to see as humans that
there's some kind of purpose to it like

2868
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:15,359
there's some kind of purpose to it like
 

2869
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,049
there's some kind of purpose to it like
a momentum towards complexity and Beauty

2870
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:18,059
a momentum towards complexity and Beauty
 

2871
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,089
a momentum towards complexity and Beauty
you know

2872
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:20,099
you know
 

2873
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:23,170
you know
well Beauty's in the eye of the beholder

2874
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:23,180
well Beauty's in the eye of the beholder
 

2875
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,670
well Beauty's in the eye of the beholder
but yes everything gets more complicated

2876
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:25,680
but yes everything gets more complicated
 

2877
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,829
but yes everything gets more complicated
but there's also a beauty to the the

2878
00:57:27,829 --> 00:57:27,839
but there's also a beauty to the the
 

2879
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,450
but there's also a beauty to the the
chemically pristine Universe in the

2880
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:29,460
chemically pristine Universe in the
 

2881
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,150
chemically pristine Universe in the
early days

2882
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:31,160
early days
 

2883
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,430
early days
yes yes I love the desert it's

2884
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:34,440
yes yes I love the desert it's
 

2885
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,890
yes yes I love the desert it's
nothingness yeah that it has so much

2886
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:36,900
nothingness yeah that it has so much
 

2887
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:39,890
nothingness yeah that it has so much
Aesthetics and appeal we came from

2888
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:39,900
Aesthetics and appeal we came from
 

2889
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,049
Aesthetics and appeal we came from
nothing will return to nothing so what

2890
00:57:42,049 --> 00:57:42,059
nothing will return to nothing so what
 

2891
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,569
nothing will return to nothing so what
about he 1523

2892
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:44,579
about he 1523
 

2893
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:48,470
about he 1523
what's exciting a red a red giant star

2894
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:48,480
what's exciting a red a red giant star
 

2895
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,910
what's exciting a red a red giant star
yes

2896
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:49,920
yes
 

2897
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,510
yes
uh that's another one of your babies yes

2898
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:52,520
uh that's another one of your babies yes
 

2899
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,970
uh that's another one of your babies yes
13.2 billion years old

2900
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:55,980
13.2 billion years old
 

2901
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,670
13.2 billion years old
um yeah um so that one isn't quite as

2902
00:57:58,670 --> 00:57:58,680
um yeah um so that one isn't quite as
 

2903
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,349
um yeah um so that one isn't quite as
iron deficient as the other one so

2904
00:58:00,349 --> 00:58:00,359
iron deficient as the other one so
 

2905
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:02,210
iron deficient as the other one so
probably not a second generation star

2906
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:02,220
probably not a second generation star
 

2907
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,690
probably not a second generation star
but easily second third sorry third

2908
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:05,700
but easily second third sorry third
 

2909
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,790
but easily second third sorry third
fourth fifth or so we we can't really

2910
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:07,800
fourth fifth or so we we can't really
 

2911
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,790
fourth fifth or so we we can't really
pin it down but that's also not super

2912
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:10,800
pin it down but that's also not super
 

2913
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,609
pin it down but that's also not super
important for us what what is important

2914
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:13,619
important for us what what is important
 

2915
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:17,450
important for us what what is important
is that that star has a very different

2916
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:17,460
is that that star has a very different
 

2917
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,970
is that that star has a very different
chemical composition in a sense that yes

2918
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:19,980
chemical composition in a sense that yes
 

2919
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,530
chemical composition in a sense that yes
we have all the elements up to iron

2920
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:21,540
we have all the elements up to iron
 

2921
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,490
we have all the elements up to iron
there

2922
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:22,500
there
 

2923
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,329
there
they have sort of normal

2924
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:25,339
they have sort of normal
 

2925
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:30,049
they have sort of normal
ratios uh which means kind of the same

2926
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:30,059
ratios uh which means kind of the same
 

2927
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:32,630
ratios uh which means kind of the same
as most other old stars and not too

2928
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:32,640
as most other old stars and not too
 

2929
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,430
as most other old stars and not too
different from the Sun or at least you

2930
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:34,440
different from the Sun or at least you
 

2931
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,450
different from the Sun or at least you
know different in quantifiable ways

2932
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:38,460

 

2933
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,990

um but it has this huge overload of very

2934
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:42,000
um but it has this huge overload of very
 

2935
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,549
um but it has this huge overload of very
heavy elements

2936
00:58:43,549 --> 00:58:43,559
heavy elements
 

2937
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,410
heavy elements
and what was so nice about that stone

2938
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:45,420
and what was so nice about that stone
 

2939
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,569
and what was so nice about that stone
particular was that I could measure the

2940
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:47,579
particular was that I could measure the
 

2941
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:50,329
particular was that I could measure the
thorium and the uranium abundance

2942
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:50,339
thorium and the uranium abundance
 

2943
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:53,630
thorium and the uranium abundance
and again that was the second of its

2944
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:53,640
and again that was the second of its
 

2945
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,710
and again that was the second of its
kind

2946
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:54,720
kind
 

2947
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:58,130
kind
um but the uranium abundance was could

2948
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:58,140
um but the uranium abundance was could
 

2949
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,349
um but the uranium abundance was could
be more well determined so we had a

2950
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:00,359
be more well determined so we had a
 

2951
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:02,450
be more well determined so we had a
better grasp on that now why arthurium

2952
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:02,460
better grasp on that now why arthurium
 

2953
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,730
better grasp on that now why arthurium
and uranium interesting

2954
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:04,740
and uranium interesting
 

2955
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:08,750
and uranium interesting
um they are radioactive elements they

2956
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:08,760
um they are radioactive elements they
 

2957
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,470
um they are radioactive elements they
have they Decay thorium has a half-life

2958
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:12,480
have they Decay thorium has a half-life
 

2959
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,109
have they Decay thorium has a half-life
of 14 billion years I believe and

2960
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:15,119
of 14 billion years I believe and
 

2961
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,410
of 14 billion years I believe and
uranium of 4.7

2962
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:18,420
uranium of 4.7
 

2963
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,750
uranium of 4.7
which uh you know to focus on us on

2964
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:20,760
which uh you know to focus on us on
 

2965
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,690
which uh you know to focus on us on
Earth is a really long time but those

2966
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:23,700
Earth is a really long time but those
 

2967
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,730
Earth is a really long time but those
kind of timelines are really good when

2968
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:25,740
kind of timelines are really good when
 

2969
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,450
kind of timelines are really good when
you want to explore the early universe

2970
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:29,460
you want to explore the early universe
 

2971
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:30,770
you want to explore the early universe
so

2972
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:30,780
so
 

2973
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,809
so
there are two questions now that that

2974
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:32,819
there are two questions now that that
 

2975
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,609
there are two questions now that that
kind of come to mind

2976
00:59:34,609 --> 00:59:34,619
kind of come to mind
 

2977
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:37,609
kind of come to mind
where do these elements come from and

2978
00:59:37,609 --> 00:59:37,619
where do these elements come from and
 

2979
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:40,849
where do these elements come from and
what what do they tell us right and um

2980
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:40,859
what what do they tell us right and um
 

2981
00:59:40,859 --> 00:59:42,910
what what do they tell us right and um
these as we know

2982
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:42,920
these as we know
 

2983
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:45,530
these as we know
these heavy elements are made in a

2984
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:45,540
these heavy elements are made in a
 

2985
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,809
these heavy elements are made in a
specific process it's a neutron capture

2986
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:47,819
specific process it's a neutron capture
 

2987
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:50,630
specific process it's a neutron capture
process usually referred to as the r

2988
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:50,640
process usually referred to as the r
 

2989
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,970
process usually referred to as the r
process for Rapid Neutron capture

2990
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:52,980
process for Rapid Neutron capture
 

2991
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,490
process for Rapid Neutron capture
process we talked about seed nuclei

2992
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:55,500
process we talked about seed nuclei
 

2993
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,670
process we talked about seed nuclei
before right so we still don't exactly

2994
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:58,680
before right so we still don't exactly
 

2995
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:01,309
before right so we still don't exactly
know where this process can occur so you

2996
01:00:01,309 --> 01:00:01,319
know where this process can occur so you
 

2997
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:03,710
know where this process can occur so you
have let's say a lone iron atom

2998
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:03,720
have let's say a lone iron atom
 

2999
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,010
have let's say a lone iron atom
somewhere and it it is in an environment

3000
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:07,020
somewhere and it it is in an environment
 

3001
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,530
somewhere and it it is in an environment
where you have a strong Neutron flux

3002
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:09,540
where you have a strong Neutron flux
 

3003
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,569
where you have a strong Neutron flux
which means there must be lots of

3004
01:00:11,569 --> 01:00:11,579
which means there must be lots of
 

3005
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:13,309
which means there must be lots of
neutrons around and again when we talk

3006
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:13,319
neutrons around and again when we talk
 

3007
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,829
neutrons around and again when we talk
about the side we can summarize and

3008
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:15,839
about the side we can summarize and
 

3009
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,930
about the side we can summarize and
Ponder where where that might be the

3010
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:17,940
Ponder where where that might be the
 

3011
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,890
Ponder where where that might be the
case

3012
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:18,900
case
 

3013
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,569
case
um but you have this iron atom and you

3014
01:00:20,569 --> 01:00:20,579
um but you have this iron atom and you
 

3015
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:22,609
um but you have this iron atom and you
bombard it with neutrons and you do it

3016
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:22,619
bombard it with neutrons and you do it
 

3017
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,250
bombard it with neutrons and you do it
incredibly fast now what happens in the

3018
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:25,260
incredibly fast now what happens in the
 

3019
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:28,309
incredibly fast now what happens in the
process that iron atom you know you

3020
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:28,319
process that iron atom you know you
 

3021
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,049
process that iron atom you know you
collect lots of neutrons it becomes

3022
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:30,059
collect lots of neutrons it becomes
 

3023
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,589
collect lots of neutrons it becomes
really big and unstable so it's a heavy

3024
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:33,599
really big and unstable so it's a heavy
 

3025
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,870
really big and unstable so it's a heavy
Neutron Rich nucleus

3026
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:35,880
Neutron Rich nucleus
 

3027
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,690
Neutron Rich nucleus
that wants to Decay

3028
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:37,700
that wants to Decay
 

3029
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,150
that wants to Decay
because it's not stable it's way too big

3030
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:41,160
because it's not stable it's way too big
 

3031
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,990
because it's not stable it's way too big
um and so let's say you add only one

3032
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:45,000
um and so let's say you add only one
 

3033
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,970
um and so let's say you add only one
Neutron to it that would already make it

3034
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:46,980
Neutron to it that would already make it
 

3035
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,609
Neutron to it that would already make it
unstable so it will then it has a

3036
01:00:49,609 --> 01:00:49,619
unstable so it will then it has a
 

3037
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:51,230
unstable so it will then it has a
characteristic Decay time that's called

3038
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:51,240
characteristic Decay time that's called
 

3039
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,109
characteristic Decay time that's called
the beta Decay time scale so it will

3040
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:54,119
the beta Decay time scale so it will
 

3041
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:56,210
the beta Decay time scale so it will
Decay to a stable nucleus so the neutron

3042
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:56,220
Decay to a stable nucleus so the neutron
 

3043
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,130
Decay to a stable nucleus so the neutron
will convert to a proton and that makes

3044
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:58,140
will convert to a proton and that makes
 

3045
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:00,049
will convert to a proton and that makes
it stable

3046
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:00,059
it stable
 

3047
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:02,990
it stable
if you know bombard lots and lots and

3048
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:03,000
if you know bombard lots and lots and
 

3049
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,150
if you know bombard lots and lots and
lots of neutrons onto that seed nucleus

3050
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:05,160
lots of neutrons onto that seed nucleus
 

3051
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,910
lots of neutrons onto that seed nucleus
within that time scale of the beta Decay

3052
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:07,920
within that time scale of the beta Decay
 

3053
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,549
within that time scale of the beta Decay
that's how you get to this huge fat

3054
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:10,559
that's how you get to this huge fat
 

3055
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,150
that's how you get to this huge fat
Neutron Rich nucleus that then wants to

3056
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
Neutron Rich nucleus that then wants to
 

3057
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,730
Neutron Rich nucleus that then wants to
Decay right so the r the rapid process

3058
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:16,740
Decay right so the r the rapid process
 

3059
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,410
Decay right so the r the rapid process
is you have your seed nuclear they get

3060
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:18,420
is you have your seed nuclear they get
 

3061
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,690
is you have your seed nuclear they get
bombarded you create these these really

3062
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:20,700
bombarded you create these these really
 

3063
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,789
bombarded you create these these really
heavy Neutron Rich nuclei

3064
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
heavy Neutron Rich nuclei
 

3065
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:25,549
heavy Neutron Rich nuclei
they are heavier than uranium even

3066
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:25,559
they are heavier than uranium even
 

3067
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:27,950
they are heavier than uranium even
the neutron flux stops and then all

3068
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:27,960
the neutron flux stops and then all
 

3069
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,849
the neutron flux stops and then all
these heavy nuclei they Decay and they

3070
01:01:31,849 --> 01:01:31,859
these heavy nuclei they Decay and they
 

3071
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:35,750
these heavy nuclei they Decay and they
make all these stable isotopes that we

3072
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:35,760
make all these stable isotopes that we
 

3073
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,609
make all these stable isotopes that we
know of all the way up to thorum and

3074
01:01:37,609 --> 01:01:37,619
know of all the way up to thorum and
 

3075
01:01:37,619 --> 01:01:39,230
know of all the way up to thorum and
uranium

3076
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:39,240
uranium
 

3077
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,230
uranium
so that rapid nuclei Decay is what

3078
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240
so that rapid nuclei Decay is what
 

3079
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,549
so that rapid nuclei Decay is what
creates all the functions correct and

3080
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:43,559
creates all the functions correct and
 

3081
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:45,950
creates all the functions correct and
the whole thing is done within two

3082
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:45,960
the whole thing is done within two
 

3083
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,589
the whole thing is done within two
seconds

3084
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:47,599
seconds
 

3085
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,289

so just to add to the rapid here

3086
01:01:51,289 --> 01:01:51,299
so just to add to the rapid here
 

3087

it's it's all there in my talks I often
 

3091
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,089
it's it's all there in my talks I often
I have this nice simulation that that

3092
01:01:59,089 --> 01:01:59,099
I have this nice simulation that that
 

3093
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:00,410
I have this nice simulation that that

01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:02,160
um you know this this creation of these
 

3097
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,569
um you know this this creation of these
rap of these heavy neutral nuclei and I

3098
01:02:05,569 --> 01:02:05,579
rap of these heavy neutral nuclei and I
 

3099
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:07,670
rap of these heavy neutral nuclei and I
always say this is the only simulation

3100
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:07,680
always say this is the only simulation
 

3101
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,410
always say this is the only simulation
you will ever see that's slower than

years in 30 seconds
 

3111
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,210
years in 30 seconds
really short right this is the opposite

3112
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:20,220
really short right this is the opposite
 

3113
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,309
really short right this is the opposite
me showing you this the element is

3114
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:22,319
me showing you this the element is
 

3115
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:25,370
me showing you this the element is
already long long made so where and when

3116
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:25,380
already long long made so where and when
 

3117
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,410
already long long made so where and when
does this happen does this process so

3118
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:27,420
does this happen does this process so
 

3119
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:31,190
does this happen does this process so
you need the strong Neutron flux

3120
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:31,200
you need the strong Neutron flux
 

3121
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,130
you need the strong Neutron flux
the clumping of the the neutrons yes

3122
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:34,140
the clumping of the the neutrons yes
 

3123
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,109
the clumping of the the neutrons yes
that's right and so there are not that

3124
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:36,119
that's right and so there are not that
 

3125
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,510
that's right and so there are not that
many options right so where do you find

3126
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:38,520
many options right so where do you find
 

3127
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,430
many options right so where do you find
lots of neutrons in the universe so it's

3128
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:40,440
lots of neutrons in the universe so it's
 

3129
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:44,210
lots of neutrons in the universe so it's
neutron stars right neutron stars form

3130
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:44,220
neutron stars right neutron stars form
 

3131
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,089
neutron stars right neutron stars form
in the making of supernovae of the

3132
01:02:47,089 --> 01:02:47,099
in the making of supernovae of the
 

3133
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:48,170
in the making of supernovae of the
explosions

3134
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:48,180
explosions
 

3135
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,329
explosions
okay so maybe some of this heavy

3136
01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:50,339
okay so maybe some of this heavy
 

3137
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:52,069
okay so maybe some of this heavy
material gets sort of made in the making

3138
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:52,079
material gets sort of made in the making
 

3139
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:54,109
material gets sort of made in the making
of the Supernova explosion and then gets

3140
01:02:54,109 --> 01:02:54,119
of the Supernova explosion and then gets
 

3141
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:55,789
of the Supernova explosion and then gets
expelled

3142
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:55,799
expelled
 

3143
01:02:55,799 --> 01:02:59,569
expelled
or you have neutron stars so the you

3144
01:02:59,569 --> 01:02:59,579
or you have neutron stars so the you
 

3145
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:02,150
or you have neutron stars so the you
know if the neutron star survive I mean

3146
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,160
know if the neutron star survive I mean
 

3147
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,650
know if the neutron star survive I mean
usually that's the leftover of the

3148
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:03,660
usually that's the leftover of the
 

3149
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,349
usually that's the leftover of the
Supernova if you have two from a binary

3150
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:06,359
Supernova if you have two from a binary
 

3151
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:08,690
Supernova if you have two from a binary
pair so Stars usually actually show up

3152
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:08,700
pair so Stars usually actually show up
 

3153
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:13,010
pair so Stars usually actually show up
in pairs and so it's not too unusual to

3154
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:13,020
in pairs and so it's not too unusual to
 

3155
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,490
in pairs and so it's not too unusual to
um create a pair of of neutron stars

3156
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:16,500
um create a pair of of neutron stars
 

3157
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,049
um create a pair of of neutron stars
that will still orbit each other after

3158
01:03:18,049 --> 01:03:18,059
that will still orbit each other after
 

3159
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:19,670
that will still orbit each other after
both of their progenitor Styles have

01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:20,880
exploded
 

3163
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,390
exploded
and those two Neutron cells will orbit

3164
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:23,400
and those two Neutron cells will orbit
 

3165
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,750
and those two Neutron cells will orbit
each other diligently but as we know now

3166
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:26,760

01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,530
Observatory
ah I mean we know already that

3172
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:33,540
ah I mean we know already that
 

3173
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,450
ah I mean we know already that
before but now it's been measured by

3174
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:35,460
before but now it's been measured by
 

3175
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:38,750
before but now it's been measured by
ligo is that these two neutron stars

3176
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:38,760
ligo is that these two neutron stars
 

3177
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,950
ligo is that these two neutron stars
they will orbit each other for like

3178
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:39,960
they will orbit each other for like
 

3179
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,230
they will orbit each other for like
forever but in the process they will

3180
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
forever but in the process they will
 

3181
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,230
forever but in the process they will
they will lose energy so that that orbit

3182
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:45,240
they will lose energy so that that orbit
 

3183
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,569
they will lose energy so that that orbit
is what we call the orbit decays and

3184
01:03:47,569 --> 01:03:47,579
is what we call the orbit decays and
 

3185
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:50,270
is what we call the orbit decays and
eventually the two Neutron cells will

3186
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:50,280
eventually the two Neutron cells will
 

3187
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,809
eventually the two Neutron cells will
merge and that results in a in an

3188
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:53,819
merge and that results in a in an
 

3189
01:03:53,819 --> 01:03:55,970
merge and that results in a in an
explosive event that has roughly the

3190
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:55,980
explosive event that has roughly the
 

3191
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,510
explosive event that has roughly the
energy of a supernova but uh the process

3192
01:03:59,510 --> 01:03:59,520
energy of a supernova but uh the process
 

3193
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,609
energy of a supernova but uh the process
is completely different and the cool

3194
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:01,619
is completely different and the cool
 

3195
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:04,309
is completely different and the cool
thing is when these two neutron stars

3196
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:04,319
thing is when these two neutron stars
 

3197
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,829
thing is when these two neutron stars
collide they produce a gravitational

3198
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:06,839
collide they produce a gravitational
 

3199
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:09,710
collide they produce a gravitational
wave signature because neutron stars are

3200
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:09,720
wave signature because neutron stars are
 

3201
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,890
wave signature because neutron stars are
super dense objects they are like giant

3202
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:12,900
super dense objects they are like giant
 

3203
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,470
super dense objects they are like giant
atomic nucleuses so there's a lot of

3204
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:15,480
atomic nucleuses so there's a lot of
 

3205
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,970
atomic nucleuses so there's a lot of
interesting physics happening already

3206
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:16,980
interesting physics happening already
 

3207
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:19,430
interesting physics happening already
and so if you basically form a super

3208
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
and so if you basically form a super
 

3209
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,970
and so if you basically form a super
neutron star by Smashing two into each

3210
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:22,980
neutron star by Smashing two into each
 

3211
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,829
neutron star by Smashing two into each
other

3212
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:23,839
other
 

3213
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,630
other
uh more interesting physics happens and

3214
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:26,640
uh more interesting physics happens and
 

3215
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,750
uh more interesting physics happens and
that means that there's this Ripple sent

3216
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:29,760
that means that there's this Ripple sent
 

3217
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,990
that means that there's this Ripple sent
out you know into the space uh the you

3218
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:33,000
out you know into the space uh the you
 

3219
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,730
out you know into the space uh the you
know the space-time Continuum basically

3220
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:34,740
know the space-time Continuum basically
 

3221
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,190
know the space-time Continuum basically
you know the what do people say the the

3222
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:37,200
you know the what do people say the the
 

3223
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,809
you know the what do people say the the
ripples of space time you know it's like

3224
01:04:38,809 --> 01:04:38,819
ripples of space time you know it's like
 

3225
01:04:38,819 --> 01:04:41,270
ripples of space time you know it's like
yes it's like you drop a rock into water

3226
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:41,280
yes it's like you drop a rock into water
 

3227
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,250
yes it's like you drop a rock into water
right you see the waves coming so that's

3228
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:43,260
right you see the waves coming so that's
 

3229
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,049
right you see the waves coming so that's
exactly what happens when two two

3230
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:45,059
exactly what happens when two two
 

3231
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:48,650
exactly what happens when two two
neutron stars emerge and this is

3232
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:48,660
neutron stars emerge and this is
 

3233
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:50,510
neutron stars emerge and this is
Neutron's Galore right it's really

3234
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:50,520
Neutron's Galore right it's really
 

3235
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,210
Neutron's Galore right it's really
violent to smash two neutron stars you

3236
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:53,220
violent to smash two neutron stars you
 

3237
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,069
violent to smash two neutron stars you
know so that are so dense already into

3238
01:04:55,069 --> 01:04:55,079
know so that are so dense already into
 

3239
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:56,329
know so that are so dense already into
each other

3240
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:56,339
each other
 

3241
01:04:56,339 --> 01:05:01,789
each other
and um they in in 2017 one of these

3242
01:05:01,789 --> 01:05:01,799
and um they in in 2017 one of these
 

3243
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:04,849
and um they in in 2017 one of these
events occurred and the ligo and Virgo

3244
01:05:04,849 --> 01:05:04,859
events occurred and the ligo and Virgo
 

3245
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,849
events occurred and the ligo and Virgo
gravitational wave observatories they

3246
01:05:06,849 --> 01:05:06,859
gravitational wave observatories they
 

3247
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:09,530
gravitational wave observatories they
detected that and then the astronomers

3248
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:09,540
detected that and then the astronomers
 

3249
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,270
detected that and then the astronomers
pointed their telescopes in that

3250
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:11,280
pointed their telescopes in that
 

3251
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,970
pointed their telescopes in that
direction and they indeed observed what

3252
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:13,980
direction and they indeed observed what
 

3253
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,890
direction and they indeed observed what
we call the electromagnetic counterpart

3254
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:15,900
we call the electromagnetic counterpart
 

3255
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,730
we call the electromagnetic counterpart
so there was something seen in the sky

3256
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:18,740
so there was something seen in the sky
 

3257
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:22,789
so there was something seen in the sky
that faded over the course of two weeks

3258
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
that faded over the course of two weeks
 

3259
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,510
that faded over the course of two weeks
and that's light curve that light was

3260
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:26,520
and that's light curve that light was
 

3261
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,770
and that's light curve that light was
exactly

3262
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:27,780
exactly
 

3263
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:31,370
exactly
what you get when you create all these

3264
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:31,380
what you get when you create all these
 

3265
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:33,530
what you get when you create all these
heavy Neutron Rich nuclei in the r

3266
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:33,540
heavy Neutron Rich nuclei in the r
 

3267
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:36,170
heavy Neutron Rich nuclei in the r
process and then the neutron flux stops

3268
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:36,180
process and then the neutron flux stops
 

3269
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,970
process and then the neutron flux stops
and then it takes about two or three

3270
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:37,980
and then it takes about two or three
 

3271
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,490
and then it takes about two or three
weeks for most of them of these nuclear

3272
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:40,500
weeks for most of them of these nuclear
 

3273
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,670
weeks for most of them of these nuclear
2 DK2 stability

3274
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:42,680
2 DK2 stability
 

3275
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,890
2 DK2 stability
so we saw the astronomer saw in this

3276
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:45,900
so we saw the astronomer saw in this
 

3277
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,950
so we saw the astronomer saw in this
electromagnetic counterpart

3278
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:47,960
electromagnetic counterpart
 

3279
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:52,010
electromagnetic counterpart
the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements

3280
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:52,020
the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements
 

3281
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,510
the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements
occurring

3282
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:53,520
occurring
 

3283
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,609
occurring
and that's that's just that's amazing

3284
01:05:55,609 --> 01:05:55,619
and that's that's just that's amazing
 

3285
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,010
and that's that's just that's amazing
awesome so that's so awesome that's

3286
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:58,020
awesome so that's so awesome that's
 

3287
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,630
awesome so that's so awesome that's
electromagnetic counterpart to the

3288
01:05:59,630 --> 01:05:59,640
electromagnetic counterpart to the
 

3289
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,130
electromagnetic counterpart to the
gravitational waves that were detected

3290
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:01,140
gravitational waves that were detected
 

3291
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,289
gravitational waves that were detected
with yes two neutron stars colliding

aggressively violently to create a super

3294
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:08,760
aggressively violently to create a super
 

3295
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,930
aggressively violently to create a super
neutron star and that's where you get

3296
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:11,940
neutron star and that's where you get
 

3297
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,430
neutron star and that's where you get
all the neutrons and neutron flux

3298
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
all the neutrons and neutron flux
 

3299
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,530
all the neutrons and neutron flux
somehow and then that the whole shebang

3300
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:15,540
somehow and then that the whole shebang
 

3301
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:18,170
somehow and then that the whole shebang
that happens in two seconds so that

3302
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:18,180
that happens in two seconds so that
 

3303
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:21,470
that happens in two seconds so that
confirmed that one of the sites for sure

3304
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:21,480
confirmed that one of the sites for sure
 

3305
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,730
confirmed that one of the sites for sure
is

3306
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:22,740
is

ancient iron deficient stars that also
had a strong signature of these heavy

3326
01:06:51,109 --> 01:06:51,119
had a strong signature of these heavy
 

3327
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,470

elements exactly like he1523
we weren't looking for that I actually

3330
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:56,940
we weren't looking for that I actually
 

3331
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,210
we weren't looking for that I actually
wanted to prove that they had really low

3332
01:06:59,210 --> 01:06:59,220
wanted to prove that they had really low
 

3333
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:01,309
wanted to prove that they had really low
levels of heavy elements because that's

3334
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:01,319
levels of heavy elements because that's
 

3335
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:03,230
levels of heavy elements because that's
what we had seen in all the other dwarf

3336
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:03,240
what we had seen in all the other dwarf
 

3337
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,609
what we had seen in all the other dwarf
galaxies

3338
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:04,619
galaxies
 

3339
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:08,150
galaxies
and I was dead set on showing yet that

3340
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:08,160
and I was dead set on showing yet that
 

3341
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,609
and I was dead set on showing yet that
that is yet the case again and that that

3342
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:10,619
that is yet the case again and that that
 

3343
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:12,890
that is yet the case again and that that
is a typical signature of early star

3344
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:12,900
is a typical signature of early star
 

3345
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,569
is a typical signature of early star
formation we already talked about low

3346
01:07:14,569 --> 01:07:14,579
formation we already talked about low
 

3347
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:16,549
formation we already talked about low
strontium and barium abundances and the

3348
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:16,559
strontium and barium abundances and the
 

3349
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,950
strontium and barium abundances and the
oldest Stars right this is what we had

3350
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:18,960
oldest Stars right this is what we had
 

3351
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,349
oldest Stars right this is what we had
seen anecdotally in in the ancient dwarf

3352
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
seen anecdotally in in the ancient dwarf
 

3353
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,390
seen anecdotally in in the ancient dwarf
galaxies that are surrounding us so

3354
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:23,400
galaxies that are surrounding us so
 

3355
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,950
galaxies that are surrounding us so
that's an ancient dwarf Galaxy the

3356
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:24,960
that's an ancient dwarf Galaxy the
 

3357
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,809
that's an ancient dwarf Galaxy the
network galaxy has a bunch of ancient

3358
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:26,819
network galaxy has a bunch of ancient
 

3359
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:28,789
network galaxy has a bunch of ancient
stars in it yes

3360
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
stars in it yes
 

3361
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,089
stars in it yes
and so now we find reticulum 2 and it

3362
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:32,099
and so now we find reticulum 2 and it
 

3363
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:35,450
and so now we find reticulum 2 and it
has these the Stars show the signature

3364
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:35,460
has these the Stars show the signature
 

3365
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,670
has these the Stars show the signature
of the rapid Neutron capture process the

3366
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:37,680
of the rapid Neutron capture process the
 

3367
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,190
of the rapid Neutron capture process the
r process and we elect

3368
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:40,200
r process and we elect
 

3369
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,549
r process and we elect
okay these stars are located in a dwarf

3370
01:07:43,549 --> 01:07:43,559
okay these stars are located in a dwarf
 

3371
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,529
okay these stars are located in a dwarf
Galaxy right now we have environmental

3372
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:45,539
Galaxy right now we have environmental
 

3373
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,569
Galaxy right now we have environmental
information they are not lost in the

3374
01:07:47,569 --> 01:07:47,579
information they are not lost in the
 

3375
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:48,890
information they are not lost in the
Galaxy where we don't know where they

3376
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:48,900
Galaxy where we don't know where they
 

3377
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,690
Galaxy where we don't know where they
actually came from now we know these

3378
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:50,700
actually came from now we know these
 

3379
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,970
actually came from now we know these
stars were formed in that Galaxy because

3380
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:52,980
stars were formed in that Galaxy because
 

3381
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,770
stars were formed in that Galaxy because
they're still in it

3382
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:54,780
they're still in it
 

3383
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,930
they're still in it
and that we already deduced from that

3384
01:07:56,930 --> 01:07:56,940
and that we already deduced from that
 

3385
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,370
and that we already deduced from that
that it must have been a neutron star

3386
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:58,380
that it must have been a neutron star
 

3387
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:01,849
that it must have been a neutron star
merger that went off in reticulum 2 at

3388
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:01,859
merger that went off in reticulum 2 at
 

3389
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:04,250
merger that went off in reticulum 2 at
Early times that polluted the gas from

3390
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:04,260
Early times that polluted the gas from
 

3391
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,289
Early times that polluted the gas from
which all our little stars formed can

3392
01:08:06,289 --> 01:08:06,299
which all our little stars formed can
 

3393
01:08:06,299 --> 01:08:08,329
which all our little stars formed can
you speak to what a dwarf Galaxy is can

3394
01:08:08,329 --> 01:08:08,339
you speak to what a dwarf Galaxy is can
 

3395
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:10,010
you speak to what a dwarf Galaxy is can
you speak to what this particular two

3396
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:10,020
you speak to what this particular two
 

3397
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,170
you speak to what this particular two
dwarf Galaxy is that it's orbiting the

3398
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:12,180
dwarf Galaxy is that it's orbiting the
 

3399
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:13,910
dwarf Galaxy is that it's orbiting the
Milky Way galaxy yeah it's going to be

3400
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:13,920
Milky Way galaxy yeah it's going to be
 

3401
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,890
Milky Way galaxy yeah it's going to be
eaten by it presumably it totally is

3402
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:15,900
eaten by it presumably it totally is
 

3403
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,349
eaten by it presumably it totally is
going to be eaten I can't tell you

3404
01:08:18,349 --> 01:08:18,359
going to be eaten I can't tell you
 

3405
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:20,209
going to be eaten I can't tell you
exactly when

3406
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:20,219
exactly when
 

3407
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:22,669
exactly when
um yeah the Milky Way remains surrounded

3408
01:08:22,669 --> 01:08:22,679
um yeah the Milky Way remains surrounded
 

3409
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:25,849
um yeah the Milky Way remains surrounded
by dozens of small dwarf galaxies and

3410
01:08:25,849 --> 01:08:25,859
by dozens of small dwarf galaxies and
 

3411
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:28,249
by dozens of small dwarf galaxies and
they are collections of stars

3412
01:08:28,249 --> 01:08:28,259
they are collections of stars
 

3413
01:08:28,259 --> 01:08:31,189
they are collections of stars
um some of them we call them Ultra faint

3414
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:31,199
um some of them we call them Ultra faint
 

3415
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:33,229
um some of them we call them Ultra faint
dwarf galaxies because they now only

3416
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:33,239
dwarf galaxies because they now only
 

3417
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:35,390
dwarf galaxies because they now only
contain I don't know a few thousand

3418
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:35,400
contain I don't know a few thousand
 

3419
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,950
contain I don't know a few thousand
stars

3420
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:36,960
stars
 

3421
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,010
stars
um very very faint still detectable uh

3422
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:40,020
um very very faint still detectable uh
 

3423
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,229
um very very faint still detectable uh
yes because they're fairly close and and

3424
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:42,239
yes because they're fairly close and and
 

3425
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:45,289
yes because they're fairly close and and
we detect actual individual stars now so

3426
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:45,299
we detect actual individual stars now so
 

3427
01:08:45,299 --> 01:08:47,510
we detect actual individual stars now so
I've observed some of the the faintest

3428
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:47,520
I've observed some of the the faintest
 

3429
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,189
I've observed some of the the faintest
Stars you know you possibly observed

3430
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:49,199
Stars you know you possibly observed
 

3431
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:50,870
Stars you know you possibly observed
with current telescopes in in these

3432
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:50,880
with current telescopes in in these
 

3433
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,970
with current telescopes in in these
dwarf galaxies because I was like I need

3434
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:52,980
dwarf galaxies because I was like I need
 

3435
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:54,530
dwarf galaxies because I was like I need
to know what the chemical composition is

3436
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:54,540
to know what the chemical composition is
 

3437
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:57,950
to know what the chemical composition is
because there are leftovers from the

3438
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:57,960
because there are leftovers from the
 

3439
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,990
because there are leftovers from the
early Universe right they they did not

3440
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:00,000
early Universe right they they did not
 

3441
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,849
early Universe right they they did not
get eaten so they're still in their

3442
01:09:01,849 --> 01:09:01,859
get eaten so they're still in their
 

3443
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:04,550
get eaten so they're still in their
native surroundings I I go it's like

3444
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:04,560
native surroundings I I go it's like
 

3445
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,070
native surroundings I I go it's like
getting the lions in the wild right I

3446
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:07,080
getting the lions in the wild right I
 

3447
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,950
getting the lions in the wild right I
gotta study those and compare to the

3448
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:09,960
gotta study those and compare to the
 

3449
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,050
gotta study those and compare to the
counterparts that got eaten and are now

3450
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:12,060
counterparts that got eaten and are now
 

3451
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:15,110
counterparts that got eaten and are now
in the Milky Way and so I so presumably

3452
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,120
in the Milky Way and so I so presumably
 

3453
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,970
in the Milky Way and so I so presumably
most of those Stars it's not all those

3454
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:16,980
most of those Stars it's not all those
 

3455
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:18,829
most of those Stars it's not all those
Stars Network Galaxy are really ancient

3456
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:18,839
Stars Network Galaxy are really ancient
 

3457
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:20,809
Stars Network Galaxy are really ancient
they're all really ancient because

3458
01:09:20,809 --> 01:09:20,819
they're all really ancient because
 

3459
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:23,510
they're all really ancient because
actually as it turns out if you have a

3460
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
actually as it turns out if you have a
 

3461
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,950
actually as it turns out if you have a
small Galaxy

3462
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:24,960
small Galaxy
 

3463
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,550
small Galaxy
um

3464
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:25,560
um
 

3465
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,709
um
there was a process early on in the

3466
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:27,719
there was a process early on in the
 

3467
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:29,630
there was a process early on in the
universe called reionization that kind

3468
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:29,640
universe called reionization that kind
 

3469
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,289
universe called reionization that kind
of heated up everything and together

3470
01:09:33,289 --> 01:09:33,299
of heated up everything and together
 

3471
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:35,870
of heated up everything and together
with some Supernova explosions in an

3472
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:35,880
with some Supernova explosions in an
 

3473
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,890
with some Supernova explosions in an
early shallow you know bound system

3474
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:39,900
early shallow you know bound system
 

3475
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,709
early shallow you know bound system
all these little systems lost the gas it

3476
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:42,719
all these little systems lost the gas it
 

3477
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,169
all these little systems lost the gas it
was sort of blown out or it simply

3478
01:09:45,169 --> 01:09:45,179
was sort of blown out or it simply
 

3479
01:09:45,179 --> 01:09:48,110
was sort of blown out or it simply
evaporated or both probably both

3480
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:48,120
evaporated or both probably both
 

3481
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,510
evaporated or both probably both
um and so these systems have been unable

3482
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:50,520
um and so these systems have been unable
 

3483
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,610
um and so these systems have been unable
to continue to form Stars since so it's

3484
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:54,620
to continue to form Stars since so it's
 

3485
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,990
to continue to form Stars since so it's
it's it's the best

3486
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,000
it's it's the best
 

3487
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,390
it's it's the best
for a Stella archaeologists that you

3488
01:09:59,390 --> 01:09:59,400
for a Stella archaeologists that you
 

3489
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,550
for a Stella archaeologists that you
could hope for because it's a whole

3490
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:01,560
could hope for because it's a whole
 

3491
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,410
could hope for because it's a whole
bunch of stars still sitting there it's

3492
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:03,420
bunch of stars still sitting there it's
 

3493
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,610
bunch of stars still sitting there it's
not just one there's a whole bunch of

3494
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:04,620
not just one there's a whole bunch of
 

3495
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,729
not just one there's a whole bunch of
them still sitting there ever since and

3496
01:10:07,729 --> 01:10:07,739
them still sitting there ever since and
 

3497
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:09,590

nothing has literally nothing has

01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:09,600
nothing has literally nothing has

01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:10,739
happened to them they're just been
 

3501
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,770

archeology perspective what is like

3504
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
archeology perspective what is like
 

3505
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,510
archeology perspective what is like
juicier more interesting the uh

3506
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
juicier more interesting the uh
 

3507
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,310
juicier more interesting the uh
the old stars and the outskirts that

3508
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:19,320
the old stars and the outskirts that
 

3509
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,870
the old stars and the outskirts that
have been eaten or the outskirts of

01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:20,880
have been eaten or the outskirts of
 

3511
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,510
have been eaten or the outskirts of

3513
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,890
Milky Way or the the stars in the in the
dwarf galaxies what's uh what's uh about

3514
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:27,900
dwarf galaxies what's uh what's uh about
 

3515
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,910
dwarf galaxies what's uh what's uh about
the world you said you love Stars so uh

3516
01:10:30,910 --> 01:10:30,920
the world you said you love Stars so uh
 

3517
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,790
the world you said you love Stars so uh
which do you love more of you oh that's

3518
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:34,800
which do you love more of you oh that's
 

3519
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,070
which do you love more of you oh that's
a hard one I mean I love them all of

3520
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:37,080
a hard one I mean I love them all of
 

3521
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,149
a hard one I mean I love them all of
course

3522
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:38,159
course
 

3523
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,910
course
um they serve different purposes the the

3524
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:40,920
um they serve different purposes the the
 

3525
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,669
um they serve different purposes the the
SAS in the Milky Way um I can get much

3526
01:10:43,669 --> 01:10:43,679
SAS in the Milky Way um I can get much
 

3527
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:45,470
SAS in the Milky Way um I can get much
much better data for them because

3528
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:45,480
much better data for them because
 

3529
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,390
much better data for them because
they're brighter they're closer so

3530
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:47,400
they're brighter they're closer so
 

3531
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,930
they're brighter they're closer so
they're brighter and that uh that

3532
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:50,940
they're brighter and that uh that
 

3533
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,970
they're brighter and that uh that
tickles my fancy and they have

3534
01:10:52,970 --> 01:10:52,980
tickles my fancy and they have
 

3535
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:54,470
tickles my fancy and they have
interesting kinematics presumably yes

3536
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:54,480
interesting kinematics presumably yes
 

3537
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,649
interesting kinematics presumably yes
and we can get that and so he1523 for

3538
01:10:57,649 --> 01:10:57,659
and we can get that and so he1523 for
 

3539
01:10:57,659 --> 01:10:59,090
and we can get that and so he1523 for
example you know that one is really

3540
01:10:59,090 --> 01:10:59,100
example you know that one is really
 

3541
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,209
example you know that one is really
bright only it's a red giant so it's

3542
01:11:02,209 --> 01:11:02,219
bright only it's a red giant so it's
 

3543
01:11:02,219 --> 01:11:03,770
bright only it's a red giant so it's
intrinsically bright and it's fairly

3544
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:03,780
intrinsically bright and it's fairly
 

3545
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:04,669
intrinsically bright and it's fairly
close

3546
01:11:04,669 --> 01:11:04,679
close
 

3547
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:07,430
close
and so the data I got for that was

3548
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
and so the data I got for that was
 

3549
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,350
and so the data I got for that was
insanely good and that yielded this

3550
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
insanely good and that yielded this
 

3551
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,470
insanely good and that yielded this
uranium detection and thorium detection

3552
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:12,480
uranium detection and thorium detection
 

3553
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,570
uranium detection and thorium detection
um I can never get that kind of data for

3554
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:14,580
um I can never get that kind of data for
 

3555
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,490
um I can never get that kind of data for
dwarf Galaxy Star so that's a big

3556
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:16,500
dwarf Galaxy Star so that's a big
 

3557
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,530
dwarf Galaxy Star so that's a big
trade-off but the environmental

3558
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:18,540
trade-off but the environmental
 

3559
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,870
trade-off but the environmental
information that would we get along with

3560
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:20,880
information that would we get along with
 

3561
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,550
information that would we get along with
the basic information about these stars

3562
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:22,560
the basic information about these stars
 

3563
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,950
the basic information about these stars
in each dwarf Galaxy is really really

3564
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:24,960
in each dwarf Galaxy is really really
 

3565
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,070
in each dwarf Galaxy is really really
valuable in establishing you know these

3566
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,080
valuable in establishing you know these
 

3567
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,390
valuable in establishing you know these
um for example these site information

3568
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:29,400
um for example these site information
 

3569
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,450
um for example these site information
right sure because the the Galaxy is

3570
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:32,460
right sure because the the Galaxy is
 

3571
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:34,970
right sure because the the Galaxy is
still there so nothing crazy could have

3572
01:11:34,970 --> 01:11:34,980
still there so nothing crazy could have
 

3573
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:38,330
still there so nothing crazy could have
happened so actually to close that Loop

3574
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:38,340
happened so actually to close that Loop
 

3575
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,850
happened so actually to close that Loop
probably some heavy elements come out of

3576
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:40,860
probably some heavy elements come out of
 

3577
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,790
probably some heavy elements come out of
supernovae here and there but somehow my

3578
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:43,800
supernovae here and there but somehow my
 

3579
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,830
supernovae here and there but somehow my
theory colleagues tell me that the

3580
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
theory colleagues tell me that the
 

3581
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,270
theory colleagues tell me that the
normal Supernova just doesn't have

3582
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:47,280
normal Supernova just doesn't have
 

3583
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,490
normal Supernova just doesn't have
enough oomph to really get an R process

3584
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:49,500
enough oomph to really get an R process
 

3585
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,250
enough oomph to really get an R process
going and doing doing it all so any

3586
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:52,260
going and doing doing it all so any
 

3587
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,110
going and doing doing it all so any
disorbiting super

3588
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:54,120
disorbiting super
 

3589
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,209
disorbiting super
we need them the probably the neutron

3590
01:11:56,209 --> 01:11:56,219
we need them the probably the neutron
 

3591
01:11:56,219 --> 01:11:58,490
we need them the probably the neutron
star mergers or we need a special kind

3592
01:11:58,490 --> 01:11:58,500
star mergers or we need a special kind
 

3593
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,229
star mergers or we need a special kind
of supernova that's maybe extremely

3594
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:00,239
of supernova that's maybe extremely
 

3595
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,030
of supernova that's maybe extremely
massive or heavily rotating or does

3596
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:02,040
massive or heavily rotating or does
 

3597
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,649
massive or heavily rotating or does
something else funny right to really

3598
01:12:03,649 --> 01:12:03,659
something else funny right to really
 

3599
01:12:03,659 --> 01:12:05,030
something else funny right to really
kind of get that particular process

3600
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:05,040
kind of get that particular process
 

3601
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,790
kind of get that particular process
going but uh the normal supernovae don't

3602
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:07,800
going but uh the normal supernovae don't
 

3603
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,470
going but uh the normal supernovae don't
do it right so only a little bit comes

3604
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:09,480
do it right so only a little bit comes
 

3605
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:11,390
do it right so only a little bit comes
up but you could come alongside Anna why

3606
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:11,400
up but you could come alongside Anna why
 

3607
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,030
up but you could come alongside Anna why
don't you just take 100 supernovae

3608
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:14,040
don't you just take 100 supernovae
 

3609
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,729
don't you just take 100 supernovae
together to build up the yield right but

3610
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:16,739
together to build up the yield right but
 

3611
01:12:16,739 --> 01:12:18,290
together to build up the yield right but
then I come along and say like Mike look

3612
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:18,300
then I come along and say like Mike look
 

3613
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,630
then I come along and say like Mike look
this dwarf Galaxy is still intact today

3614
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:20,640
this dwarf Galaxy is still intact today
 

3615
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,790
this dwarf Galaxy is still intact today
if you would have plugged in 100

3616
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:22,800
if you would have plugged in 100
 

3617
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,070
if you would have plugged in 100
supernovae into this little system early

3618
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:25,080
supernovae into this little system early
 

3619
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,050
supernovae into this little system early
on it would have blown apart it would

3620
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:27,060
on it would have blown apart it would
 

3621
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:29,450
on it would have blown apart it would
have blown apart past five supernovia or

3622
01:12:29,450 --> 01:12:29,460
have blown apart past five supernovia or
 

3623
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:32,090
have blown apart past five supernovia or
ten so that's a really important

3624
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:32,100
ten so that's a really important
 

3625
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,590
ten so that's a really important
constraint that we have that these

3626
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:33,600
constraint that we have that these
 

3627
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,410
constraint that we have that these
systems are still alive right so

3628
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:36,420
systems are still alive right so
 

3629
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,990
systems are still alive right so
um it helps us to pin down where certain

3630
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:39,000
um it helps us to pin down where certain
 

3631
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,209
um it helps us to pin down where certain
processes could have possibly happened

3632
01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:41,219
processes could have possibly happened
 

3633
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:43,910
processes could have possibly happened
and so that's it's just a it's just a

3634
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:43,920
and so that's it's just a it's just a
 

3635
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,709
and so that's it's just a it's just a
different type of information that we

3636
01:12:45,709 --> 01:12:45,719
different type of information that we
 

3637
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:46,790
different type of information that we
get

3638
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:46,800
get
 

3639
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,410
get
it'd be amazing if we could talk about

3640
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:48,420
it'd be amazing if we could talk about
 

3641
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,090
it'd be amazing if we could talk about
the observational aspect of this the

3642
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:50,100
the observational aspect of this the
 

3643
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:53,149
the observational aspect of this the
tools of observation so what telescopes

3644
01:12:53,149 --> 01:12:53,159
tools of observation so what telescopes
 

3645
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:55,850
tools of observation so what telescopes
have you used do you use and what does

3646
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:55,860
have you used do you use and what does
 

3647
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:58,550
have you used do you use and what does
the data look like and I think I've read

3648
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:58,560
the data look like and I think I've read
 

3649
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,110
the data look like and I think I've read
a few interesting stories about the

3650
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,120
a few interesting stories about the
 

3651
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,030
a few interesting stories about the
actual process of day-to-day observation

3652
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:02,040
actual process of day-to-day observation
 

3653
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:06,649
actual process of day-to-day observation
a bunch of uh probably late nights

3654
01:13:06,649 --> 01:13:06,659
a bunch of uh probably late nights
 

3655
01:13:06,659 --> 01:13:08,630
a bunch of uh probably late nights
well yeah astronomers are doing it all

3656
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,640
well yeah astronomers are doing it all
 

3657
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,810
well yeah astronomers are doing it all
night long so oh yeah

3658
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:10,820
night long so oh yeah
 

3659
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:12,709
night long so oh yeah
can you explain the all night long

3660
01:13:12,709 --> 01:13:12,719
can you explain the all night long
 

3661
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,450
can you explain the all night long
aspect of it

3662
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:14,460
aspect of it
 

3663
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,910
aspect of it
um well let me start by saying uh I

3664
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:16,920
um well let me start by saying uh I
 

3665
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,130
um well let me start by saying uh I
mostly these days use the Magellan

3666
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:19,140
mostly these days use the Magellan
 

3667
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,649
mostly these days use the Magellan
telescopes in Chile they are 6.5 meter

3668
01:13:21,649 --> 01:13:21,659
telescopes in Chile they are 6.5 meter
 

3669
01:13:21,659 --> 01:13:23,870
telescopes in Chile they are 6.5 meter
telescope which means the the mirror

3670
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:23,880
telescope which means the the mirror
 

3671
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:26,630
telescope which means the the mirror
diameter is 6.5 meter

3672
01:13:26,630 --> 01:13:26,640
diameter is 6.5 meter
 

3673
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,130
diameter is 6.5 meter
um that's not the largest that there's

3674
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:28,140
um that's not the largest that there's
 

3675
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:32,209
um that's not the largest that there's
out there but it's among the largest and

3676
01:13:32,209 --> 01:13:32,219
out there but it's among the largest and
 

3677
01:13:32,219 --> 01:13:34,610
out there but it's among the largest and
um I use a spectrograph because I'm a

3678
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:34,620
um I use a spectrograph because I'm a
 

3679
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:38,750
um I use a spectrograph because I'm a
spectroscopist I don't take pictures

3680
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:38,760

 

3681
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,450

um and uh that particular spectrograph

3682
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:41,460
um and uh that particular spectrograph
 

3683
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:44,090
um and uh that particular spectrograph
at that telescope is actually

3684
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:44,100
at that telescope is actually
 

3685
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,490
at that telescope is actually
um unusually efficient so it kind of

3686
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:46,500
um unusually efficient so it kind of
 

3687
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,050
um unusually efficient so it kind of
makes up for the fact that the mirror

3688
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,060
makes up for the fact that the mirror
 

3689
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,729
makes up for the fact that the mirror
isn't as large and not let's say the

3690
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:49,739
isn't as large and not let's say the
 

3691
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:51,530
isn't as large and not let's say the
eight meter telescopes from the

3692
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:51,540
eight meter telescopes from the
 

3693
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,810
eight meter telescopes from the
Europeans or so so I'm very happy with

3694
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:53,820
Europeans or so so I'm very happy with
 

3695
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,330
Europeans or so so I'm very happy with
that efficiency meaning how many photons

3696
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:56,340
that efficiency meaning how many photons
 

3697
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,370
that efficiency meaning how many photons
get collected sort of per time unit

3698
01:13:58,370 --> 01:13:58,380
get collected sort of per time unit
 

3699
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:02,030
get collected sort of per time unit
because we that that's always the

3700
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:02,040
because we that that's always the
 

3701
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,610
because we that that's always the
limiting factor

3702
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:04,620
limiting factor
 

3703
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,649
limiting factor
um

3704
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:05,659
um
 

3705
01:14:05,659 --> 01:14:08,630
um
uh prior to the pandemic we would travel

3706
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:08,640
uh prior to the pandemic we would travel
 

3707
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:12,470
uh prior to the pandemic we would travel
to Chile to do our observations

3708
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:12,480
to Chile to do our observations
 

3709
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,810
to Chile to do our observations
um those telescopes are the that's the

3710
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:14,820
um those telescopes are the that's the
 

3711
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:16,610
um those telescopes are the that's the
last Observatory where people were sort

3712
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:16,620
last Observatory where people were sort
 

3713
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,110
last Observatory where people were sort
of supposed to travel there and take

3714
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:18,120
of supposed to travel there and take
 

3715
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,270
of supposed to travel there and take
their own observations most other

3716
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:20,280
their own observations most other
 

3717
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,709
their own observations most other
observatories

3718
01:14:21,709 --> 01:14:21,719
observatories
 

3719
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:24,350
observatories
basically have staff there by now who

3720
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:24,360
basically have staff there by now who
 

3721
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,209
basically have staff there by now who
take the observations for you

3722
01:14:26,209 --> 01:14:26,219
take the observations for you
 

3723
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:28,910
take the observations for you
so there's the directly the scientists

3724
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:28,920
so there's the directly the scientists
 

3725
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,130
so there's the directly the scientists
are

3726
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:30,140
are
 

3727
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,330
are
specifying where to point the telescope

3728
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:32,340
specifying where to point the telescope
 

3729
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,770
specifying where to point the telescope
and sitting there and collecting the

3730
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:33,780
and sitting there and collecting the
 

3731
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,810
and sitting there and collecting the
data make sure the data is collected

3732
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:35,820
data make sure the data is collected
 

3733
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,970
data make sure the data is collected
well the cleaning of the data the what

3734
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:37,980
well the cleaning of the data the what
 

3735
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,350
well the cleaning of the data the what
offloading of the data all that kind of

3736
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:39,360
offloading of the data all that kind of
 

3737
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,149
offloading of the data all that kind of
stuff yeah so it's mostly done for them

3738
01:14:41,149 --> 01:14:41,159
stuff yeah so it's mostly done for them
 

3739
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:42,649
stuff yeah so it's mostly done for them
yeah

3740
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:42,659
yeah
 

3741
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:45,890
yeah
um obviously that's super convenient but

3742
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:45,900
um obviously that's super convenient but
 

3743
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:49,189
um obviously that's super convenient but
it also takes takes away a central part

3744
01:14:49,189 --> 01:14:49,199
it also takes takes away a central part
 

3745
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,350
it also takes takes away a central part
of what the work of an astronomer is

3746
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:51,360
of what the work of an astronomer is
 

3747
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,290
of what the work of an astronomer is
which is data collection

3748
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:54,300
which is data collection
 

3749
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,390
which is data collection
right we don't have an experiment in the

3750
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:56,400
right we don't have an experiment in the
 

3751
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,310
right we don't have an experiment in the
basement where we can go day and night

3752
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:58,320
basement where we can go day and night
 

3753
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,410
basement where we can go day and night
or whenever we please

3754
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:00,420
or whenever we please
 

3755
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:02,630
or whenever we please
um and ask a certain question of the

3756
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:02,640
um and ask a certain question of the
 

3757
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,850
um and ask a certain question of the
apparatus right let's

3758
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:04,860
apparatus right let's
 

3759
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:06,530
apparatus right let's
turn this knob and see what happens

3760
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:06,540
turn this knob and see what happens
 

3761
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:08,090
turn this knob and see what happens
let's turn that knob and see what

3762
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:08,100
let's turn that knob and see what
 

3763
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,310
let's turn that knob and see what
happens no you know we we only have one

3764
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:10,320
happens no you know we we only have one
 

3765
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:14,090
happens no you know we we only have one
experiment uh which is the universe and

3766
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:14,100
experiment uh which is the universe and
 

3767
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:16,330
experiment uh which is the universe and
we what we see is what we get

3768
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:16,340
we what we see is what we get
 

3769
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:19,850
we what we see is what we get
and I think it's it's so important to to

3770
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:19,860
and I think it's it's so important to to
 

3771
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:22,669
and I think it's it's so important to to
take an active role in that so I really

3772
01:15:22,669 --> 01:15:22,679
take an active role in that so I really
 

3773
01:15:22,679 --> 01:15:25,550
take an active role in that so I really
love going to the observatory I've taken

3774
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:25,560
love going to the observatory I've taken
 

3775
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,070
love going to the observatory I've taken
many students there over the years

3776
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:28,080
many students there over the years
 

3777
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,790
many students there over the years
to to teach them and to

3778
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:31,800
to to teach them and to
 

3779
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,030
to to teach them and to
just show them what it means to to be in

3780
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:35,040
just show them what it means to to be in
 

3781
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,950
just show them what it means to to be in
astronomer because you you go to the

3782
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:36,960
astronomer because you you go to the
 

3783
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,130
astronomer because you you go to the
these remote mountain tops and it's such

3784
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:40,140
these remote mountain tops and it's such
 

3785
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:43,490
these remote mountain tops and it's such
a magical environment and you wait there

3786
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:43,500
a magical environment and you wait there
 

3787
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,890
a magical environment and you wait there
you know for the sun to go down and then

3788
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:45,900
you know for the sun to go down and then
 

3789
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,169
you know for the sun to go down and then
you get ready and you look outside and

3790
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:48,179
you get ready and you look outside and
 

3791
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:51,950
you get ready and you look outside and
it's it's such a Serene environment

3792
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:51,960
it's it's such a Serene environment
 

3793
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,350
it's it's such a Serene environment
um it's it's a little bit out of this

3794
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:54,360
um it's it's a little bit out of this
 

3795
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,630
um it's it's a little bit out of this
world you're sitting there so the sun

3796
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:56,640
world you're sitting there so the sun
 

3797
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,090
world you're sitting there so the sun
goes down it's evening late evening

3798
01:15:59,090 --> 01:15:59,100
goes down it's evening late evening
 

3799
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,250
goes down it's evening late evening
and uh what does it look like what are

3800
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:01,260
and uh what does it look like what are
 

3801
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:02,990
and uh what does it look like what are
some of the most magical experiences of

3802
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:03,000
some of the most magical experiences of
 

3803
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,209
some of the most magical experiences of
that process well you know when you're

3804
01:16:05,209 --> 01:16:05,219
that process well you know when you're
 

3805
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:07,490
that process well you know when you're
on top of a mountain uh you know

3806
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:07,500
on top of a mountain uh you know
 

3807
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,290
on top of a mountain uh you know
climbers I guess get to see that

3808
01:16:09,290 --> 01:16:09,300
climbers I guess get to see that
 

3809
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,490
climbers I guess get to see that
probably

3810
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:10,500
probably
 

3811
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,610
probably
um otherwise um

3812
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:13,620
um otherwise um
 

3813
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:18,110
um otherwise um
it's it's very calm and the colors are

3814
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:18,120
it's it's very calm and the colors are
 

3815
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,910
it's it's very calm and the colors are
so beautiful and

3816
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:19,920
so beautiful and
 

3817
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,669
so beautiful and
I always become much calmer when I'm

3818
01:16:22,669 --> 01:16:22,679
I always become much calmer when I'm
 

3819
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:25,669
I always become much calmer when I'm
there I'm just a because I'm just there

3820
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:25,679
there I'm just a because I'm just there
 

3821
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,890
there I'm just a because I'm just there
for one purpose only that's data

3822
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:27,900
for one purpose only that's data
 

3823
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:28,790
for one purpose only that's data
collection

3824
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,800
collection
 

3825
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,370
collection
I can say no to my emails I can say no

3826
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:31,380
I can say no to my emails I can say no
 

3827
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,149
I can say no to my emails I can say no
to everything else because I'm observing

3828
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:34,159
to everything else because I'm observing
 

3829
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:37,669
to everything else because I'm observing
so there's literally less less

3830
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
so there's literally less less
 

3831
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,290
so there's literally less less
distractions because you know you're

3832
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:39,300
distractions because you know you're
 

3833
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,570
distractions because you know you're
just there to do one thing and also the

3834
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:41,580
just there to do one thing and also the
 

3835
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,250
just there to do one thing and also the
emails somehow seem less significant

3836
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:43,260
emails somehow seem less significant
 

3837
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:46,430
emails somehow seem less significant
yeah yeah it's just you can't afford to

3838
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:46,440
yeah yeah it's just you can't afford to
 

3839
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,510
yeah yeah it's just you can't afford to
focus on this one thing and you

3840
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:50,520
focus on this one thing and you
 

3841
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,790
focus on this one thing and you
it just kind of does something to you

3842
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:52,800
it just kind of does something to you
 

3843
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,209
it just kind of does something to you
it's it's a little hard to describe but

3844
01:16:56,209 --> 01:16:56,219
it's it's a little hard to describe but
 

3845
01:16:56,219 --> 01:16:56,810
it's it's a little hard to describe but
um

3846
01:16:56,810 --> 01:16:56,820
um
 

3847
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,490
um
you know if you then fast forward maybe

3848
01:16:58,490 --> 01:16:58,500
you know if you then fast forward maybe
 

3849
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,110
you know if you then fast forward maybe
I can speak a little bit about that and

3850
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:00,120
I can speak a little bit about that and
 

3851
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,270
I can speak a little bit about that and
I have done a lot of astrophotography

3852
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:02,280
I have done a lot of astrophotography
 

3853
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,209
I have done a lot of astrophotography
there as well so and and I observing

3854
01:17:05,209 --> 01:17:05,219
there as well so and and I observing
 

3855
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:07,550
there as well so and and I observing
faint dwarf Galaxy Stars you know these

3856
01:17:07,550 --> 01:17:07,560
faint dwarf Galaxy Stars you know these
 

3857
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,130
faint dwarf Galaxy Stars you know these
are like 45 minutes 55 minute exposure

3858
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:10,140
are like 45 minutes 55 minute exposure
 

3859
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,810
are like 45 minutes 55 minute exposure
so you actually have a lot of time so I

3860
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:11,820
so you actually have a lot of time so I
 

3861
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,370
so you actually have a lot of time so I
would run outside

3862
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:13,380
would run outside
 

3863
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,130
would run outside
and just lay on the ground under the

3864
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:16,140
and just lay on the ground under the
 

3865
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,810
and just lay on the ground under the
southern Milky Way

3866
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:17,820
southern Milky Way
 

3867
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:21,590
southern Milky Way
beautiful right up you know there and I

3868
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:21,600
beautiful right up you know there and I
 

3869
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:23,450
beautiful right up you know there and I
would just lay there like the snow angel

3870
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:23,460
would just lay there like the snow angel
 

3871
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,070
would just lay there like the snow angel
you know

3872
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:25,080
you know
 

3873
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,370
you know

and it just stare up there and just kind
 

3875
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,410
and it just stare up there and just kind
of let my thoughts sort of pass through

3876
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:30,420
of let my thoughts sort of pass through
 

3877
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:34,490
of let my thoughts sort of pass through
my brain and just like I'm I'm one of it

3878
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:34,500
my brain and just like I'm I'm one of it
 

3879
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:35,930
my brain and just like I'm I'm one of it
right we talked about this in the

3880
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:35,940
right we talked about this in the
 

3881
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:38,510
right we talked about this in the
beginning this is when I personally have

3882
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:38,520
beginning this is when I personally have
 

3883
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,209
beginning this is when I personally have
the feeling that I'm a part of it I I

3884
01:17:41,209 --> 01:17:41,219
the feeling that I'm a part of it I I
 

3885
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:43,610
the feeling that I'm a part of it I I
belong here rather than feeling kind of

3886
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:43,620
belong here rather than feeling kind of
 

3887
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:45,890
belong here rather than feeling kind of
small yes I'm small but there are many

3888
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:45,900
small yes I'm small but there are many
 

3889
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,630
small yes I'm small but there are many
other small things and lots of small

3890
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:47,640
other small things and lots of small
 

3891
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,970
other small things and lots of small
things make one big hole yeah we're part

3892
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:49,980
things make one big hole yeah we're part
 

3893
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:52,130
things make one big hole yeah we're part
of that big hole and um so that's

3894
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:52,140
of that big hole and um so that's
 

3895
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:55,370
of that big hole and um so that's
looking at the inner spirals yes Milky

3896
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:55,380
looking at the inner spirals yes Milky
 

3897
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:58,669
looking at the inner spirals yes Milky
Way galaxy and just you know this this

3898
01:17:58,669 --> 01:17:58,679
Way galaxy and just you know this this
 

3899
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:01,010
Way galaxy and just you know this this
dark sky with the with the bright stars

3900
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:01,020
dark sky with the with the bright stars
 

3901
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:04,669
dark sky with the with the bright stars
and I have described this in my my book

3902
01:18:04,669 --> 01:18:04,679
and I have described this in my my book
 

3903
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:05,930
and I have described this in my my book
um years ago

3904
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:05,940
um years ago
 

3905
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,209
um years ago
if the Milky Way Is All Bright above you

3906
01:18:08,209 --> 01:18:08,219
if the Milky Way Is All Bright above you
 

3907
01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:10,490
if the Milky Way Is All Bright above you
you don't need a moon or anything you

3908
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:10,500
you don't need a moon or anything you
 

3909
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,350
you don't need a moon or anything you
can walk in the Starlight and you will

3910
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:12,360
can walk in the Starlight and you will
 

3911
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,930
can walk in the Starlight and you will
find your way there are no trees there

3912
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:14,940
find your way there are no trees there
 

3913
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,689
find your way there are no trees there
for safety reasons but you wouldn't even

3914
01:18:17,689 --> 01:18:17,699
for safety reasons but you wouldn't even
 

3915
01:18:17,699 --> 01:18:19,790
for safety reasons but you wouldn't even
run into a tree right I mean you can see

3916
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:19,800
run into a tree right I mean you can see
 

3917
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,890
run into a tree right I mean you can see
you can almost see the shadow you know

3918
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:21,900
you can almost see the shadow you know
 

3919
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,810
you can almost see the shadow you know
from from The Starlight because it's

3920
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:23,820
from from The Starlight because it's
 

3921
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:26,270
from from The Starlight because it's
such a dark side and and the stars are

3922
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:26,280
such a dark side and and the stars are
 

3923
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:29,030
such a dark side and and the stars are
so bright and these are kind of moments

3924
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:29,040
so bright and these are kind of moments
 

3925
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,070
so bright and these are kind of moments
that that kind of change you a little

3926
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:31,080
that that kind of change you a little
 

3927
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:31,970
that that kind of change you a little
bit

3928
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:31,980
bit
 

3929
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,970
bit
and you see the unity of it all yeah and

3930
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:34,980
and you see the unity of it all yeah and
 

3931
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,510
and you see the unity of it all yeah and
it's just you and nature and

3932
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:38,520
it's just you and nature and
 

3933
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:41,209
it's just you and nature and
you know with modern civilization and

3934
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:41,219
you know with modern civilization and
 

3935
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:43,250
you know with modern civilization and
all of that we I think we often try a

3936
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:43,260
all of that we I think we often try a
 

3937
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:45,229
all of that we I think we often try a
little bit too hard to be removed from

3938
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:45,239
little bit too hard to be removed from
 

3939
01:18:45,239 --> 01:18:47,330
little bit too hard to be removed from
from nature you know to to be

3940
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:47,340
from nature you know to to be
 

3941
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,970
from nature you know to to be
independent of it and figuring it all

3942
01:18:49,970 --> 01:18:49,980
independent of it and figuring it all
 

3943
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,610
independent of it and figuring it all
out but at the end of the day we're just

3944
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:52,620
out but at the end of the day we're just
 

3945
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:56,149
out but at the end of the day we're just
a part of it and and that really helps

3946
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
a part of it and and that really helps
 

3947
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,330
a part of it and and that really helps
me to remember that that you know

3948
01:18:59,330 --> 01:18:59,340
me to remember that that you know
 

3949
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:02,090
me to remember that that you know
well one and the same well that fills me

3950
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:02,100
well one and the same well that fills me
 

3951
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:04,850
well one and the same well that fills me
with hope that because I I tend to think

3952
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:04,860
with hope that because I I tend to think
 

3953
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,649
with hope that because I I tend to think
of us humans as in the very early days

3954
01:19:06,649 --> 01:19:06,659
of us humans as in the very early days
 

3955
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:09,590
of us humans as in the very early days
of whatever the heck we are so that

3956
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:09,600
of whatever the heck we are so that
 

3957
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,350
of whatever the heck we are so that
makes me think uh thousands tens of

3958
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:12,360
makes me think uh thousands tens of
 

3959
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:13,850
makes me think uh thousands tens of
thousands hundreds of thousands of years

3960
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:13,860
thousands hundreds of thousands of years
 

3961
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,669
thousands hundreds of thousands of years
from now there will be reached whatever

3962
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:16,679
from now there will be reached whatever
 

3963
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:20,030
from now there will be reached whatever
we become will be traveling out there to

3964
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:20,040
we become will be traveling out there to
 

3965
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,250
we become will be traveling out there to
explore more and more and more yeah so

3966
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:22,260
explore more and more and more yeah so
 

3967
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,110
explore more and more and more yeah so
we're what you're doing is the early

3968
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:24,120
we're what you're doing is the early
 

3969
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:25,850
we're what you're doing is the early
days of Exploration with the tools we

3970
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:25,860
days of Exploration with the tools we
 

3971
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:28,490
days of Exploration with the tools we
have yes the early seafarers looking at

3972
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:28,500
have yes the early seafarers looking at
 

3973
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,250
have yes the early seafarers looking at
the sky for navigation coming up with

3974
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:31,260
the sky for navigation coming up with
 

3975
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:33,050
the sky for navigation coming up with
different theories of what uh what's on

3976
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:33,060
different theories of what uh what's on
 

3977
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,910
different theories of what uh what's on
the other side that the Earth is

3978
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:34,920
the other side that the Earth is
 

3979
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,530
the other side that the Earth is
starting to gain an intuition that the

3980
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:36,540
starting to gain an intuition that the
 

3981
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:37,850
starting to gain an intuition that the
Earth may be round

3982
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:37,860
Earth may be round
 

3983
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,530
Earth may be round
and then we might be able to navigate

3984
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:39,540
and then we might be able to navigate
 

3985
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:42,050
and then we might be able to navigate
all the way around to get to

3986
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:42,060
all the way around to get to
 

3987
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,490
all the way around to get to
um the financial benefits of getting

3988
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:43,500
um the financial benefits of getting
 

3989
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,130
um the financial benefits of getting
spices from India whatever the reason

3990
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:45,140
spices from India whatever the reason
 

3991
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:48,410
spices from India whatever the reason
whatever the grant funding process is

3992
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:48,420
whatever the grant funding process is
 

3993
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,330
whatever the grant funding process is
all about but ultimately actually

3994
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:50,340
all about but ultimately actually
 

3995
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,390
all about but ultimately actually
results in a deep understanding of the

3996
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:53,400
results in a deep understanding of the
 

3997
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,390
results in a deep understanding of the
mystery that's uh all around us and I

3998
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400
mystery that's uh all around us and I
 

3999
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,149
mystery that's uh all around us and I
mean it's just to travel out there

4000
01:19:59,149 --> 01:19:59,159
mean it's just to travel out there
 

4001
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:00,950
mean it's just to travel out there
I mean to me

4002
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:00,960
I mean to me
 

4003
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,830
I mean to me
the discovery of life in the solar

4004
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:03,840
the discovery of life in the solar
 

4005
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,689
the discovery of life in the solar
system

4006
01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:05,699
system
 

4007
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:07,669
system
I really hope to see that in my lifetime

4008
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,679
I really hope to see that in my lifetime
 

4009
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,669
I really hope to see that in my lifetime
some kind of some kind of Life bacteria

4010
01:20:10,669 --> 01:20:10,679
some kind of some kind of Life bacteria
 

4011
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:13,610
some kind of some kind of Life bacteria
something maybe dead because that means

4012
01:20:13,610 --> 01:20:13,620
something maybe dead because that means
 

4013
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,649
something maybe dead because that means
there's life everywhere

4014
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:15,659
there's life everywhere
 

4015
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:17,870
there's life everywhere
and that that's just the kind of stuff

4016
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:17,880
and that that's just the kind of stuff
 

4017
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,430
and that that's just the kind of stuff
that might be out there

4018
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:19,440
that might be out there
 

4019
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,410
that might be out there
all the different

4020
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:21,420
all the different
 

4021
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,070
all the different
um

4022
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
um
 

4023
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,570
um
all the different environmental

4024
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:23,580
all the different environmental
 

4025
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,330
all the different environmental
conditions chemically speaking that are

4026
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:26,340
conditions chemically speaking that are
 

4027
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:28,070
conditions chemically speaking that are
out there and it just seems like when

4028
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:28,080
out there and it just seems like when
 

4029
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,070
out there and it just seems like when
you look at Earth life finds a way

4030
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:31,080
you look at Earth life finds a way
 

4031
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,410
you look at Earth life finds a way
to survive to thrive in whatever

4032
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:33,420
to survive to thrive in whatever
 

4033
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:37,070
to survive to thrive in whatever
conditions and so uh

4034
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:37,080
conditions and so uh
 

4035
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,890
conditions and so uh
maybe that process just kind of humbles

4036
01:20:39,890 --> 01:20:39,900
maybe that process just kind of humbles
 

4037
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,930
maybe that process just kind of humbles
you as a super exciting to know that

4038
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:41,940
you as a super exciting to know that
 

4039
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,550
you as a super exciting to know that
there is life out there of different

4040
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:43,560
there is life out there of different
 

4041
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,830
there is life out there of different
forms and of course that raises the

4042
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:45,840
forms and of course that raises the
 

4043
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,870
forms and of course that raises the
question of um

4044
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:47,880
question of um
 

4045
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,229
question of um
what is life even we tend to have a very

4046
01:20:51,229 --> 01:20:51,239
what is life even we tend to have a very
 

4047
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:52,850
what is life even we tend to have a very
human-centric perspective

4048
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:52,860
human-centric perspective
 

4049
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,550
human-centric perspective
of uh what is a living organism and what

4050
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:55,560
of uh what is a living organism and what
 

4051
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,930
of uh what is a living organism and what
is intelligence and all this kind of

4052
01:20:56,930 --> 01:20:56,940
is intelligence and all this kind of
 

4053
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,850
is intelligence and all this kind of
stuff and all the work in artificial

4054
01:20:58,850 --> 01:20:58,860
stuff and all the work in artificial
 

4055
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,130
stuff and all the work in artificial
intelligence now is starting to

4056
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:00,140
intelligence now is starting to
 

4057
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,229
intelligence now is starting to
challenge our ideas of what makes human

4058
01:21:03,229 --> 01:21:03,239
challenge our ideas of what makes human
 

4059
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:04,669
challenge our ideas of what makes human
beings special

4060
01:21:04,669 --> 01:21:04,679
beings special
 

4061
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:06,590
beings special
I think we're doing that through all

4062
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:06,600
I think we're doing that through all
 

4063
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,090
I think we're doing that through all
kinds of ways and I think you're working

4064
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:08,100
kinds of ways and I think you're working
 

4065
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,610
kinds of ways and I think you're working
some part doing that as well like the

4066
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:10,620
some part doing that as well like the
 

4067
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,610
some part doing that as well like the
unity you feel is realizing where uh

4068
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:13,620
unity you feel is realizing where uh
 

4069
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:15,890
unity you feel is realizing where uh
we're part of this big mechanism of

4070
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:15,900
we're part of this big mechanism of
 

4071
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:18,169
we're part of this big mechanism of
nature whatever that is that's creating

4072
01:21:18,169 --> 01:21:18,179
nature whatever that is that's creating
 

4073
01:21:18,179 --> 01:21:20,390
nature whatever that is that's creating
all kinds of cool stuff from The Humble

4074
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
all kinds of cool stuff from The Humble
 

4075
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,770
all kinds of cool stuff from The Humble
pristine Origins to uh to today

4076
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:24,780
pristine Origins to uh to today
 

4077
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:25,970
pristine Origins to uh to today
um

4078
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:25,980
um
 

4079
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,010
um
so what is if you could just kind of

4080
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:28,020
so what is if you could just kind of
 

4081
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:30,169
so what is if you could just kind of
Linger on the on the process of the data

4082
01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:30,179
Linger on the on the process of the data
 

4083
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:32,689
Linger on the on the process of the data
what does the data look like and how

4084
01:21:32,689 --> 01:21:32,699
what does the data look like and how
 

4085
01:21:32,699 --> 01:21:36,590
what does the data look like and how
does the data the raw data lead to uh

4086
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:36,600
does the data the raw data lead to uh
 

4087
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,310
does the data the raw data lead to uh
a discovery of an ancient star

4088
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:39,320
a discovery of an ancient star
 

4089
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,229
a discovery of an ancient star
well as a spectroscopist we have to I

4090
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,239
well as a spectroscopist we have to I
 

4091
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:44,030
well as a spectroscopist we have to I
guess talk for for a brief moment about

4092
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:44,040
guess talk for for a brief moment about
 

4093
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,030
guess talk for for a brief moment about
what what a spectrum is yes

4094
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
what what a spectrum is yes
 

4095
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,070
what what a spectrum is yes
um

4096
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:49,080
um
 

4097
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,530
um
everyone I hope has seen a rainbow in

4098
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:51,540
everyone I hope has seen a rainbow in
 

4099
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,110
everyone I hope has seen a rainbow in
the sky that is

4100
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:54,120
the sky that is
 

4101
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,350
the sky that is
that is basically what we're doing uh we

4102
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,360
that is basically what we're doing uh we
 

4103
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,209
that is basically what we're doing uh we
don't send the Starlight through a

4104
01:21:59,209 --> 01:21:59,219
don't send the Starlight through a
 

4105
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:00,890
don't send the Starlight through a
raindrop that then gets bounced around

4106
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:00,900
raindrop that then gets bounced around
 

4107
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,590
raindrop that then gets bounced around
and splits up the light into the rainbow

4108
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:03,600
and splits up the light into the rainbow
 

4109
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,990
and splits up the light into the rainbow
colors we

4110
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:06,000
colors we
 

4111
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,149
colors we
um we do it with a spectrograph so

4112
01:22:08,149 --> 01:22:08,159
um we do it with a spectrograph so
 

4113
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,910
um we do it with a spectrograph so
basically a prism so we send a Starlight

4114
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:10,920
basically a prism so we send a Starlight
 

4115
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:13,669
basically a prism so we send a Starlight
through a prism of sorts and that splits

4116
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:13,679
through a prism of sorts and that splits
 

4117
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,630
through a prism of sorts and that splits
it up and then we record exactly that so

4118
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:17,640
it up and then we record exactly that so
 

4119
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:21,709
it up and then we record exactly that so
it's a little 2D picture actually of a

4120
01:22:21,709 --> 01:22:21,719
it's a little 2D picture actually of a
 

4121
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:23,209
it's a little 2D picture actually of a
spectrum

4122
01:22:23,209 --> 01:22:23,219
spectrum
 

4123
01:22:23,219 --> 01:22:26,390
spectrum
now uh it's not gonna look colorful it's

4124
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:26,400
now uh it's not gonna look colorful it's
 

4125
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,070
now uh it's not gonna look colorful it's
just black or black and white different

4126
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:28,080
just black or black and white different
 

4127
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,110
just black or black and white different
and different colors have of course

4128
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:30,120
and different colors have of course
 

4129
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:32,090
and different colors have of course
different energies that's what what we

4130
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:32,100
different energies that's what what we
 

4131
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,649
different energies that's what what we
record

4132
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:33,659
record
 

4133
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:36,410
record
um more specifically we we record it as

4134
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:36,420
um more specifically we we record it as
 

4135
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:39,110
um more specifically we we record it as
as wavelengths so wavelengths and

4136
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:39,120
as wavelengths so wavelengths and
 

4137
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,090
as wavelengths so wavelengths and
frequency and energies all all the same

4138
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:41,100
frequency and energies all all the same
 

4139
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,370
frequency and energies all all the same
at the end of the day

4140
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:43,380
at the end of the day
 

4141
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:47,270
at the end of the day
um we process that that little image in

4142
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:47,280
um we process that that little image in
 

4143
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,090
um we process that that little image in
the sense that we do a cross cut

4144
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:50,100
the sense that we do a cross cut
 

4145
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,090
the sense that we do a cross cut
and then sum up a few columns so that we

4146
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:53,100
and then sum up a few columns so that we
 

4147
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,970
and then sum up a few columns so that we
get all the data that we recorded and

4148
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:55,980
get all the data that we recorded and
 

4149
01:22:55,980 --> 01:23:00,590
get all the data that we recorded and
what we see is a um it's a bit funny to

4150
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:00,600
what we see is a um it's a bit funny to
 

4151
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,689
what we see is a um it's a bit funny to
describe just with words but a wiggly

4152
01:23:02,689 --> 01:23:02,699
describe just with words but a wiggly
 

4153
01:23:02,699 --> 01:23:05,630
describe just with words but a wiggly
line with lots of dips so the 2D process

4154
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:05,640
line with lots of dips so the 2D process
 

4155
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,030
line with lots of dips so the 2D process
Spectrum we call it Continuum so it's

4156
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:08,040
Spectrum we call it Continuum so it's
 

4157
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:09,950
Spectrum we call it Continuum so it's
just a flat line basically and then they

4158
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:09,960
just a flat line basically and then they
 

4159
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,530
just a flat line basically and then they
are dips so the interesting things are

4160
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:12,540
are dips so the interesting things are
 

4161
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,330
are dips so the interesting things are
the dips if you think back of the

4162
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:14,340
the dips if you think back of the
 

4163
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,850
the dips if you think back of the
rainbow what we actually see in Our

4164
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:16,860
rainbow what we actually see in Our
 

4165
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:19,070
rainbow what we actually see in Our
Stars is not just a rainbow but it would

4166
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:19,080
Stars is not just a rainbow but it would
 

4167
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,229
Stars is not just a rainbow but it would
be a rainbow with lots of black lines in

4168
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:21,239
be a rainbow with lots of black lines in
 

4169
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:25,130
be a rainbow with lots of black lines in
it which means certain little pieces of

4170
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:25,140
it which means certain little pieces of
 

4171
01:23:25,140 --> 01:23:28,430
it which means certain little pieces of
color have been eaten Away by a certain

4172
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:28,440
color have been eaten Away by a certain
 

4173
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,250
color have been eaten Away by a certain
amount and so we can no longer see it as

4174
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:31,260
amount and so we can no longer see it as
 

4175
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,070
amount and so we can no longer see it as
well or not at all

4176
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
well or not at all
 

4177
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,709
well or not at all
why is that happening so if we come back

4178
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:36,719
why is that happening so if we come back
 

4179
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,209
why is that happening so if we come back
to our Stars what we're observing we're

4180
01:23:38,209 --> 01:23:38,219
to our Stars what we're observing we're
 

4181
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:40,010
to our Stars what we're observing we're
observing the Stella surface we can

4182
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:40,020
observing the Stella surface we can
 

4183
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:42,050
observing the Stella surface we can
actually never peer without telescopes

4184
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:42,060
actually never peer without telescopes
 

4185
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,990
actually never peer without telescopes
inside we only ever go can go after the

4186
01:23:44,990 --> 01:23:45,000
inside we only ever go can go after the
 

4187
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,070
inside we only ever go can go after the
surface

4188
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:46,080
surface
 

4189
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:48,229
surface
and the

4190
01:23:48,229 --> 01:23:48,239
and the
 

4191
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:51,350
and the
surface contains oh the surface layer

4192
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:51,360
surface contains oh the surface layer
 

4193
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,970
surface contains oh the surface layer
contains different kinds of elements

4194
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:54,980
contains different kinds of elements
 

4195
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:58,430
contains different kinds of elements
every one of those types of atoms so

4196
01:23:58,430 --> 01:23:58,440
every one of those types of atoms so
 

4197
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,750
every one of those types of atoms so
elements are just different types of

4198
01:23:59,750 --> 01:23:59,760
elements are just different types of
 

4199
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:04,130
elements are just different types of
atoms they absorb different photons that

4200
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:04,140
atoms they absorb different photons that
 

4201
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,930
atoms they absorb different photons that
are coming from the hot core where the

4202
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:05,940
are coming from the hot core where the
 

4203
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,990
are coming from the hot core where the
fusion is occurring and so that means

4204
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:09,000
fusion is occurring and so that means
 

4205
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,910
fusion is occurring and so that means
that if you're the Observer you know

4206
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:10,920
that if you're the Observer you know
 

4207
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,610
that if you're the Observer you know
with a spectrograph or without

4208
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:13,620
with a spectrograph or without
 

4209
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:15,950
with a spectrograph or without
um you will see the Starlight but

4210
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:15,960
um you will see the Starlight but
 

4211
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,649
um you will see the Starlight but
certain frequencies certain energies of

4212
01:24:18,649 --> 01:24:18,659
certain frequencies certain energies of
 

4213
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:21,110
certain frequencies certain energies of
that light will have been absorbed by

4214
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:21,120
that light will have been absorbed by
 

4215
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,750
that light will have been absorbed by
all the different atoms in the gas

4216
01:24:23,750 --> 01:24:23,760
all the different atoms in the gas
 

4217
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,090
all the different atoms in the gas
so you see less of them and so those are

4218
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:26,100
so you see less of them and so those are
 

4219
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,790
so you see less of them and so those are
the dips and the strength of the dips

4220
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
the dips and the strength of the dips
 

4221
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:33,709
the dips and the strength of the dips
tell us you know which element was it

4222
01:24:33,709 --> 01:24:33,719
tell us you know which element was it
 

4223
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:38,209
tell us you know which element was it
and how much of that element was or is

4224
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:38,219
and how much of that element was or is
 

4225
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:40,189
and how much of that element was or is
in in the star

4226
01:24:40,189 --> 01:24:40,199
in in the star
 

4227
01:24:40,199 --> 01:24:43,250
in in the star
so we have many many dips the the solar

4228
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:43,260
so we have many many dips the the solar
 

4229
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:46,130
so we have many many dips the the solar
Spectrum for reference you know all the

4230
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:46,140
Spectrum for reference you know all the
 

4231
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,630
Spectrum for reference you know all the
dips are overlapping because the

4232
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:47,640
dips are overlapping because the
 

4233
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,370
dips are overlapping because the
abundance of all the elements are so

4234
01:24:49,370 --> 01:24:49,380
abundance of all the elements are so
 

4235
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:52,010
abundance of all the elements are so
high it's actually very complicated

4236
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:52,020
high it's actually very complicated
 

4237
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,890
high it's actually very complicated
Spectrum my Spectra really look like a

4238
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:54,900
Spectrum my Spectra really look like a
 

4239
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,390
Spectrum my Spectra really look like a
straight line and then there's a dip

4240
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:56,400
straight line and then there's a dip
 

4241
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,950
straight line and then there's a dip
here and then you have the straight line

4242
01:24:57,950 --> 01:24:57,960
here and then you have the straight line
 

4243
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,390
here and then you have the straight line
again there's a dip there the sun

4244
01:24:59,390 --> 01:24:59,400
again there's a dip there the sun
 

4245
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,590
again there's a dip there the sun
doesn't have straight lines I mean

4246
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:00,600
doesn't have straight lines I mean
 

4247
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,689
doesn't have straight lines I mean
that's just all absorbed in some form or

4248
01:25:02,689 --> 01:25:02,699
that's just all absorbed in some form or
 

4249
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:04,910
that's just all absorbed in some form or
another

4250
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:04,920

 

4251
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,790

um but the old stars have so little of

4252
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:07,800
um but the old stars have so little of
 

4253
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,490
um but the old stars have so little of
all the elements that they're only

4254
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:10,500
all the elements that they're only
 

4255
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,290
all the elements that they're only
occasionally these dips that then

4256
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:12,300
occasionally these dips that then
 

4257
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:14,090
occasionally these dips that then
indicate okay that one at that

4258
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:14,100
indicate okay that one at that
 

4259
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,250
indicate okay that one at that
wavelength was iron and here we have

4260
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:16,260
wavelength was iron and here we have
 

4261
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,290
wavelength was iron and here we have
carbon and there's magnesium and sodium

4262
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:18,300
carbon and there's magnesium and sodium
 

4263
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,030
carbon and there's magnesium and sodium
and oh there's a little strontium line

4264
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:20,040
and oh there's a little strontium line
 

4265
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:24,470
and oh there's a little strontium line
here so we have a much easier way to

4266
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:24,480
here so we have a much easier way to
 

4267
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,410
here so we have a much easier way to
um map out this barcode that the

4268
01:25:27,410 --> 01:25:27,420
um map out this barcode that the
 

4269
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,990
um map out this barcode that the
Spectrum you know pretty much is in at

4270
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:30,000
Spectrum you know pretty much is in at
 

4271
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,930
Spectrum you know pretty much is in at
the end of the day and to then measure

4272
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:32,940
the end of the day and to then measure
 

4273
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:34,910
the end of the day and to then measure
the strength of these we call it

4274
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:34,920
the strength of these we call it
 

4275
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,910
the strength of these we call it
absorption lines to then calculate with

4276
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:37,920
absorption lines to then calculate with
 

4277
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,130
absorption lines to then calculate with
existing codes that mimic the physics of

4278
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:40,140
existing codes that mimic the physics of
 

4279
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,630
existing codes that mimic the physics of
the Stellar hemispheres like how much

4280
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:41,640
the Stellar hemispheres like how much
 

4281
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,030
the Stellar hemispheres like how much
was absorbed how many what what kind of

4282
01:25:44,030 --> 01:25:44,040
was absorbed how many what what kind of
 

4283
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:46,970
was absorbed how many what what kind of
elements were were present in in the

4284
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:46,980
elements were were present in in the
 

4285
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,290
elements were were present in in the
cellar atmosphere

4286
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:48,300
cellar atmosphere
 

4287
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,209
cellar atmosphere
and so this is how we get to our

4288
01:25:50,209 --> 01:25:50,219
and so this is how we get to our
 

4289
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:52,490
and so this is how we get to our
abundance measurements and then all

4290
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:52,500
abundance measurements and then all
 

4291
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,649
abundance measurements and then all
together that gives us the the chemical

4292
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:54,659
together that gives us the the chemical
 

4293
01:25:54,659 --> 01:25:56,689
together that gives us the the chemical
composition and and that particular

4294
01:25:56,689 --> 01:25:56,699
composition and and that particular
 

4295
01:25:56,699 --> 01:25:58,790
composition and and that particular
signature in that star

4296
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:58,800
signature in that star
 

4297
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,189
signature in that star
if you uh do you ever look at like the

4298
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:01,199
if you uh do you ever look at like the
 

4299
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,770
if you uh do you ever look at like the
raw spectrograph and the absorption line

4300
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:03,780
raw spectrograph and the absorption line
 

4301
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,110
raw spectrograph and the absorption line
and they're able to see

4302
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:06,120
and they're able to see
 

4303
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:10,189
and they're able to see
Intuit some interesting non-standard

4304
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:10,199
Intuit some interesting non-standard
 

4305
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:13,250
Intuit some interesting non-standard
outlier kind of patterns

4306
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:13,260
outlier kind of patterns
 

4307
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,530
outlier kind of patterns
or does this have to do heavy amount of

4308
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:15,540
or does this have to do heavy amount of
 

4309
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,270
or does this have to do heavy amount of
processing

4310
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:17,280
processing
 

4311
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,930
processing
um we actually process our it's fairly

4312
01:26:20,930 --> 01:26:20,940
um we actually process our it's fairly
 

4313
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:23,990
um we actually process our it's fairly
straightforward to to do our processing

4314
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:24,000
straightforward to to do our processing
 

4315
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,629
straightforward to to do our processing
we do it at the telescope so I often

4316
01:26:26,629 --> 01:26:26,639
we do it at the telescope so I often
 

4317
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,390
we do it at the telescope so I often
take a shorter exposure first let's say

4318
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:29,400
take a shorter exposure first let's say
 

4319
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,750
take a shorter exposure first let's say
10 or 15 minutes uh so mostly when I do

4320
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:32,760
10 or 15 minutes uh so mostly when I do
 

4321
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,610
10 or 15 minutes uh so mostly when I do
Discovery work we would just take a

4322
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:34,620
Discovery work we would just take a
 

4323
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:37,550
Discovery work we would just take a
quick look Spectrum then we process it

4324
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:37,560
quick look Spectrum then we process it
 

4325
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,590
quick look Spectrum then we process it
while we observe the next uh

4326
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:39,600
while we observe the next uh
 

4327
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,290
while we observe the next uh
then we take a quick look we have what I

4328
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:42,300
then we take a quick look we have what I
 

4329
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,149
then we take a quick look we have what I
call the summary plot it's it's a

4330
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:44,159
call the summary plot it's it's a
 

4331
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,669
call the summary plot it's it's a
collection of little areas in the

4332
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:46,679
collection of little areas in the
 

4333
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:49,310
collection of little areas in the
spectrum that have the the key positions

4334
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:49,320
spectrum that have the the key positions
 

4335
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,950
spectrum that have the the key positions
uh the positions of the key elements in

4336
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:51,960
uh the positions of the key elements in
 

4337
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,750
uh the positions of the key elements in
it and it's kind of like reading the tea

4338
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:53,760
it and it's kind of like reading the tea
 

4339
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,870
it and it's kind of like reading the tea
leaves I have stared at so many Spectra

4340
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:56,880
leaves I have stared at so many Spectra
 

4341
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,629
leaves I have stared at so many Spectra
I just need to know I just need to see

4342
01:26:59,629 --> 01:26:59,639
I just need to know I just need to see
 

4343
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:01,310
I just need to know I just need to see
our summary plot and I can tell you

4344
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:01,320
our summary plot and I can tell you
 

4345
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,930
our summary plot and I can tell you
exactly what the numbers are going to be

4346
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:02,940
exactly what the numbers are going to be
 

4347
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:05,209
exactly what the numbers are going to be
awesome and also to tell if it's going

4348
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:05,219
awesome and also to tell if it's going
 

4349
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:06,649
awesome and also to tell if it's going
to be promising to look at further

4350
01:27:06,649 --> 01:27:06,659
to be promising to look at further
 

4351
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:09,410
to be promising to look at further
exactly and so that's a thumbs up thumbs

4352
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:09,420
exactly and so that's a thumbs up thumbs
 

4353
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:10,450
exactly and so that's a thumbs up thumbs
down

4354
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:10,460
down
 

4355
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,950
down
uh you're worth my time

4356
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:12,960
uh you're worth my time
 

4357
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,070
uh you're worth my time
or not in most cases it's not or it's

4358
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:16,080
or not in most cases it's not or it's
 

4359
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,870
or not in most cases it's not or it's
good enough we can do a basic analysis

4360
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:17,880
good enough we can do a basic analysis
 

4361
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,729
good enough we can do a basic analysis
maybe publish this as part of a larger

4362
01:27:19,729 --> 01:27:19,739
maybe publish this as part of a larger
 

4363
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:22,310
maybe publish this as part of a larger
sample just so you know we output that

4364
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:22,320
sample just so you know we output that
 

4365
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,110
sample just so you know we output that
we have observed the star and and their

4366
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:24,120
we have observed the star and and their
 

4367
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:25,669
we have observed the star and and their
basic nature that that's an important

4368
01:27:25,669 --> 01:27:25,679
basic nature that that's an important
 

4369
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:28,010
basic nature that that's an important
part to to publish as well

4370
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:28,020
part to to publish as well
 

4371
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:31,189
part to to publish as well
um and uh yeah I had a I had a run so

4372
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
um and uh yeah I had a I had a run so
 

4373
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,169
um and uh yeah I had a I had a run so
now we do remote observing I do all of

4374
01:27:33,169 --> 01:27:33,179
now we do remote observing I do all of
 

4375
01:27:33,179 --> 01:27:35,689
now we do remote observing I do all of
this now from my home from my living

4376
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:35,699
this now from my home from my living
 

4377
01:27:35,699 --> 01:27:39,410
this now from my home from my living
room all night long

4378
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:39,420

 

4379
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,030

um and

4380
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:41,040
um and
 

4381
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,250
um and
um I often work with with colleagues so

4382
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:43,260
um I often work with with colleagues so
 

4383
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:46,370
um I often work with with colleagues so
we we do it over zoom and we process the

4384
01:27:46,370 --> 01:27:46,380
we we do it over zoom and we process the
 

4385
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,770
we we do it over zoom and we process the
data we look at it same thing still and

4386
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:48,780
data we look at it same thing still and
 

4387
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:51,830
data we look at it same thing still and
we we just found a star that

4388
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:51,840
we we just found a star that
 

4389
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,470
we we just found a star that
um had a very low iron abundance and

4390
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
um had a very low iron abundance and
 

4391
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,450
um had a very low iron abundance and
then we decided okay that looks

4392
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:56,460
then we decided okay that looks
 

4393
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,950
then we decided okay that looks
interesting we're just gonna keep

4394
01:27:57,950 --> 01:27:57,960
interesting we're just gonna keep
 

4395
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,470
interesting we're just gonna keep
exposing so we'll talk more data on it

4396
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:00,480
exposing so we'll talk more data on it
 

4397
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,570
exposing so we'll talk more data on it
on the spot and we're writing up the

4398
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:02,580
on the spot and we're writing up the
 

4399
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:04,189
on the spot and we're writing up the
paper right now how do you know where to

4400
01:28:04,189 --> 01:28:04,199
paper right now how do you know where to
 

4401
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:06,470
paper right now how do you know where to
point the telescope it's not random

4402
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:06,480
point the telescope it's not random
 

4403
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,750
point the telescope it's not random
there's a lot of work that goes into

4404
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:08,760
there's a lot of work that goes into
 

4405
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,490
there's a lot of work that goes into
that

4406
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:10,500
that
 

4407
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,510
that
um I began my career by

4408
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:14,520
um I began my career by
 

4409
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,370
um I began my career by
answering trying to answer that question

4410
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:16,380
answering trying to answer that question
 

4411
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:19,310
answering trying to answer that question
as in like doing the search process

4412
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:19,320
as in like doing the search process
 

4413
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:22,850
as in like doing the search process
that's why I called my my book that I've

4414
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:22,860
that's why I called my my book that I've
 

4415
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:24,649
that's why I called my my book that I've
written some time ago searching for the

4416
01:28:24,649 --> 01:28:24,659
written some time ago searching for the
 

4417
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:26,570
written some time ago searching for the
oldest ass because

4418
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:26,580
oldest ass because
 

4419
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:28,550
oldest ass because
searching is one thing it's very time

4420
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:28,560
searching is one thing it's very time
 

4421
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,770
searching is one thing it's very time
consuming and then on top of that not

4422
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:30,780
consuming and then on top of that not
 

4423
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:33,290
consuming and then on top of that not
everyone finds right and I often don't

4424
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:33,300
everyone finds right and I often don't
 

4425
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:36,950
everyone finds right and I often don't
find but I keep searching because you

4426
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:36,960
find but I keep searching because you
 

4427
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,689
find but I keep searching because you
know techniques have established that

4428
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:38,699
know techniques have established that
 

4429
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:41,149
know techniques have established that
yes we can do it if we're just patient

4430
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:41,159
yes we can do it if we're just patient
 

4431
01:28:41,159 --> 01:28:43,370
yes we can do it if we're just patient
enough and keep going because it's a

4432
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:43,380
enough and keep going because it's a
 

4433
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:45,590
enough and keep going because it's a
numbers game and that's often the case

4434
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
numbers game and that's often the case
 

4435
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,669
numbers game and that's often the case
in science and that's something that not

4436
01:28:49,669 --> 01:28:49,679
in science and that's something that not
 

4437
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,910
in science and that's something that not
a not enough is talked about how tedious

4438
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:52,920
a not enough is talked about how tedious
 

4439
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,850
a not enough is talked about how tedious
it is and how long it takes to get to

4440
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:55,860
it is and how long it takes to get to
 

4441
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:57,709
it is and how long it takes to get to
that one

4442
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:57,719
that one
 

4443
01:28:57,719 --> 01:29:00,590
that one
a discovery right that that moves the

4444
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:00,600
a discovery right that that moves the
 

4445
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,530
a discovery right that that moves the
field further and how difficult it is to

4446
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:03,540
field further and how difficult it is to
 

4447
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,570
field further and how difficult it is to
believe that there is a thing to be

4448
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:05,580
believe that there is a thing to be
 

4449
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:08,510
believe that there is a thing to be
discovered yes yes

4450
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:08,520
discovered yes yes
 

4451
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,370
discovered yes yes
um if we have the saying I I learned

4452
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:10,380
um if we have the saying I I learned
 

4453
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,129
um if we have the saying I I learned
this I think from my supervisor one star

4454
01:29:13,129 --> 01:29:13,139
this I think from my supervisor one star
 

4455
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:15,290
this I think from my supervisor one star
is a discovery

4456
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:15,300
is a discovery
 

4457
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:19,370
is a discovery
two is a is a sample and three is a

4458
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:19,380
two is a is a sample and three is a
 

4459
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:22,129
two is a is a sample and three is a
population so as soon as you found three

4460
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:22,139
population so as soon as you found three
 

4461
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:25,550
population so as soon as you found three
of roughly the same kind you're done but

4462
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:25,560
of roughly the same kind you're done but
 

4463
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,950
of roughly the same kind you're done but
you need to get there yeah probably at

4464
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:27,960
you need to get there yeah probably at
 

4465
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,770
you need to get there yeah probably at
first is the hardest right yes but it

4466
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:30,780
first is the hardest right yes but it
 

4467
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:34,129
first is the hardest right yes but it
kind of remains really hard and but the

4468
01:29:34,129 --> 01:29:34,139
kind of remains really hard and but the
 

4469
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:36,830
kind of remains really hard and but the
thing is that at past three many of us

4470
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:36,840
thing is that at past three many of us
 

4471
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,350
thing is that at past three many of us
are okay we solved that problem

4472
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:39,360
are okay we solved that problem
 

4473
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,450
are okay we solved that problem
we've done it three times so we can't do

4474
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:41,460
we've done it three times so we can't do
 

4475
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,430
we've done it three times so we can't do
it that's a thing right that's a

4476
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:43,440
it that's a thing right that's a
 

4477
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,189
it that's a thing right that's a
population three iron deficient Stars

4478
01:29:46,189 --> 01:29:46,199
population three iron deficient Stars
 

4479
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:48,950
population three iron deficient Stars
let's say right that's one puzzle piece

4480
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:48,960
let's say right that's one puzzle piece
 

4481
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,390
let's say right that's one puzzle piece
now we can move on to the next thing

4482
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:50,400
now we can move on to the next thing
 

4483
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,010
now we can move on to the next thing
that's an indicator that there's many

4484
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:52,020
that's an indicator that there's many
 

4485
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,830
that's an indicator that there's many
more of them yes potentially yes yes yes

4486
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:53,840
more of them yes potentially yes yes yes
 

4487
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,990
more of them yes potentially yes yes yes
so to cut a long story short about the

4488
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:57,000
so to cut a long story short about the
 

4489
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,430
so to cut a long story short about the
searching

4490
01:29:58,430 --> 01:29:58,440
searching
 

4491
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:00,830

um we started early on with

4492
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:00,840
um we started early on with
 

4493
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,390
um we started early on with
um what's called low resolution

4494
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
um what's called low resolution
 

4495
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,610
um what's called low resolution
spectroscopy of many stars so for

4496
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:04,620
spectroscopy of many stars so for
 

4497
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:07,129
spectroscopy of many stars so for
example my thesis work almost 20 years

4498
01:30:07,129 --> 01:30:07,139
example my thesis work almost 20 years
 

4499
01:30:07,139 --> 01:30:10,669
example my thesis work almost 20 years
ago was piggybacking off

4500
01:30:10,669 --> 01:30:10,679
ago was piggybacking off
 

4501
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:13,850
ago was piggybacking off
um a quasa survey that had collected so

4502
01:30:13,850 --> 01:30:13,860
um a quasa survey that had collected so
 

4503
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,910
um a quasa survey that had collected so
quasars are basically giant supermassive

4504
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:16,920
quasars are basically giant supermassive
 

4505
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,070
quasars are basically giant supermassive
black holes that are really far away so

4506
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:19,080
black holes that are really far away so
 

4507
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,169
black holes that are really far away so
you only see a one big bright light

4508
01:30:21,169 --> 01:30:21,179
you only see a one big bright light
 

4509
01:30:21,179 --> 01:30:23,270
you only see a one big bright light
point so it looks like a star but it's

4510
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:23,280
point so it looks like a star but it's
 

4511
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,669
point so it looks like a star but it's
actually just a giant supermassive like

4512
01:30:25,669 --> 01:30:25,679
actually just a giant supermassive like
 

4513
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:27,590
actually just a giant supermassive like
all that outshines it's it's its own

4514
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:27,600
all that outshines it's it's its own
 

4515
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,970
all that outshines it's it's its own
Galaxy

4516
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:28,980
Galaxy
 

4517
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:31,490
Galaxy
and people had been trying to study

4518
01:30:31,490 --> 01:30:31,500
and people had been trying to study
 

4519
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:33,910
and people had been trying to study
those and they had taken little Spectra

4520
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:33,920
those and they had taken little Spectra
 

4521
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,310
those and they had taken little Spectra
of of you know all things in the sky and

4522
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:37,320
of of you know all things in the sky and
 

4523
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,110
of of you know all things in the sky and
it turns out oh you can fish out the

4524
01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:39,120
it turns out oh you can fish out the
 

4525
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,510
it turns out oh you can fish out the
actual stars from that and and look for

4526
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:41,520
actual stars from that and and look for
 

4527
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,430
actual stars from that and and look for
certain signatures

4528
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:43,440
certain signatures
 

4529
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,890
certain signatures
um that might indicate uh Low Middle

4530
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:45,900
um that might indicate uh Low Middle
 

4531
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:47,570
um that might indicate uh Low Middle
City Star so it starts with low

4532
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:47,580
City Star so it starts with low
 

4533
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,610
City Star so it starts with low
abundances

4534
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:49,620
abundances
 

4535
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:53,030
abundances
um and so it was painstaking work to

4536
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:53,040
um and so it was painstaking work to
 

4537
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,550
um and so it was painstaking work to
then take medium resolution spectroscopy

4538
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:55,560
then take medium resolution spectroscopy
 

4539
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:56,990
then take medium resolution spectroscopy
to get a little bit more information and

4540
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:57,000
to get a little bit more information and
 

4541
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,850
to get a little bit more information and
to use the approximations and to kind of

4542
01:30:58,850 --> 01:30:58,860
to use the approximations and to kind of
 

4543
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:00,590
to use the approximations and to kind of
get candidates that we can then

4544
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:00,600
get candidates that we can then
 

4545
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,149
get candidates that we can then
eventually take to the big class like

4546
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:02,159
eventually take to the big class like
 

4547
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,250
eventually take to the big class like
Magellan to get a high resolution

4548
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:04,260
Magellan to get a high resolution
 

4549
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:07,010
Magellan to get a high resolution
Spectrum so we really see the dips of

4550
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:07,020
Spectrum so we really see the dips of
 

4551
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,649
Spectrum so we really see the dips of
all the individual elements that then

4552
01:31:09,649 --> 01:31:09,659
all the individual elements that then
 

4553
01:31:09,659 --> 01:31:11,390
all the individual elements that then
give us the final answer is it yay

4554
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:11,400
give us the final answer is it yay
 

4555
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,550
give us the final answer is it yay
already

4556
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:13,560
already
 

4557
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,010
already
um these days uh with another grad

4558
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:16,020
um these days uh with another grad
 

4559
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:18,410
um these days uh with another grad
student I just I developed a new

4560
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:18,420
student I just I developed a new
 

4561
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:20,390
student I just I developed a new
technique to use

4562
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:20,400
technique to use
 

4563
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,270
technique to use
um images actually of all the stars in

4564
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:23,280
um images actually of all the stars in
 

4565
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:26,629
um images actually of all the stars in
the sky taken with very narrow filters

4566
01:31:26,629 --> 01:31:26,639
the sky taken with very narrow filters
 

4567
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:28,189
the sky taken with very narrow filters
so it's like you're wearing very

4568
01:31:28,189 --> 01:31:28,199
so it's like you're wearing very
 

4569
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:30,350
so it's like you're wearing very
specific glasses that only let so much

4570
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:30,360
specific glasses that only let so much
 

4571
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:33,169
specific glasses that only let so much
light through and so we can do similar

4572
01:31:33,169 --> 01:31:33,179
light through and so we can do similar
 

4573
01:31:33,179 --> 01:31:34,209
light through and so we can do similar
things

4574
01:31:34,209 --> 01:31:34,219
things
 

4575
01:31:34,219 --> 01:31:37,129
things
through having several narrow band

4576
01:31:37,129 --> 01:31:37,139
through having several narrow band
 

4577
01:31:37,139 --> 01:31:40,129
through having several narrow band
filters what we call it to fish out

4578
01:31:40,129 --> 01:31:40,139
filters what we call it to fish out
 

4579
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:42,350
filters what we call it to fish out
things that have you know no absorption

4580
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:42,360
things that have you know no absorption
 

4581
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,750
things that have you know no absorption
over here so just the the straight line

4582
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:44,760
over here so just the the straight line
 

4583
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:46,910
over here so just the the straight line
and then a little dip here so a little

4584
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:46,920
and then a little dip here so a little
 

4585
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,950
and then a little dip here so a little
something there

4586
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:48,960
something there
 

4587
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,550
something there
and that has proven fairly successful in

4588
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:52,560
and that has proven fairly successful in
 

4589
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,590
and that has proven fairly successful in
recent years so looking at the entire

4590
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:54,600
recent years so looking at the entire
 

4591
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:57,530
recent years so looking at the entire
looking at a broader regions of space

4592
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:57,540
looking at a broader regions of space
 

4593
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,990
looking at a broader regions of space
that's right because these stars are a

4594
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,000
that's right because these stars are a
 

4595
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:00,950
that's right because these stars are a
little bit like the needle in the

4596
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:00,960
little bit like the needle in the
 

4597
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,209
little bit like the needle in the
haystack right there are not that many

4598
01:32:02,209 --> 01:32:02,219
haystack right there are not that many
 

4599
01:32:02,219 --> 01:32:04,430
haystack right there are not that many
left over and the certainly the galaxy

4600
01:32:04,430 --> 01:32:04,440
left over and the certainly the galaxy
 

4601
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:07,669
left over and the certainly the galaxy
has made plenty of stars in between we

4602
01:32:07,669 --> 01:32:07,679
has made plenty of stars in between we
 

4603
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:10,310
has made plenty of stars in between we
need to comb through all of those

4604
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:10,320
need to comb through all of those
 

4605
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,129
need to comb through all of those
um to to get to the goods yeah so we

4606
01:32:13,129 --> 01:32:13,139
um to to get to the goods yeah so we
 

4607
01:32:13,139 --> 01:32:15,169
um to to get to the goods yeah so we
always start with millions and then work

4608
01:32:15,169 --> 01:32:15,179
always start with millions and then work
 

4609
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:16,790
always start with millions and then work
our way down and in the end we have like

4610
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:16,800
our way down and in the end we have like
 

4611
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,370
our way down and in the end we have like
three good candidates I wonder how those

4612
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:19,380
three good candidates I wonder how those
 

4613
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:21,050
three good candidates I wonder how those
ancient Stars feel that they were

4614
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:21,060
ancient Stars feel that they were
 

4615
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:23,750
ancient Stars feel that they were
noticed they probably know that nobody

4616
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:23,760
noticed they probably know that nobody
 

4617
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,030
noticed they probably know that nobody
pays attention

4618
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:25,040
pays attention
 

4619
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,990
pays attention
no I'm just kidding we're all special

4620
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:27,000
no I'm just kidding we're all special
 

4621
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,910
no I'm just kidding we're all special
right so understands it's good it's

4622
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:28,920
right so understands it's good it's
 

4623
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,330
right so understands it's good it's
inspiring even if you're the outcast

4624
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:32,340
inspiring even if you're the outcast
 

4625
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:35,149
inspiring even if you're the outcast
um in your pristine nature you still

4626
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:35,159
um in your pristine nature you still
 

4627
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:37,250
um in your pristine nature you still
might nevertheless be noticed I'm hoping

4628
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:37,260
might nevertheless be noticed I'm hoping
 

4629
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:38,870
might nevertheless be noticed I'm hoping
the same about humans if somebody's

4630
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:38,880
the same about humans if somebody's
 

4631
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,729
the same about humans if somebody's
observing us

4632
01:32:40,729 --> 01:32:40,739
observing us
 

4633
01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:42,169
observing us
um

4634
01:32:42,169 --> 01:32:42,179
um
 

4635
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:43,669
um
is there something else you could say

4636
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
is there something else you could say
 

4637
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:44,930
is there something else you could say
that's

4638
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:44,940
that's
 

4639
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,610
that's
about the challenges of this kind of

4640
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:46,620
about the challenges of this kind of
 

4641
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,350
about the challenges of this kind of
high Precision measurement

4642
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:48,360
high Precision measurement
 

4643
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,270
high Precision measurement
uh that you're doing

4644
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:50,280
uh that you're doing
 

4645
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,610
uh that you're doing
so this kind of collection of data

4646
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:52,620
so this kind of collection of data
 

4647
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:53,930
so this kind of collection of data
looking

4648
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:53,940
looking
 

4649
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:56,390
looking
trying to come

4650
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:56,400
trying to come
 

4651
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:59,090
trying to come
pull out the signal from the noise out

4652
01:32:59,090 --> 01:32:59,100
pull out the signal from the noise out
 

4653
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,590
pull out the signal from the noise out
there

4654
01:33:00,590 --> 01:33:00,600
there
 

4655
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,810
there
well that's literally what we're doing

4656
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:02,820
well that's literally what we're doing
 

4657
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,209
well that's literally what we're doing
in multiple ways actually so we find

4658
01:33:05,209 --> 01:33:05,219
in multiple ways actually so we find
 

4659
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:06,470
in multiple ways actually so we find
trying to find the needle in the

4660
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:06,480
trying to find the needle in the
 

4661
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,729
trying to find the needle in the
haystack

4662
01:33:07,729 --> 01:33:07,739
haystack
 

4663
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:09,530
haystack
and then we find something and then it

4664
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:09,540
and then we find something and then it
 

4665
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:10,850
and then we find something and then it
turns out

4666
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:10,860
turns out
 

4667
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,530
turns out
it's just a little bit too faint to

4668
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:12,540
it's just a little bit too faint to
 

4669
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:14,450
it's just a little bit too faint to
actually get the kind of data quality on

4670
01:33:14,450 --> 01:33:14,460
actually get the kind of data quality on
 

4671
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:16,370
actually get the kind of data quality on
it that we would like or that would

4672
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:16,380
it that we would like or that would
 

4673
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,010
it that we would like or that would
would be warranted given the the

4674
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:19,020
would be warranted given the the
 

4675
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:22,669
would be warranted given the the
potential of the Star right it's like so

4676
01:33:22,669 --> 01:33:22,679
potential of the Star right it's like so
 

4677
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:24,169
potential of the Star right it's like so
there's always noise

4678
01:33:24,169 --> 01:33:24,179
there's always noise
 

4679
01:33:24,179 --> 01:33:25,790
there's always noise
there's always a little bit of noise and

4680
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:25,800
there's always a little bit of noise and
 

4681
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,490
there's always a little bit of noise and
you have to try to say like what uh yeah

4682
01:33:28,490 --> 01:33:28,500
you have to try to say like what uh yeah
 

4683
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:29,810
you have to try to say like what uh yeah
how special is this when you're looking

4684
01:33:29,810 --> 01:33:29,820
how special is this when you're looking
 

4685
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:32,689
how special is this when you're looking
at the absorption line yeah how so the

4686
01:33:32,689 --> 01:33:32,699
at the absorption line yeah how so the
 

4687
01:33:32,699 --> 01:33:35,209
at the absorption line yeah how so the
most iron Pro Stars their iron lines are

4688
01:33:35,209 --> 01:33:35,219
most iron Pro Stars their iron lines are
 

4689
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:37,430
most iron Pro Stars their iron lines are
so tiny that they're literally you know

4690
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:37,440
so tiny that they're literally you know
 

4691
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:39,530
so tiny that they're literally you know
almost in the noise so you need an

4692
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:39,540
almost in the noise so you need an
 

4693
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:44,990
almost in the noise so you need an
incredibly good data to make detections

4694
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:45,000
incredibly good data to make detections
 

4695
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,030
incredibly good data to make detections
and and the funny thing is we're looking

4696
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:47,040
and and the funny thing is we're looking
 

4697
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:50,030
and and the funny thing is we're looking
for the nothingness of let's say the

4698
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:50,040
for the nothingness of let's say the
 

4699
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:51,830
for the nothingness of let's say the
iron lines but then we don't want

4700
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:51,840
iron lines but then we don't want
 

4701
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:53,510
iron lines but then we don't want
nothing because if there's nothing in

4702
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:53,520
nothing because if there's nothing in
 

4703
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,010
nothing because if there's nothing in
the Spectrum we can't measure anything

4704
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:55,020
the Spectrum we can't measure anything
 

4705
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:57,950
the Spectrum we can't measure anything
we can only get an upper limit but we'd

4706
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:57,960
we can only get an upper limit but we'd
 

4707
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,689
we can only get an upper limit but we'd
really like a measurement so we are

4708
01:33:59,689 --> 01:33:59,699
really like a measurement so we are
 

4709
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:01,550
really like a measurement so we are
looking for the the last little bit that

4710
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:01,560
looking for the the last little bit that
 

4711
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,830
looking for the the last little bit that
you could possibly detect and that's the

4712
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:03,840
you could possibly detect and that's the
 

4713
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,629
you could possibly detect and that's the
strong function of the brightness of the

4714
01:34:05,629 --> 01:34:05,639
strong function of the brightness of the
 

4715
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:07,430
strong function of the brightness of the
star because the telescopes have the

4716
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:07,440
star because the telescopes have the
 

4717
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,890
star because the telescopes have the
size that they do that that's not going

4718
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:09,900
size that they do that that's not going
 

4719
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:10,970
size that they do that that's not going
to change for a while hopefully

4720
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:10,980
to change for a while hopefully
 

4721
01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:12,830
to change for a while hopefully
eventually it will but it's going to be

4722
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:12,840
eventually it will but it's going to be
 

4723
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,990
eventually it will but it's going to be
at least 10 years out

4724
01:34:14,990 --> 01:34:15,000
at least 10 years out
 

4725
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,209
at least 10 years out
um and so yes we'll often literally

4726
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:17,219
um and so yes we'll often literally
 

4727
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:19,310
um and so yes we'll often literally
stuck in the noise because we can't make

4728
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:19,320
stuck in the noise because we can't make
 

4729
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,870
stuck in the noise because we can't make
the measurement so actually the record

4730
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:20,880
the measurement so actually the record
 

4731
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,209
the measurement so actually the record
holder for the most iron poster only has

4732
01:34:23,209 --> 01:34:23,219
holder for the most iron poster only has
 

4733
01:34:23,219 --> 01:34:25,669
holder for the most iron poster only has
an upper limit we can't get enough data

4734
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
an upper limit we can't get enough data
 

4735
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,110
an upper limit we can't get enough data
on this to actually pinpoint a

4736
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:27,120
on this to actually pinpoint a
 

4737
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,970
on this to actually pinpoint a
measurement to then take it to our

4738
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:28,980
measurement to then take it to our
 

4739
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:30,770
measurement to then take it to our
Theory colleagues and say like give me

4740
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:30,780
Theory colleagues and say like give me
 

4741
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:34,310
Theory colleagues and say like give me
this little iron out of your first star

4742
01:34:34,310 --> 01:34:34,320
this little iron out of your first star
 

4743
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,709
this little iron out of your first star
so it's a bit frustrating but also super

4744
01:34:36,709 --> 01:34:36,719
so it's a bit frustrating but also super
 

4745
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:38,930
so it's a bit frustrating but also super
exciting at the same time so let's go to

4746
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:38,940
exciting at the same time so let's go to
 

4747
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:41,270
exciting at the same time so let's go to
both sides of that Spectrum what's uh

4748
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:41,280
both sides of that Spectrum what's uh
 

4749
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,610
both sides of that Spectrum what's uh
what's like the most exciting Discovery

4750
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:43,620
what's like the most exciting Discovery
 

4751
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:46,490
what's like the most exciting Discovery
to you personally where it's is there a

4752
01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:46,500
to you personally where it's is there a
 

4753
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:48,770
to you personally where it's is there a
moment you remember that you saw a piece

4754
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:48,780
moment you remember that you saw a piece
 

4755
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:50,990
moment you remember that you saw a piece
of data and you kind of your heart

4756
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:51,000
of data and you kind of your heart
 

4757
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,450
of data and you kind of your heart
skipped a bit

4758
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:53,460
skipped a bit
 

4759
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:57,169
skipped a bit
um yeah yeah of course is it the is it

4760
01:34:57,169 --> 01:34:57,179
um yeah yeah of course is it the is it
 

4761
01:34:57,179 --> 01:35:00,770
um yeah yeah of course is it the is it
uh he1327 that was that was definitely

4762
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:00,780
uh he1327 that was that was definitely
 

4763
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,570
uh he1327 that was that was definitely
one of those moments I wasn't actually

4764
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:02,580
one of those moments I wasn't actually
 

4765
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,070
one of those moments I wasn't actually
present at the telescope but we will

4766
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:04,080
present at the telescope but we will
 

4767
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,510
present at the telescope but we will
send the data immediately for my

4768
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
send the data immediately for my
 

4769
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:06,550
send the data immediately for my
colleague

4770
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:06,560
colleague
 

4771
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,890
colleague
and we just looked at it and our eyes

4772
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:09,900
and we just looked at it and our eyes
 

4773
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,370
and we just looked at it and our eyes
got really white and it's like oh my God

4774
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:12,380
got really white and it's like oh my God
 

4775
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:14,930
got really white and it's like oh my God
this is this really what you think it is

4776
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:14,940
this is this really what you think it is
 

4777
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:18,169
this is this really what you think it is
so we had to run some numbers and and it

4778
01:35:18,169 --> 01:35:18,179
so we had to run some numbers and and it
 

4779
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:21,110
so we had to run some numbers and and it
was and it these are magical little

4780
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:21,120
was and it these are magical little
 

4781
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,649
was and it these are magical little
moments yeah the thing is

4782
01:35:24,649 --> 01:35:24,659
moments yeah the thing is
 

4783
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:26,750
moments yeah the thing is
you know often we we have false

4784
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:26,760
you know often we we have false
 

4785
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:29,450
you know often we we have false
positives yeah and so there's always

4786
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:29,460
positives yeah and so there's always
 

4787
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,850
positives yeah and so there's always
this this kind of period and often it's

4788
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:31,860
this this kind of period and often it's
 

4789
01:35:31,860 --> 01:35:34,729
this this kind of period and often it's
it's I don't know 10 15 minutes where

4790
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:34,739
it's I don't know 10 15 minutes where
 

4791
01:35:34,739 --> 01:35:36,590
it's I don't know 10 15 minutes where
you need to make some tests to kind of

4792
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:36,600
you need to make some tests to kind of
 

4793
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,030
you need to make some tests to kind of
make the decision is this really

4794
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:38,040
make the decision is this really
 

4795
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,470
make the decision is this really
something I should keep observing now is

4796
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:39,480
something I should keep observing now is
 

4797
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:41,390
something I should keep observing now is
this really as good as I think or or am

4798
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:41,400
this really as good as I think or or am
 

4799
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:43,610
this really as good as I think or or am
I being fooled by something right so

4800
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:43,620
I being fooled by something right so
 

4801
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:45,530
I being fooled by something right so
actually if you take a spectrum of a

4802
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:45,540
actually if you take a spectrum of a
 

4803
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,689
actually if you take a spectrum of a
white dwarf a white dwarf is the

4804
01:35:47,689 --> 01:35:47,699
white dwarf a white dwarf is the
 

4805
01:35:47,699 --> 01:35:50,629
white dwarf a white dwarf is the
leftover core of a star like the sun

4806
01:35:50,629 --> 01:35:50,639
leftover core of a star like the sun
 

4807
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,450
leftover core of a star like the sun
that has gone extinct

4808
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:53,460
that has gone extinct
 

4809
01:35:53,460 --> 01:35:55,370
that has gone extinct
and why dwarves have lost all their

4810
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:55,380
and why dwarves have lost all their
 

4811
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,990
and why dwarves have lost all their
outer atmosphere so it's just the

4812
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:57,000
outer atmosphere so it's just the
 

4813
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,209
outer atmosphere so it's just the
hydrogen helium core so they look like a

4814
01:35:59,209 --> 01:35:59,219
hydrogen helium core so they look like a
 

4815
01:35:59,219 --> 01:36:00,830
hydrogen helium core so they look like a
metal poor star because that's only

4816
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:00,840
metal poor star because that's only
 

4817
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,530
metal poor star because that's only
hydrogen helium left right but the

4818
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:03,540
hydrogen helium left right but the
 

4819
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:05,330
hydrogen helium left right but the
hydrogen lines that you can see in the

4820
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:05,340
hydrogen lines that you can see in the
 

4821
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:07,129
hydrogen lines that you can see in the
spectrum of our stars and of the white

4822
01:36:07,129 --> 01:36:07,139
spectrum of our stars and of the white
 

4823
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:10,430
spectrum of our stars and of the white
dwarfs a little bit wider than normal so

4824
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:10,440
dwarfs a little bit wider than normal so
 

4825
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,830
dwarfs a little bit wider than normal so
you need to have a good eye just to

4826
01:36:12,830 --> 01:36:12,840
you need to have a good eye just to
 

4827
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,510
you need to have a good eye just to
check you know does this look a little

4828
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:14,520
check you know does this look a little
 

4829
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:16,850
check you know does this look a little
bit wider than us is this a white dwarf

4830
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:16,860
bit wider than us is this a white dwarf
 

4831
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:19,370
bit wider than us is this a white dwarf
who's fooling me here right and so it's

4832
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:19,380
who's fooling me here right and so it's
 

4833
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,709
who's fooling me here right and so it's
like this moment it's like oh my God

4834
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:21,719
like this moment it's like oh my God
 

4835
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:24,470
like this moment it's like oh my God
it's just minutes of nervousness yes yes

4836
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:24,480
it's just minutes of nervousness yes yes
 

4837
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,590
it's just minutes of nervousness yes yes
and sometimes you know it's it's a dud

4838
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:27,600
and sometimes you know it's it's a dud
 

4839
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,350
and sometimes you know it's it's a dud
and sometimes it's not what's been uh

4840
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:30,360
and sometimes it's not what's been uh
 

4841
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:31,610
and sometimes it's not what's been uh
what's been a big that you remember

4842
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:31,620
what's been a big that you remember
 

4843
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:34,729
what's been a big that you remember
heartbreak like a painful low point

4844
01:36:34,729 --> 01:36:34,739
heartbreak like a painful low point
 

4845
01:36:34,739 --> 01:36:37,910
heartbreak like a painful low point
is it all leading up to the first is it

01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:37,920
is it all leading up to the first is it
 

4847
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,669
is it all leading up to the first is it
all about HG 1327 again just the leading

4848
01:36:40,669 --> 01:36:40,679
all about HG 1327 again just the leading
 

4849
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:42,770
all about HG 1327 again just the leading
up to it or has there been like a

4850
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:42,780
up to it or has there been like a
 

4851
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:44,870
up to it or has there been like a
uh yeah has there been like low points

4852
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:44,880
uh yeah has there been like low points
 

4853
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,910
uh yeah has there been like low points
in this search

4854
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:46,920
in this search
 

4855
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,669
in this search
um that's a good question

4856
01:36:49,669 --> 01:36:49,679
um that's a good question
 

4857
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:53,090
um that's a good question
I mean you know it starts with mundane

4858
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:53,100
I mean you know it starts with mundane
 

4859
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:55,129
I mean you know it starts with mundane
things as in like you you want your

4860
01:36:55,129 --> 01:36:55,139
things as in like you you want your
 

4861
01:36:55,139 --> 01:36:57,290
things as in like you you want your
telescope time you travel there

4862
01:36:57,290 --> 01:36:57,300
telescope time you travel there
 

4863
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:00,290
telescope time you travel there
and the weather is completely cloudy it

4864
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:00,300
and the weather is completely cloudy it
 

4865
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:03,110
and the weather is completely cloudy it
rains and you you had three nights which

4866
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:03,120
rains and you you had three nights which
 

4867
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:06,229
rains and you you had three nights which
is a lot and you go home empty-handed

4868
01:37:06,229 --> 01:37:06,239
is a lot and you go home empty-handed
 

4869
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:08,080
is a lot and you go home empty-handed
so that's definitely a low point

4870
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:08,090
so that's definitely a low point
 

4871
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:09,229
so that's definitely a low point
[Laughter]

4872
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:09,239
[Laughter]
 

4873
01:37:09,239 --> 01:37:10,910
[Laughter]
uh probably not what you were thinking

4874
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:10,920
uh probably not what you were thinking
 

4875
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,830
uh probably not what you were thinking
of uh but there is a certain

4876
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:12,840
of uh but there is a certain
 

4877
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:15,470
of uh but there is a certain
occupational hazard to it which requires

4878
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:15,480
occupational hazard to it which requires
 

4879
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,669
occupational hazard to it which requires
a kind of

4880
01:37:16,669 --> 01:37:16,679
a kind of
 

4881
01:37:16,679 --> 01:37:19,310
a kind of
resilience and a patience yeah and you

4882
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:19,320
resilience and a patience yeah and you
 

4883
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:21,649
resilience and a patience yeah and you
just gotta learn to to live with it um

4884
01:37:21,649 --> 01:37:21,659
just gotta learn to to live with it um
 

4885
01:37:21,659 --> 01:37:23,390
just gotta learn to to live with it um
coming back to reticulum too actually

4886
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:23,400
coming back to reticulum too actually
 

4887
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,669
coming back to reticulum too actually
you know that little dwarf Galaxy that

4888
01:37:25,669 --> 01:37:25,679
you know that little dwarf Galaxy that
 

4889
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,830
you know that little dwarf Galaxy that
was a run that we had and the weather

4890
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:27,840
was a run that we had and the weather
 

4891
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,530
was a run that we had and the weather
was incredibly bad and I had sent my

4892
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:30,540
was incredibly bad and I had sent my
 

4893
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:33,050
was incredibly bad and I had sent my
student there

4894
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:33,060
student there
 

4895
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:34,189
student there
um

4896
01:37:34,189 --> 01:37:34,199
um
 

4897
01:37:34,199 --> 01:37:36,590
um
and I was at home and he calls me at 2AM

4898
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:36,600
and I was at home and he calls me at 2AM
 

4899
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,350
and I was at home and he calls me at 2AM
and he was like Anna I think I observed

4900
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:39,360
and he was like Anna I think I observed
 

4901
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:40,990
and he was like Anna I think I observed
the wrong stuff I'm so sorry

4902
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:41,000
the wrong stuff I'm so sorry
 

4903
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,490
the wrong stuff I'm so sorry
there's this line there this europium

4904
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:43,500
there's this line there this europium
 

4905
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:45,649
there's this line there this europium
line and it looks like a metal Rich star

4906
01:37:45,649 --> 01:37:45,659
line and it looks like a metal Rich star
 

4907
01:37:45,659 --> 01:37:49,610
line and it looks like a metal Rich star
and I was like it's cool we all make

4908
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:49,620
and I was like it's cool we all make
 

4909
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:52,310
and I was like it's cool we all make
mistakes send me the data send me that

4910
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:52,320
mistakes send me the data send me that
 

4911
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,689
mistakes send me the data send me that
summary plot

4912
01:37:53,689 --> 01:37:53,699
summary plot
 

4913
01:37:53,699 --> 01:37:55,790
summary plot
and so I look at it you know I was like

4914
01:37:55,790 --> 01:37:55,800
and so I look at it you know I was like
 

4915
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:59,810
and so I look at it you know I was like
super tired and it's like

4916
01:37:59,810 --> 01:37:59,820
super tired and it's like
 

4917
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:02,090
super tired and it's like
I I can't really tell it doesn't look

4918
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:02,100
I I can't really tell it doesn't look
 

4919
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:04,370
I I can't really tell it doesn't look
wrong but I can't tell you right now

4920
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:04,380
wrong but I can't tell you right now
 

4921
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:06,169
wrong but I can't tell you right now
that it's right either so why don't you

4922
01:38:06,169 --> 01:38:06,179
that it's right either so why don't you
 

4923
01:38:06,179 --> 01:38:08,990
that it's right either so why don't you
go to the next Target

4924
01:38:08,990 --> 01:38:09,000
go to the next Target
 

4925
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,090
go to the next Target
he calls me back an hour later you know

4926
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:11,100
he calls me back an hour later you know
 

4927
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,149
he calls me back an hour later you know
it looks just the same

4928
01:38:13,149 --> 01:38:13,159
it looks just the same
 

4929
01:38:13,159 --> 01:38:16,370
it looks just the same
what am I supposed to do

4930
01:38:16,370 --> 01:38:16,380
what am I supposed to do
 

4931
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:18,470
what am I supposed to do
and then I joked well maybe we found an

4932
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:18,480
and then I joked well maybe we found an
 

4933
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:20,350
and then I joked well maybe we found an
R process Galaxy

4934
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:20,360
R process Galaxy
 

4935
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:23,450
R process Galaxy
let's go to the next one and the weather

4936
01:38:23,450 --> 01:38:23,460
let's go to the next one and the weather
 

4937
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:25,850
let's go to the next one and the weather
was degrading

4938
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:25,860
was degrading
 

4939
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:28,910
was degrading
um and so to cut a long story short

4940
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:28,920
um and so to cut a long story short
 

4941
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:32,030
um and so to cut a long story short
we had to come so he was observing the

4942
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:32,040
we had to come so he was observing the
 

4943
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:35,030
we had to come so he was observing the
right stores it was an r-process Galaxy

4944
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:35,040
right stores it was an r-process Galaxy
 

4945
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,669
right stores it was an r-process Galaxy
the first one we had ever discovered

4946
01:38:37,669 --> 01:38:37,679
the first one we had ever discovered
 

4947
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,410
the first one we had ever discovered
totally

4948
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:39,420
totally
 

4949
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:42,649
totally
and I mean unpredicted we had no idea

4950
01:38:42,649 --> 01:38:42,659
and I mean unpredicted we had no idea
 

4951
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:45,830
and I mean unpredicted we had no idea
that this was a thing I mean you know

4952
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:45,840
that this was a thing I mean you know
 

4953
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,709
that this was a thing I mean you know
of course we we thought that you know

4954
01:38:48,709 --> 01:38:48,719
of course we we thought that you know
 

4955
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:50,629
of course we we thought that you know
such a thing might possibly exist

4956
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:50,639
such a thing might possibly exist
 

4957
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,050
such a thing might possibly exist
because why not right Neutron summer

4958
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:54,060
because why not right Neutron summer
 

4959
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:57,830
because why not right Neutron summer
just happened somewhere uh crazy

4960
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:57,840
just happened somewhere uh crazy
 

4961
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,770
just happened somewhere uh crazy
supernovae probably too but we were not

4962
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:00,780
supernovae probably too but we were not
 

4963
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:03,410
supernovae probably too but we were not
prepared in that moment to to find this

4964
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:03,420
prepared in that moment to to find this
 

4965
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,430
prepared in that moment to to find this
thing

4966
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:04,440
thing
 

4967
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,050
thing
and

4968
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:06,060
and
 

4969
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,450
and
in the end the weather was getting worse

4970
01:39:08,450 --> 01:39:08,460
in the end the weather was getting worse
 

4971
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:11,450
in the end the weather was getting worse
and worse and we wanted to see how many

4972
01:39:11,450 --> 01:39:11,460
and worse and we wanted to see how many
 

4973
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:14,629
and worse and we wanted to see how many
our processors are in this galaxy so we

4974
01:39:14,629 --> 01:39:14,639
our processors are in this galaxy so we
 

4975
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,129
our processors are in this galaxy so we
managed

4976
01:39:16,129 --> 01:39:16,139
managed
 

4977
01:39:16,139 --> 01:39:19,070
managed
by a hairline to observe the nine

4978
01:39:19,070 --> 01:39:19,080
by a hairline to observe the nine
 

4979
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:21,290
by a hairline to observe the nine
brightest stars but the data quality was

4980
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:21,300
brightest stars but the data quality was
 

4981
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,390
brightest stars but the data quality was
atrocious and weather affects the data

4982
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:23,400
atrocious and weather affects the data
 

4983
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,010
atrocious and weather affects the data
quality yes absolutely because these

4984
01:39:25,010 --> 01:39:25,020
quality yes absolutely because these
 

4985
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:27,890
quality yes absolutely because these
were really faint Stars

4986
01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:27,900
were really faint Stars
 

4987
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:32,030
were really faint Stars
um so we we were really lucky by making

4988
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:32,040
um so we we were really lucky by making
 

4989
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,970
um so we we were really lucky by making
a very tight strategy of getting the

4990
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:34,980
a very tight strategy of getting the
 

4991
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:37,189
a very tight strategy of getting the
absolute bare minimum for all the stores

4992
01:39:37,189 --> 01:39:37,199
absolute bare minimum for all the stores
 

4993
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:40,189
absolute bare minimum for all the stores
so we could at least take a a very crude

4994
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:40,199
so we could at least take a a very crude
 

4995
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:42,530
so we could at least take a a very crude
look is it a yay or is an a we couldn't

4996
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:42,540
look is it a yay or is an a we couldn't
 

4997
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:44,810
look is it a yay or is an a we couldn't
even say yes or no just just to get an

4998
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:44,820
even say yes or no just just to get an
 

4999
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:47,689
even say yes or no just just to get an
idea because we needed to know

5000
01:39:47,689 --> 01:39:47,699
idea because we needed to know
 

5001
01:39:47,699 --> 01:39:50,149
idea because we needed to know
why was that important because

5002
01:39:50,149 --> 01:39:50,159
why was that important because
 

5003
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,729
why was that important because
we could only observe this system again

5004
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:52,739
we could only observe this system again
 

5005
01:39:52,739 --> 01:39:55,070
we could only observe this system again
nine months later so there's always a

5006
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:55,080
nine months later so there's always a
 

5007
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,530
nine months later so there's always a
window of observation yes it was setting

5008
01:39:57,530 --> 01:39:57,540
window of observation yes it was setting
 

5009
01:39:57,540 --> 01:40:00,169
window of observation yes it was setting
this was our chance and it was going

5010
01:40:00,169 --> 01:40:00,179
this was our chance and it was going
 

5011
01:40:00,179 --> 01:40:04,070
this was our chance and it was going
away with the clouds you know

5012
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:04,080
away with the clouds you know
 

5013
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:07,910
away with the clouds you know
that was super high stakes but we we we

5014
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:07,920
that was super high stakes but we we we
 

5015
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,490
that was super high stakes but we we we
just made it like really it was

5016
01:40:10,490 --> 01:40:10,500
just made it like really it was
 

5017
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,729
just made it like really it was
almost impossible and it was just the

5018
01:40:13,729 --> 01:40:13,739
almost impossible and it was just the
 

5019
01:40:13,739 --> 01:40:17,050
almost impossible and it was just the
the thing is this is such a

5020
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:17,060
the thing is this is such a
 

5021
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:19,850
the thing is this is such a
serendipitous moment in a serendipitous

5022
01:40:19,850 --> 01:40:19,860
serendipitous moment in a serendipitous
 

5023
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:22,070
serendipitous moment in a serendipitous
moment the enhancement of these heavy

5024
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:22,080
moment the enhancement of these heavy
 

5025
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:25,010
moment the enhancement of these heavy
elements was so strong that even in this

5026
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:25,020
elements was so strong that even in this
 

5027
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:27,410
elements was so strong that even in this
really crappy data we could still see

5028
01:40:27,410 --> 01:40:27,420
really crappy data we could still see
 

5029
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:28,970
really crappy data we could still see
the enhancement

5030
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:28,980
the enhancement
 

5031
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:30,890
the enhancement
right the absorption was so strong

5032
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:30,900
right the absorption was so strong
 

5033
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,229
right the absorption was so strong
they're stuck out of the noise if the

5034
01:40:33,229 --> 01:40:33,239
they're stuck out of the noise if the
 

5035
01:40:33,239 --> 01:40:35,149
they're stuck out of the noise if the
enhancement wouldn't have been as strong

5036
01:40:35,149 --> 01:40:35,159
enhancement wouldn't have been as strong
 

5037
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:37,129
enhancement wouldn't have been as strong
we would not have been able to say

5038
01:40:37,129 --> 01:40:37,139
we would not have been able to say
 

5039
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:38,629
we would not have been able to say
anything because we wouldn't have been

5040
01:40:38,629 --> 01:40:38,639
anything because we wouldn't have been
 

5041
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,250
anything because we wouldn't have been
able to tell

5042
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:40,260
able to tell
 

5043
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:43,250
able to tell
but because it was so extreme it lent us

5044
01:40:43,250 --> 01:40:43,260
but because it was so extreme it lent us
 

5045
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,189
but because it was so extreme it lent us
a hand despite the weather and all to

5046
01:40:46,189 --> 01:40:46,199
a hand despite the weather and all to
 

5047
01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:48,770
a hand despite the weather and all to
say like yes this is it

5048
01:40:48,770 --> 01:40:48,780
say like yes this is it
 

5049
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:52,790
say like yes this is it
so that was quite the night

5050
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:52,800
so that was quite the night
 

5051
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,770
so that was quite the night
look that means a lot of this is just

5052
01:40:54,770 --> 01:40:54,780
look that means a lot of this is just
 

5053
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:55,729
look that means a lot of this is just
luck

5054
01:40:55,729 --> 01:40:55,739
luck
 

5055
01:40:55,739 --> 01:40:57,530
luck
so that was the first our process Galaxy

5056
01:40:57,530 --> 01:40:57,540
so that was the first our process Galaxy
 

5057
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:00,050
so that was the first our process Galaxy
discovered yes I didn't sleep all that

5058
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:00,060
discovered yes I didn't sleep all that
 

5059
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,510
discovered yes I didn't sleep all that
much

5060
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:02,520

 

5061
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,910

um do you have hope are you excited

5062
01:41:04,910 --> 01:41:04,920
um do you have hope are you excited
 

5063
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:07,250
um do you have hope are you excited
about uh James Webb's Space Telescope

5064
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:07,260
about uh James Webb's Space Telescope
 

5065
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:09,770
about uh James Webb's Space Telescope
and other telescopes in the future that

5066
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:09,780
and other telescopes in the future that
 

5067
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,270
and other telescopes in the future that
uh increase the resolution and the

5068
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:11,280
uh increase the resolution and the
 

5069
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,729
uh increase the resolution and the
Precision of what can be detected out

5070
01:41:13,729 --> 01:41:13,739
Precision of what can be detected out
 

5071
01:41:13,739 --> 01:41:15,350
Precision of what can be detected out
there absolutely

5072
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,360
there absolutely
 

5073
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,530
there absolutely
um database is fantastic already I am

5074
01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:18,540
um database is fantastic already I am
 

5075
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:19,970
um database is fantastic already I am
not planning to use it personally

5076
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:19,980
not planning to use it personally
 

5077
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:22,250
not planning to use it personally
although I think I'm on one or two

5078
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:22,260
although I think I'm on one or two
 

5079
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:24,610
although I think I'm on one or two
observing proposals actually because

5080
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:24,620
observing proposals actually because
 

5081
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,750
observing proposals actually because
similar to what we already spoke about

5082
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:26,760
similar to what we already spoke about
 

5083
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:29,270
similar to what we already spoke about
we're interested in the same thing we're

5084
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:29,280
we're interested in the same thing we're
 

5085
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,470
we're interested in the same thing we're
just kind of looking at the different

5086
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:30,480
just kind of looking at the different
 

5087
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,590
just kind of looking at the different
sides of the fence right I have my my

5088
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:33,600
sides of the fence right I have my my
 

5089
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,350
sides of the fence right I have my my
old surviving stars and I concoct these

5090
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:36,360
old surviving stars and I concoct these
 

5091
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,030
old surviving stars and I concoct these
little stories about what the earliest

5092
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:38,040
little stories about what the earliest
 

5093
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:39,890
little stories about what the earliest
galaxies may have looked like what what

5094
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:39,900
galaxies may have looked like what what
 

5095
01:41:39,900 --> 01:41:41,990
galaxies may have looked like what what
the objects were that contributed you

5096
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:42,000
the objects were that contributed you
 

5097
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,390
the objects were that contributed you
know energy and and elements and all

5098
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:44,400
know energy and and elements and all
 

5099
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,930
know energy and and elements and all
these things and uh my jwst colleagues

5100
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:47,940
these things and uh my jwst colleagues
 

5101
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:50,330
these things and uh my jwst colleagues
they try to detect some of these

5102
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:50,340
they try to detect some of these
 

5103
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:51,830
they try to detect some of these
earliest photons from these earliest

5104
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:51,840
earliest photons from these earliest
 

5105
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,490
earliest photons from these earliest
systems to look at the energetics and

5106
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:55,500
systems to look at the energetics and
 

5107
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,229
systems to look at the energetics and
and other things you know what was there

5108
01:41:57,229 --> 01:41:57,239
and other things you know what was there
 

5109
01:41:57,239 --> 01:41:59,930
and other things you know what was there
how many these kind of things right so

5110
01:41:59,930 --> 01:41:59,940
how many these kind of things right so
 

5111
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:02,689
how many these kind of things right so
together we're trying to to explore this

5112
01:42:02,689 --> 01:42:02,699
together we're trying to to explore this
 

5113
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:04,609
together we're trying to to explore this
first billion years

5114
01:42:04,609 --> 01:42:04,619
first billion years
 

5115
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:06,530
first billion years
but we do it in very complementary ways

5116
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:06,540
but we do it in very complementary ways
 

5117
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:08,810
but we do it in very complementary ways
and so I'm I'm very excited to to see

5118
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:08,820
and so I'm I'm very excited to to see
 

5119
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:11,390
and so I'm I'm very excited to to see
what what they can come up with and how

5120
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:11,400
what what they can come up with and how
 

5121
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:14,750
what what they can come up with and how
that helps me to inform my stories

5122
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:14,760
that helps me to inform my stories
 

5123
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:17,149
that helps me to inform my stories
better and more comprehensively

5124
01:42:17,149 --> 01:42:17,159
better and more comprehensively
 

5125
01:42:17,159 --> 01:42:19,729
better and more comprehensively
uh what do you think is the future

5126
01:42:19,729 --> 01:42:19,739
uh what do you think is the future
 

5127
01:42:19,739 --> 01:42:22,010
uh what do you think is the future
of the of the field of Stellar

5128
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:22,020
of the of the field of Stellar
 

5129
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:24,470
of the of the field of Stellar
archeology how much can we

5130
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:24,480
archeology how much can we
 

5131
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,629
archeology how much can we
maybe what are the limits of our our

5132
01:42:26,629 --> 01:42:26,639
maybe what are the limits of our our
 

5133
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,010
maybe what are the limits of our our
understanding of this first billion

5134
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:28,020
understanding of this first billion
 

5135
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:31,550
understanding of this first billion
years of our uterus

5136
01:42:31,550 --> 01:42:31,560

 

5137
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:34,010

um well obviously lots of limitations in

5138
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:34,020
um well obviously lots of limitations in
 

5139
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:36,169
um well obviously lots of limitations in
the sense that I always say I have a

5140
01:42:36,169 --> 01:42:36,179
the sense that I always say I have a
 

5141
01:42:36,179 --> 01:42:37,609
the sense that I always say I have a
metal poor star for any of your

5142
01:42:37,609 --> 01:42:37,619
metal poor star for any of your
 

5143
01:42:37,619 --> 01:42:38,530
metal poor star for any of your
questions

5144
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:38,540
questions
 

5145
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:40,669
questions
because there are so many different

5146
01:42:40,669 --> 01:42:40,679
because there are so many different
 

5147
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:42,830
because there are so many different
kinds out there

5148
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:42,840
kinds out there
 

5149
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,689
kinds out there
um and we still find new patterns

5150
01:42:44,689 --> 01:42:44,699
um and we still find new patterns
 

5151
01:42:44,699 --> 01:42:46,370
um and we still find new patterns
sometimes right and there needs to be an

5152
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:46,380
sometimes right and there needs to be an
 

5153
01:42:46,380 --> 01:42:48,169
sometimes right and there needs to be an
explanation the question is is it

5154
01:42:48,169 --> 01:42:48,179
explanation the question is is it
 

5155
01:42:48,179 --> 01:42:50,149
explanation the question is is it
ultimately just one quirky star or is it

5156
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:50,159
ultimately just one quirky star or is it
 

5157
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,010
ultimately just one quirky star or is it
two or is it three right is it is it a

5158
01:42:52,010 --> 01:42:52,020
two or is it three right is it is it a
 

5159
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:54,169
two or is it three right is it is it a
sample is it a population so we haven't

5160
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:54,179
sample is it a population so we haven't
 

5161
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:56,570
sample is it a population so we haven't
concluded that kind of work yet so every

5162
01:42:56,570 --> 01:42:56,580
concluded that kind of work yet so every
 

5163
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:58,129
concluded that kind of work yet so every
metal poor star

5164
01:42:58,129 --> 01:42:58,139
metal poor star
 

5165
01:42:58,139 --> 01:43:00,169
metal poor star
is the kind of data point that you can

5166
01:43:00,169 --> 01:43:00,179
is the kind of data point that you can
 

5167
01:43:00,179 --> 01:43:02,149
is the kind of data point that you can
use to improve the quality of your model

5168
01:43:02,149 --> 01:43:02,159
use to improve the quality of your model
 

5169
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:04,250
use to improve the quality of your model
of how the evolution of the early

5170
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:04,260
of how the evolution of the early
 

5171
01:43:04,260 --> 01:43:08,270
of how the evolution of the early
Universe yes yes and I would say we're

5172
01:43:08,270 --> 01:43:08,280
Universe yes yes and I would say we're
 

5173
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,729
Universe yes yes and I would say we're
we've made huge progress over the last

5174
01:43:10,729 --> 01:43:10,739
we've made huge progress over the last
 

5175
01:43:10,739 --> 01:43:12,709
we've made huge progress over the last
20 years when I joined that field it was

5176
01:43:12,709 --> 01:43:12,719
20 years when I joined that field it was
 

5177
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:14,750
20 years when I joined that field it was
in its infancy and there was this

5178
01:43:14,750 --> 01:43:14,760
in its infancy and there was this
 

5179
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:16,550
in its infancy and there was this
serendipitous discovery of that first

5180
01:43:16,550 --> 01:43:16,560
serendipitous discovery of that first
 

5181
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,530
serendipitous discovery of that first
second generation star

5182
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:18,540
second generation star
 

5183
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:21,649
second generation star
and we have filled in the canvas a great

5184
01:43:21,649 --> 01:43:21,659
and we have filled in the canvas a great
 

5185
01:43:21,659 --> 01:43:24,530
and we have filled in the canvas a great
deal since then and this is what I have

5186
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:24,540
deal since then and this is what I have
 

5187
01:43:24,540 --> 01:43:27,649
deal since then and this is what I have
greatly enjoyed about doing so because

5188
01:43:27,649 --> 01:43:27,659
greatly enjoyed about doing so because
 

5189
01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:30,010
greatly enjoyed about doing so because
there was so much Discovery potential

5190
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:30,020
there was so much Discovery potential
 

5191
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:33,350
there was so much Discovery potential
and it's been it's been dying down a

5192
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:33,360
and it's been it's been dying down a
 

5193
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:36,770
and it's been it's been dying down a
little bit because of all the progress

5194
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:36,780
little bit because of all the progress
 

5195
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:39,530
little bit because of all the progress
um it's gonna it's gonna it's on on the

5196
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:39,540
um it's gonna it's gonna it's on on the
 

5197
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,270
um it's gonna it's gonna it's on on the
up and coming again because there's so

5198
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:41,280
up and coming again because there's so
 

5199
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:44,149
up and coming again because there's so
many large spectroscopic surveys in the

5200
01:43:44,149 --> 01:43:44,159
many large spectroscopic surveys in the
 

5201
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:46,370
many large spectroscopic surveys in the
works now that will just provide a

5202
01:43:46,370 --> 01:43:46,380
works now that will just provide a
 

5203
01:43:46,380 --> 01:43:48,229
works now that will just provide a
different level of data that we haven't

5204
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:48,239
different level of data that we haven't
 

5205
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:51,290
different level of data that we haven't
had before I'm sort of of these older

5206
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:51,300
had before I'm sort of of these older
 

5207
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:53,510
had before I'm sort of of these older
generation I have only very few

5208
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:53,520
generation I have only very few
 

5209
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:55,490
generation I have only very few
colleagues I work in small teams and I

5210
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:55,500
colleagues I work in small teams and I
 

5211
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,910
colleagues I work in small teams and I
observe every single star myself

5212
01:43:57,910 --> 01:43:57,920
observe every single star myself
 

5213
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,830
observe every single star myself
that you know I whatever I can I do

5214
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:00,840
that you know I whatever I can I do
 

5215
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:04,129
that you know I whatever I can I do
myself I don't generally take other

5216
01:44:04,129 --> 01:44:04,139
myself I don't generally take other
 

5217
01:44:04,139 --> 01:44:06,950
myself I don't generally take other
people's data at least not certainly not

5218
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:06,960
people's data at least not certainly not
 

5219
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:10,189
people's data at least not certainly not
in the end stage and and uh you know I'm

5220
01:44:10,189 --> 01:44:10,199
in the end stage and and uh you know I'm
 

5221
01:44:10,199 --> 01:44:12,649
in the end stage and and uh you know I'm
not a big data kind of person although

5222
01:44:12,649 --> 01:44:12,659
not a big data kind of person although
 

5223
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:15,290
not a big data kind of person although
we're all headed that that way I I

5224
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:15,300
we're all headed that that way I I
 

5225
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,490
we're all headed that that way I I
certainly use uh data from the Gaia

5226
01:44:18,490 --> 01:44:18,500
certainly use uh data from the Gaia
 

5227
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:21,169
certainly use uh data from the Gaia
astrometric satellite for the kinematics

5228
01:44:21,169 --> 01:44:21,179
astrometric satellite for the kinematics
 

5229
01:44:21,179 --> 01:44:23,930
astrometric satellite for the kinematics
for example but that's personally a new

5230
01:44:23,930 --> 01:44:23,940
for example but that's personally a new
 

5231
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:26,030
for example but that's personally a new
thing for me to to use sort of Big Sky

5232
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:26,040
thing for me to to use sort of Big Sky
 

5233
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,290
thing for me to to use sort of Big Sky
surveys

5234
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:27,300
surveys
 

5235
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:28,970
surveys
um that are available

5236
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:28,980
um that are available
 

5237
01:44:28,980 --> 01:44:31,430
um that are available
um so it's still very sort of hand grown

5238
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:31,440
um so it's still very sort of hand grown
 

5239
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:33,350
um so it's still very sort of hand grown
field you know where we do our

5240
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
field you know where we do our
 

5241
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,570
field you know where we do our
individual observations

5242
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:35,580
individual observations
 

5243
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:38,330
individual observations
um have enjoyed that a lot but that's

5244
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:38,340
um have enjoyed that a lot but that's
 

5245
01:44:38,340 --> 01:44:40,609
um have enjoyed that a lot but that's
about to change so one star at a time

5246
01:44:40,609 --> 01:44:40,619
about to change so one star at a time
 

5247
01:44:40,619 --> 01:44:42,530
about to change so one star at a time
yes I mean there's power to that to

5248
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:42,540
yes I mean there's power to that to
 

5249
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:44,629
yes I mean there's power to that to
build up intuition of the early Universe

5250
01:44:44,629 --> 01:44:44,639
build up intuition of the early Universe
 

5251
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:46,850
build up intuition of the early Universe
by looking one star at a time yeah and

5252
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:46,860
by looking one star at a time yeah and
 

5253
01:44:46,860 --> 01:44:48,530
by looking one star at a time yeah and
and this is how you can really drill

5254
01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:48,540
and this is how you can really drill
 

5255
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:50,149
and this is how you can really drill
down on the questions that you have

5256
01:44:50,149 --> 01:44:50,159
down on the questions that you have
 

5257
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,609
down on the questions that you have
right because you control what data you

5258
01:44:52,609 --> 01:44:52,619
right because you control what data you
 

5259
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:54,229
right because you control what data you
get

5260
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:54,239
get
 

5261
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,270
get
um otherwise you have the data that you

5262
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:56,280
um otherwise you have the data that you
 

5263
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:57,890
um otherwise you have the data that you
have right you get what you get and you

5264
01:44:57,890 --> 01:44:57,900
have right you get what you get and you
 

5265
01:44:57,900 --> 01:44:59,350
have right you get what you get and you
don't get upset

5266
01:44:59,350 --> 01:44:59,360
don't get upset
 

5267
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,550
don't get upset
I don't like that I'm a little bit

5268
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:01,560
I don't like that I'm a little bit
 

5269
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:04,370
I don't like that I'm a little bit
snobby I I really like to formulate my

5270
01:45:04,370 --> 01:45:04,380
snobby I I really like to formulate my
 

5271
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:06,290
snobby I I really like to formulate my
questions go to the telescope and then

5272
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:06,300
questions go to the telescope and then
 

5273
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,410
questions go to the telescope and then
come what may I will try to get it and I

5274
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:09,420
come what may I will try to get it and I
 

5275
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:11,090
come what may I will try to get it and I
also develop the intuition of where the

5276
01:45:11,090 --> 01:45:11,100
also develop the intuition of where the
 

5277
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,189
also develop the intuition of where the
data can be relied upon and what it

5278
01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:13,199
data can be relied upon and what it
 

5279
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,450
data can be relied upon and what it
can't and all the different quirks of

5280
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:14,460
can't and all the different quirks of
 

5281
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,830
can't and all the different quirks of
the data and all that kind of stuff yeah

5282
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:15,840
the data and all that kind of stuff yeah
 

5283
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,990
the data and all that kind of stuff yeah
sometimes a lot is lost

5284
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:18,000
sometimes a lot is lost
 

5285
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,450
sometimes a lot is lost
in the aggregation of the noisy data

5286
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:20,460
in the aggregation of the noisy data
 

5287
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:23,270
in the aggregation of the noisy data
yeah yeah yeah and and that's always the

5288
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:23,280
yeah yeah yeah and and that's always the
 

5289
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,830
yeah yeah yeah and and that's always the
danger if you have someone else's data

5290
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:24,840
danger if you have someone else's data
 

5291
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:25,910
danger if you have someone else's data
that you just don't really understand

5292
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:25,920
that you just don't really understand
 

5293
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,370
that you just don't really understand
the you know the limitations and

5294
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:28,380
the you know the limitations and
 

5295
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:31,189
the you know the limitations and
completeness things how certain things

5296
01:45:31,189 --> 01:45:31,199
completeness things how certain things
 

5297
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:34,310
completeness things how certain things
were set up and you know you get out

5298
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:34,320
were set up and you know you get out
 

5299
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,470
were set up and you know you get out
what you put in so I'm I'm really

5300
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:36,480
what you put in so I'm I'm really
 

5301
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:38,689
what you put in so I'm I'm really
particular about that and it certainly

5302
01:45:38,689 --> 01:45:38,699
particular about that and it certainly
 

5303
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:40,970
particular about that and it certainly
paid off for me that's one of the main

5304
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:40,980
paid off for me that's one of the main
 

5305
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:43,310
paid off for me that's one of the main
Notions that I try to teach in my

5306
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:43,320
Notions that I try to teach in my
 

5307
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:46,729
Notions that I try to teach in my
classes and to my my students that

5308
01:45:46,729 --> 01:45:46,739
classes and to my my students that
 

5309
01:45:46,739 --> 01:45:48,950
classes and to my my students that
you need to be able to formulate your

5310
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:48,960
you need to be able to formulate your
 

5311
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:50,510
you need to be able to formulate your
quest question really well because

5312
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:50,520
quest question really well because
 

5313
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:51,830
quest question really well because
otherwise you're going to get an answer

5314
01:45:51,830 --> 01:45:51,840
otherwise you're going to get an answer
 

5315
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,169
otherwise you're going to get an answer
to a different question but you won't

5316
01:45:54,169 --> 01:45:54,179
to a different question but you won't
 

5317
01:45:54,179 --> 01:45:56,390
to a different question but you won't
notice that it had that the goal post

5318
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:56,400
notice that it had that the goal post
 

5319
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,729
notice that it had that the goal post
has shifted in the meantime right so

5320
01:45:58,729 --> 01:45:58,739
has shifted in the meantime right so
 

5321
01:45:58,739 --> 01:46:00,350
has shifted in the meantime right so
your interpretation can only be as good

5322
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:00,360
your interpretation can only be as good
 

5323
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:02,209
your interpretation can only be as good
as the question if you need to change

5324
01:46:02,209 --> 01:46:02,219
as the question if you need to change
 

5325
01:46:02,219 --> 01:46:05,930
as the question if you need to change
your question that's cool do it

5326
01:46:05,930 --> 01:46:05,940
your question that's cool do it
 

5327
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:07,970
your question that's cool do it
but then you know it needs to pair up

5328
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:07,980
but then you know it needs to pair up
 

5329
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:10,450
but then you know it needs to pair up
with your interpretation again and so

5330
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:10,460
with your interpretation again and so
 

5331
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:13,729
with your interpretation again and so
knowing really being in the know about

5332
01:46:13,729 --> 01:46:13,739
knowing really being in the know about
 

5333
01:46:13,739 --> 01:46:16,010
knowing really being in the know about
every step of what happens that relates

5334
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:16,020
every step of what happens that relates
 

5335
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:18,290
every step of what happens that relates
to Quality results I think that's why I

5336
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:18,300
to Quality results I think that's why I
 

5337
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:19,910
to Quality results I think that's why I
have sometimes a little trouble with

5338
01:46:19,910 --> 01:46:19,920
have sometimes a little trouble with
 

5339
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:21,649
have sometimes a little trouble with
with sort of big data and statistical

5340
01:46:21,649 --> 01:46:21,659
with sort of big data and statistical
 

5341
01:46:21,659 --> 01:46:25,129
with sort of big data and statistical
analysis yes on average that's true I'm

5342
01:46:25,129 --> 01:46:25,139
analysis yes on average that's true I'm
 

5343
01:46:25,139 --> 01:46:27,890
analysis yes on average that's true I'm
not debating that but I I'm the kind of

5344
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:27,900
not debating that but I I'm the kind of
 

5345
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:30,290
not debating that but I I'm the kind of
person I like to look at the outlier so

5346
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:30,300
person I like to look at the outlier so
 

5347
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,450
person I like to look at the outlier so
not the bulk but you know the special

5348
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:32,460
not the bulk but you know the special
 

5349
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:35,750
not the bulk but you know the special
ones and they just need to be treated in

5350
01:46:35,750 --> 01:46:35,760
ones and they just need to be treated in
 

5351
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:37,010
ones and they just need to be treated in
a different way and there needs to be an

5352
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:37,020
a different way and there needs to be an
 

5353
01:46:37,020 --> 01:46:38,990
a different way and there needs to be an
acknowledgment of that different ways

5354
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:39,000
acknowledgment of that different ways
 

5355
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,510
acknowledgment of that different ways
for different things so uh big data can

5356
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:41,520
for different things so uh big data can
 

5357
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,910
for different things so uh big data can
look at uh divorce rates

5358
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:43,920
look at uh divorce rates
 

5359
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:46,189
look at uh divorce rates
and uh perhaps you and I are more

5360
01:46:46,189 --> 01:46:46,199
and uh perhaps you and I are more
 

5361
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:47,330
and uh perhaps you and I are more
interested in the individual love

5362
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:47,340
interested in the individual love
 

5363
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:51,950
interested in the individual love
stories yes

5364
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:51,960

 

5365
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,390

um so

5366
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:53,400
um so
 

5367
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,250
um so
I don't know if it's possible to say but

5368
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:55,260
I don't know if it's possible to say but
 

5369
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:56,990
I don't know if it's possible to say but
what do you think is the big discoveries

5370
01:46:56,990 --> 01:46:57,000
what do you think is the big discoveries
 

5371
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,910
what do you think is the big discoveries
that are waiting

5372
01:46:58,910 --> 01:46:58,920
that are waiting
 

5373
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:02,030
that are waiting
uh is it on the different dynamics of

5374
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:02,040
uh is it on the different dynamics of
 

5375
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,590
uh is it on the different dynamics of
the yield

5376
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:03,600
the yield
 

5377
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,229
the yield
the common narrative the common story of

5378
01:47:06,229 --> 01:47:06,239
the common narrative the common story of
 

5379
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:09,290
the common narrative the common story of
how some of these metal poor stars are

5380
01:47:09,290 --> 01:47:09,300
how some of these metal poor stars are
 

5381
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:10,490
how some of these metal poor stars are
formed

5382
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:10,500
formed
 

5383
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,470
formed
is it where are the discoveries in this

5384
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:12,480
is it where are the discoveries in this
 

5385
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,870
is it where are the discoveries in this
field that you think will come

5386
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:14,880
field that you think will come
 

5387
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,470
field that you think will come
I think the individual discoveries are

5388
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:18,480
I think the individual discoveries are
 

5389
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,430
I think the individual discoveries are
actually

5390
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:19,440
actually
 

5391
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,430
actually
we've made most of those certainly

5392
01:47:22,430 --> 01:47:22,440
we've made most of those certainly
 

5393
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:25,790
we've made most of those certainly
through individual Stars

5394
01:47:25,790 --> 01:47:25,800
through individual Stars
 

5395
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,770
through individual Stars
um finding yet another second generation

5396
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:27,780
um finding yet another second generation
 

5397
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:30,590
um finding yet another second generation
size incredibly important for me but

5398
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:30,600
size incredibly important for me but
 

5399
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:32,390
size incredibly important for me but
isn't isn't really going to move the

5400
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:32,400
isn't isn't really going to move the
 

5401
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,530
isn't isn't really going to move the
needle

5402
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:33,540
needle
 

5403
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:35,990
needle
finding 50 of them or 100 of them that

5404
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:36,000
finding 50 of them or 100 of them that
 

5405
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,729
finding 50 of them or 100 of them that
would move the needle but that's in

5406
01:47:37,729 --> 01:47:37,739
would move the needle but that's in
 

5407
01:47:37,739 --> 01:47:40,550
would move the needle but that's in
order or two magnitudes up

5408
01:47:40,550 --> 01:47:40,560
order or two magnitudes up
 

5409
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,870
order or two magnitudes up
and new search techniques and new uh

5410
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:44,880
and new search techniques and new uh
 

5411
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,750
and new search techniques and new uh
surveys may enable that but would you

5412
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:47,760
surveys may enable that but would you
 

5413
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,850
surveys may enable that but would you
still call that a discovery

5414
01:47:49,850 --> 01:47:49,860
still call that a discovery
 

5415
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:52,310
still call that a discovery
right so that's just a scale that's a

5416
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:52,320
right so that's just a scale that's a
 

5417
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,709
right so that's just a scale that's a
scale yes so I think about it more like

5418
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:54,719
scale yes so I think about it more like
 

5419
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:57,109
scale yes so I think about it more like
literally of the puzzle let's say you

5420
01:47:57,109 --> 01:47:57,119
literally of the puzzle let's say you
 

5421
01:47:57,119 --> 01:47:58,850
literally of the puzzle let's say you
have a thousand piece puzzle and you

5422
01:47:58,850 --> 01:47:58,860
have a thousand piece puzzle and you
 

5423
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:01,910
have a thousand piece puzzle and you
know you have 900 pieces in there

5424
01:48:01,910 --> 01:48:01,920
know you have 900 pieces in there
 

5425
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,609
know you have 900 pieces in there
if you're a person like me I want to get

5426
01:48:04,609 --> 01:48:04,619
if you're a person like me I want to get
 

5427
01:48:04,619 --> 01:48:06,590
if you're a person like me I want to get
to the last ones I'm not gonna leave it

5428
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:06,600
to the last ones I'm not gonna leave it
 

5429
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:08,450
to the last ones I'm not gonna leave it
it's like okay I see broadly what this

5430
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:08,460
it's like okay I see broadly what this
 

5431
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,430
it's like okay I see broadly what this
is going to look like right I'm done now

5432
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:10,440
is going to look like right I'm done now
 

5433
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:13,669
is going to look like right I'm done now
no I want to get to the last one

5434
01:48:13,669 --> 01:48:13,679
no I want to get to the last one
 

5435
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:16,310
no I want to get to the last one
so is the picture globally going to

5436
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:16,320
so is the picture globally going to
 

5437
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,109
so is the picture globally going to
change no

5438
01:48:18,109 --> 01:48:18,119
change no
 

5439
01:48:18,119 --> 01:48:19,850
change no
are we going to figure out all the

5440
01:48:19,850 --> 01:48:19,860
are we going to figure out all the
 

5441
01:48:19,860 --> 01:48:22,250
are we going to figure out all the
details and how it really works yes

5442
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:22,260
details and how it really works yes
 

5443
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:25,310
details and how it really works yes
right so really careful getting detail

5444
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:25,320
right so really careful getting detail
 

5445
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:29,209
right so really careful getting detail
into it the the ancient uh the ancient

5446
01:48:29,209 --> 01:48:29,219
into it the the ancient uh the ancient
 

5447
01:48:29,219 --> 01:48:31,310
into it the the ancient uh the ancient
stars of our universe yeah because I

5448
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:31,320
stars of our universe yeah because I
 

5449
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,709
stars of our universe yeah because I
think that's what many of us scientists

5450
01:48:33,709 --> 01:48:33,719
think that's what many of us scientists
 

5451
01:48:33,719 --> 01:48:36,290
think that's what many of us scientists
are a real little bit detailed obsessed

5452
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:36,300
are a real little bit detailed obsessed
 

5453
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,090
are a real little bit detailed obsessed
but I think that's that's our job too

5454
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:38,100
but I think that's that's our job too
 

5455
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:40,129
but I think that's that's our job too
right to really kind of make it airtight

5456
01:48:40,129 --> 01:48:40,139
right to really kind of make it airtight
 

5457
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:43,669
right to really kind of make it airtight
to really walk away saying I fully

5458
01:48:43,669 --> 01:48:43,679
to really walk away saying I fully
 

5459
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:47,990
to really walk away saying I fully
understand this not just broadly

5460
01:48:47,990 --> 01:48:48,000
understand this not just broadly
 

5461
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,149
understand this not just broadly
but you know I really know we really

5462
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:50,159
but you know I really know we really
 

5463
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:53,750
but you know I really know we really
know now and so more and more of that is

5464
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:53,760
know now and so more and more of that is
 

5465
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,609
know now and so more and more of that is
going to happen

5466
01:48:55,609 --> 01:48:55,619
going to happen
 

5467
01:48:55,619 --> 01:48:57,649
going to happen
um and so I think this is probably true

5468
01:48:57,649 --> 01:48:57,659
um and so I think this is probably true
 

5469
01:48:57,659 --> 01:49:00,470
um and so I think this is probably true
across astronomy these individual

5470
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:00,480
across astronomy these individual
 

5471
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,050
across astronomy these individual
10 Sigma discoveries become less and

5472
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:03,060
10 Sigma discoveries become less and
 

5473
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:04,310
10 Sigma discoveries become less and
less

5474
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:04,320
less
 

5475
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,470
less
if they were easy we would have made

5476
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:06,480
if they were easy we would have made
 

5477
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,510
if they were easy we would have made
them already right which means we have

5478
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:08,520
them already right which means we have
 

5479
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:12,290
them already right which means we have
made many of them but really filling in

5480
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:12,300
made many of them but really filling in
 

5481
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:15,709
made many of them but really filling in
the details is is is is is the next sort

5482
01:49:15,709 --> 01:49:15,719
the details is is is is is the next sort
 

5483
01:49:15,719 --> 01:49:18,169
the details is is is is is the next sort
of level of Discovery maybe we need to

5484
01:49:18,169 --> 01:49:18,179
of level of Discovery maybe we need to
 

5485
01:49:18,179 --> 01:49:20,330
of level of Discovery maybe we need to
find a new word for that

5486
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:20,340
find a new word for that
 

5487
01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:21,189
find a new word for that
um

5488
01:49:21,189 --> 01:49:21,199
um
 

5489
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:23,810
um
the hopes and expectations that go along

5490
01:49:23,810 --> 01:49:23,820
the hopes and expectations that go along
 

5491
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:26,350
the hopes and expectations that go along
with the word Discovery are so enormous

5492
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:26,360
with the word Discovery are so enormous
 

5493
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:29,330
with the word Discovery are so enormous
we we may not always be able to live up

5494
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:29,340
we we may not always be able to live up
 

5495
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,970
we we may not always be able to live up
to that but it doesn't mean that we're

5496
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:31,980
to that but it doesn't mean that we're
 

5497
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:34,910
to that but it doesn't mean that we're
not finding out new things it's just a

5498
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:34,920
not finding out new things it's just a
 

5499
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,470
not finding out new things it's just a
different kind of quality because the

5500
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:36,480
different kind of quality because the
 

5501
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,930
different kind of quality because the
questions have shifted you close one

5502
01:49:38,930 --> 01:49:38,940
questions have shifted you close one
 

5503
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:41,570
questions have shifted you close one
door suddenly that 10 new open doors

5504
01:49:41,570 --> 01:49:41,580
door suddenly that 10 new open doors
 

5505
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:43,729
door suddenly that 10 new open doors
that that we want to explore and March

5506
01:49:43,729 --> 01:49:43,739
that that we want to explore and March
 

5507
01:49:43,739 --> 01:49:46,129
that that we want to explore and March
through and that's the you know finding

5508
01:49:46,129 --> 01:49:46,139
through and that's the you know finding
 

5509
01:49:46,139 --> 01:49:47,930
through and that's the you know finding
these last puzzle pieces here and there

5510
01:49:47,930 --> 01:49:47,940
these last puzzle pieces here and there
 

5511
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:51,169
these last puzzle pieces here and there
that Miri make it airtight so there's a

5512
01:49:51,169 --> 01:49:51,179
that Miri make it airtight so there's a
 

5513
01:49:51,179 --> 01:49:52,930
that Miri make it airtight so there's a
lot of value a lot of power and Beauty

5514
01:49:52,930 --> 01:49:52,940
lot of value a lot of power and Beauty
 

5515
01:49:52,940 --> 01:49:55,310
lot of value a lot of power and Beauty
to the discovery

5516
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:55,320
to the discovery
 

5517
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:57,649
to the discovery
in the big picture of our universe and

5518
01:49:57,649 --> 01:49:57,659
in the big picture of our universe and
 

5519
01:49:57,659 --> 01:50:00,770
in the big picture of our universe and
in the details yeah we need both

5520
01:50:00,770 --> 01:50:00,780
in the details yeah we need both
 

5521
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:02,530
in the details yeah we need both
absolutely

5522
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:02,540
absolutely
 

5523
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:04,850
absolutely
uh perhaps drifting into the

5524
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:04,860
uh perhaps drifting into the
 

5525
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:07,370
uh perhaps drifting into the
philosophical uh let me ask about the

5526
01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:07,380
philosophical uh let me ask about the
 

5527
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:10,970
philosophical uh let me ask about the
Big Bang as we kind of encroach onto it

5528
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:10,980
Big Bang as we kind of encroach onto it
 

5529
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:13,669
Big Bang as we kind of encroach onto it
so your work is kind of taking steps

5530
01:50:13,669 --> 01:50:13,679
so your work is kind of taking steps
 

5531
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:16,430
so your work is kind of taking steps
back through time in a weird way

5532
01:50:16,430 --> 01:50:16,440
back through time in a weird way
 

5533
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:19,250
back through time in a weird way
do you think we'll get to deeper and

5534
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:19,260
do you think we'll get to deeper and
 

5535
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:21,470
do you think we'll get to deeper and
deeper understand

5536
01:50:21,470 --> 01:50:21,480
deeper understand
 

5537
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:23,990
deeper understand
the really really early days of the Big

5538
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:24,000
the really really early days of the Big
 

5539
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,830
the really really early days of the Big
Bang

5540
01:50:24,830 --> 01:50:24,840
Bang
 

5541
01:50:24,840 --> 01:50:27,890
Bang
and um the philosophical question do you

5542
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:27,900
and um the philosophical question do you
 

5543
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:29,390
and um the philosophical question do you
think we'll be able to understand what

5544
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:29,400
think we'll be able to understand what
 

5545
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,010
think we'll be able to understand what
was before the Big Bang

5546
01:50:31,010 --> 01:50:31,020
was before the Big Bang
 

5547
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:33,229
was before the Big Bang
or why the Big Bang happened you think

5548
01:50:33,229 --> 01:50:33,239
or why the Big Bang happened you think
 

5549
01:50:33,239 --> 01:50:35,209
or why the Big Bang happened you think
about that stuff

5550
01:50:35,209 --> 01:50:35,219
about that stuff
 

5551
01:50:35,219 --> 01:50:37,790
about that stuff
um not with stars For Better or For

5552
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:37,800
um not with stars For Better or For
 

5553
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,850
um not with stars For Better or For
Worse because you know Stars only probe

5554
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:40,860
Worse because you know Stars only probe
 

5555
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:43,729
Worse because you know Stars only probe
the time when they were formed and the

5556
01:50:43,729 --> 01:50:43,739
the time when they were formed and the
 

5557
01:50:43,739 --> 01:50:47,030
the time when they were formed and the
Big Bang is surely before then I mean I

5558
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:47,040
Big Bang is surely before then I mean I
 

5559
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,770
Big Bang is surely before then I mean I
I often talk to my students about the

5560
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:48,780
I often talk to my students about the
 

5561
01:50:48,780 --> 01:50:51,229
I often talk to my students about the
difference between math and physics let

5562
01:50:51,229 --> 01:50:51,239
difference between math and physics let
 

5563
01:50:51,239 --> 01:50:53,689
difference between math and physics let
me give you an example um we talked

5564
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:53,699
me give you an example um we talked
 

5565
01:50:53,699 --> 01:50:56,390
me give you an example um we talked
earlier about 80 1523 and you know I I

5566
01:50:56,390 --> 01:50:56,400
earlier about 80 1523 and you know I I
 

5567
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,250
earlier about 80 1523 and you know I I
was happy to to share with you that I

5568
01:50:58,250 --> 01:50:58,260
was happy to to share with you that I
 

5569
01:50:58,260 --> 01:50:59,689
was happy to to share with you that I
measure thorium and uranium but I

5570
01:50:59,689 --> 01:50:59,699
measure thorium and uranium but I
 

5571
01:50:59,699 --> 01:51:01,910
measure thorium and uranium but I
actually didn't quite close that Loop so

5572
01:51:01,910 --> 01:51:01,920
actually didn't quite close that Loop so
 

5573
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,490
actually didn't quite close that Loop so
we we did this to try to attempt to

5574
01:51:04,490 --> 01:51:04,500
we we did this to try to attempt to
 

5575
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:08,570
we we did this to try to attempt to
calculate an age for these Stars right

5576
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:08,580
calculate an age for these Stars right
 

5577
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:12,050
calculate an age for these Stars right
um but they rely on us knowing how the r

5578
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:12,060
um but they rely on us knowing how the r
 

5579
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:14,510
um but they rely on us knowing how the r
process works how these elements are

5580
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:14,520
process works how these elements are
 

5581
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:17,709
process works how these elements are
created where it happens and then how

5582
01:51:17,709 --> 01:51:17,719
created where it happens and then how
 

5583
01:51:17,719 --> 01:51:19,970
created where it happens and then how
those elements get dispersed into the

5584
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:19,980
those elements get dispersed into the
 

5585
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:21,709
those elements get dispersed into the
gas and end up in the next Generation

5586
01:51:21,709 --> 01:51:21,719
gas and end up in the next Generation
 

5587
01:51:21,719 --> 01:51:24,890
gas and end up in the next Generation
store so quite a few question marks so

5588
01:51:24,890 --> 01:51:24,900
store so quite a few question marks so
 

5589
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:27,229
store so quite a few question marks so
that's how we got to the age of 13.2

5590
01:51:27,229 --> 01:51:27,239
that's how we got to the age of 13.2
 

5591
01:51:27,239 --> 01:51:30,229
that's how we got to the age of 13.2
billion years this is probably not

5592
01:51:30,229 --> 01:51:30,239
billion years this is probably not
 

5593
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,330
billion years this is probably not
accurate but this is the best

5594
01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:32,340
accurate but this is the best
 

5595
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:35,090
accurate but this is the best
calculation we could do

5596
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:35,100
calculation we could do
 

5597
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:37,310
calculation we could do
um and uh the reason why I'm bringing

5598
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:37,320
um and uh the reason why I'm bringing
 

5599
01:51:37,320 --> 01:51:38,689
um and uh the reason why I'm bringing
this up is that that was actually the

5600
01:51:38,689 --> 01:51:38,699
this up is that that was actually the
 

5601
01:51:38,699 --> 01:51:40,790
this up is that that was actually the
average of multiple

5602
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:40,800
average of multiple
 

5603
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,010
average of multiple
um Elemental ratios that each gave a

5604
01:51:43,010 --> 01:51:43,020
um Elemental ratios that each gave a
 

5605
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:44,810
um Elemental ratios that each gave a
certain age and then we average that

5606
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:44,820
certain age and then we average that
 

5607
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:47,149
certain age and then we average that
because For Better or For Worse this is

5608
01:51:47,149 --> 01:51:47,159
because For Better or For Worse this is
 

5609
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:49,609
because For Better or For Worse this is
the best we can do so some of these

5610
01:51:49,609 --> 01:51:49,619
the best we can do so some of these
 

5611
01:51:49,619 --> 01:51:53,030
the best we can do so some of these
numbers said oh this star is 15 billion

5612
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:53,040
numbers said oh this star is 15 billion
 

5613
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,189
numbers said oh this star is 15 billion
years old and then others said oh this

5614
01:51:55,189 --> 01:51:55,199
years old and then others said oh this
 

5615
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:57,229
years old and then others said oh this
is 10 billion years old and so I often

5616
01:51:57,229 --> 01:51:57,239
is 10 billion years old and so I often
 

5617
01:51:57,239 --> 01:52:00,890
is 10 billion years old and so I often
use that in my class to say like

5618
01:52:00,890 --> 01:52:00,900

 

5619
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:02,990

what's the good news and what's the bad

5620
01:52:02,990 --> 01:52:03,000
what's the good news and what's the bad
 

5621
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,470
what's the good news and what's the bad
news here some ratio said 15 something

5622
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:06,480
news here some ratio said 15 something
 

5623
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:10,850
news here some ratio said 15 something
10 right is 15 correct

5624
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:10,860
10 right is 15 correct
 

5625
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:12,830
10 right is 15 correct
and then I asked to ask them and some

5626
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:12,840
and then I asked to ask them and some
 

5627
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:14,330
and then I asked to ask them and some
people will say something

5628
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:14,340
people will say something
 

5629
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:17,270
people will say something
and so the the thing here is that it's

5630
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:17,280
and so the the thing here is that it's
 

5631
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:19,850
and so the the thing here is that it's
an absolutely correct calculation given

5632
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:19,860
an absolutely correct calculation given
 

5633
01:52:19,860 --> 01:52:21,950
an absolutely correct calculation given
the mathematical and physical model that

5634
01:52:21,950 --> 01:52:21,960
the mathematical and physical model that
 

5635
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:25,609
the mathematical and physical model that
we constructed but does it make sense no

5636
01:52:25,609 --> 01:52:25,619
we constructed but does it make sense no
 

5637
01:52:25,619 --> 01:52:27,590
we constructed but does it make sense no
it doesn't if we believe the universe is

5638
01:52:27,590 --> 01:52:27,600
it doesn't if we believe the universe is
 

5639
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:30,109
it doesn't if we believe the universe is
13.8 billion years old

5640
01:52:30,109 --> 01:52:30,119
13.8 billion years old
 

5641
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:33,649
13.8 billion years old
15 is is ridiculous yet it is correct

5642
01:52:33,649 --> 01:52:33,659
15 is is ridiculous yet it is correct
 

5643
01:52:33,659 --> 01:52:35,990
15 is is ridiculous yet it is correct
isn't that interesting correct from a

5644
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:36,000
isn't that interesting correct from a
 

5645
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,609
isn't that interesting correct from a
mathematics perspective it is not

5646
01:52:37,609 --> 01:52:37,619
mathematics perspective it is not
 

5647
01:52:37,619 --> 01:52:39,290
mathematics perspective it is not
incorrect because this is what I

5648
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:39,300
incorrect because this is what I
 

5649
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:41,689
incorrect because this is what I
calculated nobody made a mistake now we

5650
01:52:41,689 --> 01:52:41,699
calculated nobody made a mistake now we
 

5651
01:52:41,699 --> 01:52:43,209
calculated nobody made a mistake now we
can question whether that's a good model

5652
01:52:43,209 --> 01:52:43,219
can question whether that's a good model
 

5653
01:52:43,219 --> 01:52:45,950
can question whether that's a good model
but that's that's a separate issue so

5654
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:45,960
but that's that's a separate issue so
 

5655
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,510
but that's that's a separate issue so
you're saying physicists are much closer

5656
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:47,520
you're saying physicists are much closer
 

5657
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:50,570
you're saying physicists are much closer
to truth than mathematicians well it

5658
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:50,580
to truth than mathematicians well it
 

5659
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:53,090
to truth than mathematicians well it
depends yeah sometimes yes and sometimes

5660
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:53,100
depends yeah sometimes yes and sometimes
 

5661
01:52:53,100 --> 01:52:55,850
depends yeah sometimes yes and sometimes
no right so yeah what our job as

5662
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:55,860
no right so yeah what our job as
 

5663
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:58,129
no right so yeah what our job as
physicist is is to take the mathematical

5664
01:52:58,129 --> 01:52:58,139
physicist is is to take the mathematical
 

5665
01:52:58,139 --> 01:53:00,649
physicist is is to take the mathematical
model calculate our numbers and then ask

5666
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:00,659
model calculate our numbers and then ask
 

5667
01:53:00,659 --> 01:53:03,290
model calculate our numbers and then ask
the question does this make sense right

5668
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:03,300
the question does this make sense right
 

5669
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:04,970
the question does this make sense right
now

5670
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:04,980
now
 

5671
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:08,330
now
in the case of 15 it doesn't but we took

5672
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:08,340
in the case of 15 it doesn't but we took
 

5673
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:10,570
in the case of 15 it doesn't but we took
the average anyway because

5674
01:53:10,570 --> 01:53:10,580
the average anyway because
 

5675
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:13,370
the average anyway because
that was the the best we could do right

5676
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:13,380
that was the the best we could do right
 

5677
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:15,530
that was the the best we could do right
so all right let's put that aside let's

5678
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:15,540
so all right let's put that aside let's
 

5679
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:17,149
so all right let's put that aside let's
apply the same sort of thinking to the

5680
01:53:17,149 --> 01:53:17,159
apply the same sort of thinking to the
 

5681
01:53:17,159 --> 01:53:19,850
apply the same sort of thinking to the
Big Bang right math can tell us things

5682
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:19,860
Big Bang right math can tell us things
 

5683
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:22,189
Big Bang right math can tell us things
that we as physicists cannot grasp

5684
01:53:22,189 --> 01:53:22,199
that we as physicists cannot grasp
 

5685
01:53:22,199 --> 01:53:24,470
that we as physicists cannot grasp
because it doesn't make sense to us now

5686
01:53:24,470 --> 01:53:24,480
because it doesn't make sense to us now
 

5687
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:26,090
because it doesn't make sense to us now
in the case of the big band that's big

5688
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:26,100
in the case of the big band that's big
 

5689
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:29,030
in the case of the big band that's big
bang that's a special case because we

5690
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:29,040
bang that's a special case because we
 

5691
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:30,350
bang that's a special case because we
don't actually know what's supposed to

5692
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:30,360
don't actually know what's supposed to
 

5693
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:33,109
don't actually know what's supposed to
make sense yeah and this is where things

5694
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:33,119
make sense yeah and this is where things
 

5695
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:35,090
make sense yeah and this is where things
get interesting but this is where math

5696
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:35,100
get interesting but this is where math
 

5697
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,609
get interesting but this is where math
will ultimately be the winner because we

5698
01:53:37,609 --> 01:53:37,619
will ultimately be the winner because we
 

5699
01:53:37,619 --> 01:53:39,350
will ultimately be the winner because we
can no longer say this makes sense or

5700
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:39,360
can no longer say this makes sense or
 

5701
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,330
can no longer say this makes sense or
this doesn't make sense because the

5702
01:53:41,330 --> 01:53:41,340
this doesn't make sense because the
 

5703
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:43,729
this doesn't make sense because the
physics is broken down but math breaks

5704
01:53:43,729 --> 01:53:43,739
physics is broken down but math breaks
 

5705
01:53:43,739 --> 01:53:45,609
physics is broken down but math breaks
down too in the singularity of things

5706
01:53:45,609 --> 01:53:45,619
down too in the singularity of things
 

5707
01:53:45,619 --> 01:53:49,330
down too in the singularity of things
well or no depending on who you ask okay

5708
01:53:49,330 --> 01:53:49,340
well or no depending on who you ask okay
 

5709
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:52,010
well or no depending on who you ask okay
sure sure this is this is the current

5710
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:52,020
sure sure this is this is the current
 

5711
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:55,070
sure sure this is this is the current
question right how far how much further

5712
01:53:55,070 --> 01:53:55,080
question right how far how much further
 

5713
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:57,709
question right how far how much further
can we push math let's say to the front

5714
01:53:57,709 --> 01:53:57,719
can we push math let's say to the front
 

5715
01:53:57,719 --> 01:54:00,649
can we push math let's say to the front
of the Big Bang if there is such a thing

5716
01:54:00,649 --> 01:54:00,659
of the Big Bang if there is such a thing
 

5717
01:54:00,659 --> 01:54:02,090
of the Big Bang if there is such a thing
um what's the front in the back what's

5718
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:02,100
um what's the front in the back what's
 

5719
01:54:02,100 --> 01:54:05,510
um what's the front in the back what's
the front before the Big Bang the front

5720
01:54:05,510 --> 01:54:05,520
the front before the Big Bang the front
 

5721
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:10,570
the front before the Big Bang the front
okay

5722
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:10,580

 

5723
01:54:10,580 --> 01:54:15,250

so how far can we let the math go before

5724
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:15,260
so how far can we let the math go before
 

5725
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:17,689
so how far can we let the math go before
that stops to make sense right and I

5726
01:54:17,689 --> 01:54:17,699
that stops to make sense right and I
 

5727
01:54:17,699 --> 01:54:19,010
that stops to make sense right and I
don't know what the answer is to that

5728
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:19,020
don't know what the answer is to that
 

5729
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,990
don't know what the answer is to that
but it's it's really cool that because

5730
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:21,000
but it's it's really cool that because
 

5731
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,390
but it's it's really cool that because
math doesn't have is not limited by of

5732
01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:23,400
math doesn't have is not limited by of
 

5733
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:25,609
math doesn't have is not limited by of
our physical nature

5734
01:54:25,609 --> 01:54:25,619
our physical nature
 

5735
01:54:25,619 --> 01:54:27,890
our physical nature
it can probably go a little bit further

5736
01:54:27,890 --> 01:54:27,900
it can probably go a little bit further
 

5737
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:30,530
it can probably go a little bit further
than the physics yeah right and math can

5738
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:30,540
than the physics yeah right and math can
 

5739
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:31,850
than the physics yeah right and math can
go into uh

5740
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:31,860
go into uh
 

5741
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:33,770
go into uh
more Dimensions than four dimensions

5742
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:33,780
more Dimensions than four dimensions
 

5743
01:54:33,780 --> 01:54:36,169
more Dimensions than four dimensions
comfortably and it's it's judgment free

5744
01:54:36,169 --> 01:54:36,179
comfortably and it's it's judgment free
 

5745
01:54:36,179 --> 01:54:38,750
comfortably and it's it's judgment free
because it just calculates things on its

5746
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:38,760
because it just calculates things on its
 

5747
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:40,609
because it just calculates things on its
own whereas as physicists we are so

5748
01:54:40,609 --> 01:54:40,619
own whereas as physicists we are so
 

5749
01:54:40,619 --> 01:54:43,010
own whereas as physicists we are so
judgmental yeah this makes sense this

5750
01:54:43,010 --> 01:54:43,020
judgmental yeah this makes sense this
 

5751
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:44,870
judgmental yeah this makes sense this
doesn't make sense right it doesn't get

5752
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:44,880
doesn't make sense right it doesn't get
 

5753
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,970
doesn't make sense right it doesn't get
any worse it's such a beautiful dance

5754
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:46,980
any worse it's such a beautiful dance
 

5755
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:51,470
any worse it's such a beautiful dance
it's such a uh it's so amazing that

5756
01:54:51,470 --> 01:54:51,480
it's such a uh it's so amazing that
 

5757
01:54:51,480 --> 01:54:54,530
it's such a uh it's so amazing that
through this dance you can explore the

5758
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:54,540
through this dance you can explore the
 

5759
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:56,450
through this dance you can explore the
origins of the universe

5760
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:56,460
origins of the universe
 

5761
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:57,830
origins of the universe
like

5762
01:54:57,830 --> 01:54:57,840
like
 

5763
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,750
like
doesn't the Big Bang just blow your mind

5764
01:54:59,750 --> 01:54:59,760
doesn't the Big Bang just blow your mind
 

5765
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,790
doesn't the Big Bang just blow your mind
that this thing has just started from a

5766
01:55:01,790 --> 01:55:01,800
that this thing has just started from a
 

5767
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:02,750
that this thing has just started from a
point

5768
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:02,760
point
 

5769
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:05,050
point
yeah and now we're here yeah yeah yeah

5770
01:55:05,050 --> 01:55:05,060
yeah and now we're here yeah yeah yeah
 

5771
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:07,669
yeah and now we're here yeah yeah yeah
hydrogen and helium and then all the

5772
01:55:07,669 --> 01:55:07,679
hydrogen and helium and then all the
 

5773
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:09,410
hydrogen and helium and then all the
stuff you're studying

5774
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:09,420
stuff you're studying
 

5775
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:12,790
stuff you're studying
I mean this this this evolution of

5776
01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:12,800
I mean this this this evolution of
 

5777
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:15,050
I mean this this this evolution of
chemistry created

5778
01:55:15,050 --> 01:55:15,060
chemistry created
 

5779
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:16,430
chemistry created
humans

5780
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:16,440
humans
 

5781
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:18,350
humans
and we're here talking

5782
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:18,360
and we're here talking
 

5783
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,109
and we're here talking
and there's a lot more to the story

5784
01:55:21,109 --> 01:55:21,119
and there's a lot more to the story
 

5785
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:25,669
and there's a lot more to the story
it's amazing yeah yeah yeah uh

5786
01:55:25,669 --> 01:55:25,679
it's amazing yeah yeah yeah uh
 

5787
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:27,590
it's amazing yeah yeah yeah uh
and this kind of March that you're doing

5788
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:27,600
and this kind of March that you're doing
 

5789
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:31,070
and this kind of March that you're doing
is observing data

5790
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:31,080
is observing data
 

5791
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:33,109
is observing data
and is there

5792
01:55:33,109 --> 01:55:33,119
and is there
 

5793
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:33,830
and is there
foreign

5794
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:33,840
foreign
 

5795
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:37,609
foreign
you're looking at old light on old data

5796
01:55:37,609 --> 01:55:37,619
you're looking at old light on old data
 

5797
01:55:37,619 --> 01:55:39,649
you're looking at old light on old data
but only a few thousand years right just

5798
01:55:39,649 --> 01:55:39,659
but only a few thousand years right just
 

5799
01:55:39,659 --> 01:55:40,910
but only a few thousand years right just
a few thousand that's that's the

5800
01:55:40,910 --> 01:55:40,920
a few thousand that's that's the
 

5801
01:55:40,920 --> 01:55:42,649
a few thousand that's that's the
difference between me and my jwst

5802
01:55:42,649 --> 01:55:42,659
difference between me and my jwst
 

5803
01:55:42,659 --> 01:55:45,590
difference between me and my jwst
colleagues yes their objects that light

5804
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:45,600
colleagues yes their objects that light
 

5805
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:47,689
colleagues yes their objects that light
has traveled 13 billion years or

5806
01:55:47,689 --> 01:55:47,699
has traveled 13 billion years or
 

5807
01:55:47,699 --> 01:55:49,850
has traveled 13 billion years or
whatever it was to us and they're

5808
01:55:49,850 --> 01:55:49,860
whatever it was to us and they're
 

5809
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:52,250
whatever it was to us and they're
observing that now my light has only

5810
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:52,260
observing that now my light has only
 

5811
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:54,890
observing that now my light has only
traveled a few thousand years it's it's

5812
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:54,900
traveled a few thousand years it's it's
 

5813
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:57,050
traveled a few thousand years it's it's
nothing so whatever You observe now is

5814
01:55:57,050 --> 01:55:57,060
nothing so whatever You observe now is
 

5815
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:00,050
nothing so whatever You observe now is
likely still going on yes these stars

5816
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:00,060
likely still going on yes these stars
 

5817
01:56:00,060 --> 01:56:03,229
likely still going on yes these stars
are alive and kicking and having a blast

5818
01:56:03,229 --> 01:56:03,239
are alive and kicking and having a blast
 

5819
01:56:03,239 --> 01:56:04,790
are alive and kicking and having a blast
Thousand Years

5820
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:04,800
Thousand Years
 

5821
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,649
Thousand Years
just a few thousand years that all it

5822
01:56:06,649 --> 01:56:06,659
just a few thousand years that all it
 

5823
01:56:06,659 --> 01:56:08,030
just a few thousand years that all it
takes if we can travel close to the

5824
01:56:08,030 --> 01:56:08,040
takes if we can travel close to the
 

5825
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:09,350
takes if we can travel close to the
speed of light

5826
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:09,360
speed of light
 

5827
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:11,930
speed of light
yeah maybe we can reach out there

5828
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:11,940
yeah maybe we can reach out there
 

5829
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:13,490
yeah maybe we can reach out there
we wouldn't have any planets around

5830
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:13,500
we wouldn't have any planets around
 

5831
01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:16,129
we wouldn't have any planets around
those tasks though so that's is that a

5832
01:56:16,129 --> 01:56:16,139
those tasks though so that's is that a
 

5833
01:56:16,139 --> 01:56:18,410
those tasks though so that's is that a
definitive intuition well what are

5834
01:56:18,410 --> 01:56:18,420
definitive intuition well what are
 

5835
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:21,290
definitive intuition well what are
planets made of elements right to take

5836
01:56:21,290 --> 01:56:21,300
planets made of elements right to take
 

5837
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:23,149
planets made of elements right to take
the Earth as all Heavy elements right

5838
01:56:23,149 --> 01:56:23,159
the Earth as all Heavy elements right
 

5839
01:56:23,159 --> 01:56:26,030
the Earth as all Heavy elements right
the universe needed to reach a certain

5840
01:56:26,030 --> 01:56:26,040
the universe needed to reach a certain
 

5841
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:29,209
the universe needed to reach a certain
stage first to have produced enough of

5842
01:56:29,209 --> 01:56:29,219
stage first to have produced enough of
 

5843
01:56:29,219 --> 01:56:31,370
stage first to have produced enough of
all these elements to actually make a

5844
01:56:31,370 --> 01:56:31,380
all these elements to actually make a
 

5845
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:33,530
all these elements to actually make a
planet so on average you've got so okay

5846
01:56:33,530 --> 01:56:33,540
planet so on average you've got so okay
 

5847
01:56:33,540 --> 01:56:35,030
planet so on average you've got so okay
right so that took quite a few billion

5848
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:35,040
right so that took quite a few billion
 

5849
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,410
right so that took quite a few billion
years so they're not going to have a

5850
01:56:36,410 --> 01:56:36,420
years so they're not going to have a
 

5851
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:38,390
years so they're not going to have a
mechanism for forming planets you could

5852
01:56:38,390 --> 01:56:38,400
mechanism for forming planets you could
 

5853
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,129
mechanism for forming planets you could
have visitors probably but the the the

5854
01:56:40,129 --> 01:56:40,139
have visitors probably but the the the
 

5855
01:56:40,139 --> 01:56:42,229
have visitors probably but the the the
kinematics of that are weird are

5856
01:56:42,229 --> 01:56:42,239
kinematics of that are weird are
 

5857
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:47,149
kinematics of that are weird are
unlikely yeah I would say so

5858
01:56:47,149 --> 01:56:47,159

 

5859
01:56:47,159 --> 01:56:49,129

so they're interesting in that they

5860
01:56:49,129 --> 01:56:49,139
so they're interesting in that they
 

5861
01:56:49,139 --> 01:56:51,169
so they're interesting in that they
reveal the early chemical evolution of

5862
01:56:51,169 --> 01:56:51,179
reveal the early chemical evolution of
 

5863
01:56:51,179 --> 01:56:53,689
reveal the early chemical evolution of
the universe yes not that they're uh

5864
01:56:53,689 --> 01:56:53,699
the universe yes not that they're uh
 

5865
01:56:53,699 --> 01:56:55,669
the universe yes not that they're uh
they could be good vacation spots but

5866
01:56:55,669 --> 01:56:55,679
they could be good vacation spots but
 

5867
01:56:55,679 --> 01:57:00,290
they could be good vacation spots but
not well there's nothing like a warm

5868
01:57:00,290 --> 01:57:00,300
not well there's nothing like a warm
 

5869
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:03,410
not well there's nothing like a warm
it's just not no Planet Islands to to go

5870
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:03,420
it's just not no Planet Islands to to go
 

5871
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:05,330
it's just not no Planet Islands to to go
to to chill

5872
01:57:05,330 --> 01:57:05,340
to to chill
 

5873
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:07,430
to to chill
in your book you highlight the major

01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:20,280
discoveries so for me from from computer
 

5885
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:21,770

science perspective
 

5887
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:23,810

uh the story also tells Harvard

5888
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:23,820
uh the story also tells Harvard
 

5889
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:26,209
uh the story also tells Harvard
computers uh who were these women and

5890
01:57:26,209 --> 01:57:26,219
computers uh who were these women and
 

5891
01:57:26,219 --> 01:57:28,490
computers uh who were these women and
what can you just say about the nature

5892
01:57:28,490 --> 01:57:28,500
what can you just say about the nature
 

5893
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:31,129
what can you just say about the nature
of science and Humanity discovering

5894
01:57:31,129 --> 01:57:31,139
of science and Humanity discovering
 

5895
01:57:31,139 --> 01:57:33,470

things is is in is part of the human
 

5897
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,750
things is is in is part of the human
nature right and so it has happened for

5898
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:35,760
nature right and so it has happened for
 

5899
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,790
nature right and so it has happened for
the longest time

5900

observatory director they were carrying
 

5929
01:58:20,820 --> 01:58:23,810
observatory director they were carrying
out large Sky surveys at the time and

5930
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:23,820
out large Sky surveys at the time and
 

5931
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:26,570
out large Sky surveys at the time and
they needed uh

5932
01:58:26,570 --> 01:58:26,580
they needed uh
 

5933
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:28,790
they needed uh
that that data needed to be processed

5934
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:28,800
that that data needed to be processed
 

5935
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,729
that that data needed to be processed
and looked at and analyzed and so many

5936
01:58:31,729 --> 01:58:31,739
and looked at and analyzed and so many
 

5937
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:35,750
and looked at and analyzed and so many
women or several dozens or one or two

5938
01:58:35,750 --> 01:58:35,760
women or several dozens or one or two
 

5939
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,169
women or several dozens or one or two
dozen women over over the years where

5940
01:58:39,169 --> 01:58:39,179
dozen women over over the years where
 

5941
01:58:39,179 --> 01:58:42,410
dozen women over over the years where
um were hired to to do this work and in

5942
01:58:42,410 --> 01:58:42,420
um were hired to to do this work and in
 

5943
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:43,850
um were hired to to do this work and in
the process

5944
01:58:43,850 --> 01:58:43,860
the process
 

5945
01:58:43,860 --> 01:58:45,589
the process
because they were looking at the actual

5946
01:58:45,589 --> 01:58:45,599
because they were looking at the actual
 

5947
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:47,810
because they were looking at the actual
data and they were smart even though

5948
01:58:47,810 --> 01:58:47,820
data and they were smart even though
 

5949
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:50,689
data and they were smart even though
they had often no formal education

5950
01:58:50,689 --> 01:58:50,699
they had often no formal education
 

5951
01:58:50,699 --> 01:58:53,510
they had often no formal education
they made a lot of discoveries simply by

5952
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:53,520
they made a lot of discoveries simply by
 

5953
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,270
they made a lot of discoveries simply by
by being in tune with what they were

5954
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:56,280
by being in tune with what they were
 

5955
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:58,910
by being in tune with what they were
doing so they weren't robots as you know

5956
01:58:58,910 --> 01:58:58,920
doing so they weren't robots as you know
 

5957
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:02,169

the term computer would perhaps let on

5958
01:59:02,169 --> 01:59:02,179
the term computer would perhaps let on
 

5959
01:59:02,179 --> 01:59:06,410
the term computer would perhaps let on
uh lead on um so any Jump Cannon

5960
01:59:06,410 --> 01:59:06,420
uh lead on um so any Jump Cannon
 

5961
01:59:06,420 --> 01:59:08,950
uh lead on um so any Jump Cannon
classified

5962
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:08,960
classified
 

5963
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:11,629
classified
thousands and thousands of Spectra and

5964
01:59:11,629 --> 01:59:11,639
thousands and thousands of Spectra and
 

5965
01:59:11,639 --> 01:59:15,830
thousands and thousands of Spectra and
found out that uh you can you know

5966
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:15,840
found out that uh you can you know
 

5967
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:17,510
found out that uh you can you know
stores have different temperatures and

5968
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:17,520
stores have different temperatures and
 

5969
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,330
stores have different temperatures and
their Spectra look according we still

5970
01:59:20,330 --> 01:59:20,340
their Spectra look according we still
 

5971
01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:24,709
their Spectra look according we still
use the classification sequence today

5972
01:59:24,709 --> 01:59:24,719

 

5973
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:28,070

um Cecilia Payne gaposhkin later on in I

5974
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:28,080
um Cecilia Payne gaposhkin later on in I
 

5975
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:31,729
um Cecilia Payne gaposhkin later on in I
think 1925 was one of the first women to

5976
01:59:31,729 --> 01:59:31,739
think 1925 was one of the first women to
 

5977
01:59:31,739 --> 01:59:33,850
think 1925 was one of the first women to
obtain a PhD

5978
01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:33,860
obtain a PhD
 

5979
01:59:33,860 --> 01:59:39,229
obtain a PhD
uh in in Stella astronomy and she

5980
01:59:39,229 --> 01:59:39,239
uh in in Stella astronomy and she
 

5981
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:42,169
uh in in Stella astronomy and she
figured out she calculated that the sun

5982
01:59:42,169 --> 01:59:42,179
figured out she calculated that the sun
 

5983
01:59:42,179 --> 01:59:45,649
figured out she calculated that the sun
is mostly made of hydrogen and helium

5984
01:59:45,649 --> 01:59:45,659
is mostly made of hydrogen and helium
 

5985
01:59:45,659 --> 01:59:49,370
is mostly made of hydrogen and helium
that seems normal to many of us these

5986
01:59:49,370 --> 01:59:49,380
that seems normal to many of us these
 

5987
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:52,310
that seems normal to many of us these
days but at the time it was thought that

5988
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:52,320
days but at the time it was thought that
 

5989
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,830
days but at the time it was thought that
celestial objects are made of the same

5990
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:54,840
celestial objects are made of the same
 

5991
01:59:54,840 --> 01:59:58,490
celestial objects are made of the same
thing as the Earth

5992
01:59:58,490 --> 01:59:58,500

 

5993
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:01,910

it's a gutsy amazing Discovery yes it

5994
02:00:01,910 --> 02:00:01,920
it's a gutsy amazing Discovery yes it
 

5995
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:04,930
it's a gutsy amazing Discovery yes it
was later termed the most important

5996
02:00:04,930 --> 02:00:04,940
was later termed the most important
 

5997
02:00:04,940 --> 02:00:07,490
was later termed the most important
thesis of humankind or something like

5998
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:07,500
thesis of humankind or something like
 

5999
02:00:07,500 --> 02:00:09,530
thesis of humankind or something like
that

6000
02:00:09,530 --> 02:00:09,540
that
 

6001
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:13,129
that
what a revelation to realize that stars

6002
02:00:13,129 --> 02:00:13,139
what a revelation to realize that stars
 

6003
02:00:13,139 --> 02:00:15,050
what a revelation to realize that stars
are made of hydrogen and helium right

6004
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:15,060
are made of hydrogen and helium right
 

6005
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:16,970
are made of hydrogen and helium right
and this was exactly the time when

6006
02:00:16,970 --> 02:00:16,980
and this was exactly the time when
 

6007
02:00:16,980 --> 02:00:19,070
and this was exactly the time when
people figured out why stars are shining

6008
02:00:19,070 --> 02:00:19,080
people figured out why stars are shining
 

6009
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,930
people figured out why stars are shining
namely because of nuclear fusion and

6010
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:20,940
namely because of nuclear fusion and
 

6011
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:23,209
namely because of nuclear fusion and
that its protons and you know the

6012
02:00:23,209 --> 02:00:23,219
that its protons and you know the
 

6013
02:00:23,219 --> 02:00:25,129
that its protons and you know the
tunneling effect that leads to to the

6014
02:00:25,129 --> 02:00:25,139
tunneling effect that leads to to the
 

6015
02:00:25,139 --> 02:00:28,010
tunneling effect that leads to to the
actual Fusion otherwise you know you the

6016
02:00:28,010 --> 02:00:28,020
actual Fusion otherwise you know you the
 

6017
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:29,990
actual Fusion otherwise you know you the
the protons repulse each other they

6018
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:30,000
the protons repulse each other they
 

6019
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,370
the protons repulse each other they
don't come together

6020
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:31,380
don't come together
 

6021
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:34,070
don't come together
and so what an incredible time it was

6022
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:34,080
and so what an incredible time it was
 

6023
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:37,010
and so what an incredible time it was
back then and so stars and nuclear

6024
02:00:37,010 --> 02:00:37,020
back then and so stars and nuclear
 

6025
02:00:37,020 --> 02:00:39,709
back then and so stars and nuclear
physics were very closely related and

6026
02:00:39,709 --> 02:00:39,719
physics were very closely related and
 

6027
02:00:39,719 --> 02:00:41,089
physics were very closely related and
and it remains that now it's called

6028
02:00:41,089 --> 02:00:41,099
and it remains that now it's called
 

6029
02:00:41,099 --> 02:00:43,250
and it remains that now it's called
nuclear astrophysics

6030
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:43,260
nuclear astrophysics
 

6031
02:00:43,260 --> 02:00:45,589
nuclear astrophysics
and so many women had many uh

6032
02:00:45,589 --> 02:00:45,599
and so many women had many uh
 

6033
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:47,330
and so many women had many uh
contributions to that of course prior to

6034
02:00:47,330 --> 02:00:47,340
contributions to that of course prior to
 

6035
02:00:47,340 --> 02:00:50,209
contributions to that of course prior to
that Marie Curie uh discovered two new

6036
02:00:50,209 --> 02:00:50,219
that Marie Curie uh discovered two new
 

6037
02:00:50,219 --> 02:00:51,350
that Marie Curie uh discovered two new
elements

6038
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:51,360
elements
 

6039
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:55,430
elements
ah so awesome

6040
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:55,440

 

6041
02:00:55,440 --> 02:01:00,790

um uh radium and polonium

6042
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:00,800

 

6043
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:04,310

discovered nuclear fission that is the

6044
02:01:04,310 --> 02:01:04,320
discovered nuclear fission that is the
 

6045
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:06,350
discovered nuclear fission that is the
basis for understanding the our process

6046
02:01:06,350 --> 02:01:06,360
basis for understanding the our process
 

6047
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:09,109
basis for understanding the our process
this is exactly what happens

6048
02:01:09,109 --> 02:01:09,119
this is exactly what happens
 

6049
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:12,350
this is exactly what happens
uh in in the our process you know the

6050
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:12,360
uh in in the our process you know the
 

6051
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:15,530
uh in in the our process you know the
heavy nuclei let's say uranium if you

6052
02:01:15,530 --> 02:01:15,540
heavy nuclei let's say uranium if you
 

6053
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:17,570
heavy nuclei let's say uranium if you
bombard it with a neutron

6054
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:17,580
bombard it with a neutron
 

6055
02:01:17,580 --> 02:01:19,609
bombard it with a neutron
we talked at length about it it will

6056
02:01:19,609 --> 02:01:19,619
we talked at length about it it will
 

6057
02:01:19,619 --> 02:01:22,430
we talked at length about it it will
Decay it will well not Decay actually it

6058
02:01:22,430 --> 02:01:22,440
Decay it will well not Decay actually it
 

6059
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:25,490
Decay it will well not Decay actually it
will fission it will split into barium

6060
02:01:25,490 --> 02:01:25,500
will fission it will split into barium
 

6061
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:27,890
will fission it will split into barium
and Krypton let's say so two lighter

6062
02:01:27,890 --> 02:01:27,900
and Krypton let's say so two lighter
 

6063
02:01:27,900 --> 02:01:30,290
and Krypton let's say so two lighter
elements that's exactly what we observe

6064
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:30,300
elements that's exactly what we observe
 

6065
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:32,089
elements that's exactly what we observe
I have always a higher abundance of

6066
02:01:32,089 --> 02:01:32,099
I have always a higher abundance of
 

6067
02:01:32,099 --> 02:01:33,950
I have always a higher abundance of
barium than the heavier elements because

6068
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:33,960
barium than the heavier elements because
 

6069
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:35,870
barium than the heavier elements because
of this fission cycling that she

6070
02:01:35,870 --> 02:01:35,880
of this fission cycling that she
 

6071
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:37,270
of this fission cycling that she
calculated

6072
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:37,280
calculated
 

6073
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:40,070
calculated
uh in 1938

6074
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,080
uh in 1938
 

6075
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,530
uh in 1938
1939

6076
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:42,540
1939
 

6077
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:44,990
1939
um so many many contributions and it's

6078
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:45,000
um so many many contributions and it's
 

6079
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,050
um so many many contributions and it's
it's just so remarkable if you just take

6080
02:01:48,050 --> 02:01:48,060
it's just so remarkable if you just take
 

6081
02:01:48,060 --> 02:01:49,609
it's just so remarkable if you just take
that body of work

6082
02:01:49,609 --> 02:01:49,619
that body of work
 

6083
02:01:49,619 --> 02:01:52,910
that body of work
that that changed how we

6084
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:52,920
that that changed how we
 

6085
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:55,070
that that changed how we
how we do things how how we see the

6086
02:01:55,070 --> 02:01:55,080
how we do things how how we see the
 

6087
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:56,030
how we do things how how we see the
Universe

6088
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:56,040
Universe
 

6089
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:58,070
Universe
um how we understand things

6090
02:01:58,070 --> 02:01:58,080
um how we understand things
 

6091
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,470
um how we understand things
has led to so many subsequent

6092
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:00,480
has led to so many subsequent
 

6093
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:03,649
has led to so many subsequent
discoveries good ones and bad

6094
02:02:03,649 --> 02:02:03,659
discoveries good ones and bad
 

6095
02:02:03,659 --> 02:02:06,890
discoveries good ones and bad
um well we did all of it is taken

6096
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:06,900
um well we did all of it is taken
 

6097
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:09,229
um well we did all of it is taken
together that's progress right it's it's

6098
02:02:09,229 --> 02:02:09,239
together that's progress right it's it's
 

6099
02:02:09,239 --> 02:02:11,870
together that's progress right it's it's
ultimate science is what it is we have

6100
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:11,880
ultimate science is what it is we have
 

6101
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:13,550
ultimate science is what it is we have
to decide what we do with that knowledge

6102
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:13,560
to decide what we do with that knowledge
 

6103
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:15,470
to decide what we do with that knowledge
right we can always use things for good

6104
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:15,480
right we can always use things for good
 

6105
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:17,149
right we can always use things for good
or for bad

6106
02:02:17,149 --> 02:02:17,159
or for bad
 

6107
02:02:17,159 --> 02:02:19,729
or for bad
um that's that's part of the human uh

6108
02:02:19,729 --> 02:02:19,739
um that's that's part of the human uh
 

6109
02:02:19,739 --> 02:02:22,010
um that's that's part of the human uh
Endeavor as well and also part of the

6110
02:02:22,010 --> 02:02:22,020
Endeavor as well and also part of the
 

6111
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:23,930
Endeavor as well and also part of the
human endeavor and the human nature is

6112
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:23,940
human endeavor and the human nature is
 

6113
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:26,450
human endeavor and the human nature is
the issues with corruption and credit

6114
02:02:26,450 --> 02:02:26,460
the issues with corruption and credit
 

6115
02:02:26,460 --> 02:02:28,070
the issues with corruption and credit
assignment and all these kinds of things

6116
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:28,080
assignment and all these kinds of things
 

6117
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:30,290
assignment and all these kinds of things
that make this whole ride so damn

6118
02:02:30,290 --> 02:02:30,300
that make this whole ride so damn
 

6119
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:32,930
that make this whole ride so damn
interesting about what's right and wrong

6120
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:32,940
interesting about what's right and wrong
 

6121
02:02:32,940 --> 02:02:34,790
interesting about what's right and wrong
and about the nature of Good and Evil

6122
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:34,800
and about the nature of Good and Evil
 

6123
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:37,070
and about the nature of Good and Evil
yeah and that seems to surface itself in

6124
02:02:37,070 --> 02:02:37,080
yeah and that seems to surface itself in
 

6125
02:02:37,080 --> 02:02:40,010
yeah and that seems to surface itself in
all kinds of places all the time yes yes

6126
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:40,020
all kinds of places all the time yes yes
 

6127
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:42,410
all kinds of places all the time yes yes
Lisa Maynard was nominated for the Nobel

6128
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:42,420
Lisa Maynard was nominated for the Nobel
 

6129
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:45,410
Lisa Maynard was nominated for the Nobel
Prize 40 times more than that even it's

6130
02:02:45,410 --> 02:02:45,420
Prize 40 times more than that even it's
 

6131
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:47,570
Prize 40 times more than that even it's
amazingly she holds the record for that

6132
02:02:47,570 --> 02:02:47,580
amazingly she holds the record for that
 

6133
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:51,770
amazingly she holds the record for that
she never received it uh so I guess in

6134
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:51,780
she never received it uh so I guess in
 

6135
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:54,169
she never received it uh so I guess in
point

6136
02:02:54,169 --> 02:02:54,179

 

6137
02:02:54,179 --> 02:02:56,810

um yeah and of course the Nobel Prize is

6138
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:56,820
um yeah and of course the Nobel Prize is
 

6139
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:59,270
um yeah and of course the Nobel Prize is
its complexities one is the credit

6140
02:02:59,270 --> 02:02:59,280
its complexities one is the credit
 

6141
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,550
its complexities one is the credit
assignment but two even in astronomy

6142
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:01,560
assignment but two even in astronomy
 

6143
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:04,070
assignment but two even in astronomy
sort of assigning credit to a handful of

6144
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:04,080
sort of assigning credit to a handful of
 

6145
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:07,070
sort of assigning credit to a handful of
folks on so many more contributed as a

6146
02:03:07,070 --> 02:03:07,080
folks on so many more contributed as a
 

6147
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:08,870
folks on so many more contributed as a
complicated story also yeah it's very

6148
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:08,880
complicated story also yeah it's very
 

6149
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,669
complicated story also yeah it's very
complex

6150
02:03:10,669 --> 02:03:10,679
complex
 

6151
02:03:10,679 --> 02:03:12,950
complex
okay sorry for the Romantic question but

6152
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:12,960
okay sorry for the Romantic question but
 

6153
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:14,990
okay sorry for the Romantic question but
what to use the most beautiful idea in

6154
02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:15,000
what to use the most beautiful idea in
 

6155
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:18,350
what to use the most beautiful idea in
astronomy in Stellar astronomy

6156
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:18,360
astronomy in Stellar astronomy
 

6157
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:21,530
astronomy in Stellar astronomy
well

6158
02:03:21,530 --> 02:03:21,540

 

6159
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:23,330

when I was in high school I I was

6160
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:23,340
when I was in high school I I was
 

6161
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:25,189
when I was in high school I I was
thinking like okay well what what what

6162
02:03:25,189 --> 02:03:25,199
thinking like okay well what what what
 

6163
02:03:25,199 --> 02:03:27,169
thinking like okay well what what what
do I want to do when I'm growing when I

6164
02:03:27,169 --> 02:03:27,179
do I want to do when I'm growing when I
 

6165
02:03:27,179 --> 02:03:29,390
do I want to do when I'm growing when I
grow up right I knew I wanted to do

6166
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:29,400
grow up right I knew I wanted to do
 

6167
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,070
grow up right I knew I wanted to do
astronomy but I was a little bit torn

6168
02:03:31,070 --> 02:03:31,080
astronomy but I was a little bit torn
 

6169
02:03:31,080 --> 02:03:33,589
astronomy but I was a little bit torn
because my interests were definitely

6170
02:03:33,589 --> 02:03:33,599
because my interests were definitely
 

6171
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:35,930
because my interests were definitely
Stars Stella astronomy but also

6172
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:35,940
Stars Stella astronomy but also
 

6173
02:03:35,940 --> 02:03:38,209
Stars Stella astronomy but also
chemistry I always had a Fascination

6174
02:03:38,209 --> 02:03:38,219
chemistry I always had a Fascination
 

6175
02:03:38,219 --> 02:03:40,189
chemistry I always had a Fascination
about the elements so Marie Curie was

6176
02:03:40,189 --> 02:03:40,199
about the elements so Marie Curie was
 

6177
02:03:40,199 --> 02:03:43,550
about the elements so Marie Curie was
was a a big role model

6178
02:03:43,550 --> 02:03:43,560
was a a big role model
 

6179
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:46,070
was a a big role model
um my friend actually made a beautiful

6180
02:03:46,070 --> 02:03:46,080
um my friend actually made a beautiful
 

6181
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:48,589
um my friend actually made a beautiful
produced a beautiful movie about the

6182
02:03:48,589 --> 02:03:48,599
produced a beautiful movie about the
 

6183
02:03:48,599 --> 02:03:52,370
produced a beautiful movie about the
discovery of um of of the elements this

6184
02:03:52,370 --> 02:03:52,380
discovery of um of of the elements this
 

6185
02:03:52,380 --> 02:03:56,890
discovery of um of of the elements this
is the theater play but digitized

6186
02:03:56,890 --> 02:03:56,900
is the theater play but digitized
 

6187
02:03:56,900 --> 02:03:59,450
is the theater play but digitized
where when I thought I could actually

6188
02:03:59,450 --> 02:03:59,460
where when I thought I could actually
 

6189
02:03:59,460 --> 02:04:01,729
where when I thought I could actually
kind of relive this sort of Discovery

6190
02:04:01,729 --> 02:04:01,739
kind of relive this sort of Discovery
 

6191
02:04:01,739 --> 02:04:04,189
kind of relive this sort of Discovery
moment that that Marie Curie had it sent

6192
02:04:04,189 --> 02:04:04,199
moment that that Marie Curie had it sent
 

6193
02:04:04,199 --> 02:04:06,950
moment that that Marie Curie had it sent
shivers down my spine it was fantastic I

6194
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:06,960
shivers down my spine it was fantastic I
 

6195
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:07,970
shivers down my spine it was fantastic I
mean this is

6196
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:07,980
mean this is
 

6197
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:10,250
mean this is
this is the kind of thing that that I

6198
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:10,260
this is the kind of thing that that I
 

6199
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:12,530
this is the kind of thing that that I
wanted to experience

6200
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:12,540
wanted to experience
 

6201
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:15,709
wanted to experience
um but yeah so nuclear physics and

6202
02:04:15,709 --> 02:04:15,719
um but yeah so nuclear physics and
 

6203
02:04:15,719 --> 02:04:17,810
um but yeah so nuclear physics and
element creation information was really

6204
02:04:17,810 --> 02:04:17,820
element creation information was really
 

6205
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:19,790
element creation information was really
interesting to me chemistry the elements

6206
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:19,800
interesting to me chemistry the elements
 

6207
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,129
interesting to me chemistry the elements
stars and all of that and I was like

6208
02:04:22,129 --> 02:04:22,139
stars and all of that and I was like
 

6209
02:04:22,139 --> 02:04:24,109
stars and all of that and I was like
I don't know if I ever find something

6210
02:04:24,109 --> 02:04:24,119
I don't know if I ever find something
 

6211
02:04:24,119 --> 02:04:26,510
I don't know if I ever find something
that combines all of these things

6212
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:26,520
that combines all of these things
 

6213
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:28,850
that combines all of these things
and then I ended up in Australia and I I

6214
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:28,860
and then I ended up in Australia and I I
 

6215
02:04:28,860 --> 02:04:30,770
and then I ended up in Australia and I I
met this this person and he was working

6216
02:04:30,770 --> 02:04:30,780
met this this person and he was working
 

6217
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:33,770
met this this person and he was working
on Old stars and as I was sitting in his

6218
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:33,780
on Old stars and as I was sitting in his
 

6219
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:35,450
on Old stars and as I was sitting in his
talk hearing about this for the first

6220
02:04:35,450 --> 02:04:35,460
talk hearing about this for the first
 

6221
02:04:35,460 --> 02:04:37,490
talk hearing about this for the first
time

6222
02:04:37,490 --> 02:04:37,500
time
 

6223
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:40,609
time
it kind of it clicked all over my head

6224
02:04:40,609 --> 02:04:40,619
it kind of it clicked all over my head
 

6225
02:04:40,619 --> 02:04:42,950
it kind of it clicked all over my head
and it's like oh my God it it all fell

6226
02:04:42,950 --> 02:04:42,960
and it's like oh my God it it all fell
 

6227
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:45,770
and it's like oh my God it it all fell
in place because we can use these old

6228
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:45,780
in place because we can use these old
 

6229
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:48,950
in place because we can use these old
stars to study the elements to learn how

6230
02:04:48,950 --> 02:04:48,960
stars to study the elements to learn how
 

6231
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,410
stars to study the elements to learn how
they're formed we can get these clean

6232
02:04:51,410 --> 02:04:51,420
they're formed we can get these clean
 

6233
02:04:51,420 --> 02:04:53,270
they're formed we can get these clean
signatures that help us inform the

6234
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:53,280
signatures that help us inform the
 

6235
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:56,030
signatures that help us inform the
nuclear synthesis processes you know and

6236
02:04:56,030 --> 02:04:56,040
nuclear synthesis processes you know and
 

6237
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:59,030
nuclear synthesis processes you know and
I know of course I need to know a lot

6238
02:04:59,030 --> 02:04:59,040
I know of course I need to know a lot
 

6239
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,310
I know of course I need to know a lot
about stars too so it's it's like all

6240
02:05:01,310 --> 02:05:01,320
about stars too so it's it's like all
 

6241
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:03,109
about stars too so it's it's like all
together and that that was sort of a

6242
02:05:03,109 --> 02:05:03,119
together and that that was sort of a
 

6243
02:05:03,119 --> 02:05:05,209
together and that that was sort of a
moment of magic

6244
02:05:05,209 --> 02:05:05,219
moment of magic
 

6245
02:05:05,219 --> 02:05:06,890
moment of magic
and then the fact that

6246
02:05:06,890 --> 02:05:06,900
and then the fact that
 

6247
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:09,229
and then the fact that
I have now done that for 20 years this

6248
02:05:09,229 --> 02:05:09,239
I have now done that for 20 years this
 

6249
02:05:09,239 --> 02:05:12,530
I have now done that for 20 years this
is just like I won the lottery it all

6250
02:05:12,530 --> 02:05:12,540
is just like I won the lottery it all
 

6251
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:15,410
is just like I won the lottery it all
clicked into place so in some sense it's

6252
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:15,420
clicked into place so in some sense it's
 

6253
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:17,750
clicked into place so in some sense it's
an it's an ongoing love story for me if

6254
02:05:17,750 --> 02:05:17,760
an it's an ongoing love story for me if
 

6255
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:19,729
an it's an ongoing love story for me if
I could say it like that where you know

6256
02:05:19,729 --> 02:05:19,739
I could say it like that where you know
 

6257
02:05:19,739 --> 02:05:25,070
I could say it like that where you know
I found my stars my thing and I am

6258
02:05:25,070 --> 02:05:25,080
I found my stars my thing and I am
 

6259
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:27,589
I found my stars my thing and I am
fortunate enough to be able to keep

6260
02:05:27,589 --> 02:05:27,599
fortunate enough to be able to keep
 

6261
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:30,890
fortunate enough to be able to keep
doing that and I'm happy to

6262
02:05:30,890 --> 02:05:30,900
doing that and I'm happy to
 

6263
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:33,229
doing that and I'm happy to
see where where it will take me you know

6264
02:05:33,229 --> 02:05:33,239
see where where it will take me you know
 

6265
02:05:33,239 --> 02:05:35,570
see where where it will take me you know
it's an evolution as with every

6266
02:05:35,570 --> 02:05:35,580
it's an evolution as with every
 

6267
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:38,570
it's an evolution as with every
relationship you have to if you don't

6268
02:05:38,570 --> 02:05:38,580
relationship you have to if you don't
 

6269
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:41,450
relationship you have to if you don't
March forward you move backwards I'm not

6270
02:05:41,450 --> 02:05:41,460
March forward you move backwards I'm not
 

6271
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:43,370
March forward you move backwards I'm not
interested in moving backwards so I'm

6272
02:05:43,370 --> 02:05:43,380
interested in moving backwards so I'm
 

6273
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:45,410
interested in moving backwards so I'm
I'm letting the field and the

6274
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:45,420
I'm letting the field and the
 

6275
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:48,109
I'm letting the field and the
discoveries and the findings lead me to

6276
02:05:48,109 --> 02:05:48,119
discoveries and the findings lead me to
 

6277
02:05:48,119 --> 02:05:50,570
discoveries and the findings lead me to
you know and I'm often

6278
02:05:50,570 --> 02:05:50,580
you know and I'm often
 

6279
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:51,890
you know and I'm often
um

6280
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:51,900
um
 

6281
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:54,410
um
I'm I'm it's it's not hard for me to

6282
02:05:54,410 --> 02:05:54,420
I'm I'm it's it's not hard for me to
 

6283
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:56,570
I'm I'm it's it's not hard for me to
follow sort of my hunches and sometimes

6284
02:05:56,570 --> 02:05:56,580
follow sort of my hunches and sometimes
 

6285
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:58,629
follow sort of my hunches and sometimes
even at the telescope it's like

6286
02:05:58,629 --> 02:05:58,639
even at the telescope it's like
 

6287
02:05:58,639 --> 02:06:01,430
even at the telescope it's like
let's take a look at this one I have a

6288
02:06:01,430 --> 02:06:01,440
let's take a look at this one I have a
 

6289
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:03,290
let's take a look at this one I have a
good feeling and then usually something

6290
02:06:03,290 --> 02:06:03,300
good feeling and then usually something
 

6291
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:06,430
good feeling and then usually something
good or you know not bad

6292
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:06,440
good or you know not bad
 

6293
02:06:06,440 --> 02:06:10,970
good or you know not bad
pop pops out at the end and I

6294
02:06:10,970 --> 02:06:10,980
pop pops out at the end and I
 

6295
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,129
pop pops out at the end and I
um I really like that hey that I have

6296
02:06:13,129 --> 02:06:13,139
um I really like that hey that I have
 

6297
02:06:13,139 --> 02:06:14,810
um I really like that hey that I have
the freedom to to do that that I'm

6298
02:06:14,810 --> 02:06:14,820
the freedom to to do that that I'm
 

6299
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:17,209
the freedom to to do that that I'm
allowed to follow my hunches

6300
02:06:17,209 --> 02:06:17,219
allowed to follow my hunches
 

6301
02:06:17,219 --> 02:06:18,589
allowed to follow my hunches
um too many people I think are sort of

6302
02:06:18,589 --> 02:06:18,599
um too many people I think are sort of
 

6303
02:06:18,599 --> 02:06:20,390
um too many people I think are sort of
boxed in with their job or their life

6304
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:20,400
boxed in with their job or their life
 

6305
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:22,010
boxed in with their job or their life
that they they don't have that kind of

6306
02:06:22,010 --> 02:06:22,020
that they they don't have that kind of
 

6307
02:06:22,020 --> 02:06:23,689
that they they don't have that kind of
Freedom that that's really important to

6308
02:06:23,689 --> 02:06:23,699
Freedom that that's really important to
 

6309
02:06:23,699 --> 02:06:25,250
Freedom that that's really important to

all the opportunities these days and
that's that's wonderful but it's almost

6360
02:07:26,450 --> 02:07:26,460
that's that's wonderful but it's almost
 

6361
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:28,669
that's that's wonderful but it's almost
like that leads to some

6362
02:07:28,669 --> 02:07:28,679
like that leads to some

02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:32,760
little bit of tired of too too tired to
 

6367
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:34,910
little bit of tired of too too tired to
make all the decisions because at some

6368
02:07:34,910 --> 02:07:34,920
make all the decisions because at some
 

6369
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:36,530
make all the decisions because at some
point you need to put your eggs in a

6370
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:36,540
point you need to put your eggs in a
 

6371
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:39,189
point you need to put your eggs in a
basket and you need to be okay with that

6372
02:07:39,189 --> 02:07:39,199
basket and you need to be okay with that
 

6373
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:41,810
basket and you need to be okay with that
we can't do all the things even though

6374
02:07:41,810 --> 02:07:41,820
we can't do all the things even though
 

6375
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:43,910
we can't do all the things even though
we're often told you can be president

6376

6377
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:45,830
we're often told you can be president
too and I think that's really important

6378
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:45,840
too and I think that's really important
 

6379
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,530
too and I think that's really important
to convey but at the end of the day we

6380
02:07:48,530 --> 02:07:48,540
to convey but at the end of the day we
 

6381
02:07:48,540 --> 02:07:50,330
to convey but at the end of the day we
can only have sort of one job or one

6382
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:50,340
can only have sort of one job or one
 

6383
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:52,550
can only have sort of one job or one
type of profession I'm not saying you

6384
02:07:52,550 --> 02:07:52,560
type of profession I'm not saying you
 

6385
02:07:52,560 --> 02:07:54,890
type of profession I'm not saying you
know you need to be locked in but

6386
02:07:54,890 --> 02:07:54,900
know you need to be locked in but
 

6387
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:58,609
know you need to be locked in but
um it's hard to change 180 degrees

6388
02:07:58,609 --> 02:07:58,619
um it's hard to change 180 degrees
 

6389
02:07:58,619 --> 02:08:00,950
um it's hard to change 180 degrees
and and so lots of people I think are

6390
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:00,960
and and so lots of people I think are
 

6391
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:03,649
and and so lots of people I think are
often afraid to

6392
02:08:03,649 --> 02:08:03,659
often afraid to
 

6393
02:08:03,659 --> 02:08:07,129
often afraid to
to really dig in at least for some time

6394
02:08:07,129 --> 02:08:07,139
to really dig in at least for some time
 

6395
02:08:07,139 --> 02:08:09,350
to really dig in at least for some time
and get the hands real dirty

6396
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:09,360
and get the hands real dirty
 

6397
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:11,930
and get the hands real dirty

and really learn from the bottom up on
 

6399
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:14,089
and really learn from the bottom up on
one thing on one thing because they're

6400
02:08:14,089 --> 02:08:14,099
one thing on one thing because they're
 

6401
02:08:14,099 --> 02:08:16,129
one thing on one thing because they're
afraid they're missing out on on 99

6402
02:08:16,129 --> 02:08:16,139
afraid they're missing out on on 99
 

6403
02:08:16,139 --> 02:08:18,290
afraid they're missing out on on 99
other things

6404
02:08:18,290 --> 02:08:18,300
other things
 

6405
02:08:18,300 --> 02:08:20,930
other things
but life is a little bit missing out on

6406
02:08:20,930 --> 02:08:20,940
but life is a little bit missing out on
 

6407
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:22,790
but life is a little bit missing out on
99 other things because we only have 24

6408
02:08:22,790 --> 02:08:22,800
99 other things because we only have 24
 

6409
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:25,550
99 other things because we only have 24
hours in a day I

hours in a day I
 

6411
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:27,950
hours in a day I
I have that feeling very often there are

6412
02:08:27,950 --> 02:08:27,960
I have that feeling very often there are
 

6413
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:30,410
I have that feeling very often there are
so many things I would like to do many

6414
02:08:30,410 --> 02:08:30,420
so many things I would like to do many
 

6415
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:33,010
so many things I would like to do many
things I would like to try to be good at

6416
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:33,020
things I would like to try to be good at
 

6417
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:35,209
things I would like to try to be good at
sometimes I wish I had a different job

6418
02:08:35,209 --> 02:08:35,219
sometimes I wish I had a different job
 

6419
02:08:35,219 --> 02:08:37,250
sometimes I wish I had a different job
you know because I have other interests

you know because I have other interests
 

6421
02:08:37,260 --> 02:08:38,990
you know because I have other interests

too but I realized okay I can only do
 

6423
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:43,010
too but I realized okay I can only do
one thing so I have no regrets but this

6424
02:08:43,010 --> 02:08:43,020
one thing so I have no regrets but this
 

6425
02:08:43,020 --> 02:08:45,109
one thing so I have no regrets but this
is this is a general feeling that I

6426
02:08:45,109 --> 02:08:45,119
is this is a general feeling that I
 

6427
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:45,890
is this is a general feeling that I
think

6428
02:08:45,890 --> 02:08:45,900
think
 

6429
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:49,550
think
I would think most of us have but if it

6430
02:08:49,550 --> 02:08:49,560
I would think most of us have but if it
 

6431
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:52,430
I would think most of us have but if it
lets if it stops you from really digging

6432
02:08:52,430 --> 02:08:52,440
lets if it stops you from really digging
 

6433
02:08:52,440 --> 02:08:54,470
lets if it stops you from really digging
drilling down on one thing to become an

6434
02:08:54,470 --> 02:08:54,480
drilling down on one thing to become an
 

6435
02:08:54,480 --> 02:08:55,970
drilling down on one thing to become an
expert in one thing to become really

6436
02:08:55,970 --> 02:08:55,980
expert in one thing to become really
 

6437
02:08:55,980 --> 02:09:00,109
expert in one thing to become really
good at one thing that you call your own

6438
02:09:00,109 --> 02:09:00,119
good at one thing that you call your own
 

6439
02:09:00,119 --> 02:09:03,050
good at one thing that you call your own
then that it just makes it difficult

6440
02:09:03,050 --> 02:09:03,060
then that it just makes it difficult
 

6441
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:05,109
then that it just makes it difficult
and so a fulfilling life

6442
02:09:05,109 --> 02:09:05,119
and so a fulfilling life
 

6443
02:09:05,119 --> 02:09:08,149
and so a fulfilling life
is in part likely to be discovered in a

6444
02:09:08,149 --> 02:09:08,159
is in part likely to be discovered in a
 

6445
02:09:08,159 --> 02:09:10,129
is in part likely to be discovered in a
singular pursuit of a thing of one thing

6446
02:09:10,129 --> 02:09:10,139
singular pursuit of a thing of one thing
 

6447
02:09:10,139 --> 02:09:12,830
singular pursuit of a thing of one thing
well yeah for at least for a time yeah

um because I think most people long to
 

6455
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:22,010
um because I think most people long to
own something

6456
02:09:22,010 --> 02:09:22,020
own something
 

6457
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:23,750
own something
you know we all

Humanity for this planet
 

6465
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:34,070
Humanity for this planet
and I think

6466
02:09:34,070 --> 02:09:34,080
and I think
 

6467
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:35,870
and I think
it's really important for young people

6468
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:35,880
it's really important for young people
 

6469
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:39,410
it's really important for young people
to strive for that and not lose sight or

6470
02:09:39,410 --> 02:09:39,420
to strive for that and not lose sight or
 

6471
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:41,270
to strive for that and not lose sight or
trade that for all the opportunities

6472
02:09:41,270 --> 02:09:41,280
trade that for all the opportunities
 

6473
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:43,129
trade that for all the opportunities
because an opportunity is nothing if you

6474
02:09:43,129 --> 02:09:43,139
because an opportunity is nothing if you
 

6475
02:09:43,139 --> 02:09:44,510
because an opportunity is nothing if you
don't do anything

6476
02:09:44,510 --> 02:09:44,520
don't do anything
 

6477
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:47,149
don't do anything
you need to you need to do something at

6478
02:09:47,149 --> 02:09:47,159
you need to you need to do something at
 

6479
02:09:47,159 --> 02:09:49,189
you need to you need to do something at
the end of the day so I chat with lots

6480
02:09:49,189 --> 02:09:49,199
the end of the day so I chat with lots
 

6481
02:09:49,199 --> 02:09:51,350
the end of the day so I chat with lots
of people about this and I often start

6482
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:51,360
of people about this and I often start
 

6483
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,910
of people about this and I often start
by just saying hey tell me what you

6484
02:09:52,910 --> 02:09:52,920
by just saying hey tell me what you
 

6485
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:54,589
by just saying hey tell me what you
don't like

6486
02:09:54,589 --> 02:09:54,599
don't like
 

6487
02:09:54,599 --> 02:09:57,830
don't like
because it's often much easier to to

6488
02:09:57,830 --> 02:09:57,840
because it's often much easier to to
 

6489
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:00,649
because it's often much easier to to
narrow down narrow down narrow down let

6490
02:10:00,649 --> 02:10:00,659
narrow down narrow down narrow down let
 

6491
02:10:00,659 --> 02:10:03,470
narrow down narrow down narrow down let
out what what's not on your plate yeah

6492
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:03,480
out what what's not on your plate yeah
 

6493
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:05,089
out what what's not on your plate yeah
and then this way we get a little bit

6494
02:10:05,089 --> 02:10:05,099
and then this way we get a little bit
 

6495
02:10:05,099 --> 02:10:07,070
and then this way we get a little bit
closer and then it's like well why don't

6496
02:10:07,070 --> 02:10:07,080
closer and then it's like well why don't
 

6497
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:09,589
closer and then it's like well why don't
you take a risk yeah and just sign up

6498
02:10:09,589 --> 02:10:09,599
you take a risk yeah and just sign up
 

6499
02:10:09,599 --> 02:10:11,330
you take a risk yeah and just sign up
for something for three months but

6500
02:10:11,330 --> 02:10:11,340
for something for three months but
 

6501
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:13,010
for something for three months but
that's what it feels like that that's

6502
02:10:13,010 --> 02:10:13,020
that's what it feels like that that's
 

6503
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:15,050
that's what it feels like that that's
what it feels like and it is that is a

6504
02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:15,060
what it feels like and it is that is a
 

6505
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:17,689
what it feels like and it is that is a
risk commitment is a risk yes because

6506
02:10:17,689 --> 02:10:17,699
risk commitment is a risk yes because
 

6507
02:10:17,699 --> 02:10:19,910
risk commitment is a risk yes because
it's you're basically sacrificing all

6508
02:10:19,910 --> 02:10:19,920
it's you're basically sacrificing all
 

6509
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:21,830
it's you're basically sacrificing all
the other possible options but then I

6510
02:10:21,830 --> 02:10:21,840
the other possible options but then I
 

6511
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:23,870
the other possible options but then I
guess you have to trust the magic you

6512
02:10:23,870 --> 02:10:23,880
guess you have to trust the magic you
 

6513
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:25,970
guess you have to trust the magic you
you noticed in that thing yes if you

6514
02:10:25,970 --> 02:10:25,980
you noticed in that thing yes if you
 

6515
02:10:25,980 --> 02:10:28,790
you noticed in that thing yes if you
notice one thing just stick with it and

6516
02:10:28,790 --> 02:10:28,800
notice one thing just stick with it and
 

6517
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:30,169
notice one thing just stick with it and
then and then maybe there's something

6518
02:10:30,169 --> 02:10:30,179
then and then maybe there's something
 

6519
02:10:30,179 --> 02:10:33,290
then and then maybe there's something
there right right and and this moment of

6520
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:33,300
there right right and and this moment of
 

6521
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:35,750
there right right and and this moment of
kind of feeling it in in your entire

6522
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:35,760
kind of feeling it in in your entire
 

6523
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,430
kind of feeling it in in your entire
body and mind that this is the right

6524
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:37,440
body and mind that this is the right
 

6525
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:39,709
body and mind that this is the right
thing you know getting there is is

6526
02:10:39,709 --> 02:10:39,719
thing you know getting there is is
 

6527
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:42,589
thing you know getting there is is
probably really hard but if you don't

6528
02:10:42,589 --> 02:10:42,599
probably really hard but if you don't
 

6529
02:10:42,599 --> 02:10:44,750
probably really hard but if you don't
try you won't find out right the hard

6530
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:44,760
try you won't find out right the hard
 

6531
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:46,430
try you won't find out right the hard
stuff is the fun stuff that's also

6532
02:10:46,430 --> 02:10:46,440
stuff is the fun stuff that's also
 

6533
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:47,870
stuff is the fun stuff that's also
another thing you find out and then

6534
02:10:47,870 --> 02:10:47,880
another thing you find out and then
 

6535
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:50,510
another thing you find out and then
there's that yes somehow it doesn't make

6536
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:50,520
there's that yes somehow it doesn't make
 

6537
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:53,169
there's that yes somehow it doesn't make
sense uh you also mentioned that uh

6538
02:10:53,169 --> 02:10:53,179
sense uh you also mentioned that uh
 

6539
02:10:53,179 --> 02:10:56,450
sense uh you also mentioned that uh
you've taken a little stroll into the

6540
02:10:56,450 --> 02:10:56,460
you've taken a little stroll into the
 

6541
02:10:56,460 --> 02:10:59,570
you've taken a little stroll into the
artistic representation of yourself uh

6542
02:10:59,570 --> 02:10:59,580
artistic representation of yourself uh
 

6543
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:01,129
artistic representation of yourself uh
can you can you speak to that for a

6544
02:11:01,129 --> 02:11:01,139
can you can you speak to that for a
 

6545
02:11:01,139 --> 02:11:02,629
can you can you speak to that for a
little bit yes

6546
02:11:02,629 --> 02:11:02,639
little bit yes
 

6547
02:11:02,639 --> 02:11:05,390
little bit yes
I already just mentioned

6548
02:11:05,390 --> 02:11:05,400
I already just mentioned
 

6549
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:08,629
I already just mentioned
I wish I I you know had more time to do

6550
02:11:08,629 --> 02:11:08,639
I wish I I you know had more time to do
 

6551
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:09,589
I wish I I you know had more time to do
other things

6552
02:11:09,589 --> 02:11:09,599
other things
 

6553
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:12,050
other things
I find little little

6554
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:12,060
I find little little
 

6555
02:11:12,060 --> 02:11:15,050
I find little little
um sideways I guess to to pursue things

6556
02:11:15,050 --> 02:11:15,060
um sideways I guess to to pursue things
 

6557
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:17,990
um sideways I guess to to pursue things
that that I like besides astronomy or at

6558
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:18,000
that that I like besides astronomy or at
 

6559
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,570
that that I like besides astronomy or at
least I try to find connections and so

6560
02:11:20,570 --> 02:11:20,580
least I try to find connections and so
 

6561
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:23,270
least I try to find connections and so
um some years ago I

6562
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:23,280
um some years ago I
 

6563
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:25,729
um some years ago I
um again with the help of of my friend

6564
02:11:25,729 --> 02:11:25,739
um again with the help of of my friend
 

6565
02:11:25,739 --> 02:11:29,209
um again with the help of of my friend
who made this Marie Curie movie uh she

6566
02:11:29,209 --> 02:11:29,219
who made this Marie Curie movie uh she
 

6567
02:11:29,219 --> 02:11:33,709
who made this Marie Curie movie uh she
and I wrote a one-woman play where I

6568
02:11:33,709 --> 02:11:33,719
and I wrote a one-woman play where I
 

6569
02:11:33,719 --> 02:11:36,589
and I wrote a one-woman play where I
actually portray Lisa midna who was an

6570
02:11:36,589 --> 02:11:36,599
actually portray Lisa midna who was an
 

6571
02:11:36,599 --> 02:11:38,810
actually portray Lisa midna who was an
Austrian German physicist nuclear

6572
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:38,820
Austrian German physicist nuclear
 

6573
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:41,930
Austrian German physicist nuclear
physicist I'm from Germany so I have the

6574
02:11:41,930 --> 02:11:41,940
physicist I'm from Germany so I have the
 

6575
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:44,350
physicist I'm from Germany so I have the
right accent for that

6576
02:11:44,350 --> 02:11:44,360
right accent for that
 

6577
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:48,109
right accent for that
uh and we wrote this play about this

6578
02:11:48,109 --> 02:11:48,119
uh and we wrote this play about this
 

6579
02:11:48,119 --> 02:11:51,229
uh and we wrote this play about this
moment of discovery of nuclear fission

6580
02:11:51,229 --> 02:11:51,239
moment of discovery of nuclear fission
 

6581
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:55,370
moment of discovery of nuclear fission
again this is an absolutely critical

6582
02:11:55,370 --> 02:11:55,380
again this is an absolutely critical
 

6583
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:58,910
again this is an absolutely critical
piece that explains my work today

6584
02:11:58,910 --> 02:11:58,920
piece that explains my work today
 

6585
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:00,950
piece that explains my work today
and we all stand on the shoulder of

6586
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:00,960
and we all stand on the shoulder of
 

6587
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,890
and we all stand on the shoulder of
giants she was one of those Giants and

6588
02:12:03,890 --> 02:12:03,900
giants she was one of those Giants and
 

6589
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:07,129
giants she was one of those Giants and
in some ways it's it's of course a way

6590
02:12:07,129 --> 02:12:07,139
in some ways it's it's of course a way
 

6591
02:12:07,139 --> 02:12:09,649
in some ways it's it's of course a way
for me to acknowledge other people's

6592
02:12:09,649 --> 02:12:09,659
for me to acknowledge other people's
 

6593
02:12:09,659 --> 02:12:12,229
for me to acknowledge other people's
work that have come before me it's a

6594
02:12:12,229 --> 02:12:12,239
work that have come before me it's a
 

6595
02:12:12,239 --> 02:12:14,930
work that have come before me it's a
wonderful way to highlight

6596
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:14,940
wonderful way to highlight
 

6597
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:18,410
wonderful way to highlight
um the contribution by a prominent woman

6598
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:18,420
um the contribution by a prominent woman
 

6599
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:22,910
um the contribution by a prominent woman
and the way I I do it is it's a 25

6600
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:22,920
and the way I I do it is it's a 25
 

6601
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:26,209
and the way I I do it is it's a 25
minute play in costume

6602
02:12:26,209 --> 02:12:26,219
minute play in costume
 

6603
02:12:26,219 --> 02:12:29,390
minute play in costume
where I relive for people the moment of

6604
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:29,400
where I relive for people the moment of
 

6605
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:30,950
where I relive for people the moment of
discovery

6606
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:30,960
discovery
 

6607
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:33,290
discovery
then I turn into myself

6608
02:12:33,290 --> 02:12:33,300
then I turn into myself
 

6609
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:36,129
then I turn into myself
and then I give a 30 minute presentation

6610
02:12:36,129 --> 02:12:36,139
and then I give a 30 minute presentation
 

6611
02:12:36,139 --> 02:12:39,589
and then I give a 30 minute presentation
on the r process and the creation of

6612
02:12:39,589 --> 02:12:39,599
on the r process and the creation of
 

6613
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:42,410
on the r process and the creation of
heavy elements because the audience can

6614
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:42,420
heavy elements because the audience can
 

6615
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:44,629
heavy elements because the audience can
now perfectly understand that the public

6616
02:12:44,629 --> 02:12:44,639
now perfectly understand that the public
 

6617
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:48,109
now perfectly understand that the public
audience given the historic backdrop of

6618
02:12:48,109 --> 02:12:48,119
audience given the historic backdrop of
 

6619
02:12:48,119 --> 02:12:50,629
audience given the historic backdrop of
this discovery that they just lived

6620
02:12:50,629 --> 02:12:50,639
this discovery that they just lived
 

6621
02:12:50,639 --> 02:12:53,149
this discovery that they just lived
through my presentation

and
 

6631
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:05,990
and
you know when we write up our results in

6632
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:06,000
you know when we write up our results in
 

6633
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,490
you know when we write up our results in
let's say you know in magazines like

02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:07,500
let's say you know in magazines like
 

6635
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:09,709
let's say you know in magazines like
Nature and Science it's always about the

it's the discovery is never described
 

6643
02:13:18,119 --> 02:13:20,870
it's the discovery is never described
only ever the results

6647
02:13:23,579 --> 02:13:25,310
you asked me beforehand right what does
it feel to be at the telescope in this

6648
02:13:25,310 --> 02:13:25,320
it feel to be at the telescope in this
 

6649
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:26,689
it feel to be at the telescope in this
moment right

6650

talks about it and so having a form of
 

6657
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:40,550
talks about it and so having a form of
uh you know theater of the Arts to bring

6658
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:40,560
uh you know theater of the Arts to bring
 

6659
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,950
uh you know theater of the Arts to bring
this this exciting moment that that is

6660
02:13:42,950 --> 02:13:42,960
this this exciting moment that that is
 

6661
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:44,810
this this exciting moment that that is
what we all want to experience as

what we all want to experience as
 

6663
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:48,830
what we all want to experience as
scientists to a wider audience is so

6664
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:48,840
scientists to a wider audience is so
 

6665
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:51,830
scientists to a wider audience is so
profound and so rewarding and they all

love it because everyone can understand
 

6669
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:56,569
love it because everyone can understand
a moment of Discovery I was looking for

6670
02:13:56,569 --> 02:13:56,579
a moment of Discovery I was looking for
 

6671
02:13:56,579 --> 02:13:58,490
a moment of Discovery I was looking for
something and then I found it it's like

6672
02:13:58,490 --> 02:13:58,500
something and then I found it it's like
 

6673
02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:01,569
something and then I found it it's like
you misplaced car keys right

6674
02:14:01,569 --> 02:14:01,579
you misplaced car keys right
 

6675
02:14:01,579 --> 02:14:06,649
you misplaced car keys right
or love it yes yes it everyone can what

6676
02:14:06,649 --> 02:14:06,659
or love it yes yes it everyone can what
 

6677
02:14:06,659 --> 02:14:08,810
or love it yes yes it everyone can what
the Glorious experiences yes the the

6678
02:14:08,810 --> 02:14:08,820
the Glorious experiences yes the the
 

6679
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:11,510
the Glorious experiences yes the the
implications and the findings that is

6680
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:11,520
implications and the findings that is
 

6681
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:14,330
implications and the findings that is
much harder to understand for the for

6682
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:14,340
much harder to understand for the for
 

6683
02:14:14,340 --> 02:14:17,270
much harder to understand for the for
anyone this is where the scientists work

6684
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:17,280
anyone this is where the scientists work
 

6685
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:20,089
anyone this is where the scientists work
truly lies this is our job but the

6686
02:14:20,089 --> 02:14:20,099
truly lies this is our job but the
 

6687
02:14:20,099 --> 02:14:22,430
truly lies this is our job but the
moment of Discovery is easy

6688
02:14:22,430 --> 02:14:22,440
moment of Discovery is easy
 

6689
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:24,890
moment of Discovery is easy
and it's beautiful and it needs to be

6690
02:14:24,890 --> 02:14:24,900
and it's beautiful and it needs to be
 

6691
02:14:24,900 --> 02:14:28,189
and it's beautiful and it needs to be
said and so taking my audience on this

6692
02:14:28,189 --> 02:14:28,199
said and so taking my audience on this
 

6693
02:14:28,199 --> 02:14:31,069
said and so taking my audience on this
journey what is the perils what are my

6694

journey what is the perils what are my
worries and then ah here is the moment

6696
02:14:33,950 --> 02:14:33,960
worries and then ah here is the moment
 

6697
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:36,950
worries and then ah here is the moment
of Discovery let me tell you about it it

6698
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:36,960
of Discovery let me tell you about it it
 

6699
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:39,770
of Discovery let me tell you about it it
profoundly transformed me and here

6700
02:14:39,770 --> 02:14:39,780
profoundly transformed me and here
 

6701
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:42,709
profoundly transformed me and here
here's how it went right it it it's so

6702
02:14:42,709 --> 02:14:42,719
here's how it went right it it it's so
 

6703
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:45,709
here's how it went right it it it's so
good and art is a way to reveal this

6704
02:14:45,709 --> 02:14:45,719
good and art is a way to reveal this
 

6705
02:14:45,719 --> 02:14:47,689
good and art is a way to reveal this
fundamentally Human Side of science yes

6706
02:14:47,689 --> 02:14:47,699
fundamentally Human Side of science yes
 

6707
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:50,569
fundamentally Human Side of science yes
it's the problem with science is that's

6708
02:14:50,569 --> 02:14:50,579
it's the problem with science is that's
 

6709
02:14:50,579 --> 02:14:53,649
it's the problem with science is that's
people doing it

6710
02:14:53,649 --> 02:14:53,659

 

6711
02:14:53,659 --> 02:14:56,030

that's also what makes it beautiful

6712
02:14:56,030 --> 02:14:56,040
that's also what makes it beautiful
 

6713
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:58,669
that's also what makes it beautiful
right yeah humans are fascinating and

6714
02:14:58,669 --> 02:14:58,679
right yeah humans are fascinating and
 

6715
02:14:58,679 --> 02:14:59,930
right yeah humans are fascinating and
that we're able to come up with these

6716
02:14:59,930 --> 02:14:59,940
that we're able to come up with these
 

6717
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:01,910
that we're able to come up with these
ideas through all the struggle through

6718
02:15:01,910 --> 02:15:01,920
ideas through all the struggle through
 

6719
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:03,290
ideas through all the struggle through
all the hardship through all the Hope

6720
02:15:03,290 --> 02:15:03,300
all the hardship through all the Hope
 

6721
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:05,089
all the hardship through all the Hope
through all the search

6722
02:15:05,089 --> 02:15:05,099
through all the search
 

6723
02:15:05,099 --> 02:15:07,669
through all the search
and so the art is a great way to to

6724
02:15:07,669 --> 02:15:07,679
and so the art is a great way to to
 

6725
02:15:07,679 --> 02:15:11,330
and so the art is a great way to to
portray that and to broadcast that right

6726
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:11,340
portray that and to broadcast that right
 

6727
02:15:11,340 --> 02:15:13,370
portray that and to broadcast that right
I think this is how the audience really

6728
02:15:13,370 --> 02:15:13,380
I think this is how the audience really
 

6729
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:15,169
I think this is how the audience really
should be interacting with Scientists

6730
02:15:15,169 --> 02:15:15,179
should be interacting with Scientists
 

6731
02:15:15,179 --> 02:15:17,689
should be interacting with Scientists
much less about the findings but really

6732
02:15:17,689 --> 02:15:17,699
much less about the findings but really
 

6733
02:15:17,699 --> 02:15:19,910
much less about the findings but really
more about this Yearning For answers

6734
02:15:19,910 --> 02:15:19,920
more about this Yearning For answers
 

6735
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,550

6745
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:37,010
it's so relatable yeah we just need to
find more and better ways to to do that

6746
02:15:37,010 --> 02:15:37,020
find more and better ways to to do that
 

6747
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:40,069
find more and better ways to to do that
so I hope to turn this into also a

6748
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:40,079
so I hope to turn this into also a
 

6749
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:41,990
so I hope to turn this into also a
digitized version at some point to again

6750
02:15:41,990 --> 02:15:42,000
digitized version at some point to again
 

6751
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,669
digitized version at some point to again
make it more accessible

6752
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
make it more accessible

you do just that let me ask you a big
ridiculous question you look up at the

6764
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:56,880
ridiculous question you look up at the
 

6765
02:15:56,880 --> 02:16:00,109
ridiculous question you look up at the
stars you look up at the early

6766
02:16:00,109 --> 02:16:00,119
stars you look up at the early
 

6767
02:16:00,119 --> 02:16:02,569
stars you look up at the early
early Stars

6768
02:16:02,569 --> 02:16:02,579
early Stars
 

6769
02:16:02,579 --> 02:16:04,430
early Stars
so let me ask the big question that we

6770
02:16:04,430 --> 02:16:04,440
so let me ask the big question that we
 

6771
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:06,709
so let me ask the big question that we
humans often ask and struggle to answer

6772
02:16:06,709 --> 02:16:06,719
humans often ask and struggle to answer
 

6773
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:09,530
humans often ask and struggle to answer
what's the meaning of this whole thing

6774
02:16:09,530 --> 02:16:09,540
what's the meaning of this whole thing
 

6775
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:14,750
what's the meaning of this whole thing
why why are we here

6776
02:16:14,750 --> 02:16:14,760

 

6777
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:16,729

the biological evolution requires the

02:16:16,729 --> 02:16:16,739
the biological evolution requires the
 

6779
02:16:16,739 --> 02:16:18,530
the biological evolution requires the
chemical Evolution for all of this to

6780
02:16:18,530 --> 02:16:18,540
chemical Evolution for all of this to
 

6781
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:19,910
chemical Evolution for all of this to
kind of play out

6782
02:16:19,910 --> 02:16:19,920
kind of play out
 

6783
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:21,890
kind of play out
and carbon played this important role

6784
02:16:21,890 --> 02:16:21,900
and carbon played this important role
 

6785
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:24,649
and carbon played this important role
and you know in some sense we're just a

6786
02:16:24,649 --> 02:16:24,659
and you know in some sense we're just a
 

6787
02:16:24,659 --> 02:16:26,930
and you know in some sense we're just a
consequence of all of these things being

6788
02:16:26,930 --> 02:16:26,940
consequence of all of these things being
 

6789
02:16:26,940 --> 02:16:29,990
consequence of all of these things being
the way they are right so

6790
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:30,000
the way they are right so
 

6791
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,209
the way they are right so
maybe this is just where we are supposed

6792
02:16:32,209 --> 02:16:32,219
maybe this is just where we are supposed
 

6793
02:16:32,219 --> 02:16:35,209
maybe this is just where we are supposed
to be because you know the laws of

6794
02:16:35,209 --> 02:16:35,219
to be because you know the laws of
 

6795
02:16:35,219 --> 02:16:39,410
to be because you know the laws of
physics sort of work the way they do and

6796
02:16:39,410 --> 02:16:39,420
physics sort of work the way they do and
 

6797
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:41,810
physics sort of work the way they do and
um we talked much about the variety of

6798
02:16:41,810 --> 02:16:41,820
um we talked much about the variety of
 

6799
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:44,870
um we talked much about the variety of
of everything really in certainly you

6800
02:16:44,870 --> 02:16:44,880
of everything really in certainly you
 

6801
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:49,250
of everything really in certainly you
know from over here to over there and

6802
02:16:49,250 --> 02:16:49,260
know from over here to over there and
 

6803
02:16:49,260 --> 02:16:52,370
know from over here to over there and
things in the vicinity of where the sun

6804
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:52,380
things in the vicinity of where the sun
 

6805
02:16:52,380 --> 02:16:54,530
things in the vicinity of where the sun
and the solar system formed they were

6806
02:16:54,530 --> 02:16:54,540
and the solar system formed they were
 

6807
02:16:54,540 --> 02:16:57,650
and the solar system formed they were
the way they were and life maybe wasn't

6808
02:16:57,650 --> 02:16:57,660
the way they were and life maybe wasn't
 

6809
02:16:57,660 --> 02:16:59,629
the way they were and life maybe wasn't
necessary consequence of that

6810
02:16:59,629 --> 02:16:59,639
necessary consequence of that
 

6811
02:16:59,639 --> 02:17:01,610
necessary consequence of that
I in some sense I like to believe that

6812
02:17:01,610 --> 02:17:01,620
I in some sense I like to believe that
 

6813
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:03,770
I in some sense I like to believe that
because then it becomes reproducible and

6814
02:17:03,770 --> 02:17:03,780
because then it becomes reproducible and
 

6815
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:04,969
because then it becomes reproducible and
we can apply that same argument

6816
02:17:04,969 --> 02:17:04,979
we can apply that same argument
 

6817
02:17:04,979 --> 02:17:07,969
we can apply that same argument
elsewhere if it's total chance right

6818
02:17:07,969 --> 02:17:07,979
elsewhere if it's total chance right
 

6819
02:17:07,979 --> 02:17:10,250
elsewhere if it's total chance right
that makes it harder and that's not not

6820
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:10,260
that makes it harder and that's not not
 

6821
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:13,070
that makes it harder and that's not not
truly satisfying to to a scientist

6822
02:17:13,070 --> 02:17:13,080
truly satisfying to to a scientist
 

6823
02:17:13,080 --> 02:17:15,889
truly satisfying to to a scientist
so it's uh as a consequence

6824
02:17:15,889 --> 02:17:15,899
so it's uh as a consequence
 

6825
02:17:15,899 --> 02:17:18,650
so it's uh as a consequence
of psychological Evolution which is the

6826
02:17:18,650 --> 02:17:18,660
of psychological Evolution which is the
 

6827
02:17:18,660 --> 02:17:20,150
of psychological Evolution which is the
consequence of biological evolution

02:17:20,150 --> 02:17:20,160
consequence of biological evolution
 

6829
02:17:20,160 --> 02:17:21,650
consequence of biological evolution
which is consequence of chemical

6830
02:17:21,650 --> 02:17:21,660
which is consequence of chemical
 

6831
02:17:21,660 --> 02:17:23,209
which is consequence of chemical
Evolution consequence of physical
