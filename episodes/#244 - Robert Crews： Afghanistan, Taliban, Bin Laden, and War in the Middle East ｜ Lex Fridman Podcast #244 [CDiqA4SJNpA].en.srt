1883
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,669
um and also i think there was in many
quarters there was a deep urge for

and that's why we're doing this that
 

3333

that's right and i mean if you look at
 

3445
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,230
that's right and i mean if you look at
the speeches and the ideas the republic

3446
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
the speeches and the ideas the republic
 

3447

of hitler in the 1930s
 

3449
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,870
of hitler in the 1930s
he spoke quite

3450
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:38,880
he spoke quite
 

3451
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,430
he spoke quite
accurately to the

3452
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:41,440
accurately to the
 

3453
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,549

injustice and maybe the the suffering of
the german people

3456
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:46,400
the german people
 

3457
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,109
the german people
it i mean charismatic politicians are

3458
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:49,119
it i mean charismatic politicians are
 

3459
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,870
it i mean charismatic politicians are
good at telling accurate stories it's

3460
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
good at telling accurate stories it's
 

3461
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,030
good at telling accurate stories it's
not all fabricated

3462
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:53,040
not all fabricated
 

3463
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,510
not all fabricated
but they emphasize certain aspects right

3464
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:55,520
but they emphasize certain aspects right
 

3465
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,230
but they emphasize certain aspects right
and then the problem part is the actions

3466
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,240
and then the problem part is the actions
 

3467
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,549
and then the problem part is the actions
you should take based on that that's

3468
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:00,559
you should take based on that that's
 

3469
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,789
you should take based on that that's
right right so the the narratives and

3470
00:55:02,789 --> 00:55:02,799
right right so the the narratives and
 

3471
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,549
right right so the the narratives and
the stories may be grounded in

3472
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:04,559
the stories may be grounded in
 

3473
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,990
the stories may be grounded in
historical accuracy right the actions

3474
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,000
historical accuracy right the actions
 

3475
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,870
historical accuracy right the actions
then cross the line yeah the ethical

3476
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:10,880
then cross the line yeah the ethical
 

3477
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,349
then cross the line yeah the ethical
line yeah i find that too i mean it's a

3478
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:13,359
line yeah i find that too i mean it's a
 

3479
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:14,390
line yeah i find that too i mean it's a
again if you pick up just one of these

3480
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:14,400
again if you pick up just one of these
 

3481
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,910
again if you pick up just one of these
texts i mean it's it's a claudio scope

3482
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:15,920
texts i mean it's it's a claudio scope
 

3483
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,349
texts i mean it's it's a claudio scope
so the

3484
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:17,359
so the
 

3485
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,549
so the
hitler analogy is interesting because

3486
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:18,559
hitler analogy is interesting because
 

3487
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:19,430
hitler analogy is interesting because
it's

3488
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:19,440
it's
 

3489
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,950
it's
you know hitler spoke to

3490
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:20,960
you know hitler spoke to
 

3491
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,870
you know hitler spoke to

4233
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,470
a great way to understand bin ladenism
and the whole phenomenon but i think

4234
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:34,480
and the whole phenomenon but i think
 

4235
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,109
and the whole phenomenon but i think
looking at the big picture it's also

4236
01:07:37,109 --> 01:07:37,119
looking at the big picture it's also
 

4237
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,870
looking at the big picture it's also
you wonder

4238
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:38,880
you wonder
 

4239
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,870
you wonder
will that ever end right i mean is that

4240
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
will that ever end right i mean is that
 

4241
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,390
will that ever end right i mean is that
i mean that's the the risk of being a

4242
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:42,400
i mean that's the the risk of being a
 

4243
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,990
i mean that's the the risk of being a
kind of hyper power

4244
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,000
kind of hyper power
 

4245
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,549
kind of hyper power
um like the u.s were you

4278
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:24,480
how could it have been done better yeah
 

4279
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,749
how could it have been done better yeah
an important question

4280
01:08:25,749 --> 01:08:25,759
an important question
 

4281
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,789
an important question
i mean i would

4282
01:08:26,789 --> 01:08:26,799
i mean i would
 

4283
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:28,870
i mean i would
preface all this by saying

4284
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:28,880
preface all this by saying
 

4285
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,789
preface all this by saying
you know as i noted i think the war was

4286
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:30,799
you know as i noted i think the war was
 

4287
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,189
you know as i noted i think the war was
a mistake um

4288
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:33,199
a mistake um
 

4289
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,950
a mistake um
i

4290
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:34,960
i
 

4291
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,470
i
had hoped the war would end sooner i

4292
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:36,480
had hoped the war would end sooner i
 

4293
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,510
had hoped the war would end sooner i
think there were

4294
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:37,520
think there were
 

4295
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,669
think there were
different exit routes all along the way

4296
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:39,679
different exit routes all along the way
 

4297
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,669
different exit routes all along the way
again i think there were

4298
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:41,679
again i think there were
 

4299
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,349
again i think there were
lots of policy choices

4300
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:43,359
lots of policy choices
 

4301
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:45,189
lots of policy choices
in september in october when the war

4302
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:45,199
in september in october when the war
 

4303
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:46,789
in september in october when the war
began

4304
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:46,799
began
 

4305
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,390
began
there were choices in december 2001

4306
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:50,400
there were choices in december 2001
 

4307
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,390
there were choices in december 2001
so we could look at almost every

4308
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:52,400
so we could look at almost every
 

4309
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:55,430
so we could look at almost every
six-month stopping point and say

4310
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:55,440
six-month stopping point and say
 

4311
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,349
six-month stopping point and say
we could have done differently

4312
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:57,359
we could have done differently
 

4313
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,110
we could have done differently
as it turns out though i mean the way it

4314
01:08:59,110 --> 01:08:59,120
as it turns out though i mean the way it
 

4315
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,269
as it turns out though i mean the way it
played out um you know it's been

4316
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:01,279
played out um you know it's been
 

4317
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,789
played out um you know it's been
catastrophic and i think um

4318
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
catastrophic and i think um
 

4319
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,030
catastrophic and i think um

there are lots of signs that
 

4397
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,910
there are lots of signs that
malnutrition hunger starvation

4398
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:23,920
malnutrition hunger starvation
 

4399
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,830
malnutrition hunger starvation
are going to claim

4400
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:25,840
are going to claim
 

4401
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,350
are going to claim
tens of thousands maybe hundreds of

4402
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,360
tens of thousands maybe hundreds of
 

4403
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,270
tens of thousands maybe hundreds of
thousands of lives this winter

4404
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:29,280
thousands of lives this winter
 

4405
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,590
thousands of lives this winter
and i think there is really

4406
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:31,600
and i think there is really
 

4407
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,870
and i think there is really
nothing

4408
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:32,880
nothing
 

4409
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:34,709
nothing
there's no

4410
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:34,719
there's no
 

4411
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,510
there's no
framework in place to

4412
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:37,520
framework in place to
 

4413
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,790
framework in place to
force all that

4414
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:38,800
force all that
 

4415
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,390
force all that
what is the government

4416
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:40,400
what is the government
 

4417
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,709
what is the government
what is currently the system there

4418
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:42,719
what is currently the system there

what's the role of the taliban
 

4421
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,470
what's the role of the taliban
so there could be tens of thousands

4422
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:46,480
so there could be tens of thousands
 

4423
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,870
so there could be tens of thousands
hundreds of thousands that starve

4424
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:48,880
hundreds of thousands that starve
 

4425
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,830
hundreds of thousands that starve
uh

4426
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:49,840
uh
 

4427
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,189
uh
either just

4428
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:51,199
either just
 

4429
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:54,229

almost the famine or starve to death
 

4431
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:56,790
almost the famine or starve to death
so this is economic implosion this is

4432
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:56,800
so this is economic implosion this is
 

4433
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,830
so this is economic implosion this is
political implosion what um

01:10:59,830 --> 01:10:59,840
political implosion what um
 

4435
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,990
political implosion what um
what's the system they're like and what

4436

what's the system they're like and what
 

4437
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,229
what's the system they're like and what
could be the one you know some inkling

4438
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:04,239
could be the one you know some inkling
 

4439
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,550
could be the one you know some inkling
of hope right right

4440
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:06,560
of hope right right

1996 2001
 

4447
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,510
1996 2001
they controlled

4448
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:15,520
they controlled
 

4449
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,630
they controlled
some 85 to 90 of the country

4450
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:18,640
some 85 to 90 of the country
 

4451
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,630
some 85 to 90 of the country
now they own it all

4452
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:20,640
now they own it all
 

4453
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,310
now they own it all
but they have no budget

4454
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:22,320
but they have no budget

the afghan

4456
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:24,560
the afghan
 

4457
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,350
the afghan
banking system is

4458
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,360
banking system is

frozen
 

4461
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,110
frozen
so the financial system is a mess and

4462
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,120
so the financial system is a mess and
 

4463
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,350
so the financial system is a mess and
it's frozen by the u.s because the u.s

4464
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:33,360
it's frozen by the u.s because the u.s
 

4465
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,030
it's frozen by the u.s because the u.s
is trying to use that lever to exert

01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:35,040
is trying to use that lever to exert
 

4467
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,709
is trying to use that lever to exert
pressure on the taliban

01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,270
caravan to describe them and that that
has some attractive elements because

4644
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:33,280
has some attractive elements because

but today
and people tell us you know scholars who

4652
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:40,800

4659
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,390
the taliban is this kind of hodgepodge
of different actors and people and

4660
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,400

4661
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,070
of different actors and people and

4662
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,080
competing interests
 

4663
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,669
competing interests
and i think

4664
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:49,679
and i think
 

4665
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:51,430
and i think
so we have a lot of scholars say listen

4666
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:51,440
so we have a lot of scholars say listen
 

4667

4671
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,709
it's got people in this city in that
city and so on i think actually

4672
01:14:58,709 --> 01:14:58,719
city and so on i think actually
 

4673
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:00,229
city and so on i think actually
i was always very skeptical how do they

4674
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
i was always very skeptical how do they
 

4675
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,830
i was always very skeptical how do they
know this i mean this is an organization

4676
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840
know this i mean this is an organization
 

4677
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,189
know this i mean this is an organization
that doesn't

4678
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:03,199
that doesn't
 

4679
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,030
that doesn't

4681
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,630
want you to know um where that money
comes from and so on

4682
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:06,640
comes from and so on
 

4683
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:08,390
comes from and so on
but i would say

4684
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:08,400
but i would say
 

4685
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,070
but i would say
now that we have a clear picture of what

4686
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:10,080
now that we have a clear picture of what
 

4687
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,390
now that we have a clear picture of what
has happened i'd say they are a

4688
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:12,400
has happened i'd say they are a
 

4689
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,030
has happened i'd say they are a

01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,040
astoundingly well-organized
 

4691

that has
a

4696
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,679
a

and enduring ideology
which is quite idiosyncratic if we zoom

4702
01:15:26,709 --> 01:15:26,719
which is quite idiosyncratic if we zoom
 

4703
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:28,149
which is quite idiosyncratic if we zoom
out and continue the conversation we're

about radicalism and
you know who's drawn to what

on even in this tense period yeah but i

5258
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:22,400
on even in this tense period yeah but i
 

5259
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,910
on even in this tense period yeah but i
think that when the cameras

5260
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:23,920

gonna happen it's gonna get much worse i
 

5265
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,390
gonna happen it's gonna get much worse i
think

5266
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:28,400
think
 

5267
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,229
think
so the challenge now is you know can the

5268
01:24:30,229 --> 01:24:30,239
so the challenge now is you know can the
 

5269
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,830
so the challenge now is you know can the
taliban rule

5270
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:31,840
taliban rule
 

5271
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,870
taliban rule
and

5272
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:32,880
and
 

5273
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,550
and
and then this is where the diplomacy is

5274
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:34,560
and then this is where the diplomacy is
 

5275
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,910
and then this is where the diplomacy is
so important because

5276
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:35,920
so important because
 

5277
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,709
so important because
the top one can't rule in isolation and

5278
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
the top one can't rule in isolation and
 

5279
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,390
the top one can't rule in isolation and
they know that and

they know that and
 

5281
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,590
they know that and
part of the success is due to the fact

5282
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:41,600
part of the success is due to the fact
 

5283
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,629
part of the success is due to the fact
that they were

5284
01:24:42,629 --> 01:24:42,639

um
 

6303
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,910
um
the trick though is let me i don't mean

the trick though is let me i don't mean
to be evasive but just to convince some

to be evasive but just to convince some
 

6307
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:32,229
to be evasive but just to convince some
of the complexity um one quick answer as

6308
01:40:32,229 --> 01:40:32,239
of the complexity um one quick answer as
 

6309
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,470
of the complexity um one quick answer as
well the majority of minorities i mean

6310

maps
 

6315
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,109
maps
but i would say

6316
01:40:39,109 --> 01:40:39,119
but i would say
 

6317
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:41,669
but i would say
suspend any firm belief in that because

6318
01:40:41,669 --> 01:40:41,679
suspend any firm belief in that because
 

6319
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:43,669
suspend any firm belief in that because
that could be entirely wrong in fact

6320
01:40:43,669 --> 01:40:43,679
that could be entirely wrong in fact

01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:45,189
that could be entirely wrong in fact

01:49:17,430 --> 01:49:17,440
you know plucking out one sample from
 

6869
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,070
you know plucking out one sample from
some fairly remote area

6870
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:20,080
some fairly remote area
 

6871
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:21,669
some fairly remote area
from one like follow the follow the

6872
01:49:21,669 --> 01:49:21,679
from one like follow the follow the

agricultural products i mean
and this is where you know i think

6876
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:26,000
and this is where you know i think
 

6877
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,310
and this is where you know i think
urban rural divides sure used to mean a

6878

in the 19th century right so a lot of
 

6883
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,189
in the 19th century right so a lot of
like nuts and bolts of history is about

6884
01:49:33,189 --> 01:49:33,199
like nuts and bolts of history is about
 

6885

like nuts and bolts of history is about
conceiving of these kinds of

6886
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:34,960
conceiving of these kinds of
 

6887
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,870

bit you see that like
 

6893
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,270
bit you see that like
urban areas are fed by rural interlands

6894
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:43,280
urban areas are fed by rural interlands
 

6895
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,910
urban areas are fed by rural interlands
and if you look think of who actually

6896
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:45,920
and if you look think of who actually
 

6897
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,750
and if you look think of who actually
you know brings the bread the milk you

6898
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:47,760
you know brings the bread the milk you
 

6899
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,669

6901
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:51,589
know the pomegranates and so on it
creates these networks and then

6902
01:49:51,589 --> 01:49:51,599
creates these networks and then
 

6903
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:53,030
creates these networks and then
you know mobility

6904
01:49:53,030 --> 01:49:53,040
you know mobility
 

6905
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,510
you know mobility
channels information and so on

6906
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:55,520
channels information and so on
 

6907
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,030
channels information and so on
but yeah that but your broader point

6908
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:57,040
but yeah that but your broader point

02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:13,910
you could see from the perspective of
afghanistan

7858

that america is not some kind of place
that has an ideal of freedom and all the

7862
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:19,119
that has an ideal of freedom and all the

02:04:20,790 --> 02:04:20,800
kind of things that we american tell
 

7865
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,270
kind of things that we american tell
ourselves yeah but it's more

7866
02:04:23,270 --> 02:04:23,280
ourselves yeah but it's more
 

7867
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:25,830
ourselves yeah but it's more
america has the idea of empire that

7868
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:25,840
america has the idea of empire that
 

7869
02:04:25,840 --> 02:04:28,390
america has the idea of empire that
there's one place that has the truth and

7870
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:28,400
there's one place that has the truth and
 

7871
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,589
there's one place that has the truth and
everybody else must follow this truth

7872
02:04:31,589 --> 02:04:31,599
everybody else must follow this truth
 

7873
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:34,229
everybody else must follow this truth
and so from a perspective afghanistan it

7874

and so from a perspective afghanistan it
 

7875
02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:36,390
and so from a perspective afghanistan it
could be a victory against this idea of

military-industrial complex
 

8279
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:10,629
military-industrial complex
where there's just a momentum

8280
02:11:10,629 --> 02:11:10,639
where there's just a momentum
 

8281
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:13,270
where there's just a momentum
where after 9 11

8282
02:11:13,270 --> 02:11:13,280
where after 9 11
 

8283
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:16,229
where after 9 11
the feeling like we should do something

02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:16,239
the feeling like we should do something
 

8285
02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:19,669
the feeling like we should do something
led to us doing something and then a lot

8286
02:11:19,669 --> 02:11:19,679
led to us doing something and then a lot
 

8287
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:21,430
led to us doing something and then a lot
of people realizing they can make money

8288
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:21,440
of people realizing they can make money
 

8289
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:23,589
of people realizing they can make money
from doing more of that something and

8290
02:11:23,589 --> 02:11:23,599
from doing more of that something and
 

8291
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:26,069
from doing more of that something and
then it's just the momentum where no one

8292
02:11:26,069 --> 02:11:26,079
then it's just the momentum where no one
 

8293
02:11:26,079 --> 02:11:27,750
then it's just the momentum where no one
person is

8294
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:27,760
person is
 

8295
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:29,990
person is

sitting there petting a cat in an evil
way

8298
02:11:30,790 --> 02:11:30,800
way
 

8299
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,790
way
saying we're going to spend all of this

8300
02:11:32,790 --> 02:11:32,800
saying we're going to spend all of this
 

8301

saying we're going to spend all of this
money and create more suffering and

8302
02:11:34,629 --> 02:11:34,639
money and create more suffering and
 

8303
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:36,310
money and create more suffering and
create more terrorism right but it's

8304
02:11:36,310 --> 02:11:36,320
create more terrorism right but it's
 

8305
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,990
create more terrorism right but it's
just something about the momentum that

8306
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:38,000
just something about the momentum that
 

8307
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,950
just something about the momentum that
leads to that and it to me honestly i

8308
02:11:40,950 --> 02:11:40,960
leads to that and it to me honestly i
 

8309

i agree and yeah there is the
multi-industrial complex component which

8330
02:12:07,990 --> 02:12:08,000
multi-industrial complex component which
 

8331
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,109
multi-industrial complex component which
is huge

8332
02:12:09,109 --> 02:12:09,119
is huge
 

8333

has become a shadow of what it was once
capable of doing

8360
02:12:35,669 --> 02:12:35,679
capable of doing
 

8361
02:12:35,679 --> 02:12:37,189
capable of doing
and of course i mean other historians us

8362
02:12:37,189 --> 02:12:37,199

8374
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:48,960
and i think you know we need a reckoning
 

8375
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:50,709
and i think you know we need a reckoning
about how the united states uses

8376
02:12:50,709 --> 02:12:50,719
about how the united states uses
 

8377
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:52,069
about how the united states uses
military power

8378
02:12:52,069 --> 02:12:52,079
military power
 

8379
02:12:52,079 --> 02:12:54,149
military power
you know why we devote so much to our

8380
02:12:54,149 --> 02:12:54,159
you know why we devote so much to our
 

8381
02:12:54,159 --> 02:12:55,990
you know why we devote so much to our
military budget and what could be

8382
02:12:55,990 --> 02:12:56,000
military budget and what could be
 

8383
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,229
military budget and what could be
available to us if we

8384
02:12:58,229 --> 02:12:58,239
available to us if we
 

8385
02:12:58,239 --> 02:13:00,550
available to us if we
had a more sensible view of the value of

8386
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:00,560
had a more sensible view of the value of
 

8387
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:02,870
had a more sensible view of the value of
military power of its effectiveness

8388
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:02,880
military power of its effectiveness
 

8389
02:13:02,880 --> 02:13:04,790
military power of its effectiveness
and i think we're willing to hammer home

8390
02:13:04,790 --> 02:13:04,800
and i think we're willing to hammer home
 

8391
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:06,229
and i think we're willing to hammer home
that this is a defeat i mean i think

8392
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:06,239
that this is a defeat i mean i think
 

8393
02:13:06,239 --> 02:13:07,350
that this is a defeat i mean i think
there should be accountability and if

8394
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:07,360
there should be accountability and if
 

8395
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:09,589
there should be accountability and if
you and this could be a kind of opening

8396
02:13:09,589 --> 02:13:09,599
you and this could be a kind of opening
 

8397
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:11,109
you and this could be a kind of opening
for a kind of bipartisan conversation

8398
02:13:11,109 --> 02:13:11,119
for a kind of bipartisan conversation
 

8399
02:13:11,119 --> 02:13:12,550
for a kind of bipartisan conversation
because if you are

8407
02:13:19,440 --> 02:13:21,750
look at the leadership that got you to a
place where you're defeated by

02:13:21,750 --> 02:13:21,760
place where you're defeated by
 

8409
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:23,910

and that's it it's not a crime
 

9013
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:11,429
and that's it it's not a crime

and it's kind of the legalese that that
 

9019

yeah in a way where the opposite is true
 

9031
02:23:29,439 --> 02:23:30,550
yeah in a way where the opposite is true
which is

9032
02:23:30,550 --> 02:23:30,560
which is
 

9033
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:33,510
which is

02:25:14,550 --> 02:25:14,560
some kind of assessments from that too
 

9127
02:25:14,560 --> 02:25:15,830
some kind of assessments from that too
but um

9128
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:15,840
but um
 

9129
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:17,670
but um
but also learning from learning how not

9130
02:25:17,670 --> 02:25:17,680
but also learning from learning how not
 

9131
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:20,870
but also learning from learning how not
to do things right and then

to do things right and then
 

9133
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:22,309
to do things right and then
you know analogies are never like one to

9134
02:25:22,309 --> 02:25:22,319
you know analogies are never like one to
 

9135
02:25:22,319 --> 02:25:24,309

one i mean we talk about vietnam i mean

9136

one i mean we talk about vietnam i mean
 

9137
02:25:24,319 --> 02:25:25,110
one i mean we talk about vietnam i mean
i think

9138
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:25,120
i think
 

9139
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:26,870
i think
many vietnam veterans would say

9140
02:25:26,870 --> 02:25:26,880
many vietnam veterans would say
 

9141
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:28,389
many vietnam veterans would say
yeah this is like deja vu you know i

9142
02:25:28,389 --> 02:25:28,399
yeah this is like deja vu you know i
 

9143
02:25:28,399 --> 02:25:30,070
yeah this is like deja vu you know i
mean there's the story the the the

9144
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:30,080
mean there's the story the the the
 

9145
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,870
mean there's the story the the the
visuals of the kabul airport and of

9146
02:25:32,870 --> 02:25:32,880
visuals of the kabul airport and of
 

9147
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:35,349
visuals of the kabul airport and of
of the saigon embassy were not the same

9148
02:25:35,349 --> 02:25:35,359
of the saigon embassy were not the same
 

9149
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:36,469
of the saigon embassy were not the same
but close enough that people would

9150
02:25:36,469 --> 02:25:36,479
but close enough that people would
 

9151
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:38,790
but close enough that people would
juxtapose them all let's run up but i

9152
02:25:38,790 --> 02:25:38,800
juxtapose them all let's run up but i
 

9153
02:25:38,800 --> 02:25:40,870
juxtapose them all let's run up but i
would just ask people that you know

9154
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:40,880
would just ask people that you know
 

9155
02:25:40,880 --> 02:25:42,870
would just ask people that you know
overanalogizing is also you know a kind

9156
02:25:42,870 --> 02:25:42,880
overanalogizing is also you know a kind
 

9157
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:43,590
overanalogizing is also you know a kind
of

9158
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:43,600
of
 

9159
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:46,150
of
path down like making errors of judgment

9160
02:25:46,150 --> 02:25:46,160
path down like making errors of judgment
 

9161
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:47,750
path down like making errors of judgment
and in comparison

9162
02:25:47,750 --> 02:25:47,760
and in comparison
 

9163
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:48,630
and in comparison
and then

9164
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:48,640
and then
 

9165
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:50,389
and then
sameness um

9166
02:25:50,389 --> 02:25:50,399
sameness um
 

9167
02:25:50,399 --> 02:25:51,830
sameness um
but it's stretch you mean like 9 11

9168
02:25:51,830 --> 02:25:51,840
but it's stretch you mean like 9 11
 

9169
02:25:51,840 --> 02:25:54,469
but it's stretch you mean like 9 11
itself i think the idea that um

9170
02:25:54,469 --> 02:25:54,479
itself i think the idea that um
 

9171
02:25:54,479 --> 02:25:56,790
itself i think the idea that um
people lack the imagination within our

9172
02:25:56,790 --> 02:25:56,800
people lack the imagination within our
 

9173
02:25:56,800 --> 02:25:58,630
people lack the imagination within our
security apparatus to think this is even

9174
02:25:58,630 --> 02:25:58,640
security apparatus to think this is even
 

9175
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:00,309
security apparatus to think this is even
possible right

9176
02:26:00,309 --> 02:26:00,319
possible right
 

9177
02:26:00,319 --> 02:26:01,750
possible right
and you think of the simplicity of

9178
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:01,760
and you think of the simplicity of
 

9179
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:05,030
and you think of the simplicity of
having a 10 lock on a cockpit door you

02:26:10,479 --> 02:26:12,790
either the time or in hindsight that i
am on mission about all this but
