team to be working with so let me ask
you about the fermi paradox about aliens

78
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
you about the fermi paradox about aliens
 

79

you about the fermi paradox about aliens
why have we not found overwhelming

80
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
why have we not found overwhelming
 

81
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,350
why have we not found overwhelming
evidence for aliens visiting earth

evidence for aliens visiting earth
 

83
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,950
evidence for aliens visiting earth
i don't have a conviction in the answer

84
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
i don't have a conviction in the answer
 

85
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,870
i don't have a conviction in the answer
but rather kind of probabilistic

86
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,880
but rather kind of probabilistic
 

87
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,030
but rather kind of probabilistic
perspective on what might be a let's say

88
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
perspective on what might be a let's say
 

89
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,710
perspective on what might be a let's say
possible answers it's also interesting

90
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
possible answers it's also interesting
 

91
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,830
possible answers it's also interesting
that the question itself even

92
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
that the question itself even
 

93
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,230
that the question itself even
can't touch on the you know your typical

94
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
can't touch on the you know your typical
 

95
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,749
can't touch on the you know your typical
question of what's the meaning of life

96
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
question of what's the meaning of life
 

97
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,590
question of what's the meaning of life
because like if you assume that like we

98
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
because like if you assume that like we
 

99
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,030
because like if you assume that like we
don't see aliens because they destroy

100
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
don't see aliens because they destroy
 

101
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,270
don't see aliens because they destroy
themselves that kind of upwards their

102
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
themselves that kind of upwards their
 

103
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,950
themselves that kind of upwards their
focus on making sure that we won't

104
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
focus on making sure that we won't
 

105
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,070
focus on making sure that we won't
destroy ourselves yeah and at the moment

106
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
destroy ourselves yeah and at the moment
 

107
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,350
destroy ourselves yeah and at the moment
the

108
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
the
 

109
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,350
the
place where i am actually with my belief

110
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
place where i am actually with my belief
 

111
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,030
place where i am actually with my belief
and these things also change over the

112
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
and these things also change over the
 

113
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,070
and these things also change over the
time

114
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
time
 

115
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,030
time
is i think that we might be alone in the

116
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
is i think that we might be alone in the
 

117
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,589
is i think that we might be alone in the
universe which actually makes

118
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
universe which actually makes
 

119
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,830
universe which actually makes
life more or less a consciousness life

120
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
life more or less a consciousness life
 

121
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,470
life more or less a consciousness life
more kind of valuable and that means

122
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
more kind of valuable and that means
 

123
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,390
more kind of valuable and that means
that we should more appreciate it

124
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
that we should more appreciate it
 

125
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,150
that we should more appreciate it
have you always been alone so what's

126
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
have you always been alone so what's
 

127
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,150
have you always been alone so what's
your intuition about our galaxy our

128
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
your intuition about our galaxy our
 

129
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,150
your intuition about our galaxy our
universe is it just

130
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
universe is it just
 

131
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,630
universe is it just
sprinkled with graveyards of intelligent

132
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
sprinkled with graveyards of intelligent
 

133
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,990
sprinkled with graveyards of intelligent
civilizations or are we truly is is life

134
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,000
civilizations or are we truly is is life
 

135
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,070
civilizations or are we truly is is life
intelligent life truly unique

136
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
intelligent life truly unique
 

137
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,990
intelligent life truly unique
at the moment my belief that it is

138
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
at the moment my belief that it is
 

139
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,630
at the moment my belief that it is
unique but i would say i could also

140
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
unique but i would say i could also
 

141
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,790
unique but i would say i could also
you know there was like some footage

142
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
you know there was like some footage
 

143
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,910
you know there was like some footage
released with ufo objects which makes me

144
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:49,920
released with ufo objects which makes me
 

145
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,110
released with ufo objects which makes me
actually doubt my own belief yes

146
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
actually doubt my own belief yes
 

147
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,110
actually doubt my own belief yes
yeah i can tell you one crazy answer

148
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
yeah i can tell you one crazy answer
 

149
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,509
yeah i can tell you one crazy answer
that i have heard yes

150
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
that i have heard yes
 

151
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,790
that i have heard yes
so

152
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
so
 

153
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,710
so
apparently when you look actually at the

154
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
apparently when you look actually at the
 

155
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,550
apparently when you look actually at the
limits of computation

156
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
limits of computation
 

157
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,190
limits of computation
you can compute more

158
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
you can compute more
 

159
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,750
you can compute more
if the temperature of the universe would

160
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
if the temperature of the universe would
 

161
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,670
if the temperature of the universe would
drop down

162
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
drop down
 

163
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,990
drop down
so one of the things that

164
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
so one of the things that
 

165
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,070
so one of the things that
aliens might want to do if they are

166
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
aliens might want to do if they are
 

167
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,070
aliens might want to do if they are
truly optimizing to maximize amount of

168
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080

instead of wasting current entropy of
 

175
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,430
instead of wasting current entropy of
the universe because you know we by

the universe because you know we by
 

177
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,750

then you can wait for the universe to

182
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
then you can wait for the universe to
 

183
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,390
then you can wait for the universe to
cool down such that you have more

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
cool down such that you have more

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,149
cool down such that you have more
computation that's kind of a funny

186
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159

189
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,070
answer i'm not sure if i believe in it
but that would be one of the reasons why

190
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
but that would be one of the reasons why
 

191
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,589
but that would be one of the reasons why
you don't see aliens it's also possible

192
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
you don't see aliens it's also possible
 

193
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,990
you don't see aliens it's also possible
see some people say that maybe there is

194
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,000
see some people say that maybe there is
 

195
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,670
see some people say that maybe there is
not that much point in actually going to

196
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:45,680
not that much point in actually going to
 

197
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,110
not that much point in actually going to
other galaxies

198
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120

if you can go inwards

200
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
if you can go inwards
 

201
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,910
if you can go inwards
so there is no limits of what could be

202
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
so there is no limits of what could be
 

203

00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
if we could you know connect machines to
 

207
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,190

while there are still some limits if we
 

211
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,390
while there are still some limits if we
want to explore universe yeah there

want to explore universe yeah there
 

213
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,550
want to explore universe yeah there
could be a lot of

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
could be a lot of
 

215
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,869
could be a lot of
ways to go inwards too

216
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
ways to go inwards too
 

217
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,030

00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
may be like just a huge amount of
 

231
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,790
may be like just a huge amount of
different ways to travel and it doesn't

different ways to travel and it doesn't
 

233
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,189
different ways to travel and it doesn't
require a spaceship going

234
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
require a spaceship going

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
feels you know one of the problems is
 

239
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,749
feels you know one of the problems is
that speed of light is low and universe

that speed of light is low and universe
 

241
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,990
that speed of light is low and universe
is vast yeah and um

242
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
is vast yeah and um
 

243
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,990
is vast yeah and um
it seems that actually most likely if we

244
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
it seems that actually most likely if we
 

245
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,830
it seems that actually most likely if we
want to travel very far

246
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
want to travel very far
 

247
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,150
want to travel very far
then then we would instead of actually

248
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
then then we would instead of actually
 

249
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,550
then then we would instead of actually
sending spaceships with humans that wait

250
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
sending spaceships with humans that wait
 

251
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,909
sending spaceships with humans that wait
a lot we would

252
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
a lot we would
 

253
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,749
a lot we would
send something similar to what yuri

254
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
send something similar to what yuri
 

255
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,070
send something similar to what yuri
miller is working on these are like a

few grams of equipment and that might be
 

269
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,390

then when you think what would it mean

274
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
then when you think what would it mean
 

275
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,830
then when you think what would it mean
for humans it means that

276
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
for humans it means that
 

277
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,350
for humans it means that
we would need to actually put their 3d

278
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
we would need to actually put their 3d
 

279
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,070
we would need to actually put their 3d
printer and you know 3d print a human on

280
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
printer and you know 3d print a human on
 

281
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,990
printer and you know 3d print a human on
other planet i don't know play them

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,390
other planet i don't know play them
youtube or let's say or like a pre 3d

284
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
youtube or let's say or like a pre 3d
 

285
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,070
youtube or let's say or like a pre 3d
print like a huge human right away or

286
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
print like a huge human right away or
 

287
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,029
print like a huge human right away or
maybe a womb or so um yeah

288
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
maybe a womb or so um yeah
 

289
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,870
maybe a womb or so um yeah

if

294
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
if
 

295
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,710
if
a civilization was born and died

296
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
a civilization was born and died
 

297
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,950
a civilization was born and died
long long enough ago on earth we

298
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
long long enough ago on earth we
 

299
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,350
long long enough ago on earth we
wouldn't be able to tell and so that

300
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
wouldn't be able to tell and so that
 

301
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,189
wouldn't be able to tell and so that
makes me really sad

302
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
makes me really sad
 

303
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,189
makes me really sad
and so i think about earth in that same

304
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
and so i think about earth in that same
 

305
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,390
and so i think about earth in that same
way how can we leave some remnants if we

306
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
way how can we leave some remnants if we
 

307
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,629
way how can we leave some remnants if we
do destroy ourselves how can we leave

308
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
do destroy ourselves how can we leave
 

309
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,710
do destroy ourselves how can we leave
remnants for aliens in the future to

310
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
remnants for aliens in the future to
 

311
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,990
remnants for aliens in the future to
discover

312
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
discover
 

313
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,390
discover
like here's some nice stuff we've done

314
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
like here's some nice stuff we've done
 

315
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,870
like here's some nice stuff we've done
like wikipedia and youtube do we have it

316
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
like wikipedia and youtube do we have it
 

317
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,590
like wikipedia and youtube do we have it
like

318
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
like
 

319
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,990
like
in a satellite orbiting earth

320
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
in a satellite orbiting earth
 

321
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,430
in a satellite orbiting earth
with a hard drive like how how do we say

322
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
with a hard drive like how how do we say
 

323
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,070
with a hard drive like how how do we say
how do we back up human civilization

324
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
how do we back up human civilization
 

325
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,309
how do we back up human civilization
uh for the good parts or

326
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
uh for the good parts or
 

327
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,990
uh for the good parts or
all of it is good parts

328
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
all of it is good parts
 

329
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,430
all of it is good parts
so that uh

330
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
so that uh
 

331
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,270
so that uh
it can be preserved longer than our

332
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
it can be preserved longer than our
 

333
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,350
it can be preserved longer than our
bodies can that's a

334
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
bodies can that's a
 

335
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,189
bodies can that's a
that's kind of a

336
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
that's kind of a
 

337
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,629
that's kind of a
it's a difficult question it also

338
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
it's a difficult question it also
 

339
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,029
it's a difficult question it also
requires the difficult acceptance of the

340
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
requires the difficult acceptance of the
 

341
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,670
requires the difficult acceptance of the
fact that we may die and if we die we

342
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
fact that we may die and if we die we
 

343
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,469
fact that we may die and if we die we
may

344
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
may
 

345
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,350
may
die suddenly as a civilization

346
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
die suddenly as a civilization
 

347
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,670
die suddenly as a civilization
so let's see i think it kind of depends

348
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
so let's see i think it kind of depends
 

349
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,070
so let's see i think it kind of depends
on the cataclysm we have observed in

350
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
on the cataclysm we have observed in
 

351
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,469
on the cataclysm we have observed in
other parts of the universe that births

352
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
other parts of the universe that births
 

353
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,710
other parts of the universe that births
of gamma rays

354
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
of gamma rays
 

355
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,749
of gamma rays
these are

356
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
these are
 

357
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,110
these are
high energy

358
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
high energy
 

359
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,270
high energy
rays of light that actually can

360
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
rays of light that actually can
 

361
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,550
rays of light that actually can
apparently kill entire galaxy

362
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
apparently kill entire galaxy
 

363
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,469
apparently kill entire galaxy
so there might be actually nothing even

364
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
so there might be actually nothing even
 

365
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,189
so there might be actually nothing even
to

366
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
to
 

367
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,510
to
nothing to protect us from it i'm also

368
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
nothing to protect us from it i'm also
 

369
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,029
nothing to protect us from it i'm also
when i'm looking actually at the past

370
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
when i'm looking actually at the past
 

371
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,830
when i'm looking actually at the past
civilization so it's like aztecs or so

372
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
civilization so it's like aztecs or so
 

373
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,990
civilization so it's like aztecs or so
they disappear from the

374
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
they disappear from the
 

375
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,870
they disappear from the
surface of the earth and one can ask

376
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
surface of the earth and one can ask
 

377
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,390
surface of the earth and one can ask
why is it the case

378
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
why is it the case
 

379
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,390
why is it the case
and

380
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
and
 

381
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,710
and
the way i'm thinking about it is

382
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
the way i'm thinking about it is
 

383
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,710
the way i'm thinking about it is
you know that definitely they had some

384
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
you know that definitely they had some
 

385
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,870
you know that definitely they had some
problem that they couldn't solve

386
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
problem that they couldn't solve
 

387
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,029
problem that they couldn't solve
and maybe there was a flat and all of a

388
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
and maybe there was a flat and all of a
 

389
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,790
and maybe there was a flat and all of a
sudden they couldn't drink there was no

390
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
sudden they couldn't drink there was no
 

391
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,350
sudden they couldn't drink there was no
potable water and they all died

392
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
potable water and they all died
 

393
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,270
potable water and they all died
and

394
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
and
 

395
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,189
and
i think that

396
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
i think that
 

397
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,950
i think that
so far

398
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
so far
 

399
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,150
so far
the best solution to such a problems is

400
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
the best solution to such a problems is
 

401
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,469
the best solution to such a problems is
i guess technology so i mean if they

402
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
i guess technology so i mean if they
 

403
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,469
i guess technology so i mean if they
would know that you can just boil water

404
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
would know that you can just boil water
 

405
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,550
would know that you can just boil water
and then drink it after then that would

406
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
and then drink it after then that would
 

407
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,950
and then drink it after then that would
save their civilization and even now

408
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
save their civilization and even now
 

409
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,790
save their civilization and even now
when we look actually at the current

410
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:36,800
when we look actually at the current
 

411
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,270
when we look actually at the current
pandemic it seems that once again

412
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
pandemic it seems that once again
 

413
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,670
pandemic it seems that once again
actually science comes to rescue and

414
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680
actually science comes to rescue and
 

415
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,990
actually science comes to rescue and
somehow science increases size of the

416
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
somehow science increases size of the
 

417
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,469
somehow science increases size of the
action space and i think that's a good

418
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
action space and i think that's a good
 

419
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,270
action space and i think that's a good
thing

420
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
thing
 

421
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,189
thing
yeah but nature

422
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
yeah but nature
 

423
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,790
yeah but nature
has a vastly larger action space but

424
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
has a vastly larger action space but
 

425
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,629
has a vastly larger action space but
still it might be a good thing for us to

426
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
still it might be a good thing for us to
 

427
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,309
still it might be a good thing for us to
keep on increasing action space

428
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319

 

429
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,270

okay

430
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
okay
 

431
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,749
okay
looking at past civilizations yes

432
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
looking at past civilizations yes
 

433
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,230
looking at past civilizations yes
but looking at the destruction of human

434
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
but looking at the destruction of human
 

435
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,749
but looking at the destruction of human
civilization

436
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
civilization
 

437
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,469
civilization
perhaps expanding the action space will

438
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
perhaps expanding the action space will
 

439
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,629
perhaps expanding the action space will
add

440
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
add
 

441
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,189
add
actions that are easily

442
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
actions that are easily
 

443
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,230
actions that are easily
acted upon easily executed and as a

444
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
acted upon easily executed and as a
 

445
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,909
acted upon easily executed and as a
result destroy

446
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
result destroy
 

447
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,869
result destroy
us

448
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
us
 

449
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,230
us
so let's see

450
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
so let's see
 

451
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,390
so let's see
i was pondering

452
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
i was pondering
 

453
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,150
i was pondering
why actually even

454
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
why actually even
 

455
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,390
why actually even
we have negative impact on the

456
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
we have negative impact on the
 

457
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,950
we have negative impact on the
globe because you know if you ask every

458
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
globe because you know if you ask every
 

459
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,029
globe because you know if you ask every
single individual they would like to

460
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
single individual they would like to
 

461
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,630
single individual they would like to
have clean air

462
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640
have clean air
 

463
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,070
have clean air
they would like healthy planet but

464
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
they would like healthy planet but
 

465
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,469
they would like healthy planet but
somehow it actually is not the case that

466
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
somehow it actually is not the case that
 

467
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,550
somehow it actually is not the case that
as a collective we are not going this

468
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
as a collective we are not going this
 

469
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,070
as a collective we are not going this
direction

470
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
direction
 

471
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,550
direction
i think that there exists very powerful

472
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
i think that there exists very powerful
 

473
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,470
i think that there exists very powerful
system to describe what we value that's

474
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
system to describe what we value that's
 

475
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,630
system to describe what we value that's
capitalism it assigns actually monetary

476
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
capitalism it assigns actually monetary
 

477
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,269
capitalism it assigns actually monetary
values to various activities at the

478
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:49,279
values to various activities at the
 

479
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,670
values to various activities at the
moment the problem in the current system

480
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
moment the problem in the current system
 

481
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,269
moment the problem in the current system
is that there are some things which we

482
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
is that there are some things which we
 

483
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,230
is that there are some things which we
value there is no cost assigned to it so

484
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
value there is no cost assigned to it so
 

485
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,949
value there is no cost assigned to it so
even though we value clean air or maybe

486
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959
even though we value clean air or maybe
 

487
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,030
even though we value clean air or maybe
we also

488
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
we also
 

489
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,470
we also
value

490
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
value
 

491
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,790
value
lack of destruction on the internet or

492
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
lack of destruction on the internet or
 

493
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,710
lack of destruction on the internet or
so at the moment

494
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
so at the moment
 

495
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,790
so at the moment
these quantities you know companies

496
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:08,800
these quantities you know companies
 

497
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,269
these quantities you know companies
corporations can pollute them uh for

498
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
corporations can pollute them uh for
 

499
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,710
corporations can pollute them uh for
free

500
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
free
 

501
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,790
free
so in some sense

502
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800

 

503
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,070

i wish

504
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
i wish
 

505
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,910
i wish
or like and that's i guess purpose of

506
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
or like and that's i guess purpose of
 

507
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,389
or like and that's i guess purpose of
politics to

508
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:22,399
politics to
 

509
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,470
politics to
align the incentive systems and we are

510
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
align the incentive systems and we are
 

511
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,150
align the incentive systems and we are
kind of maybe even moving in this

512
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
kind of maybe even moving in this
 

513
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,990
kind of maybe even moving in this
direction the first issue is even to be

514
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
direction the first issue is even to be
 

515
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,550
direction the first issue is even to be
able to measure the things that we value

516
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
able to measure the things that we value
 

517
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,710
able to measure the things that we value
then we can actually assign the monetary

518
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:32,720
then we can actually assign the monetary
 

519
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,150
then we can actually assign the monetary
value to them

520
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
value to them
 

521
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,790
value to them
yeah and that's so it's getting the data

522
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
yeah and that's so it's getting the data
 

523
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,910
yeah and that's so it's getting the data
and also

524
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:37,920
and also
 

525
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,070
and also
probably through technology enabling

526
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,080
probably through technology enabling
 

527
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,990
probably through technology enabling
people to vote

528
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
people to vote
 

529
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,110
people to vote
and to

530
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,120
and to
 

531
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,670
and to
move money around in a way that is

532
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
move money around in a way that is
 

533
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,750
move money around in a way that is
aligned with their values and that's

534
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
aligned with their values and that's
 

535
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,190
aligned with their values and that's
very much a technology question so like

536
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
very much a technology question so like
 

537
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,670
very much a technology question so like
having one president

538
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:53,680
having one president
 

539
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,110
having one president
and congress

540
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
and congress
 

541
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,350
and congress
and voting that happens every four years

542
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
and voting that happens every four years
 

543
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,870
and voting that happens every four years
or something like that

544
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
or something like that
 

545
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,790
or something like that
that's a very outdated idea there could

546
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
that's a very outdated idea there could
 

547
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,550
that's a very outdated idea there could
be some technological improvements to

548
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
be some technological improvements to
 

549
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,389
be some technological improvements to
that kind of idea so

550
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
that kind of idea so
 

551
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,990
that kind of idea so
i'm thinking from time to time about

552
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,000
i'm thinking from time to time about
 

553
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,829
i'm thinking from time to time about
these topics but it also feels to me

554
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
these topics but it also feels to me
 

555
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,230
these topics but it also feels to me
that it's it's a little bit like a

556
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,240
that it's it's a little bit like a
 

557
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,750
that it's it's a little bit like a
it's hard for me to actually make

558
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
it's hard for me to actually make
 

559
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,110
it's hard for me to actually make
correct predictions what is the

560
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
correct predictions what is the
 

561
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,590
correct predictions what is the
appropriate thing to do i extremely

562
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,600
appropriate thing to do i extremely
 

563
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,269
appropriate thing to do i extremely

yeah
 

573
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,630
yeah
that's your life philosophy um

574
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
that's your life philosophy um
 

575
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,949
that's your life philosophy um
well like i think self-doubt

576
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
well like i think self-doubt
 

577
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,790
well like i think self-doubt
and uh

578
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
and uh
 

579
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,069
and uh
i think hippie implies optimism those

580
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
i think hippie implies optimism those
 

581
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,829
i think hippie implies optimism those
those two things are pretty pretty good

582
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:41,839
those two things are pretty pretty good
 

583
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,110
those two things are pretty pretty good
way to operate

584
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
way to operate
 

585
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,790
way to operate
i mean still it is

586
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
i mean still it is
 

587
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,110
i mean still it is
hard for me to actually

588
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
hard for me to actually
 

589
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,829
hard for me to actually
understand how the politics works or

590
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
understand how the politics works or
 

591
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,990
understand how the politics works or
like uh how this like

592
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,000
like uh how this like
 

593
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,790
like uh how this like
exactly how the things would play out

594
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
exactly how the things would play out
 

595
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,590
exactly how the things would play out
and sam is a really excellent with it

596
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
and sam is a really excellent with it
 

597
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,190
and sam is a really excellent with it
what do you think is rarest in the

598
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
what do you think is rarest in the
 

599
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,910
what do you think is rarest in the
universe you said we might be alone

600
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
universe you said we might be alone
 

601
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,750
universe you said we might be alone
what's hardest to build is another

602
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
what's hardest to build is another
 

603
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,829
what's hardest to build is another
engineering way to ask that

604
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
engineering way to ask that
 

605
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,790
engineering way to ask that
life

606
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
life
 

607
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,509
life
intelligence or consciousness so like

608
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
intelligence or consciousness so like
 

609
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,230
intelligence or consciousness so like
you said that we might be alone

610
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
you said that we might be alone
 

611
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,389
you said that we might be alone
which is the thing that's hardest to get

612
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
which is the thing that's hardest to get
 

613
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,110
which is the thing that's hardest to get
to

614
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
to
 

615
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,509
to
is it just the origin of life is it the

616
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
is it just the origin of life is it the
 

617
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,230
is it just the origin of life is it the
origin of intelligence is it the origin

618
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
origin of intelligence is it the origin
 

619
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,630
origin of intelligence is it the origin
of consciousness

620
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
of consciousness
 

621
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,670
of consciousness
so

622
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
so
 

623
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,230
so
um let me at first explain you my kind

624
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
um let me at first explain you my kind
 

625
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,069
um let me at first explain you my kind
of mental model what i think is needed

626
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
of mental model what i think is needed
 

627
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,230
of mental model what i think is needed
for life to appear

628
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
for life to appear
 

629
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,190
for life to appear
um

630
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
um
 

631
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,069
um
so

632
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
so
 

633
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,829
so
i imagine that at some point there was

634
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
i imagine that at some point there was
 

635
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,670
i imagine that at some point there was
this primordial

636
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
this primordial
 

637
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,350
this primordial
zoop of

638
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
zoop of
 

639
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,230
zoop of
amino acids and maybe some proteins in

640
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
amino acids and maybe some proteins in
 

641
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,269
amino acids and maybe some proteins in
the ocean

642
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
the ocean
 

643
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,670
the ocean
and you know some proteins were turning

644
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
and you know some proteins were turning
 

645
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,110
and you know some proteins were turning
into some other proteins through

646
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
into some other proteins through
 

647
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,230
into some other proteins through
reaction

648
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
reaction
 

649
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,430
reaction
and you can almost think about this

650
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
and you can almost think about this
 

651
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,230
and you can almost think about this
uh cycle of what turns into what as

652
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,240
uh cycle of what turns into what as
 

653
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,150
uh cycle of what turns into what as
there is a graph essentially describing

654
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
there is a graph essentially describing
 

655
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,230
there is a graph essentially describing
which substance turns into some other

656
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
which substance turns into some other
 

657
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,470
which substance turns into some other
substance and essentially life means

658
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
substance and essentially life means
 

659
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,470
substance and essentially life means
that all the sudden in the graph has

660
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
that all the sudden in the graph has
 

661
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,949
that all the sudden in the graph has
been created a cycle such that the same

662
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
been created a cycle such that the same
 

663
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,870
been created a cycle such that the same
thing keeps on happening over and over

664
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
thing keeps on happening over and over
 

665
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,790
thing keeps on happening over and over
again that's what is needed for life to

666
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:06,800
again that's what is needed for life to
 

667
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,310
again that's what is needed for life to
happen and in some sense you can think

668
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
happen and in some sense you can think
 

669
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,030
happen and in some sense you can think
almost that you have this gigantic graph

670
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
almost that you have this gigantic graph
 

671
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,350
almost that you have this gigantic graph
and it needs like a sufficient number of

672
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
and it needs like a sufficient number of
 

673
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,269
and it needs like a sufficient number of
edges for the cycle to appear

674
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
edges for the cycle to appear
 

675
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,910
edges for the cycle to appear
then um from perspective of intelligence

676
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:19,920
then um from perspective of intelligence
 

677
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,509
then um from perspective of intelligence
and consciousness

678
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:21,519
and consciousness
 

679
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,990
and consciousness
my current intuition is that they might

680
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
my current intuition is that they might
 

681
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,870
my current intuition is that they might
be

682
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:24,880
be
 

683
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,110
be
quite intertwined first of all it might

684
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
quite intertwined first of all it might
 

685
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,790
quite intertwined first of all it might
not be that it's like a binary thing

686
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
not be that it's like a binary thing
 

687
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,910
not be that it's like a binary thing
that you have intelligence or

688
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
that you have intelligence or
 

689
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,910
that you have intelligence or
consciousness it seems to be a

690
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
consciousness it seems to be a
 

691
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,870
consciousness it seems to be a
more a

692
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
more a

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,509
more a
continuous component let's see if we

00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
continuous component let's see if we
 

695
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,550
continuous component let's see if we
look for instance on the even networks

696
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,560
look for instance on the even networks
 

697
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,110
look for instance on the even networks
recognizing images and people are able

698
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
recognizing images and people are able
 

699
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,350
recognizing images and people are able
to show that the activations of these

700
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
to show that the activations of these
 

701
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,550
to show that the activations of these
networks correlate very strongly

702
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
networks correlate very strongly
 

703
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,430
networks correlate very strongly
with activations in visual cortex

704
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:51,440
with activations in visual cortex
 

705
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,829
with activations in visual cortex
of some monkeys the same seems to be

706
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
of some monkeys the same seems to be
 

707
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,550
of some monkeys the same seems to be
true about language models

708
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
true about language models
 

709
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,310
true about language models
also if you for instance

710
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
also if you for instance
 

711
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,430
also if you for instance
look

712
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:01,440
look
 

713
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,829
look
if you train agent in a 3d world

714
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
if you train agent in a 3d world
 

715
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,790
if you train agent in a 3d world
at first you know it it it it barely

716
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
at first you know it it it it barely
 

717
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,790
at first you know it it it it barely
recognizes what is going on over the

718
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
recognizes what is going on over the
 

719
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,870
recognizes what is going on over the
time it kind of recognizes foreground

720
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
time it kind of recognizes foreground
 

721
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,110
time it kind of recognizes foreground
from a background over the time it kind

722
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
from a background over the time it kind
 

723
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,110
from a background over the time it kind
of knows where there is a foot

724
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,120
of knows where there is a foot
 

725
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,430
of knows where there is a foot
and it just follows it

726
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
and it just follows it
 

727
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,430
and it just follows it
over the time it actually starts having

728
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
over the time it actually starts having
 

729
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,990
over the time it actually starts having
a 3d perception so it is possible for

730
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
a 3d perception so it is possible for
 

731
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,150
a 3d perception so it is possible for
instance to look inside of the head of

732
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
instance to look inside of the head of
 

733
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,470
instance to look inside of the head of
an agent and ask what would it see if it

734
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
an agent and ask what would it see if it
 

735
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,629
an agent and ask what would it see if it
looks to the right and the crazy thing

736
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
looks to the right and the crazy thing
 

737
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,870
looks to the right and the crazy thing
is you know initially when the agents

738
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
is you know initially when the agents
 

739
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,030
is you know initially when the agents
are very trained these predictions are

740
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
are very trained these predictions are
 

741
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,870
are very trained these predictions are
pretty bad over the time they they

742
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
pretty bad over the time they they
 

743
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,030
pretty bad over the time they they
become better and better you can still

744
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
become better and better you can still
 

745
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,150
become better and better you can still
see

746
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
see
 

747
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,790
see
that if you ask what happens when the

748
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
that if you ask what happens when the
 

749
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,509
that if you ask what happens when the
head is turned by 360 degrees for some

750
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
head is turned by 360 degrees for some
 

751
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,590
head is turned by 360 degrees for some
time they think that the different thing

752
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
time they think that the different thing
 

753
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,910
time they think that the different thing
appears and then at some stage they

754
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
appears and then at some stage they
 

755
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,350
appears and then at some stage they
understand actually that the same

756
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
understand actually that the same
 

757
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,189
understand actually that the same
thing's supposed to appear so they get

758
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
thing's supposed to appear so they get
 

759
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,670
thing's supposed to appear so they get
like a understanding of 3d structure

760
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:55,680
like a understanding of 3d structure
 

761
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,829
like a understanding of 3d structure
it's also you know very likely that they

762
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
it's also you know very likely that they
 

763
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,829
it's also you know very likely that they
have inside some

764
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
have inside some
 

765
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,790
have inside some
level of and of like a symbolic

766
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
level of and of like a symbolic
 

767
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,870
level of and of like a symbolic
reasoning like they're particularly

768
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
reasoning like they're particularly
 

769
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,590
reasoning like they're particularly
symbols for other agents so when you

770
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
symbols for other agents so when you
 

771
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,790
symbols for other agents so when you
look at dota agents they collaborate

772
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800
look at dota agents they collaborate
 

773
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,030
look at dota agents they collaborate
together and uh

774
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,040
together and uh
 

775
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,750
together and uh
and

776
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
and
 

777
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,430
and
now they they they have some

778
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:15,440
now they they they have some
 

779
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,069
now they they they have some
anticipation of uh if if they would win

780
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
anticipation of uh if if they would win
 

781
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,389
anticipation of uh if if they would win
battle they have some some expectations

782
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
battle they have some some expectations
 

783
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,790
battle they have some some expectations
with respect to other agents i might be

784
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
with respect to other agents i might be
 

785
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,949
with respect to other agents i might be
you know too much anthropomorphizing

786
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:24,959
you know too much anthropomorphizing
 

787
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,590
you know too much anthropomorphizing
um the the how the things look

788
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:27,600
um the the how the things look
 

789
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,550
um the the how the things look
look for me but then the fact that they

790
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
look for me but then the fact that they
 

791
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,350
look for me but then the fact that they
have a symbol for other agents

792
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:33,360
have a symbol for other agents
 

793
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,350
have a symbol for other agents
and makes me believe that

794
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
and makes me believe that
 

795
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,389
and makes me believe that
at some stage as the uh you know as they

796
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
at some stage as the uh you know as they
 

797
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,310
at some stage as the uh you know as they
are optimizing for skills they would

798
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
are optimizing for skills they would
 

799
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,829
are optimizing for skills they would
have also symbol to describe

800
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
have also symbol to describe
 

801
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,269
have also symbol to describe
themselves this is like a very useful

802
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
themselves this is like a very useful
 

803
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,590
themselves this is like a very useful
symbol to have and this particularity i

804
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
symbol to have and this particularity i
 

805
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,670
symbol to have and this particularity i
would call it like a self-consciousness

806
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
would call it like a self-consciousness
 

807
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,990
would call it like a self-consciousness
or self-awareness

808
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
or self-awareness
 

809
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,389
or self-awareness
and still it might be different from the

810
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:54,399
and still it might be different from the
 

811
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,430
and still it might be different from the
consciousness so i guess the the way how

812
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
consciousness so i guess the the way how
 

813
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,069
consciousness so i guess the the way how
i'm understanding the word consciousness

814
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
i'm understanding the word consciousness
 

815
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,910
i'm understanding the word consciousness
let's say the experience of drinking a

816
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
let's say the experience of drinking a
 

817
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,590
let's say the experience of drinking a
coffee or let's say experience of being

818
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
coffee or let's say experience of being
 

819
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,030
coffee or let's say experience of being
a butt

820
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
a butt
 

821
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,150
a butt
that's the meaning of the word

822
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
that's the meaning of the word
 

823
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,430
that's the meaning of the word
consciousness it doesn't mean to be

824
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
consciousness it doesn't mean to be
 

825
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,750
consciousness it doesn't mean to be
awake

826
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
awake
 

827
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,110
awake
yeah it feels

828
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
yeah it feels
 

829
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,269
yeah it feels
it might be also somewhat related to

830
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
it might be also somewhat related to
 

831
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,710
it might be also somewhat related to
memory and recurrent connections so um

832
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,720
memory and recurrent connections so um
 

833
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,310
memory and recurrent connections so um
it's kind of okay if you look at

834
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
it's kind of okay if you look at
 

835
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,750
it's kind of okay if you look at
anesthetic drugs they might be

836
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
anesthetic drugs they might be
 

837
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,870
anesthetic drugs they might be
uh like they essentially

838
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
uh like they essentially
 

839
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,030
uh like they essentially
they disturb

840
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
they disturb
 

841
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,870
they disturb
brain waste

842
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
brain waste
 

843
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,070
brain waste
such that

844
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:30,080
such that
 

845
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,509
such that
[Music]

846
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
[Music]
 

847
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,990
[Music]
maybe memory is not not formed

848
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,000
maybe memory is not not formed
 

849
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,310
maybe memory is not not formed
so there's a lessening of consciousness

850
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
so there's a lessening of consciousness
 

851
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,389
so there's a lessening of consciousness
when you do that correct and so that's

852
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
when you do that correct and so that's
 

853
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,110
when you do that correct and so that's
one way to intuit what is consciousness

854
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
one way to intuit what is consciousness
 

855
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,069
one way to intuit what is consciousness
there's also kind of another

856
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
there's also kind of another
 

857
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,110
there's also kind of another
element here it could be that it's

858
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
element here it could be that it's
 

859
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,430
element here it could be that it's
you know this kind of self-awareness

860
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
you know this kind of self-awareness
 

861
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,230
you know this kind of self-awareness
module that you described

862
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
module that you described
 

863
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,509
module that you described
plus the actual subjective experience

864
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
plus the actual subjective experience
 

865
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,790
plus the actual subjective experience
is a storytelling module

866
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
is a storytelling module
 

867
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,110
is a storytelling module
that tells us a story about uh

868
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
that tells us a story about uh
 

869
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,189
that tells us a story about uh
what we're experiencing

870
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
what we're experiencing
 

871
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,150
what we're experiencing
the

872
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
the
 

873
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,910
the
crazy thing so let's say i mean in

874
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
crazy thing so let's say i mean in
 

875
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,310
crazy thing so let's say i mean in
meditation they teach people

876
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,320
meditation they teach people
 

877
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,710
meditation they teach people
not to speak story inside of the head

878
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
not to speak story inside of the head
 

879
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,230
not to speak story inside of the head
and there is also some fraction of

880
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
and there is also some fraction of
 

881
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,430
and there is also some fraction of
population

882
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
population
 

883
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,069
population
who doesn't have actually narrator i

884
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
who doesn't have actually narrator i
 

885
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,150
who doesn't have actually narrator i
know people who don't have a right

886
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
know people who don't have a right
 

887
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,550
know people who don't have a right
narrator and you know they have to use

888
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
narrator and you know they have to use
 

889
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,670
narrator and you know they have to use
external people in order to

890
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
external people in order to
 

891
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,790
external people in order to
kind of

892
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
kind of
 

893
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,269
kind of
solve tasks that require internal

894
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
solve tasks that require internal
 

895
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,710
solve tasks that require internal
narrator

896
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720
narrator
 

897
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,430
narrator
so

898
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
so
 

899
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,350
so
it seems that it's possible to have the

900
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
it seems that it's possible to have the
 

901
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,430
it seems that it's possible to have the
experience without the talk

902
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
experience without the talk
 

903
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,189
experience without the talk
what are we talking about when we talk

904
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
what are we talking about when we talk
 

905
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,350
what are we talking about when we talk
about the internal narrator is that the

906
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360
about the internal narrator is that the
 

907
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,790
about the internal narrator is that the
voice when you're like yeah i thought

908
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:42,800
voice when you're like yeah i thought
 

909
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,389
voice when you're like yeah i thought
that that that's what you are referring

910
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
that that that's what you are referring
 

911
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,990
that that that's what you are referring
to well i was referring more on the like

912
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
to well i was referring more on the like
 

913
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,949
to well i was referring more on the like
not an actual voice

914
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
not an actual voice
 

915
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,470
not an actual voice
i meant like

916
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
i meant like
 

917
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,470
i meant like
there's some kind of

918
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
there's some kind of
 

919
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,949
there's some kind of
like subjective experience

920
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
like subjective experience
 

921
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,310
like subjective experience
feels like it's

922
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,320

 

923
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,030

it's fundamentally about storytelling to

924
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
it's fundamentally about storytelling to
 

925
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,390
it's fundamentally about storytelling to
ourselves

926
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:04,400
ourselves
 

927
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,270
ourselves
it feels like

928
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
it feels like
 

929
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,990
it feels like
like the feeling is a story

930
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
like the feeling is a story
 

931
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,350
like the feeling is a story
that is much

932
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360

 

933
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,590

much simpler abstraction than the raw

934
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
much simpler abstraction than the raw
 

935
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,270
much simpler abstraction than the raw
sensory information

936
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
sensory information
 

937
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,510
sensory information
so it feels like it's a very high level

938
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
so it feels like it's a very high level
 

939
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,949
so it feels like it's a very high level
abstraction

940
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
abstraction
 

941
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,230
abstraction
that

942
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
that
 

943
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,909
that
is useful

944
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
is useful
 

945
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,590
is useful
for me to feel like

946
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
for me to feel like
 

947
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,750
for me to feel like
entity in this world

948
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
entity in this world
 

949
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,870
entity in this world
most

950
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
most
 

951
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,470
most
useful aspect of it is that

952
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
useful aspect of it is that
 

953
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,110
useful aspect of it is that
because i'm conscious

954
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
because i'm conscious
 

955
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,870
because i'm conscious
i think there's an intricate connection

956
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
i think there's an intricate connection
 

957
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,230
i think there's an intricate connection
to me not one

958
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:38,240
to me not one
 

959
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,630
to me not one
wanting to die

960
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
wanting to die
 

961
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,590
wanting to die
so like

962
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
so like
 

963
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,390
so like
it's a useful hack to really

964
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
it's a useful hack to really
 

965
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,950
it's a useful hack to really
prioritize not dying

966
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
prioritize not dying
 

967
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,789
prioritize not dying
like those seem to be somehow connected

968
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
like those seem to be somehow connected
 

969
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,270
like those seem to be somehow connected
so i'm telling the story of like it's

970
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
so i'm telling the story of like it's
 

971
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,990
so i'm telling the story of like it's
richly feels like something to be me and

972
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
richly feels like something to be me and
 

973
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,390
richly feels like something to be me and
the fact that me exists in this world i

974
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
the fact that me exists in this world i
 

975
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,990
the fact that me exists in this world i
want to preserve me

976
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,000
want to preserve me
 

977
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,549
want to preserve me
and so that makes it a useful agent hack

978
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
and so that makes it a useful agent hack
 

979
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,350
and so that makes it a useful agent hack
so i will just refer maybe to the first

980
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
so i will just refer maybe to the first
 

981
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,830
so i will just refer maybe to the first
part as you said about the kind of story

982
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
part as you said about the kind of story
 

983
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,190
part as you said about the kind of story
of describing who you are

984
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,200

 

985
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,029

i was

986
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
i was
 

987
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,110
i was
thinking about that even so you know

988
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
thinking about that even so you know
 

989
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,350
thinking about that even so you know
obviously i'm i'm i

990
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
obviously i'm i'm i
 

991
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,830
obviously i'm i'm i
like thinking about consciousness uh i

992
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
like thinking about consciousness uh i
 

993
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,750
like thinking about consciousness uh i
like thinking about the ai as well and

994
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
like thinking about the ai as well and
 

995
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,830
like thinking about the ai as well and
i'm trying to see analogies of these

996
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
i'm trying to see analogies of these
 

997
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,549
i'm trying to see analogies of these
things in ai what would it correspond to

998
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
things in ai what would it correspond to
 

999
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,470
things in ai what would it correspond to
so um

1000
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480

 

1001
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,950

and one way to control gpd
 

1017
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,190
and one way to control gpd
is uh by putting into prefix at the

1018
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:49,200
is uh by putting into prefix at the
 

1019
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,350
is uh by putting into prefix at the
beginning of the text some information

1020
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
beginning of the text some information
 

1021
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,669
beginning of the text some information
what would be the story about

1022
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
what would be the story about
 

1023
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,789
what would be the story about
you can have even chat with uh

1024
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:56,799
you can have even chat with uh
 

1025
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,029
you can have even chat with uh
you know with gpt by saying that the

1026
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
you know with gpt by saying that the
 

1027
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,750
you know with gpt by saying that the
chat is with lex or elon musk or so

1028
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:01,760
chat is with lex or elon musk or so
 

1029
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,230
chat is with lex or elon musk or so
and gpt would just

1030
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
and gpt would just
 

1031
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,270
and gpt would just
pretend to be you or elon musk or so

1032
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
pretend to be you or elon musk or so
 

1033
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,110
pretend to be you or elon musk or so
and

1034
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
and
 

1035
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,669
and
it almost feels that this uh

1036
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
it almost feels that this uh
 

1037
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,630
it almost feels that this uh
story that we give ourselves to describe

1038
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
story that we give ourselves to describe
 

1039
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,789
story that we give ourselves to describe
our life it's almost like a

things that you put into context of gpt

1042
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
things that you put into context of gpt
 

1043
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,590
things that you put into context of gpt
yeah the primary it's the and but the

1044
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
yeah the primary it's the and but the
 

1045
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,549
yeah the primary it's the and but the
the context we provide to gpt

1046
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
the context we provide to gpt
 

1047
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,750
the context we provide to gpt
is uh

1048
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:25,760
is uh
 

1049
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,630
is uh
is multimodal it's so gpt itself is

1050
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
is multimodal it's so gpt itself is
 

1051
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,750
is multimodal it's so gpt itself is
multimodal gpt itself uh hasn't learned

1052
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:31,760
multimodal gpt itself uh hasn't learned
 

1053
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,830
multimodal gpt itself uh hasn't learned
actually from experience of single human

1054
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
actually from experience of single human
 

1055
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,230
actually from experience of single human
but from the experience of humanity it's

1056
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
but from the experience of humanity it's
 

1057
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,150
but from the experience of humanity it's
a chameleon you can turn it into

1058
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
a chameleon you can turn it into
 

1059
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,029
a chameleon you can turn it into
anything and in some sense by providing

1060
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
anything and in some sense by providing
 

1061
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,110
anything and in some sense by providing
context uh

1062
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
context uh
 

1063
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,390
context uh
it you know

1064
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:44,400
it you know
 

1065
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,230
it you know
behaves as the thing that you wanted it

1066
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
behaves as the thing that you wanted it
 

1067
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,350
behaves as the thing that you wanted it
to be and it's interesting that the

1068
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:49,360
to be and it's interesting that the
 

1069
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,110
to be and it's interesting that the
you know people have a stories of who

1070
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
you know people have a stories of who
 

1071
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,150
you know people have a stories of who
they are and as i said these stories

1072
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
they are and as i said these stories
 

1073
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,190
they are and as i said these stories
they help them to operate in the world

1074
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,200
they help them to operate in the world
 

1075
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,990
they help them to operate in the world
but it's also you know interesting

1076
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
but it's also you know interesting
 

1077
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,750
but it's also you know interesting
i guess various people find it out

1078
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
i guess various people find it out
 

1079
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,470
i guess various people find it out
through meditation or so that

1080
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
through meditation or so that
 

1081
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,070
through meditation or so that
there might be some patterns that you

1082
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,080
there might be some patterns that you
 

1083
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,350
there might be some patterns that you
have learned

1084
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
have learned
 

1085
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,870
have learned
when you were a kid that actually are

1086
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
when you were a kid that actually are
 

1087
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,710
when you were a kid that actually are
not serving you anymore

1088
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
not serving you anymore
 

1089
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,110
not serving you anymore
and you also might be thinking that

1090
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,120
and you also might be thinking that
 

1091
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,710
and you also might be thinking that
that's who you are and that's actually

1092
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
that's who you are and that's actually
 

1093
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,270
that's who you are and that's actually
just the story

1094
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
just the story
 

1095
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,110
just the story
yeah so it's a useful hack but sometimes

1096
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
yeah so it's a useful hack but sometimes
 

1097
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,950
yeah so it's a useful hack but sometimes
it gets us into trouble it's a local

1098
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:20,960
it gets us into trouble it's a local
 

1099
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,029
it gets us into trouble it's a local

i wonder what breathes fire into

1114
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
i wonder what breathes fire into
 

1115
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,149
i wonder what breathes fire into
computation what makes given computation

1116
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
computation what makes given computation
 

1117
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,430
computation what makes given computation
conscious

1118
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
conscious
 

1119
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,190
conscious
okay so how do we engineer consciousness

1120
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
okay so how do we engineer consciousness
 

1121
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,190
okay so how do we engineer consciousness
how do you breathe fire

1122
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:49,200
how do you breathe fire
 

1123
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,830
how do you breathe fire
and magic into the machine

1124
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
and magic into the machine
 

1125
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,950
and magic into the machine
so

1126
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
so
 

1127
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,909
so
it seems clear to me that not every

1128
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:55,919
it seems clear to me that not every
 

1129
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,230
it seems clear to me that not every
computation is conscious i mean you can

1130
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
computation is conscious i mean you can
 

1131
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,549
computation is conscious i mean you can
let's say just keep on multiplying one

1132
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
let's say just keep on multiplying one
 

1133
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,870
let's say just keep on multiplying one
matrix over and over again and my

1134
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
matrix over and over again and my
 

1135
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,710
matrix over and over again and my
gigantic matrix you can put a lot of

1136
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
gigantic matrix you can put a lot of
 

1137
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,390
gigantic matrix you can put a lot of
computation i don't think it would be

1138
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:06,400
computation i don't think it would be
 

1139
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,390
computation i don't think it would be
conscious so in some sense the question

1140
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:08,400
conscious so in some sense the question
 

1141
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,590
conscious so in some sense the question
is

1142
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
is
 

1143
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,950
is
what are the computations which could be

1144
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
what are the computations which could be
 

1145
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,070
what are the computations which could be
conscious

1146
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
conscious
 

1147
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,029
conscious
uh i mean so one assumption is

1148
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:17,039
uh i mean so one assumption is
 

1149
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,390
uh i mean so one assumption is
that it has to do purely with

1150
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
that it has to do purely with
 

1151
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,990
that it has to do purely with
computation that you can abstract away

1152
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
computation that you can abstract away
 

1153
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,710
computation that you can abstract away
matter and other possibilities that it's

1154
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
matter and other possibilities that it's
 

1155
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,310
matter and other possibilities that it's
very important was the realization of

1156
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,320
very important was the realization of
 

1157
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,549
very important was the realization of
computation that it has to do with some

1158
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
computation that it has to do with some
 

1159
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,590
computation that it has to do with some
uh uh force fields or so and they bring

1160
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:29,600
uh uh force fields or so and they bring
 

1161
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,669
uh uh force fields or so and they bring
consciousness at the moment my intuition

1162
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:31,679
consciousness at the moment my intuition
 

1163
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,270
consciousness at the moment my intuition
is that it can be fully abstracted that

1164
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
is that it can be fully abstracted that
 

1165
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,510
is that it can be fully abstracted that
way so in case of computation you can

1166
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
way so in case of computation you can
 

1167
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,510
way so in case of computation you can
ask yourself what are the

1168
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
ask yourself what are the
 

1169
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,310
ask yourself what are the
mathematical objects or so that could

1170
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
mathematical objects or so that could
 

1171
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,230
mathematical objects or so that could
bring such a properties so for instance

1172
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
bring such a properties so for instance
 

1173
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,830
bring such a properties so for instance
if we think about the

1174
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:45,840
if we think about the
 

1175
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,990
if we think about the
models uh ai models then what they truly

1176
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,000
models uh ai models then what they truly
 

1177
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,430
models uh ai models then what they truly
try to do

1178
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440
try to do
 

1179
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,549
try to do
or like models like gpt is uh

1180
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559

 

1181
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,149

you know they try to predict a next word

1182
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:00,159
you know they try to predict a next word
 

1183
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,990
you know they try to predict a next word
or so and this turns out to be

1184
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
or so and this turns out to be
 

1185
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,390
or so and this turns out to be
equivalent to

1186
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
equivalent to
 

1187
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,830
equivalent to
compressing

1188
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
compressing
 

1189
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,190
compressing

and because in some sense compression

1192
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:09,760
and because in some sense compression
 

1193
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,190
and because in some sense compression
means that

1194
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,200
means that
 

1195
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,950
means that
you learn the model of reality and you

1196
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:12,960
you learn the model of reality and you
 

1197
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,110
you learn the model of reality and you
have just to uh

1198
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
have just to uh
 

1199
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,029
have just to uh
remember where are your mistakes the

1200
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:17,039
remember where are your mistakes the
 

1201
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,190
remember where are your mistakes the
better you are in predicting the

1202
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
better you are in predicting the
 

1203
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,070
better you are in predicting the
and

1204
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,080
and
 

1205
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,830
and
and in some sense when we look at our

1206
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:21,840
and in some sense when we look at our
 

1207
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,430
and in some sense when we look at our
experience also when you look for

1208
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:23,440
experience also when you look for
 

1209
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,110
experience also when you look for
instance the car driving you know in

1210
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
instance the car driving you know in
 

1211
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,710
instance the car driving you know in
which direction it will go you are good

1212
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
which direction it will go you are good
 

1213
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,750
which direction it will go you are good
like a in prediction and um

1214
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:29,760
like a in prediction and um
 

1215
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,270
like a in prediction and um
you know it might be the case that the

1216
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,280
you know it might be the case that the
 

1217
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,630
you know it might be the case that the
consciousness

1218
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:32,640
consciousness
 

1219
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,190
consciousness
is intertwined with compression it might

1220
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,200
is intertwined with compression it might
 

1221
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,029
is intertwined with compression it might
be also the case that self-consciousness

1222
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
be also the case that self-consciousness
 

1223
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,710
be also the case that self-consciousness
has to do with compressor trying to

1224
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
has to do with compressor trying to
 

1225
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,630
has to do with compressor trying to
compress itself so

1226
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
compress itself so
 

1227
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,510
compress itself so
um

1228
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:43,520
um
 

1229
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,590
um
okay i was just wondering what are the

1230
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,600
okay i was just wondering what are the
 

1231
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,149
okay i was just wondering what are the
objects in you know mathematics or

1232
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:48,159
objects in you know mathematics or
 

1233
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,630
objects in you know mathematics or
computer science which are mysterious

1234
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
computer science which are mysterious
 

1235
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,350
computer science which are mysterious
that could uh that that could have to do

1236
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:53,360
that could uh that that could have to do
 

1237
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,870
that could uh that that could have to do
with consciousness and then i thought um

1238
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:56,880
with consciousness and then i thought um
 

1239
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,830
with consciousness and then i thought um
you know you you see in uh mathematics

1240
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
you know you you see in uh mathematics
 

1241
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,230
you know you you see in uh mathematics
there is something called cadal theorem

1242
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
there is something called cadal theorem
 

1243
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,230
there is something called cadal theorem
which means okay you have if you have

1244
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
which means okay you have if you have
 

1245
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,630
which means okay you have if you have
sufficiently complicated mathematical

1246
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
sufficiently complicated mathematical
 

1247
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,950
sufficiently complicated mathematical
system it is possible to point the

1248
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:08,960
system it is possible to point the
 

1249
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,430
system it is possible to point the
mathematical system back on itself in

1250
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:11,440
mathematical system back on itself in
 

1251
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,510
mathematical system back on itself in
computer sense there is uh something

1252
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:13,520
computer sense there is uh something
 

1253
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,669
computer sense there is uh something
called helping problem it's it's

1254
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
called helping problem it's it's
 

1255
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,909
called helping problem it's it's
somewhat similar construction so i

1256
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:17,919
somewhat similar construction so i
 

1257
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,630
somewhat similar construction so i
thought that you know if we believe that

1258
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:20,640
thought that you know if we believe that
 

1259
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,110
thought that you know if we believe that
that the that

1260
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120
that the that
 

1261
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,710
that the that
under assumption that consciousness has

1262
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
under assumption that consciousness has
 

1263
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,190
under assumption that consciousness has
to do with uh with compression

1264
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
to do with uh with compression
 

1265
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,470
to do with uh with compression
uh

1266
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:28,480
uh
 

1267
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,590
uh
then you could imagine that the the as

1268
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
then you could imagine that the the as
 

1269
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,590
then you could imagine that the the as
you keep on compressing things then at

1270
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
you keep on compressing things then at
 

1271
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,510
you keep on compressing things then at
some point it actually makes sense

1272
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
some point it actually makes sense
 

1273
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,430
some point it actually makes sense
for the compressor to compress itself

1274
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:37,440
for the compressor to compress itself
 

1275
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,909
for the compressor to compress itself
metacompression yeah consciousness is

1276
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
metacompression yeah consciousness is
 

1277
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,430
metacompression yeah consciousness is
metacompression

1278
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
metacompression
 

1279
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,029
metacompression
that's uh that's and i and an idea

1280
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
that's uh that's and i and an idea
 

1281
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,789
that's uh that's and i and an idea
and in some sense you know the creation

1282
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:46,799
and in some sense you know the creation
 

1283
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,590
and in some sense you know the creation
of it

1284
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
of it
 

1285
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,669
of it
thank you so uh

1286
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:49,679
thank you so uh
 

1287
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,430
thank you so uh
but do you think if we think of a

1288
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
but do you think if we think of a
 

1289
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,269
but do you think if we think of a
touring machine a universal touring

1290
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
touring machine a universal touring
 

1291
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,230
touring machine a universal touring
machine

1292
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
machine
 

1293
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,750
machine
can that achieve

1294
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760
can that achieve
 

1295
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,190
can that achieve
consciousness

1296
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
consciousness
 

1297
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,950
consciousness
so is there some

1298
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
so is there some
 

1299
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,510
so is there some
thing beyond our traditional definition

1300
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
thing beyond our traditional definition
 

1301
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,310
thing beyond our traditional definition
of computation that's required so it's a

1302
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:04,320
of computation that's required so it's a
 

1303
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,830
of computation that's required so it's a
specific computation and i said this

1304
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:05,840
specific computation and i said this
 

1305
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,470
specific computation and i said this
computation has to do with compression

1306
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,480
computation has to do with compression
 

1307
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,590
computation has to do with compression
and

1308
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
and
 

1309
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,669
and
the compression itself maybe other way

1310
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
the compression itself maybe other way
 

1311
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,990
the compression itself maybe other way
of putting it is like you are internally

1312
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
of putting it is like you are internally
 

1313
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,149
of putting it is like you are internally
creating the model of reality

1314
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:16,159
creating the model of reality
 

1315
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,310
creating the model of reality
in order like a it's like a you try

1316
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:18,320
in order like a it's like a you try
 

1317
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,470
in order like a it's like a you try
inside to simplify reality in order to

1318
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
inside to simplify reality in order to
 

1319
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,390
inside to simplify reality in order to
predict what's going to happen

1320
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:22,400
predict what's going to happen
 

1321
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,190
predict what's going to happen
and

1322
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,200
and
 

1323
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,590
and
that also feels somewhat similar to how

1324
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
that also feels somewhat similar to how
 

1325
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,830
that also feels somewhat similar to how
i think actually about my own conscious

1326
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
i think actually about my own conscious
 

1327
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,669
i think actually about my own conscious
experience so clearly i don't have

1328
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:29,679

crazy that you know the brain itself is
 

1493
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,789
crazy that you know the brain itself is
actually so small and it can ponder

1494
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:38,799

 

1495
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,190

how to design algorithms that optimally

1496
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:41,200
how to design algorithms that optimally
 

1497
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,669
how to design algorithms that optimally
solve the problem of intelligence okay

1498
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
solve the problem of intelligence okay
 

1499
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,750
solve the problem of intelligence okay
all right so what's the algorithm so

1500
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:45,760
all right so what's the algorithm so
 

1501
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,990
all right so what's the algorithm so
let's see so first of all the task

1502
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
let's see so first of all the task
 

1503
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,110
let's see so first of all the task
itself is

1504
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,120
itself is
 

1505
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,789
itself is
described as

1506
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
described as
 

1507
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,870
described as
you have infinite sequence of zeros and

1508
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880
you have infinite sequence of zeros and
 

1509
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,750
you have infinite sequence of zeros and
ones

1510
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:53,760
ones
 

1511
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,110
ones
okay you read n bits and you are about

1512
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,120
okay you read n bits and you are about
 

1513
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,029
okay you read n bits and you are about
to predict n plus one bit

1514
00:27:59,029 --> 00:27:59,039
to predict n plus one bit
 

1515
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,950
to predict n plus one bit
so that's the task and you could imagine

1516
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
so that's the task and you could imagine
 

1517
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,590
so that's the task and you could imagine
that every task could be casted as such

1518
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
that every task could be casted as such
 

1519
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,149
that every task could be casted as such
a task so if for instance you have

1520
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:06,159
a task so if for instance you have
 

1521
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,149
a task so if for instance you have
images and labels you can just turn

1522
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
images and labels you can just turn
 

1523
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,990
images and labels you can just turn
every image into sequence of zeros and

1524
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,000
every image into sequence of zeros and
 

1525
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,710
every image into sequence of zeros and
ones then label you concatenate labels

1526
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:12,720
ones then label you concatenate labels
 

1527
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,269
ones then label you concatenate labels
and you and that that's actually the the

1528
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:15,279
and you and that that's actually the the
 

1529
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,950
and you and that that's actually the the
and you could you could start by having

1530
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
and you could you could start by having
 

1531
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,430
and you could you could start by having
training data first and then afterwards

1532
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:19,440
training data first and then afterwards
 

1533
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,110
training data first and then afterwards
you have test data

1534
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,120
you have test data
 

1535
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,510
you have test data
so theoretically any problem could be

1536
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:23,520
so theoretically any problem could be
 

1537
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,389
so theoretically any problem could be
casted as a problem of predicting zeros

1538
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:26,399
casted as a problem of predicting zeros
 

1539
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,269
casted as a problem of predicting zeros
and ones on this infinite type so um

1540
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
and ones on this infinite type so um
 

1541
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,389
and ones on this infinite type so um
so let's say you read already n bits and

1542
00:28:34,389 --> 00:28:34,399
so let's say you read already n bits and
 

1543
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,950
so let's say you read already n bits and
you want to predict n plus one bit

1544
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
you want to predict n plus one bit
 

1545
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,149
you want to predict n plus one bit
and i will ask you to write

1546
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
and i will ask you to write
 

1547
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,710
and i will ask you to write
every possible program that generates

1548
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
every possible program that generates
 

1549
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,510
every possible program that generates
these end bits okay so

1550
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,520
these end bits okay so
 

1551
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,669
these end bits okay so
and you can have you you choose

1552
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
and you can have you you choose
 

1553
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,430
and you can have you you choose
programming language it can be in python

1554
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:49,440
programming language it can be in python
 

1555
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,549
programming language it can be in python
or c

1556
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:50,559
or c
 

1557
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,070
or c
and the difference between programming

1558
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,080
and the difference between programming
 

1559
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,350
and the difference between programming
languages

1560
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,360
languages
 

1561
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,950
languages
might be there is a difference by

1562
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
might be there is a difference by
 

1563
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,990
might be there is a difference by
constant

1564
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
constant
 

1565
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,070
constant
asymptotically your predictions will be

1566
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,080
asymptotically your predictions will be
 

1567
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,990
asymptotically your predictions will be
equivalent

1568
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
equivalent
 

1569
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,950
equivalent
so you you read and beats you enumerate

1570
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:02,960
so you you read and beats you enumerate
 

1571
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,510
so you you read and beats you enumerate
all the programs that produce these and

1572
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,520
all the programs that produce these and
 

1573
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,510
all the programs that produce these and
end bits in their output

1574
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:07,520
end bits in their output
 

1575
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,909
end bits in their output
and then in order to predict n plus one

1576
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919
and then in order to predict n plus one
 

1577
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,710
and then in order to predict n plus one
bit you actually weight

1578
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
bit you actually weight
 

1579
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,310
bit you actually weight
the programs according to their length

1580
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
the programs according to their length
 

1581
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,470
the programs according to their length
and there is like some specific formula

1582
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
and there is like some specific formula
 

1583
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,990
and there is like some specific formula
how you weight them and then the n plus

1584
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,000
how you weight them and then the n plus
 

1585
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,950
how you weight them and then the n plus
one bit prediction is the prediction uh

1586
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
one bit prediction is the prediction uh
 

1587
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,950
one bit prediction is the prediction uh
from each of this program according to

1588
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
from each of this program according to
 

1589
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,470
from each of this program according to
that weight

1590
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,480
that weight
 

1591
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,630
that weight
like statistically you statistically

1592
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
like statistically you statistically
 

1593
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,789
like statistically you statistically
pick so the smaller the program the more

1594
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:32,799
pick so the smaller the program the more
 

1595
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,510
pick so the smaller the program the more
likely you you are to pick the its

1596
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,520
likely you you are to pick the its
 

1597
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,870
likely you you are to pick the its
output

1598
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
output
 

1599
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,870
output
so uh that's that algorithm is grounded

1600
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
so uh that's that algorithm is grounded
 

1601
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,549
so uh that's that algorithm is grounded
in the hope

1602
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:42,559
in the hope
 

1603
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,630
in the hope
or the intuition that the simple answer

1604
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:44,640
or the intuition that the simple answer
 

1605
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,269
or the intuition that the simple answer
is the right one it's a formalization of

1606
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
is the right one it's a formalization of
 

1607
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,750
is the right one it's a formalization of
it yeah um it also

1608
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
it yeah um it also
 

1609
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,750
it yeah um it also
means like if you would ask the question

1610
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
means like if you would ask the question
 

1611
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,789
means like if you would ask the question
after

1612
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:52,799
after
 

1613
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,389
after
how many years

1614
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
how many years
 

1615
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,750
how many years
would you know

1616
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:55,760
would you know
 

1617
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,070
would you know
sun explode

1618
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,080
sun explode
 

1619
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,190
sun explode
you can say

1620
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
you can say
 

1621
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,110
you can say
it's more likely the answer is

1622
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
it's more likely the answer is
 

1623
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,029
it's more likely the answer is
to some power because it's a shorter

1624
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
to some power because it's a shorter
 

1625
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,990
to some power because it's a shorter
program

1626
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
program
 

1627
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,789
program
yeah

1628
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:04,799
yeah
 

1629
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,470
yeah
and then other

1630
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:06,480
and then other
 

1631
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,430
and then other
well i don't have a good intuition about

1632
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
well i don't have a good intuition about
 

1633
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,029
well i don't have a good intuition about
how different the space of short

1634
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:11,039
how different the space of short
 

1635
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,510
how different the space of short
programs are from the space of large

1636
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
programs are from the space of large
 

1637
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,630
programs are from the space of large
programs

1638
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,640
programs
 

1639
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,669
programs
like

1640
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:15,679
like
 

1641
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,269
like
what is the universe where short

1642
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
what is the universe where short
 

1643
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,710
what is the universe where short
programs

1644
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
programs
 

1645
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,430
programs
uh like run things

1646
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:21,440
uh like run things
 

1647
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,990
uh like run things
uh so as i said the things have to agree

1648
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
uh so as i said the things have to agree
 

1649
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,549
uh so as i said the things have to agree
with end beats so even if you have

1650
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:26,559
with end beats so even if you have
 

1651
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,870
with end beats so even if you have
you you need to start okay if if you

1652
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
you you need to start okay if if you
 

1653
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,710
you you need to start okay if if you
have very short program and they're like

1654
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:30,720
have very short program and they're like
 

1655
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,269
have very short program and they're like
uh still some as if it's not perfect

1656
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
uh still some as if it's not perfect
 

1657
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,870
uh still some as if it's not perfect
with prediction of n bits you have to

1658
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,880
with prediction of n bits you have to
 

1659
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,190
with prediction of n bits you have to
start errors what are the errors and

1660
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
start errors what are the errors and
 

1661
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,789
start errors what are the errors and
that gives you the full program that

1662
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:38,799
that gives you the full program that
 

1663
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,870
that gives you the full program that
agrees on end beats

1664
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:40,880
agrees on end beats
 

1665
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,029
agrees on end beats
oh so you don't agree perfectly with the

1666
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
oh so you don't agree perfectly with the
 

1667
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,710
oh so you don't agree perfectly with the
end bits and you store

1668
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:44,720
end bits and you store
 

1669
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,470
end bits and you store
that's like a longer a longer program

1670
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480
that's like a longer a longer program
 

1671
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,230
that's like a longer a longer program
slightly longer program

1672
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:48,240
slightly longer program
 

1673
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,149
slightly longer program
because it contains these extra bits of

00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:50,159
because it contains these extra bits of
 

1675
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,470
because it contains these extra bits of
errors that's fascinating what's what's

00:30:59,750 --> 00:30:59,760
that are able to do cool stuff like
 

1685
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,310
that are able to do cool stuff like

is there if then statements in them so

1692
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:09,200
is there if then statements in them so
 

1693
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,710
is there if then statements in them so
like is there a lot of exceptions that

1694
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:10,720
like is there a lot of exceptions that
 

1695
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,509
like is there a lot of exceptions that
they're storing so um you could imagine

00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:13,519
they're storing so um you could imagine
 

1697
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,190
they're storing so um you could imagine
if there would be tremendous amount of

if there would be tremendous amount of
 

1699
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,190
if there would be tremendous amount of

stochastic gradient descent so we have

1786
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
stochastic gradient descent so we have
 

1787
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,110
stochastic gradient descent so we have

00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,720
optimized do you think of that as a
 

1803
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,310
optimized do you think of that as a
single program um so there is a

car or the detector of a mask for a car
 

1819
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,509
car or the detector of a mask for a car
and then he was able to separate them

1820
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:35,519
and then he was able to separate them
 

1821
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,269
and then he was able to separate them
out and assemble them uh together using

1822
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:39,279
out and assemble them uh together using
 

1823
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,990
out and assemble them uh together using
a simple program uh for the detector for

1824
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,000
a simple program uh for the detector for
 

1825
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,710
a simple program uh for the detector for
a car detector that's like uh if you

1826
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
a car detector that's like uh if you
 

1827
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,950
a car detector that's like uh if you
think of traditionally defined programs

1828
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
think of traditionally defined programs
 

1829
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,110
think of traditionally defined programs
that's like a function within a program

1830
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,120
that's like a function within a program
 

1831
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,870
that's like a function within a program
that this particular neural network was

1832
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
that this particular neural network was
 

1833
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,750
that this particular neural network was
able to find and you can tear that out

1834
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:53,760
able to find and you can tear that out
 

1835
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,269
able to find and you can tear that out
just like you can copy and paste from

1836
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:55,279
just like you can copy and paste from
 

1837
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,710
just like you can copy and paste from
stack overflow

1838
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:56,720
stack overflow
 

1839
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,789
stack overflow
that

1840
00:33:58,789 --> 00:33:58,799
that
 

1841
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,509
that
so uh any program is a composition of

1842
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
so uh any program is a composition of
 

1843
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,190
so uh any program is a composition of
smaller programs

1844
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,200
smaller programs
 

1845
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,029
smaller programs
yeah i mean the nice thing about the

1846
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:05,039
yeah i mean the nice thing about the
 

1847
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,350
yeah i mean the nice thing about the
neural networks is that it allows the

1848
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,360
neural networks is that it allows the
 

1849
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,270
neural networks is that it allows the
things to be more fuzzy than in case of

1850
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:09,280
things to be more fuzzy than in case of
 

1851
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,310
things to be more fuzzy than in case of
programs

1852
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,320
programs
 

1853
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,470
programs
in case of programs you have this like a

1854
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:12,480
in case of programs you have this like a
 

1855
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,790
in case of programs you have this like a
branching this way or that way and the

1856
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:14,800
branching this way or that way and the
 

1857
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,030
branching this way or that way and the
neural networks they they have an easier

1858
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,040
neural networks they they have an easier
 

1859
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,990
neural networks they they have an easier
way to

1860
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
way to
 

1861
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,470
way to
to be somewhere in between or to share

1862
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:20,480
to be somewhere in between or to share
 

1863
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,389
to be somewhere in between or to share
things

1864
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:22,399
things
 

1865
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,990
things
what to use the most beautiful or

1866
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,000
what to use the most beautiful or
 

1867

it can be a cool trick yeah i mean i'm
 

1941
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,190
it can be a cool trick yeah i mean i'm
thinking about the trick but like it's

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,200
thinking about the trick but like it's
 

1943
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,069
thinking about the trick but like it's
still amusing to me that it works at all

in natural language
reinforcement learning

1982
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
reinforcement learning
 

1983
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,910
reinforcement learning
uh

1984
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
uh
 

1985
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,750
uh
and also would you attribute

1986
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760
and also would you attribute
 

1987
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,190
and also would you attribute
that success too is it just scale

1988
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,200
that success too is it just scale
 

1989
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,870
that success too is it just scale
what profound insight can we take from

1990
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:32,880
what profound insight can we take from
 

1991
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,270
what profound insight can we take from
the fact that

1992
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
the fact that
 

1993
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,790
the fact that
the thing works for

1994
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:36,800
the thing works for
 

1995
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,150
the thing works for
gigantic

1996
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,160
gigantic
 

1997
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,710
gigantic
uh sets of variables

1998
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:40,720
uh sets of variables
 

1999
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,150
uh sets of variables
i mean the interesting thing is these

2000
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,160
i mean the interesting thing is these
 

2001
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,670
i mean the interesting thing is these
algorithms they were

2002
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:43,680
algorithms they were
 

2003
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,310
algorithms they were
invented uh decades ago

2004
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,320
invented uh decades ago
 

2005
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,109
invented uh decades ago
and

2006
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:47,119
and
 

2007
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,270
and
people actually

2008
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280
people actually
 

2009
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,030
people actually
gave up on the idea yeah and um

2010
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,040
gave up on the idea yeah and um
 

2011
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,190
gave up on the idea yeah and um
you know back then they thought that we

2012
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,200
you know back then they thought that we
 

2013
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,990
you know back then they thought that we
need profoundly different algorithms and

2014
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,000
need profoundly different algorithms and
 

2015
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,829
need profoundly different algorithms and
they spent a lot of cycles on very

2016
00:36:59,829 --> 00:36:59,839
they spent a lot of cycles on very
 

2017
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,470
they spent a lot of cycles on very
different algorithms and i believe that

2018
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:02,480
different algorithms and i believe that
 

2019
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,870
different algorithms and i believe that
you know we have seen that various

2020
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:04,880
you know we have seen that various
 

2021
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,790
you know we have seen that various
various innovations that say like

2022
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:06,800
various innovations that say like
 

2023
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,870
various innovations that say like
transformer or or dropout or so they can

2024
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:10,880
transformer or or dropout or so they can
 

2025
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,150
transformer or or dropout or so they can
uh you know pass the help but it's also

2026
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,160
uh you know pass the help but it's also
 

2027
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,710
uh you know pass the help but it's also
remarkable to me that this algorithm

2028
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:16,720
remarkable to me that this algorithm
 

2029
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,550
remarkable to me that this algorithm
from 60s or so

2030
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:18,560
from 60s or so
 

2031
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,550
from 60s or so
or i mean you can even say that the

2032
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:20,560
or i mean you can even say that the
 

2033
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,190
or i mean you can even say that the
gradient descent was invented by leibniz

2034
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,200
gradient descent was invented by leibniz
 

2035
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,670
gradient descent was invented by leibniz
in i guess 18th century or so that

2036
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
in i guess 18th century or so that
 

2037
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,550
in i guess 18th century or so that
actually

2038
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:26,560
actually
 

2039
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,510
actually
is the

2040
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,520
is the
 

2041
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,430
is the
core of learning

2042
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
core of learning
 

2043
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,430
core of learning
in the past people are

2044
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,440
in the past people are
 

2045
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,470
in the past people are
it's almost like a out of the maybe an

2046
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:34,480
it's almost like a out of the maybe an
 

2047
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,790
it's almost like a out of the maybe an
ego people are saying that it cannot be

2048
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:36,800
ego people are saying that it cannot be
 

2049
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,270
ego people are saying that it cannot be
the case that such a simple algorithm is

2050
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:39,280
the case that such a simple algorithm is
 

2051
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,710
the case that such a simple algorithm is
there you know

2052
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
there you know
 

2053
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,069
there you know
uh

2054
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:42,079
uh
 

2055
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,710
uh
could solve complicated problems

2056
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:44,720
could solve complicated problems
 

2057
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,430
could solve complicated problems
so they were in search for the

2058
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,440
so they were in search for the
 

2059
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,589
so they were in search for the
other algorithms and as i'm saying like

2060
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:49,599
other algorithms and as i'm saying like
 

2061
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,109
other algorithms and as i'm saying like
i believe that actually we are in the

2062
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:51,119
i believe that actually we are in the
 

2063
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,030
i believe that actually we are in the
game where there is there are actually

2064
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:53,040
game where there is there are actually
 

2065
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,510
game where there is there are actually
frankly three levels there is compute

2066
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
frankly three levels there is compute
 

2067
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,750
frankly three levels there is compute
there are algorithms and there is data

2068
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:57,760
there are algorithms and there is data
 

2069
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,750
there are algorithms and there is data
and if we want to build intelligent

2070
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,760
and if we want to build intelligent
 

2071
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,190
and if we want to build intelligent
systems we have to

2072
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,200
systems we have to
 

2073
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,589
systems we have to
pull all three levers

2074
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:03,599
pull all three levers
 

2075
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,230
pull all three levers
and they are actually multiplicative

2076
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,240
and they are actually multiplicative
 

2077
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,390
and they are actually multiplicative
and it's also interesting so you ask is

2078
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,400
and it's also interesting so you ask is
 

2079
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,550
and it's also interesting so you ask is
it only compute

2080
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,560
it only compute
 

2081
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,870
it only compute
people internally they did the studies

2082
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:12,880
people internally they did the studies
 

2083
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,109
people internally they did the studies
to determine how much gains they were

2084
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
to determine how much gains they were
 

2085
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,829
to determine how much gains they were
coming from different levels and so far

2086
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:17,839
coming from different levels and so far
 

2087
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,750
coming from different levels and so far
we have seen that more gains came from

2088
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:19,760
we have seen that more gains came from
 

2089
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,750
we have seen that more gains came from
compute than algorithms but also we are

2090
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
compute than algorithms but also we are
 

2091
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,750
compute than algorithms but also we are
in the world that in case of compute

2092
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760
in the world that in case of compute
 

2093
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,589
in the world that in case of compute
there is a kind of you know exponential

2094
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:25,599
there is a kind of you know exponential
 

2095
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,670
there is a kind of you know exponential
increase in funding and at some point

2096
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:27,680
increase in funding and at some point
 

2097
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,190
increase in funding and at some point
it's impossible to

2098
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,200
it's impossible to
 

2099
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,790
it's impossible to
invest more it's impossible to you know

2100
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:30,800
invest more it's impossible to you know
 

2101
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,390
invest more it's impossible to you know
invest 10 trillion dollars

2102
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
invest 10 trillion dollars
 

2103
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,630
invest 10 trillion dollars
because we are speaking about that

2104
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:34,640
because we are speaking about that
 

2105
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,430
because we are speaking about that
let's say all taxes in u.s

2106
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:37,440
let's say all taxes in u.s
 

2107
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,990
let's say all taxes in u.s
uh but you're talking about money there

2108
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
uh but you're talking about money there
 

2109
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,829
uh but you're talking about money there
could be innovation

2110
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:41,839
could be innovation
 

2111
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,670
could be innovation
in the compute that's that's true as

2112
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:43,680
in the compute that's that's true as
 

2113
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,790
in the compute that's that's true as
well

2114
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:44,800
well
 

2115
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,630
well
so i mean they're like a few pieces so

2116
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:46,640
so i mean they're like a few pieces so
 

2117
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,870
so i mean they're like a few pieces so
one piece is human brain is an

2118
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:48,880
one piece is human brain is an
 

2119
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,480
one piece is human brain is an
incredible super computer

2120
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:50,490
incredible super computer
 

2121
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,589
incredible super computer

[Music]
 

2123
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,109

2125
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:55,910

it

2126
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,920
it
 

2127
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,270
it
it has

2128
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,280
it has
 

2129
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,829
it has
100 trillion

2130
00:38:58,829 --> 00:38:58,839
100 trillion
 

2131
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,910
100 trillion
parameters or like a if you try to count

2132
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:01,920
parameters or like a if you try to count
 

2133
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,349
parameters or like a if you try to count
various quantities in the brain there

2134
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:03,359
various quantities in the brain there
 

2135
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,310
various quantities in the brain there
are like a neurons synapses that small

2136
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:06,320
are like a neurons synapses that small
 

2137
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,589
are like a neurons synapses that small
number of neurons there is a lot of

2138
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:07,599
number of neurons there is a lot of
 

2139
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,390
number of neurons there is a lot of
synapses yeah it's unclear even how to

2140
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,400
synapses yeah it's unclear even how to
 

2141
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,510
synapses yeah it's unclear even how to
map

2142
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:11,520
map
 

2143
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,870

synapses

2144
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:12,880
synapses
 

2145
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,910
synapses
to

2146
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:13,920
to
 

2147
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,310
to
two parameters of neural networks but

2148
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,320
two parameters of neural networks but
 

2149
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,670
two parameters of neural networks but
it's clear that there are many more yeah

2150
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:19,680
it's clear that there are many more yeah
 

2151
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,589
it's clear that there are many more yeah
so it might be the case that our

2152
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:21,599
so it might be the case that our
 

2153
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,190
so it might be the case that our
networks are still somewhat small

2154
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,200
networks are still somewhat small
 

2155
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,630
networks are still somewhat small
it also might be the case that they are

2156
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
it also might be the case that they are
 

2157
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,069
it also might be the case that they are
more efficient than brain or less

2158
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:28,079
more efficient than brain or less
 

2159
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,950
more efficient than brain or less
efficient by some by some huge factor

2160
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
efficient by some by some huge factor
 

2161
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,750
efficient by some by some huge factor
i also believe that there will be like a

2162
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,760
i also believe that there will be like a
 

2163
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,109
i also believe that there will be like a
you know at the moment we are at the

2164
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:35,119
you know at the moment we are at the
 

2165
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,349
you know at the moment we are at the
stage that the these neural networks

2166
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:37,359
stage that the these neural networks
 

2167
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,950
stage that the these neural networks
they require 1000x or like a huge factor

2168
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:40,960
they require 1000x or like a huge factor
 

2169
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,670
they require 1000x or like a huge factor
of more data than humans do and it will

2170
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
of more data than humans do and it will
 

2171
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,310
of more data than humans do and it will
be a matter of

2172
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:46,320
be a matter of
 

2173
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,870
be a matter of
there will be algorithms that

2174
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:48,880
there will be algorithms that
 

2175
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,870
there will be algorithms that
vastly decrease sample complexity i

2176
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:50,880
vastly decrease sample complexity i
 

2177
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,109
vastly decrease sample complexity i
believe so but the place where we are

2178
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:53,119
believe so but the place where we are
 

2179
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,910
believe so but the place where we are
heading today is dark domains which

2180
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:55,920
heading today is dark domains which
 

2181
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,990
heading today is dark domains which
contains million x

2182
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,000
contains million x
 

2183
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,710
contains million x
more

2184
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:58,720
more
 

2185
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,270
more
data and even though computers might be

2186
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280
data and even though computers might be
 

2187
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,109
data and even though computers might be
1 000 times slower than humans in

1 000 times slower than humans in
 

2189
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,750
1 000 times slower than humans in
learning that's not the problem okay for

2190
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
learning that's not the problem okay for
 

2191
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,030
learning that's not the problem okay for
instance

2192
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,040
instance
 

2193
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,470
instance
i believe that

2194
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:08,480
i believe that
 

2195
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,589
i believe that
it should be possible to create super

2196
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:11,599
it should be possible to create super
 

2197
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,190
it should be possible to create super
human therapies

2198
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,200
human therapies
 

2199
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,950
human therapies
uh by uh

2200
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:14,960
uh by uh
 

2201
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,190
uh by uh
and and then they're like even simple

2202
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:17,200
and and then they're like even simple
 

2203
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,309
and and then they're like even simple
steps of of doing what of of doing it

2204
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:20,319
steps of of doing what of of doing it
 

2205
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,470
steps of of doing what of of doing it
and you know that the core reason is

2206
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,480
and you know that the core reason is
 

2207
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,109
and you know that the core reason is
there is just machine will be able to

2208
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:25,119
there is just machine will be able to
 

2209
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,390
there is just machine will be able to
read way more

2210
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
read way more
 

2211
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,309
read way more
transcripts of therapies and then it

2212
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:28,319
transcripts of therapies and then it
 

2213
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,069
transcripts of therapies and then it
should be able to speak simultaneously

2214
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
should be able to speak simultaneously
 

2215
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,670
should be able to speak simultaneously
with many more people and it should be

2216
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:31,680
with many more people and it should be
 

2217
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,309
with many more people and it should be
possible to optimize it uh all in

2218
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:34,319
possible to optimize it uh all in
 

2219
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,430
possible to optimize it uh all in
parallel

2220
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:35,440
parallel
 

2221
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,829
parallel
and well there's now you're touching on

2222
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
and well there's now you're touching on
 

2223
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,829
and well there's now you're touching on
something i deeply care about and think

2224
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:39,839
something i deeply care about and think
 

2225
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,150
something i deeply care about and think
is way harder than we imagined

2226
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,160
is way harder than we imagined
 

2227
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,270
is way harder than we imagined
um

2228
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
um
 

2229
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,430
um
what's the goal of a therapist what's it

2230
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:45,440
what's the goal of a therapist what's it
 

2231
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,510
what's the goal of a therapist what's it
called therapies

2232
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:47,520
called therapies
 

2233
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,829
called therapies
so okay so one goal now this is

2234
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:49,839
so okay so one goal now this is
 

2235
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,430
so okay so one goal now this is
terrifying to me

2236
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:51,440
terrifying to me
 

2237
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,910
terrifying to me
but there's a lot of people that

2238
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:53,920
but there's a lot of people that
 

2239
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,750
but there's a lot of people that
contemplate suicide suffer from

2240
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:55,760
contemplate suicide suffer from
 

2241
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,630
contemplate suicide suffer from
depression

2242
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:58,640

 

2243
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,710

and they could significantly be helped

2244
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:00,720
and they could significantly be helped
 

2245
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,550
and they could significantly be helped
with therapy

2246
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,560
with therapy
 

2247
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,750
with therapy
and the idea that an ai algorithm might

2248
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:05,760
and the idea that an ai algorithm might
 

2249
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,069
and the idea that an ai algorithm might
be in charge of that

2250
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:08,079
be in charge of that
 

2251
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,470
be in charge of that
it's like a life and death task

2252
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
it's like a life and death task
 

2253
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,150
it's like a life and death task
it's uh

2254
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,160
it's uh
 

2255
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,910
it's uh
the stakes are high

2256
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:13,920
the stakes are high
 

2257
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,030
the stakes are high
so one

2258
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,040
so one
 

2259
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,670
so one
goal for a therapist whether human or ai

2260
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:19,680
goal for a therapist whether human or ai
 

2261
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,470
goal for a therapist whether human or ai
is to prevent suicide ideation to

2262
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:22,480
is to prevent suicide ideation to
 

2263
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,750
is to prevent suicide ideation to
prevent suicide how do you achieve that

2264
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:25,760
prevent suicide how do you achieve that
 

2265
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,550
prevent suicide how do you achieve that
so

2266
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:26,560
so
 

2267
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,750
so
let's see

2268
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:27,760
let's see
 

2269
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,950
let's see
so

2270
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:28,960
so
 

2271
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,550
so
to be clear i don't think that the

2272
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560
to be clear i don't think that the
 

2273
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,950
to be clear i don't think that the
current models are good enough for such

2274
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:32,960
current models are good enough for such
 

2275
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,950
current models are good enough for such
a task because it requires insane amount

2276
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:34,960
a task because it requires insane amount
 

2277
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,950
a task because it requires insane amount
of understanding and patty and the

2278
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960
of understanding and patty and the
 

2279
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,470
of understanding and patty and the
models are far from this place but it's

2280
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:40,480
models are far from this place but it's
 

2281
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,230
models are far from this place but it's
but do you think that understanding

2282
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,240
but do you think that understanding
 

2283
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,750
but do you think that understanding
empathy that signal is in the data um i

2284
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:45,760
empathy that signal is in the data um i
 

2285
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,270
empathy that signal is in the data um i
think there is some signal in the data

2286
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
think there is some signal in the data
 

2287
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,870
think there is some signal in the data
yes i mean there are plenty of

2288
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:48,880
yes i mean there are plenty of
 

2289
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,870
yes i mean there are plenty of
transcripts of conversations

2290
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
transcripts of conversations
 

2291
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,510
transcripts of conversations
and it is possible to

2292
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
and it is possible to
 

2293
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,349
and it is possible to
it is possible from it to understand

2294
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:55,359
it is possible from it to understand
 

2295
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,910
it is possible from it to understand
personalities it is possible from it to

2296
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
personalities it is possible from it to
 

2297
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,030
personalities it is possible from it to
understand uh if conversation is

2298
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
understand uh if conversation is
 

2299
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,470
understand uh if conversation is
a friendly

2300
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:02,480
a friendly
 

2301
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,870
a friendly
uh amicable uh

2302
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:04,880
uh amicable uh
 

2303
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,430
uh amicable uh
antagonistic it is i believe that the

2304
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
antagonistic it is i believe that the
 

2305
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,670
antagonistic it is i believe that the
you know given the fact that the models

2306
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:09,680
you know given the fact that the models
 

2307
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,349
you know given the fact that the models
that we train now

2308
00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:11,359
that we train now
 

2309
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,069
that we train now
they can

2310
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:14,079

 

2311
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,349

they can have

2312
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:15,359
they can have
 

2313
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,030
they can have
they are chameleons that they can have

2314
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,040
they are chameleons that they can have
 

2315
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,190
they are chameleons that they can have
any personality they might turn out to

2316
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
any personality they might turn out to
 

2317
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,190
any personality they might turn out to
be better in understanding

2318
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200
be better in understanding
 

2319
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,190
be better in understanding
uh personality of other people than

2320
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:23,200
uh personality of other people than
 

2321
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,750
uh personality of other people than
anyone else and they feel pathetic to be

2322
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:25,760
anyone else and they feel pathetic to be
 

2323
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,510
anyone else and they feel pathetic to be
empathetic yeah

2324
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:27,520
empathetic yeah
 

2325
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,349
empathetic yeah
interesting uh but i wonder if there's

2326
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:31,359
interesting uh but i wonder if there's
 

2327
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,950
interesting uh but i wonder if there's
some level

2328
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
some level
 

2329
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,390
some level
of

2330
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:34,400
of
 

2331
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,589
of
multiple modalities required

2332
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:37,599
multiple modalities required
 

2333
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,270
multiple modalities required
to be able to

2334
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:39,280
to be able to
 

2335
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,910
to be able to
be empathetic of the human experience

2336
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:41,920
be empathetic of the human experience
 

2337
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,910
be empathetic of the human experience
whether language is not enough to

2338
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:43,920
whether language is not enough to
 

2339
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,150
whether language is not enough to
understand death to understand fear to

2340
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,160
understand death to understand fear to
 

2341
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,910
understand death to understand fear to
understand

2342
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:47,920
understand
 

2343
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,790
understand
uh childhood trauma

2344
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:50,800
uh childhood trauma
 

2345
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,550
uh childhood trauma
to understand uh wit and humor required

2346
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:54,560
to understand uh wit and humor required
 

2347
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,230
to understand uh wit and humor required
when you're dancing with the person who

2348
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,240
when you're dancing with the person who
 

2349
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,790
when you're dancing with the person who
might be depressed or suffering

2350
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:58,800
might be depressed or suffering
 

2351
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,349
might be depressed or suffering
both humor and hope and love and all

2352
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:01,359
both humor and hope and love and all
 

2353
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,790
both humor and hope and love and all
those kinds of things

2354
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:02,800
those kinds of things
 

2355
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,950
those kinds of things
so there's another underlying question

2356
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:04,960
so there's another underlying question
 

2357
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,510
so there's another underlying question
which is self-supervised versus

2358
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
which is self-supervised versus
 

2359
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,510
which is self-supervised versus
supervised

2360
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:09,520
supervised
 

2361
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,829
supervised
so can you get

2362
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:10,839
so can you get
 

2363
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:14,630
so can you get
that from the data by just reading

2364
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:14,640
that from the data by just reading
 

2365
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,030
that from the data by just reading
a huge number of transcripts i actually

2366
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,040
a huge number of transcripts i actually
 

2367
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,030
a huge number of transcripts i actually
so i think that reading huge number of

2368
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,040
so i think that reading huge number of
 

2369
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,430
so i think that reading huge number of
transcripts is a step one it's like the

2370
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,440
transcripts is a step one it's like the
 

2371
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,309
transcripts is a step one it's like the
same way as you cannot learn to dance if

2372
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:24,319
same way as you cannot learn to dance if
 

2373
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,550
same way as you cannot learn to dance if
just from youtube by watching it you

2374
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:26,560
just from youtube by watching it you
 

2375
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,309
just from youtube by watching it you
have to actually try it out yourself

2376
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:28,319
have to actually try it out yourself
 

2377
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,630
have to actually try it out yourself
yeah and so i think that here that's a

2378
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:30,640
yeah and so i think that here that's a
 

2379
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,190
yeah and so i think that here that's a
similar situation i also wouldn't deploy

2380
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,200
similar situation i also wouldn't deploy
 

2381
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,589
similar situation i also wouldn't deploy
the system in the high-stakes situations

2382
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:35,599
the system in the high-stakes situations
 

2383
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,309
the system in the high-stakes situations
right away but kind of see gradually

2384
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
right away but kind of see gradually
 

2385
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,190
right away but kind of see gradually
where

2386
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
where
 

2387
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,870
where
it goes and

2388
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:40,880
it goes and
 

2389
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,870
it goes and
obviously initially

2390
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:42,880
obviously initially
 

2391
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,190
obviously initially
it would have to go hand with a hand in

2392
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
it would have to go hand with a hand in
 

2393
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,349
it would have to go hand with a hand in
hand with humans but

2394
00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:47,359
hand with humans but
 

2395
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:48,870
hand with humans but
at the moment we are in the situation

2396
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:48,880
at the moment we are in the situation
 

2397
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,230
at the moment we are in the situation
that actually

2398
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:50,240
that actually
 

2399
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,309
that actually
there is many more people who actually

2400
00:43:52,309 --> 00:43:52,319
there is many more people who actually
 

2401
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,870
there is many more people who actually
would like to have a therapy or

2402
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:54,880
would like to have a therapy or
 

2403
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,550
would like to have a therapy or
or speak with with someone then there

2404
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:56,560
or speak with with someone then there
 

2405
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,870
or speak with with someone then there
are therapies out there okay you know i

2406
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:58,880
are therapies out there okay you know i
 

2407
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,910
are therapies out there okay you know i
was

2408
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
was
 

2409
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,950
was
so so

2410
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:00,960
so so
 

2411
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,950
so so
fundamentally i was thinking what are

2412
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:02,960
fundamentally i was thinking what are
 

2413
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,870
fundamentally i was thinking what are
the things that

2414
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:04,880
the things that
 

2415
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,550
the things that
can vastly increase people well-being

2416
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,560
can vastly increase people well-being
 

2417
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,309
can vastly increase people well-being
therapy is one of them i think

2418
00:44:10,309 --> 00:44:10,319
therapy is one of them i think
 

2419
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,550
therapy is one of them i think
meditation is other one i guess maybe

2420
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:12,560
meditation is other one i guess maybe
 

2421
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,470
meditation is other one i guess maybe
human connection is a third one and i

2422
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:14,480
human connection is a third one and i
 

2423
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,270
human connection is a third one and i
guess

2424
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:15,280
guess
 

2425
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,270
guess
pharmacologically it's also possible

2426
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
pharmacologically it's also possible
 

2427
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,109
pharmacologically it's also possible
maybe direct brain stimulation or

2428
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
maybe direct brain stimulation or
 

2429
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,630
maybe direct brain stimulation or
something like that but these are pretty

2430
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:20,640
something like that but these are pretty
 

2431
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,550
something like that but these are pretty
much options out there then let's say

2432
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:22,560
much options out there then let's say
 

2433
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,950
much options out there then let's say
the way i'm thinking about the agi

2434
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
the way i'm thinking about the agi
 

2435
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,950
the way i'm thinking about the agi
endeavor is by default that's an

2436
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
endeavor is by default that's an
 

2437
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,790
endeavor is by default that's an
endeavor to

2438
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:28,800
endeavor to
 

2439
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,030
endeavor to
increase amount of wealth and i believe

2440
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,040
increase amount of wealth and i believe
 

2441
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,870
increase amount of wealth and i believe
that we can vastly increase amount of

2442
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880
that we can vastly increase amount of
 

2443
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,750
that we can vastly increase amount of
wealth

2444
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:33,760
wealth
 

2445
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,710
wealth
for everyone and simultaneously so i

2446
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
for everyone and simultaneously so i
 

2447
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,790
for everyone and simultaneously so i
mean they're like two endeavors that

2448
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:38,800
mean they're like two endeavors that
 

2449
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,270
mean they're like two endeavors that
make sense to me one is like essentially

2450
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,280
make sense to me one is like essentially
 

2451
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,349
make sense to me one is like essentially
increase amount of wealth and second one

2452
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:43,359
increase amount of wealth and second one
 

2453
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,950
increase amount of wealth and second one
is uh increase overall human well-being

2454
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:46,960
is uh increase overall human well-being
 

2455
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,870
is uh increase overall human well-being
and those are coupled together and they

2456
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:48,880
and those are coupled together and they
 

2457
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,030
and those are coupled together and they
they can okay i would say these are

2458
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,040
they can okay i would say these are
 

2459
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,309
they can okay i would say these are
different topics one can help another

2460
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
different topics one can help another
 

2461
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,030
different topics one can help another
and uh you know therapist is a funny

2462
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,040
and uh you know therapist is a funny
 

2463
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,430
and uh you know therapist is a funny
word because i see friendship and love

2464
00:44:59,430 --> 00:44:59,440
word because i see friendship and love
 

2465
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,230
word because i see friendship and love
as therapy i mean so therapist broadly

2466
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240
as therapy i mean so therapist broadly
 

2467
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,349
as therapy i mean so therapist broadly
defined as just friendship as a friend

2468
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:05,359
defined as just friendship as a friend
 

2469
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,910
defined as just friendship as a friend
so like therapist is has a very kind of

2470
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920
so like therapist is has a very kind of
 

2471
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,550
so like therapist is has a very kind of
clinical sense to it but

2472
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:10,560
clinical sense to it but
 

2473
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,950
clinical sense to it but
what is human connection

2474
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:12,960
what is human connection
 

2475
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,589
what is human connection
you're like uh

2476
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:15,599
you're like uh
 

2477
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,990
you're like uh
not to get all camus and dostoyevsky on

2478
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,000
not to get all camus and dostoyevsky on
 

2479
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,150
not to get all camus and dostoyevsky on
you but you know life is suffering and

2480
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,160
you but you know life is suffering and
 

2481
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,230
you but you know life is suffering and
we draw

2482
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:22,240
we draw
 

2483
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,030
we draw
we

2484
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,040
we
 

2485
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,630
we
seek connection with other humans as we

2486
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:26,640
seek connection with other humans as we
 

2487
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,550
seek connection with other humans as we
desperately try to make sense of this

2488
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
desperately try to make sense of this
 

2489
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,510
desperately try to make sense of this
world

2490
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
world
 

2491
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,910
world
in the deep overwhelming loneliness that

2492
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920
in the deep overwhelming loneliness that
 

2493
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,030
in the deep overwhelming loneliness that
we feel

2494
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,040
we feel
 

2495
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,470
we feel
inside

2496
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:34,480
inside
 

2497
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,390
inside
so i think connection has to do with

2498
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:36,400
so i think connection has to do with
 

2499
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,750
so i think connection has to do with
understanding

2500
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:37,760
understanding
 

2501
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,910
understanding
and i think that almost like a lack of

2502
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:39,920
and i think that almost like a lack of
 

2503
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,510
and i think that almost like a lack of
understanding causes suffering if you

2504
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:41,520
understanding causes suffering if you
 

2505
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,510
understanding causes suffering if you
speak with someone and you

2506
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:43,520
speak with someone and you
 

2507
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,309
speak with someone and you
do you feel ignored that actually causes

2508
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:46,319
do you feel ignored that actually causes
 

2509
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,630
do you feel ignored that actually causes
pain if you are feeling deeply

2510
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:48,640
pain if you are feeling deeply
 

2511
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,870
pain if you are feeling deeply
understood that actually

2512
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:50,880
understood that actually
 

2513
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,710
understood that actually
they they might not even tell you what

2514
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:52,720
they they might not even tell you what
 

2515
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,030
they they might not even tell you what
to do in life but like a pure

2516
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:55,040
to do in life but like a pure
 

2517
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,430
to do in life but like a pure
understanding or just being heard

2518
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:57,440
understanding or just being heard
 

2519
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,190
understanding or just being heard
understanding is a kind of

2520
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,200
understanding is a kind of
 

2521
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,670
understanding is a kind of
it's a lot you know just being heard

2522
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:01,680
it's a lot you know just being heard
 

2523
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,670
it's a lot you know just being heard
feel like you're being heard

2524
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,680
feel like you're being heard
 

2525
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,190
feel like you're being heard
like somehow

2526
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,200
like somehow
 

2527
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,390
like somehow
that's uh alleviation temporarily of the

2528
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
that's uh alleviation temporarily of the
 

2529
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,670
that's uh alleviation temporarily of the
loneliness

2530
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:09,680
loneliness
 

2531
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,990
loneliness
that if somebody

2532
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,000
that if somebody
 

2533
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,470
that if somebody
knows you're here

2534
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,480
knows you're here
 

2535
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,470
knows you're here
with their body language with the way

2536
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:16,480
with their body language with the way
 

2537
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,230
with their body language with the way
they are with the way they look at you

2538
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
they are with the way they look at you
 

2539
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,069
they are with the way they look at you
with the way they talk

2540
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:20,079
with the way they talk
 

2541
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,670
with the way they talk
you feel less alone for a brief moment

2542
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,680
you feel less alone for a brief moment
 

2543
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,069
you feel less alone for a brief moment
yeah very very much agree so i thought

2544
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:26,079
yeah very very much agree so i thought
 

2545
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,950
yeah very very much agree so i thought
in the past about uh somewhat similar

2546
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:28,960
in the past about uh somewhat similar
 

2547
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,510
in the past about uh somewhat similar
question to yours which is what is love

2548
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:31,520
question to yours which is what is love
 

2549
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,190
question to yours which is what is love
uh rather what is connection yes and um

2550
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:35,200
uh rather what is connection yes and um
 

2551
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,030
uh rather what is connection yes and um
and obviously i think about these things

2552
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,040
and obviously i think about these things
 

2553
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,190
and obviously i think about these things
from ai perspective what would it mean

2554
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
from ai perspective what would it mean
 

2555
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,069
from ai perspective what would it mean
um

2556
00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:40,079
um
 

2557
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,190
um
so i said that the you know intelligence

2558
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,200
so i said that the you know intelligence
 

2559
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,190
so i said that the you know intelligence
has to do with some compression which is

2560
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:45,200
has to do with some compression which is
 

2561
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,950
has to do with some compression which is
more or less like i can say almost

2562
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:46,960
more or less like i can say almost
 

2563
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,270
more or less like i can say almost
understanding of what is going around it

2564
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:49,280
understanding of what is going around it
 

2565
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,069
understanding of what is going around it
seems to me that uh other aspect is

2566
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:52,079
seems to me that uh other aspect is
 

2567
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,390
seems to me that uh other aspect is
there seem to be reward functions and

2568
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
there seem to be reward functions and
 

2569
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,829
there seem to be reward functions and
you can have a you know reward for

2570
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:57,839
you can have a you know reward for
 

2571
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,030
you can have a you know reward for
uh food for maybe human connection for

2572
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,040
uh food for maybe human connection for
 

2573
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,109
uh food for maybe human connection for
uh let's say warmth

2574
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:03,119
uh let's say warmth
 

2575
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:03,910
uh let's say warmth
uh

2576
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:03,920
uh
 

2577
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,750
uh
sex and so on

2578
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:05,760
sex and so on
 

2579
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,230
sex and so on
and um

2580
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:08,240
and um
 

2581
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,790
and um
and it turns out that the various people

2582
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:10,800
and it turns out that the various people
 

2583
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,710
and it turns out that the various people
might be optimizing slightly different

2584
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:12,720
might be optimizing slightly different
 

2585
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,309
might be optimizing slightly different
reward functions they essentially might

2586
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
reward functions they essentially might
 

2587
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,309
reward functions they essentially might
care about different things

2588
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:16,319
care about different things
 

2589
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,390
care about different things
and um

2590
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:18,400
and um
 

2591
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,910
and um
in case of

2592
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
in case of
 

2593
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,750
in case of
love at least the love between two

2594
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:21,760
love at least the love between two
 

2595
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,870
love at least the love between two
people you can say that the um you know

2596
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:24,880
people you can say that the um you know
 

2597
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,470
people you can say that the um you know
boundary between people dissolves to

2598
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:26,480
boundary between people dissolves to
 

2599
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,829
boundary between people dissolves to
such extent that

2600
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:27,839
such extent that
 

2601
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,910
such extent that
they end up optimizing each other reward

2602
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:29,920
they end up optimizing each other reward
 

2603
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,030
they end up optimizing each other reward
functions

2604
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,040

 

2605
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,990

yeah

2606
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,000
yeah
 

2607
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,829
yeah
oh that's interesting um

2608
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:37,839
oh that's interesting um
 

2609
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,150
oh that's interesting um
the success of each other yeah in some

2610
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
the success of each other yeah in some
 

2611
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,829
the success of each other yeah in some
sense i would say love means

2612
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:41,839
sense i would say love means
 

2613
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:42,790
sense i would say love means
uh

2614
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:42,800
uh
 

2615
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,109
uh
helping others to optimize their uh

2616
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:45,119
helping others to optimize their uh
 

2617
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,549
helping others to optimize their uh
reward functions not your reward

2618
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:46,559
reward functions not your reward
 

2619
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,990
reward functions not your reward
functions not the things that you think

2620
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:48,000
functions not the things that you think
 

2621
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,670
functions not the things that you think
are important but the things that the

2622
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
are important but the things that the
 

2623
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,109
are important but the things that the
person cares about you try to help them

2624
00:47:53,109 --> 00:47:53,119
person cares about you try to help them
 

2625
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,630
person cares about you try to help them
to optimize it so love is uh

2626
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:56,640
to optimize it so love is uh
 

2627
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,710
to optimize it so love is uh
if you think of two reward functions you

2628
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
if you think of two reward functions you
 

2629
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,630
if you think of two reward functions you
just it's a condition yeah you combine

2630
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:00,640
just it's a condition yeah you combine
 

2631
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,230
just it's a condition yeah you combine
them together yeah pretty much maybe

2632
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,240
them together yeah pretty much maybe
 

2633
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,309
them together yeah pretty much maybe
like with a weight and it depends like

2634
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:04,319
like with a weight and it depends like
 

2635
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,390
like with a weight and it depends like
the dynamic of the relationship yeah i

2636
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,400
the dynamic of the relationship yeah i
 

2637
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,670
the dynamic of the relationship yeah i
mean you could imagine that if you are

2638
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
mean you could imagine that if you are
 

2639
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,750
mean you could imagine that if you are
fully uh optimizing someone's reward

2640
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:09,760
fully uh optimizing someone's reward
 

2641
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,589
fully uh optimizing someone's reward
function without yours then yeah then

2642
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:11,599
function without yours then yeah then
 

2643
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,190
function without yours then yeah then
maybe are creating code dependency or

2644
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
maybe are creating code dependency or
 

2645
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,190
maybe are creating code dependency or
something like that yeah

2646
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,200
something like that yeah
 

2647
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,549
something like that yeah
i'm not sure what's the appropriate

2648
00:48:16,549 --> 00:48:16,559
i'm not sure what's the appropriate
 

2649
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,390
i'm not sure what's the appropriate
weight but the interesting thing is i

2650
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:18,400
weight but the interesting thing is i
 

2651
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,190
weight but the interesting thing is i
even

2652
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,200
even
 

2653
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,349
even
i even think that the

2654
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
i even think that the
 

2655
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,549
i even think that the
individual person

2656
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:24,559

 

2657
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,030

we ourselves we are actually

2658
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,040
we ourselves we are actually
 

2659
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,390
we ourselves we are actually
less of a

2660
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,400
less of a
 

2661
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,549
less of a
unified insight so for instance if you

2662
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
unified insight so for instance if you
 

2663
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,950
unified insight so for instance if you
look at the donut on the one level you

2664
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:32,960
look at the donut on the one level you
 

2665
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,950
look at the donut on the one level you
might think oh this like it looks tasty

2666
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:34,960
might think oh this like it looks tasty
 

2667
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,790
might think oh this like it looks tasty
i would like to eat it on another level

2668
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:36,800
i would like to eat it on another level
 

2669
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,549
i would like to eat it on another level
you might tell yourself i shouldn't be

2670
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:38,559
you might tell yourself i shouldn't be
 

2671
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:39,910
you might tell yourself i shouldn't be
doing it because

2672
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:39,920
doing it because
 

2673
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,190
doing it because
i want to gain muscles so and you know

2674
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:43,200
i want to gain muscles so and you know
 

2675
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,950
i want to gain muscles so and you know
you might do it regardless kind of

2676
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:44,960
you might do it regardless kind of
 

2677
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,430
you might do it regardless kind of
against yourself so it seems that even

2678
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:47,440
against yourself so it seems that even
 

2679
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,270
against yourself so it seems that even
within ourselves they're almost like a

2680
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:49,280
within ourselves they're almost like a
 

2681
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,750
within ourselves they're almost like a
kind of intertwined personas

2682
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:51,760
kind of intertwined personas
 

2683
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,870
kind of intertwined personas
and

2684
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:52,880
and
 

2685
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,109
and
i believe that the self-love

2686
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:55,119
i believe that the self-love
 

2687
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,390
i believe that the self-love
means that

2688
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
means that
 

2689
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,790
means that
the love between all these persons which

2690
00:48:58,790 --> 00:48:58,800
the love between all these persons which
 

2691
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,870
the love between all these persons which
also means being able to

2692
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:00,880
also means being able to
 

2693
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,950
also means being able to
love love

2694
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960
love love
 

2695
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,510
love love
yourself when we are angry or stressed

2696
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:05,520
yourself when we are angry or stressed
 

2697
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,430
yourself when we are angry or stressed
or so combining all those reward

2698
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:07,440
or so combining all those reward
 

2699
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,109
or so combining all those reward
functions of the different selves you

2700
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:09,119
functions of the different selves you
 

2701
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,030
functions of the different selves you
have yeah and accepting that they are

2702
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,040
have yeah and accepting that they are
 

2703
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,950
have yeah and accepting that they are
there okay you know often people they

2704
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:12,960
there okay you know often people they
 

2705
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,349
there okay you know often people they
have a negative self-talk or they say i

2706
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:15,359
have a negative self-talk or they say i
 

2707
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,589
have a negative self-talk or they say i
don't like when i'm angry and like i try

2708
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:17,599
don't like when i'm angry and like i try
 

2709
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,510
don't like when i'm angry and like i try
to imagine

2710
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520
to imagine
 

2711
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,309
to imagine
try to imagine if there would be

2712
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:22,319
try to imagine if there would be
 

2713
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,510
try to imagine if there would be
like a

2714
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:23,520
like a
 

2715
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,390
like a
small baby alex like a five years old

2716
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:26,400
small baby alex like a five years old
 

2717
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,270
small baby alex like a five years old
who's angry angry and then you're like

2718
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:29,280
who's angry angry and then you're like
 

2719
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,950
who's angry angry and then you're like
you shouldn't be angry like stop being

2720
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
you shouldn't be angry like stop being
 

2721
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,190
you shouldn't be angry like stop being
angry yeah but like instead actually you

2722
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,200
angry yeah but like instead actually you
 

2723
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,510
angry yeah but like instead actually you
want the legs to come over give him a

2724
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,520
want the legs to come over give him a
 

2725
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,230
want the legs to come over give him a
hug and he's like i say it's fine okay

2726
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,240
hug and he's like i say it's fine okay
 

2727
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,230
hug and he's like i say it's fine okay
you can't be angry as long as you want

2728
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:40,240
you can't be angry as long as you want
 

2729
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,309
you can't be angry as long as you want
yeah then he would stop

2730
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:42,319
yeah then he would stop
 

2731
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,190
yeah then he would stop
or

2732
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:43,200
or
 

2733
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,190
or
or maybe not or maybe not but you cannot

2734
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,200
or maybe not or maybe not but you cannot
 

2735
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,190
or maybe not or maybe not but you cannot
expect it even yeah

2736
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:47,200
expect it even yeah
 

2737
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,190
expect it even yeah
but still that doesn't explain the why

2738
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,200
but still that doesn't explain the why
 

2739
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,270
but still that doesn't explain the why
of love like why is love part of the

2740
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:51,280
of love like why is love part of the
 

2741
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,670
of love like why is love part of the
human condition why is it useful

2742
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:53,680
human condition why is it useful
 

2743
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,630
human condition why is it useful
to combine the reward functions

2744
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
to combine the reward functions
 

2745
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,390
to combine the reward functions
it seems like

2746
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,400
it seems like
 

2747
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,069
it seems like
that doesn't i mean

2748
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:00,079
that doesn't i mean
 

2749
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,430
that doesn't i mean
i don't think reinforcement learning

2750
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:01,440
i don't think reinforcement learning
 

2751
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,990
i don't think reinforcement learning
frameworks can give us answers to why

2752
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:04,000
frameworks can give us answers to why
 

2753
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,230
frameworks can give us answers to why
even even the hudder

2754
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,240
even even the hudder
 

2755
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,390
even even the hudder
framework has an objective function

2756
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:08,400
framework has an objective function
 

2757

framework has an objective function
that's static so we came to existence as

that's static so we came to existence as

00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,069
or it's not out of distribution it's
like as you that it evolved for

2798
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:54,079
like as you that it evolved for
 

2799
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,349
like as you that it evolved for
cooperation

2800
00:50:55,349 --> 00:50:55,359
cooperation
 

2801
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,829
cooperation
yes and i believe that the cop like a in

2802
00:50:57,829 --> 00:50:57,839
yes and i believe that the cop like a in
 

2803
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,510
yes and i believe that the cop like a in
some sense cooperation ends up helping

2804
00:50:59,510 --> 00:50:59,520
some sense cooperation ends up helping
 

2805
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,349
some sense cooperation ends up helping
each of us individually so it makes

2806
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:01,359
each of us individually so it makes
 

2807
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,069
each of us individually so it makes
sense evolutionary and there is a in

2808
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079
sense evolutionary and there is a in
 

2809
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,390
sense evolutionary and there is a in
some sense and you know love means there

2810
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:06,400
some sense and you know love means there
 

2811
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,309
some sense and you know love means there
is this dissolution of boundaries that

2812
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
is this dissolution of boundaries that
 

2813
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,870
is this dissolution of boundaries that
you have a shared reward function and we

2814
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:10,880
you have a shared reward function and we
 

2815
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,950
you have a shared reward function and we
evolve to actually identify ourselves

2816
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:12,960
evolve to actually identify ourselves
 

2817
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,390
evolve to actually identify ourselves
with larger groups so we we can identify

2818
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:16,400
with larger groups so we we can identify
 

2819
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,710
with larger groups so we we can identify
ourselves you know with a family we can

2820
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
ourselves you know with a family we can
 

2821
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,710
ourselves you know with a family we can
identify ourselves with a country to

2822
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:20,720
identify ourselves with a country to
 

2823
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,390
identify ourselves with a country to
such an extent that people are willing

2824
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:22,400
such an extent that people are willing
 

2825
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,330
such an extent that people are willing
to give away their life for country

2826
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:24,340
to give away their life for country
 

2827
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,430
to give away their life for country

so there is we are wired actually even

2830
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:28,160
so there is we are wired actually even
 

2831
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,030
so there is we are wired actually even
uh

2832
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:29,040
uh
 

2833
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,390
uh
for love and at the moment i guess

2834
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
for love and at the moment i guess
 

2835
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,470
for love and at the moment i guess
the

2836
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:34,480
the
 

2837
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,349
the
maybe

2838
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:35,359
maybe
 

2839
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,270
maybe
it would be somewhat more beneficial if

2840
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:37,280
it would be somewhat more beneficial if
 

2841
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,510
it would be somewhat more beneficial if
you will if we would identify ourselves

2842
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:39,520
you will if we would identify ourselves
 

2843
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,069
you will if we would identify ourselves
with all the humanity as a whole so so

2844
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:42,079
with all the humanity as a whole so so
 

2845
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,829
with all the humanity as a whole so so
you can clearly see when people travel

2846
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
you can clearly see when people travel
 

2847
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,430
you can clearly see when people travel
around the world when they run into

2848
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
around the world when they run into
 

2849
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,990
around the world when they run into
person from the same country they say oh

2850
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
person from the same country they say oh
 

2851
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,829
person from the same country they say oh
which ctr and all this like all of a

2852
00:51:49,829 --> 00:51:49,839
which ctr and all this like all of a
 

2853
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:51,990
which ctr and all this like all of a
sudden they find all these similarities

2854
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,000
sudden they find all these similarities
 

2855
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,630
sudden they find all these similarities
they they they find some they befriend

2856
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
they they they find some they befriend
 

2857
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,030
they they they find some they befriend
those folks earlier than others so there

2858
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
those folks earlier than others so there
 

2859
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,549
those folks earlier than others so there
is like a sense some sense of the

2860
00:51:58,549 --> 00:51:58,559
is like a sense some sense of the
 

2861
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,549
is like a sense some sense of the
belonging and i would say i think it

2862
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:00,559
belonging and i would say i think it
 

2863
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,190
belonging and i would say i think it
would be overall good thing to the word

2864
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:03,200
would be overall good thing to the word
 

2865
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,470
would be overall good thing to the word
for people

2866
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
for people
 

2867
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,270
for people
to

2868
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
to
 

2869
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,030
to
move towards

2870
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:07,040
move towards
 

2871
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,390
move towards
i think it's even called open

2872
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:08,400
i think it's even called open
 

2873
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,829
i think it's even called open
individualism and move toward the

2874
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
individualism and move toward the
 

2875
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,549
individualism and move toward the
mindset of a larger and larger groups so

2876
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:14,559
mindset of a larger and larger groups so
 

2877
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,390
mindset of a larger and larger groups so
the challenge there

2878
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:16,400
the challenge there
 

2879
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,309
the challenge there
that's a beautiful vision and i share it

2880
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:18,319
that's a beautiful vision and i share it
 

2881
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:21,190
that's a beautiful vision and i share it
to expand that circle of empathy that

2882
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:21,200
to expand that circle of empathy that
 

2883
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,030
to expand that circle of empathy that
circle of love towards the entirety of

2884
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,040
circle of love towards the entirety of
 

2885
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,349
circle of love towards the entirety of
humanity but then you start to ask well

2886
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:25,359
humanity but then you start to ask well
 

2887
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,270
humanity but then you start to ask well
where do you draw the line

2888
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,280
where do you draw the line
 

2889
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,270
where do you draw the line
because why not expand it to other

2890
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:29,280
because why not expand it to other
 

2891
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,309
because why not expand it to other
conscious beings and then at the finally

2892
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:32,319
conscious beings and then at the finally
 

2893
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,230
conscious beings and then at the finally
for our discussion

2894
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:34,240
for our discussion
 

2895
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,829
for our discussion
something i think about

2896
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:35,839
something i think about
 

2897
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,349
something i think about
is why not expand it to ai systems

2898
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
is why not expand it to ai systems
 

2899
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,510
is why not expand it to ai systems
like we we start respecting each other

2900
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:41,520
like we we start respecting each other
 

2901
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,069
like we we start respecting each other
when the other the person the entity on

2902
00:52:44,069 --> 00:52:44,079
when the other the person the entity on
 

2903
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,670
when the other the person the entity on
the other side

2904
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
the other side
 

2905
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,910
the other side
has the capacity to suffer because then

2906
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:47,920
has the capacity to suffer because then
 

2907
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,630
has the capacity to suffer because then
we develop a capacity to sort of

2908
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:50,640
we develop a capacity to sort of
 

2909
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,309
we develop a capacity to sort of
empathize

2910
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:52,319
empathize
 

2911
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,270
empathize
and so

2912
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,280
and so
 

2913
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,950
and so
i could see ai systems that are

2914
00:52:54,950 --> 00:52:54,960
i could see ai systems that are
 

2915
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,870
i could see ai systems that are
interacting with humans

2916
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:56,880
interacting with humans
 

2917
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,150
interacting with humans
more and more having conscious like

2918
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:00,160
more and more having conscious like
 

2919
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,349
more and more having conscious like
displays

2920
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:01,359
displays
 

2921
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,510
displays
so like they display consciousness

2922
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:03,520
so like they display consciousness
 

2923
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,750
so like they display consciousness
through language and through other means

2924
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:05,760
through language and through other means
 

2925
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,150
through language and through other means
and so then the question is like well is

2926
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:08,160
and so then the question is like well is
 

2927
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,750
and so then the question is like well is
that consciousness

2928
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:09,760
that consciousness
 

2929
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,910
that consciousness
because they're acting conscious

2930
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:11,920
because they're acting conscious
 

2931
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,190
because they're acting conscious
and so

2932
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:13,200
and so
 

2933
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,349
and so
you know the reason we don't like

2934
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:15,359
you know the reason we don't like
 

2935
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,829
you know the reason we don't like
torturing animals

2936
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:17,839
torturing animals
 

2937
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,190
torturing animals
is because

2938
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:19,200
is because
 

2939
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,710
is because
they look like they're suffering when

2940
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:20,720
they look like they're suffering when
 

2941
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,390
they look like they're suffering when
they're tortured

2942
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:22,400
they're tortured
 

2943
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,549
they're tortured
and if ai looks like it's suffering

2944
00:53:26,549 --> 00:53:26,559
and if ai looks like it's suffering
 

2945
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,190
and if ai looks like it's suffering
when it's tortured

2946
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:29,200
when it's tortured
 

2947
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,230
when it's tortured
how is that not

2948
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:32,240

 

2949
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,390

requiring of the same kind of empathy

2950
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:34,400
requiring of the same kind of empathy
 

2951
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,270
requiring of the same kind of empathy
from us and respect and rights

2952
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:37,280
from us and respect and rights
 

2953
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,270
from us and respect and rights
that animals do and other humans do i

2954
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:39,280
that animals do and other humans do i
 

2955
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,190
that animals do and other humans do i
think it requires empathy as well i mean

2956
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:41,200
think it requires empathy as well i mean
 

2957
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,390
think it requires empathy as well i mean
i would like

2958
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
i would like
 

2959
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,870
i would like
i guess us or humanity or so make a

2960
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,880
i guess us or humanity or so make a
 

2961
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,549
i guess us or humanity or so make a
progress in

2962
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
progress in
 

2963
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,069
progress in
understanding what consciousness is

2964
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:48,079
understanding what consciousness is
 

2965
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,990
understanding what consciousness is
because i don't want just to be speaking

2966
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,000
because i don't want just to be speaking
 

2967
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,150
because i don't want just to be speaking
about that the philosophy but rather

2968
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:52,160
about that the philosophy but rather
 

2969
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,270
about that the philosophy but rather
actually make a scientific uh to have a

2970
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:55,280
actually make a scientific uh to have a
 

2971
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,030
actually make a scientific uh to have a
like a you know there was a time that

2972
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:57,040
like a you know there was a time that
 

2973
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,390
like a you know there was a time that
people thought that

2974
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:58,400
people thought that
 

2975
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,150
people thought that
there is a force

2976
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:00,160
there is a force
 

2977
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,190
there is a force
of life

2978
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:01,200
of life
 

2979
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,390
of life
and

2980
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,400
and
 

2981
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,109
and
the

2982
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:03,119
the
 

2983
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,109
the
things that have this force they are

2984
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:05,119
things that have this force they are
 

2985
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,950
things that have this force they are
alive

2986
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:06,960
alive
 

2987
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,150
alive
and

2988
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:08,160
and
 

2989
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,470
and
i think that there is actually a path to

2990
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
i think that there is actually a path to
 

2991
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,670
i think that there is actually a path to
understand exactly what consciousness is

2992
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:13,680
understand exactly what consciousness is
 

2993
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,270
understand exactly what consciousness is
and

2994
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
and
 

2995
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,069
and
um in some sense it might require

2996
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
um in some sense it might require
 

2997
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,309
um in some sense it might require
essentially putting probes inside of a

2998
00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:20,319
essentially putting probes inside of a
 

2999
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,750
essentially putting probes inside of a
human brain

3000
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:21,760
human brain
 

3001
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,190
human brain
what neuralink

3002
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:23,200
what neuralink
 

3003
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,950
what neuralink
does so the goal there i mean there's

3004
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:24,960
does so the goal there i mean there's
 

3005
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,470
does so the goal there i mean there's
several things with consciousness that

3006
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:26,480
several things with consciousness that
 

3007
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,270
several things with consciousness that
make it a real discipline which is one

3008
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:29,280
make it a real discipline which is one
 

3009
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,309
make it a real discipline which is one
is rigorous measurement of consciousness

3010
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,319
is rigorous measurement of consciousness
 

3011
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,910
is rigorous measurement of consciousness
and then the other is the engineering of

3012
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:33,920
and then the other is the engineering of
 

3013
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,589
and then the other is the engineering of
consciousness which may or may not be

3014
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:35,599
consciousness which may or may not be
 

3015
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,150
consciousness which may or may not be
related i mean you could also run into

3016
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,160
related i mean you could also run into
 

3017
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,309
related i mean you could also run into
trouble like for example in the united

3018
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:40,319
trouble like for example in the united
 

3019
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,349
trouble like for example in the united
states

3020
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:41,359
states
 

3021
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,670
states
for the department d.o.t department of

3022
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:43,680
for the department d.o.t department of
 

3023
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,069
for the department d.o.t department of
transportation and a lot of different

3024
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:46,079
transportation and a lot of different
 

3025
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:48,549
transportation and a lot of different
places put a value on human life

3026
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:48,559
places put a value on human life
 

3027
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,150
places put a value on human life
i think dot's

3028
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:50,160
i think dot's
 

3029
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,470
i think dot's
uh values nine million dollars per

3030
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
uh values nine million dollars per
 

3031
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,150
uh values nine million dollars per
person

3032
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:54,160
person
 

3033
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,829
person
sort of in that same way you can get

3034
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:55,839
sort of in that same way you can get
 

3035
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,750
sort of in that same way you can get
into trouble

3036
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:57,760
into trouble
 

3037
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,829
into trouble
if you put a number on how conscious a

3038
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
if you put a number on how conscious a
 

3039
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,950
if you put a number on how conscious a
being is

3040
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:00,960
being is
 

3041
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,349
being is
because then you can start making policy

3042
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:03,359
because then you can start making policy
 

3043
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,270
because then you can start making policy
if a cow

3044
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:05,280
if a cow
 

3045
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,990
if a cow
is uh 0.1

3046
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,000
is uh 0.1
 

3047
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,910
is uh 0.1
or like um

3048
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:09,920
or like um
 

3049
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,630
or like um
10 as conscious as a human then you can

3050
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
10 as conscious as a human then you can
 

3051
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,549
10 as conscious as a human then you can
start making calculations and might get

3052
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:14,559
start making calculations and might get
 

3053
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:15,990
start making calculations and might get
you into trouble but then again that

3054
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:16,000
you into trouble but then again that
 

3055
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,789
you into trouble but then again that
might be a very good way to do it

3056
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:18,799
might be a very good way to do it
 

3057
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,710
might be a very good way to do it
i would like uh

3058
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:20,720
i would like uh
 

3059
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,630
i would like uh
to move to that place that actually we

3060
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
to move to that place that actually we
 

3061
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,910
to move to that place that actually we
have scientific understanding what

3062
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:23,920
have scientific understanding what
 

3063
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,910
have scientific understanding what
consciousness is yeah and then we'll be

3064
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:25,920
consciousness is yeah and then we'll be
 

3065
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,829
consciousness is yeah and then we'll be
able to actually assign value and i

3066
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:27,839
able to actually assign value and i
 

3067
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,069
able to actually assign value and i
believe that there is even the path for

3068
00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:30,079
believe that there is even the path for
 

3069
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:35,349
believe that there is even the path for
the experimentation in it so uh you know

3070
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:35,359
the experimentation in it so uh you know
 

3071
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,910
the experimentation in it so uh you know
we said that you know you could put the

3072
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
we said that you know you could put the
 

3073
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,750
we said that you know you could put the
probes inside of the brain there is

3074
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:39,760
probes inside of the brain there is
 

3075
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,150
probes inside of the brain there is
actually few other things that you could

3076
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,160
actually few other things that you could
 

3077
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,789
actually few other things that you could
do with devices like neuralink so you

3078
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:44,799
do with devices like neuralink so you
 

3079
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,710
do with devices like neuralink so you
could imagine that the way even to

3080
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:46,720
could imagine that the way even to
 

3081
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,430
could imagine that the way even to
measure if ai system is conscious

3082
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:49,440
measure if ai system is conscious
 

3083
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,670
measure if ai system is conscious
is by literally just plugging into the

3084
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:51,680
is by literally just plugging into the
 

3085
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,950
is by literally just plugging into the
brain

3086
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:52,960
brain
 

3087
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,390
brain
and i mean that that seems that's kind

3088
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:54,400
and i mean that that seems that's kind
 

3089
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,870
and i mean that that seems that's kind
of easy but the plugging into the brain

3090
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:56,880
of easy but the plugging into the brain
 

3091
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,630
of easy but the plugging into the brain
and asking person if they feel that

3092
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:58,640
and asking person if they feel that
 

3093
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,870
and asking person if they feel that
their consciousness expanded

3094
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:00,880
their consciousness expanded
 

3095
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,950
their consciousness expanded
this direction of course has some issues

3096
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:02,960
this direction of course has some issues
 

3097
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,630
this direction of course has some issues
you can say you know if someone takes a

3098
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:04,640
you can say you know if someone takes a
 

3099
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,390
you can say you know if someone takes a
psychedelic drug they might feel that

3100
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:06,400
psychedelic drug they might feel that
 

3101
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,470
psychedelic drug they might feel that
their consciousness expanded even though

3102
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:08,480
their consciousness expanded even though
 

3103
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,030
their consciousness expanded even though
that drug itself is not conscious

3104
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:11,040
that drug itself is not conscious
 

3105
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,190
that drug itself is not conscious
right so like you can't fully trust the

3106
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:13,200
right so like you can't fully trust the
 

3107
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,910
right so like you can't fully trust the
self-report of a person saying their

3108
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:15,920
self-report of a person saying their
 

3109
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,390
self-report of a person saying their
their consciousness is expanded or not

3110
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:20,400

 

3111
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,510

let me ask you a little bit about

3112
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:21,520
let me ask you a little bit about
 

3113
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,349
let me ask you a little bit about
psychedelics because uh there's been a

3114
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:23,359
psychedelics because uh there's been a
 

3115
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,430
psychedelics because uh there's been a
lot of excellent research on uh

3116
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:25,440
lot of excellent research on uh
 

3117
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,069
lot of excellent research on uh
different psychedelics psilocybin mdma

3118
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
different psychedelics psilocybin mdma
 

3119
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,549
different psychedelics psilocybin mdma
yeah even dmt

3120
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:30,559
yeah even dmt
 

3121
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,349
yeah even dmt
drugs in general marijuana too

3122
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:33,359
drugs in general marijuana too
 

3123
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,589
drugs in general marijuana too
uh what do you think psychedelics do to

3124
00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:35,599
uh what do you think psychedelics do to
 

3125
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,470
uh what do you think psychedelics do to
the human mind it seems they take

3126
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:38,480
the human mind it seems they take
 

3127
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,309
the human mind it seems they take
the human mind to some interesting

3128
00:56:40,309 --> 00:56:40,319
the human mind to some interesting
 

3129
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:41,829
the human mind to some interesting
places

3130
00:56:41,829 --> 00:56:41,839
places
 

3131
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,470
places
is that just a little uh hack

3132
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:44,480
is that just a little uh hack
 

3133
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,069
is that just a little uh hack
a visual hack

3134
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,079
a visual hack
 

3135
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,069
a visual hack
or is there some profound expansion of

3136
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:48,079
or is there some profound expansion of
 

3137
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,349
or is there some profound expansion of
the mind

3138
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:49,359
the mind
 

3139
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,230
the mind
so let's see i i don't believe in magic

3140
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:52,240
so let's see i i don't believe in magic
 

3141
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,430
so let's see i i don't believe in magic
i believe in that i believe in

3142
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,440
i believe in that i believe in
 

3143
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,270
i believe in that i believe in
in science in

3144
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:57,280
in science in
 

3145
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,750
in science in
in causality

3146
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
in causality
 

3147
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,990
in causality
still let's say and then as i said like

3148
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:02,000
still let's say and then as i said like
 

3149
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,870
still let's say and then as i said like
i think that the brain

3150
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:04,880
i think that the brain
 

3151
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,109
i think that the brain
that the our subjective experience of

3152
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:07,119
that the our subjective experience of
 

3153
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,069
that the our subjective experience of
reality is uh

3154
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:10,079
reality is uh
 

3155
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,230
reality is uh
we live in the simulation run by our

3156
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
we live in the simulation run by our
 

3157
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,309
we live in the simulation run by our
brain and the simulation that our brain

3158
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:14,319
brain and the simulation that our brain
 

3159
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,190
brain and the simulation that our brain
runs

3160
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:15,200
runs
 

3161
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,270
runs
they can be very pleasant or very

3162
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:17,280
they can be very pleasant or very
 

3163
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,109
they can be very pleasant or very
hellish

3164
00:57:19,109 --> 00:57:19,119
hellish
 

3165
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,270
hellish
drugs they are changing some hyper

3166
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:21,280
drugs they are changing some hyper
 

3167
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,430
drugs they are changing some hyper
parameters of the simulation it is

3168
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
parameters of the simulation it is
 

3169
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,430
parameters of the simulation it is
possible thanks to change of these hyper

3170
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:25,440
possible thanks to change of these hyper
 

3171
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,309
possible thanks to change of these hyper
parameters to actually look back on your

3172
00:57:28,309 --> 00:57:28,319
parameters to actually look back on your
 

3173
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,390
parameters to actually look back on your
experience and even see that the given

3174
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:30,400
experience and even see that the given
 

3175
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,750
experience and even see that the given
things that we took for granted they are

3176
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
things that we took for granted they are
 

3177
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,430
things that we took for granted they are
changeable

3178
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:35,440
changeable
 

3179
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,750
changeable
so they allow to have a

3180
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:37,760
so they allow to have a
 

3181
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,470
so they allow to have a
amazing perspective there is also

3182
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:40,480
amazing perspective there is also
 

3183
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,950
amazing perspective there is also
for instance the fact that after dmt

3184
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:42,960
for instance the fact that after dmt
 

3185
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,950
for instance the fact that after dmt
people can see the

3186
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
people can see the
 

3187
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,589
people can see the
full movie inside of their head

3188
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
full movie inside of their head
 

3189
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,470
full movie inside of their head
gives me further belief

3190
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:50,480
gives me further belief
 

3191
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,390
gives me further belief
that the brain can generate that full

3192
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:52,400
that the brain can generate that full
 

3193
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,510
that the brain can generate that full
movie that the brain is actually

3194
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:55,520
movie that the brain is actually
 

3195
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,750
movie that the brain is actually
learning the model of reality to such

3196
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:57,760
learning the model of reality to such
 

3197
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,430
learning the model of reality to such
extent that it tries to predict what's

3198
00:57:59,430 --> 00:57:59,440
extent that it tries to predict what's
 

3199
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,190
extent that it tries to predict what's
going to happen next yeah very high

3200
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:01,200
going to happen next yeah very high
 

3201
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,349
going to happen next yeah very high
resolution so it can replay realities

3202
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:03,359
resolution so it can replay realities
 

3203
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,069
resolution so it can replay realities
actually extremely high resolution

3204
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:06,079
actually extremely high resolution
 

3205
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:08,390
actually extremely high resolution
and it's also kind of interesting to me

3206
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
and it's also kind of interesting to me
 

3207
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,630
and it's also kind of interesting to me
that somehow there seems to be some

3208
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:10,640
that somehow there seems to be some
 

3209
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,430
that somehow there seems to be some
similarity between

3210
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:13,440
similarity between
 

3211
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,950
similarity between
these uh drugs and meditation itself and

3212
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:16,960
these uh drugs and meditation itself and
 

3213
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,109
these uh drugs and meditation itself and
i actually started even these days to

3214
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:19,119
i actually started even these days to
 

3215
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,230
i actually started even these days to
think about meditation as a psychedelic

3216
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:22,240
think about meditation as a psychedelic
 

3217
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,470
think about meditation as a psychedelic
and do you practice meditation

3218
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:24,480
and do you practice meditation
 

3219
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,270
and do you practice meditation
i i practice meditation i mean i once

3220
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:27,280
i i practice meditation i mean i once
 

3221
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,789
i i practice meditation i mean i once
few times on the

3222
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:28,799
few times on the
 

3223
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,910
few times on the
retreats and it feels after like after

3224
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:31,920
retreats and it feels after like after
 

3225
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:37,349
retreats and it feels after like after
second or third day of meditation

3226
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:37,359

 

3227
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,670

there is a there is almost like a sense

3228
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:39,680
there is a there is almost like a sense
 

3229
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,670
there is a there is almost like a sense
of you know tripping

3230
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:41,680
of you know tripping
 

3231
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,710
of you know tripping
what does the meditation retreat entail

3232
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
what does the meditation retreat entail
 

3233
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,990
what does the meditation retreat entail
so

3234
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,000
so
 

3235
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,390
so
i mean you you wake up early in the

3236
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:48,400
i mean you you wake up early in the
 

3237
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,870
i mean you you wake up early in the
morning and you meditate for extended

3238
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
morning and you meditate for extended
 

3239
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,390
morning and you meditate for extended
period of time

3240
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:52,400
period of time
 

3241
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,390
period of time
and alone

3242
00:58:54,390 --> 00:58:54,400
and alone
 

3243
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,470
and alone
yeah so it's optimized even though there

3244
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:56,480
yeah so it's optimized even though there
 

3245
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,030
yeah so it's optimized even though there
are other people it's optimized for

3246
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,040
are other people it's optimized for
 

3247
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,349
are other people it's optimized for
isolation so you don't speak with anyone

3248
00:59:01,349 --> 00:59:01,359
isolation so you don't speak with anyone
 

3249
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:02,710
isolation so you don't speak with anyone
you don't actually look into other

3250
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:02,720
you don't actually look into other
 

3251
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,549
you don't actually look into other
people's eyes

3252
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:04,559
people's eyes
 

3253
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:05,750
people's eyes
and

3254
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
and
 

3255
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,950
and
you know you sit on the chair and

3256
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:08,960
you know you sit on the chair and
 

3257
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,069
you know you sit on the chair and
say the passage meditation tells you uh

3258
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:12,079
say the passage meditation tells you uh
 

3259
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,670
say the passage meditation tells you uh
to focus on the breath so you try to put

3260
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:15,680
to focus on the breath so you try to put
 

3261
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,030
to focus on the breath so you try to put
all the all attention into breathing and

3262
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:19,040
all the all attention into breathing and
 

3263
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,870
all the all attention into breathing and
breathing in and breathing out

3264
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:20,880
breathing in and breathing out
 

3265
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,750
breathing in and breathing out
and the

3266
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:21,760
and the
 

3267
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,030
and the
crazy thing is that as you focus

3268
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:25,040
crazy thing is that as you focus
 

3269
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,549
crazy thing is that as you focus
attention like that

3270
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:26,559
attention like that
 

3271
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,470
attention like that
after some time

3272
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:28,480
after some time
 

3273
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,549
after some time
their stamps starts coming back like

3274
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:30,559
their stamps starts coming back like
 

3275
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:31,670
their stamps starts coming back like
some

3276
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
some
 

3277
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,390
some
memories that you completely forgotten

3278
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:34,400
memories that you completely forgotten
 

3279
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,349
memories that you completely forgotten
it almost feels like um that you have a

3280
00:59:37,349 --> 00:59:37,359
it almost feels like um that you have a
 

3281
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,510
it almost feels like um that you have a
mailbox and then you

3282
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:39,520
mailbox and then you
 

3283
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,670
mailbox and then you
you know you are just like a archiving

3284
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:41,680
you know you are just like a archiving
 

3285
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,589
you know you are just like a archiving
email one by one

3286
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:43,599
email one by one
 

3287
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,829

3361
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,230
somehow the extended meditation takes
you to the space that they are

it almost feels that the we are
constantly getting a little bit of a

3376
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:26,720
constantly getting a little bit of a
 

3377
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,549
constantly getting a little bit of a
reward function and we are just

3378
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:28,559
reward function and we are just
 

3379
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,150
reward function and we are just
spreading this reward function on

3380
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160
spreading this reward function on
 

3381
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:33,910
spreading this reward function on
various activities but if you stay still

3382
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:33,920
various activities but if you stay still
 

3383
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,430
various activities but if you stay still
for extended period of time it kind of

3384
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:35,440
for extended period of time it kind of
 

3385
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,510
for extended period of time it kind of
accumulates accumulates accumulates

3386
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:37,520
accumulates accumulates accumulates
 

3387

accumulates accumulates accumulates
and

3388
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:38,880
and
 

3389
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,430
and
there is a there is a sense there is a

sense that at some point it passes some
 

3393
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,109
sense that at some point it passes some
threshold and it feels as

3394
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:47,119
threshold and it feels as
 

3395
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,829
threshold and it feels as
drop is falling into kind of ocean of

3396
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:49,839
drop is falling into kind of ocean of
 

3397
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,750
drop is falling into kind of ocean of
love and bliss and that's like a

3398
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:51,760
love and bliss and that's like a
 

3399
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,349
love and bliss and that's like a
this is like a very pleasant and as i'm

3400
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:53,359
this is like a very pleasant and as i'm
 

3401
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,029
this is like a very pleasant and as i'm
saying okay

3402
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:55,039
saying okay
 

3403
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:56,870
saying okay
that corresponds to the subjective

3404
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:56,880
that corresponds to the subjective
 

3405
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,069
that corresponds to the subjective
experience

3406
01:01:58,069 --> 01:01:58,079
experience
 

3407
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,190
experience
some people

3408
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
some people
 

3409
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,270
some people
uh i guess in spiritual community they

3410
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:03,280
uh i guess in spiritual community they
 

3411
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,750
uh i guess in spiritual community they
describe it that that's the reality and

3412
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:05,760
describe it that that's the reality and
 

3413
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,349
describe it that that's the reality and
i would say i believe that they're like

3414
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:07,359
i would say i believe that they're like
 

3415
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,349
i would say i believe that they're like
all sorts of subjective experience that

3416
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,359
all sorts of subjective experience that
 

3417
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,910
all sorts of subjective experience that
one can have and

3418
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:11,920
one can have and
 

3419
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,910
one can have and
i believe that for instance meditation

3420
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:13,920
i believe that for instance meditation
 

3421
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,430
i believe that for instance meditation
might take you to the subjective

3422
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
might take you to the subjective
 

3423
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,870
might take you to the subjective
experiences which are very pleasant

3424
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:16,880
experiences which are very pleasant

01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,270
experiences which are very pleasant
collaborative and i would like a word to

3426
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,280
collaborative and i would like a word to
 

3427
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,630
collaborative and i would like a word to
move toward a more collaborative uh

3428
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
move toward a more collaborative uh
 

3429
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,630
move toward a more collaborative uh
place

3430
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:24,640
place
 

3431
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,549
place
yeah i would say that's very pleasant

3432
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:26,559
yeah i would say that's very pleasant
 

3433

3435
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,829
that i enjoy doing stuff like that i i
i wonder how that maps to your uh

3436
01:02:31,829 --> 01:02:31,839
i wonder how that maps to your uh
 

3437
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:34,710
i wonder how that maps to your uh
mathematical model of love with the

3438
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:34,720
mathematical model of love with the
 

3439
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,549
mathematical model of love with the
the reward function combining a bunch of

3440
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:36,559
the reward function combining a bunch of
 

3441
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:37,829
the reward function combining a bunch of
things

3442
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:37,839
things
 

3443
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:41,190
things
it seems like our life

3444

it seems like our life
 

3445
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,430
it seems like our life
then is we're just we have this reward

3446
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:43,440
then is we're just we have this reward
 

3447
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,510
then is we're just we have this reward
function and we're accumulating a bunch

3448
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:45,520
function and we're accumulating a bunch
 

3449
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,029
function and we're accumulating a bunch
of stuff in it

3450
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,039
of stuff in it
 

3451
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,950
of stuff in it

but uh in terms of the it's interesting

3774
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,080
but uh in terms of the it's interesting
 

3775
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,189
but uh in terms of the it's interesting
to me because

thinker in the space of machine learning

3784
01:08:59,110 --> 01:08:59,120
thinker in the space of machine learning
 

3785
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,510

like intuition like digging deep

3786
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:01,520
like intuition like digging deep
 

3787
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,749
like intuition like digging deep
in what works

3788
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:03,759
in what works
 

3789
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,470
in what works
what doesn't why it works why it doesn't

3790
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
what doesn't why it works why it doesn't
 

3791
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,189
what doesn't why it works why it doesn't
and so is ilia i'm wondering if there's

3792
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:09,199
and so is ilia i'm wondering if there's
 

3793
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:10,630
and so is ilia i'm wondering if there's
interesting

3794
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:10,640
interesting
 

3795
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,390
interesting
deep discussions you've had with him in

3796
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:12,400
deep discussions you've had with him in
 

3797
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,390
deep discussions you've had with him in
the past or disagreements that were very

3798
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400
the past or disagreements that were very
 

3799
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,349
the past or disagreements that were very
productive so i can say

3800
01:09:17,349 --> 01:09:17,359
productive so i can say
 

3801
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,590
productive so i can say
i also understood over the time where

3802
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:19,600
i also understood over the time where
 

3803
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,390
i also understood over the time where
are

3804
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:20,400
are
 

3805
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,149
are
my strengths so obviously we have plenty

3806
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:22,159
my strengths so obviously we have plenty
 

3807
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:25,430
my strengths so obviously we have plenty
of ai discussions and

3808
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
of ai discussions and
 

3809
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,709
of ai discussions and
um

3810
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:26,719
um
 

3811
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,470
um
and you know i myself have plenty of

3812
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:28,480
and you know i myself have plenty of
 

3813
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,669
and you know i myself have plenty of
ideas but like i consider ilya

3814
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:31,679
ideas but like i consider ilya
 

3815
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,149
ideas but like i consider ilya
one of the most prolific ai scientists

3816
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:34,159
one of the most prolific ai scientists
 

3817
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:35,669
one of the most prolific ai scientists
in the entire world

3818
01:09:35,669 --> 01:09:35,679
in the entire world
 

3819
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:36,470
in the entire world
and

3820
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:36,480
and
 

3821
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,669
and
i think that

3822
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:37,679
i think that
 

3823
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:41,269
i think that
um i realized that maybe my super skill

3824
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:41,279
um i realized that maybe my super skill
 

3825
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:42,550
um i realized that maybe my super skill
is

3826
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:42,560
is
 

3827
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,990
is
being able to bring people to

3828
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:44,000
being able to bring people to
 

3829
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,669
being able to bring people to
collaborate together that i have some

3830
01:09:45,669 --> 01:09:45,679
collaborate together that i have some
 

3831
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,630
collaborate together that i have some
level of empathy that is unique in ai

3832
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:48,640
level of empathy that is unique in ai
 

3833
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,030
level of empathy that is unique in ai
world and that might come you know from

3834
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:51,040
world and that might come you know from
 

3835
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,510
world and that might come you know from
either meditation psychedelics or let's

3836
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:53,520
either meditation psychedelics or let's
 

3837
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,189
either meditation psychedelics or let's
say i read just hundreds of books on

3838
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:55,199
say i read just hundreds of books on
 

3839
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:57,430
say i read just hundreds of books on
this topic so and i also went through a

3840
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:57,440
this topic so and i also went through a
 

3841
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,830
this topic so and i also went through a
journey of you know i develop all sorts

3842
01:09:59,830 --> 01:09:59,840
journey of you know i develop all sorts
 

3843
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,110
journey of you know i develop all sorts
of algorithms so i think that

3844
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:03,120
of algorithms so i think that
 

3845
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,870
of algorithms so i think that
maybe i can

3846
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:04,880
maybe i can
 

3847
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,310
maybe i can
that's my

3848
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:06,320
that's my
 

3849
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,630
that's my
super human skill uh

3850
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:08,640
super human skill uh
 

3851
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,070
super human skill uh
ilia is

3852
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,080
ilia is
 

3853
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,030
ilia is
one of the best ai scientists but then

3854
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,040
one of the best ai scientists but then
 

3855
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,669
one of the best ai scientists but then
i'm pretty good in assembling teams and

3856
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:15,679
i'm pretty good in assembling teams and
 

3857
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,669
i'm pretty good in assembling teams and
i'm also not holding two people like i'm

3858
01:10:17,669 --> 01:10:17,679
i'm also not holding two people like i'm
 

3859
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,270
i'm also not holding two people like i'm
growing people and then people become

3860
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:19,280
growing people and then people become
 

3861
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,510
growing people and then people become
managers that open yeah there's room any

3862
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
managers that open yeah there's room any
 

3863
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,590
managers that open yeah there's room any
of them like a research manager

3864
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:23,600
of them like a research manager
 

3865
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,070
of them like a research manager
so you you find

3866
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:26,080
so you you find
 

3867
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,990
so you you find
you find places where you're excellent

3868
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:28,000
you find places where you're excellent
 

3869
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,870
you find places where you're excellent
and and he finds like his his deep

3870
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:30,880
and and he finds like his his deep
 

3871

you find ways you can

3874
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,120
you find ways you can
 

3875
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,950
you find ways you can
the puzzle pieces fit together correct

3876

the puzzle pieces fit together correct
 

3877
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,709
the puzzle pieces fit together correct
okay you know ultimately for instance

3878
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:38,719
okay you know ultimately for instance
 

3879
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,910

let's say ilia he doesn't manage people

3880
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:41,920
let's say ilia he doesn't manage people
 

3881
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,590
let's say ilia he doesn't manage people
uh that's not

3882
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:43,600
uh that's not
 

3883
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,149
uh that's not
what he likes or so um

3884
01:10:46,149 --> 01:10:46,159
what he likes or so um
 

3885

about people oh interesting okay

3890
01:10:53,189 --> 01:10:53,199
about people oh interesting okay
 

3891
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:55,669
about people oh interesting okay
okay cool so that that fits perfectly

3892
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:55,679
okay cool so that that fits perfectly
 

3893
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,149
okay cool so that that fits perfectly
together but i i mean uh i also just

can evolve a model for pedestrians like

3920
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:27,440
can evolve a model for pedestrians like
 

3921
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,950
can evolve a model for pedestrians like
through self-play all that kind of

01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,709
yeah the the limits of the
that the human intellect might be

3938
01:11:46,709 --> 01:11:46,719
that the human intellect might be
 

3939
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,229
that the human intellect might be
limitless

3940
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
limitless
 

3941
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,310
limitless
or it's just impressive to see a descent

3942
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:50,320
or it's just impressive to see a descent
 

3943
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,630
or it's just impressive to see a descent
on the vape come up with clever ideas

3944
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:52,640
on the vape come up with clever ideas
 

3945
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,350
on the vape come up with clever ideas
yeah i mean so even in the space of deep

3946
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:55,360
yeah i mean so even in the space of deep
 

3947
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,350
yeah i mean so even in the space of deep
learning when you look at various people

3948
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:57,360
learning when you look at various people
 

3949
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,750
learning when you look at various people
there are people you know who

3950
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
there are people you know who
 

3951
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,350
there are people you know who
invented

3952
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360
invented
 

3953
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,990
invented
some breakthroughs once but there are

3954
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:04,000
some breakthroughs once but there are
 

3955
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,750
some breakthroughs once but there are
very few people who did it multiple

3956
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:05,760
very few people who did it multiple
 

3957
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,270
very few people who did it multiple
times and you can think if someone

3958
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,280
times and you can think if someone
 

3959
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,709
times and you can think if someone
invented it once

3960
01:12:08,709 --> 01:12:08,719
invented it once
 

3961
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,590
invented it once
that might be just a shared luck

3962
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:11,600
that might be just a shared luck
 

3963
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,510
that might be just a shared luck
and if someone invented it multiple

3964
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
and if someone invented it multiple
 

3965
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,110
and if someone invented it multiple
times you know if a probability of

3966
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:15,120
times you know if a probability of
 

3967
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,350
times you know if a probability of
inventing it once is one over a million

3968
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:17,360
inventing it once is one over a million
 

3969
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,030
inventing it once is one over a million
then probability of inventing it twice

3970
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:19,040
then probability of inventing it twice
 

3971
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,149
then probability of inventing it twice
or three times would be one over a

3972
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:20,159
or three times would be one over a
 

3973
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:21,350
or three times would be one over a
million square

3974
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:21,360
million square
 

3975
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,110
million square
or to the power of three

3976
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
or to the power of three
 

3977
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,350
or to the power of three
which which would be just impossible so

3978
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:25,360
which which would be just impossible so
 

3979
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,709
which which would be just impossible so
it literally means that it's it's given

3980
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:28,719
it literally means that it's it's given
 

3981
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,669
it literally means that it's it's given
that uh it's not the luck yeah and ilea

3982
01:12:31,669 --> 01:12:31,679
that uh it's not the luck yeah and ilea
 

3983
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:35,270
that uh it's not the luck yeah and ilea
is one of these few people who um

3984
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
is one of these few people who um
 

3985
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,669
is one of these few people who um
who have uh a lot of these inventions in

3986
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
who have uh a lot of these inventions in
 

3987
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,709
who have uh a lot of these inventions in
his arsenal it also feels that the

3988
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:40,719
his arsenal it also feels that the
 

3989
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,470
his arsenal it also feels that the
now for instance if you think about

3990
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:42,480
now for instance if you think about
 

3991
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,550
now for instance if you think about
folks like gauss or euler

3992
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:44,560
folks like gauss or euler
 

3993
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,390
folks like gauss or euler
and you know

3994
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,400
and you know
 

3995
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,110
and you know
at first they read a lot of books

3996
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,120
at first they read a lot of books
 

3997
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,510
at first they read a lot of books
and then they did thinking and then they

3998
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:51,520
and then they did thinking and then they
 

3999
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,830
and then they did thinking and then they
figure out math

4000
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:53,840
figure out math
 

4001
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,390
figure out math
and that's how it feels with ilya yeah

4002
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
and that's how it feels with ilya yeah
 

4003
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,070
and that's how it feels with ilya yeah
you know at first he read stuff and then

4004
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,080
you know at first he read stuff and then
 

4005
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,950
you know at first he read stuff and then
like he spent his thinking cycles

4006
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960
like he spent his thinking cycles
 

4007
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,709
like he spent his thinking cycles
and

4008
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:02,719
and
 

4009
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,590
and
that's a really good way to put it

4010
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:05,600
that's a really good way to put it
 

4011
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,240
that's a really good way to put it
when i talk to him

4012
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:07,250
when i talk to him

i see thinking
 

4019
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:14,310
i see thinking
he's actually thinking

4020
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:14,320
he's actually thinking
 

4021
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,070
he's actually thinking
like he makes me realize that there's

4022
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:16,080
like he makes me realize that there's
 

4023
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,149
like he makes me realize that there's
like deep thinking that the human mind

4024
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:18,159
like deep thinking that the human mind
 

4025
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,870
like deep thinking that the human mind
can do like most of us are not thinking

4026
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:20,880
can do like most of us are not thinking
 

4027
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,390
can do like most of us are not thinking
deeply

4028
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:22,400
deeply
 

4029
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,070
deeply
like you really have to put a lot of

4030
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:24,080
like you really have to put a lot of
 

4031
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,470
like you really have to put a lot of
effort to think deeply like i have to

4032
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:26,480
effort to think deeply like i have to
 

4033
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,950
effort to think deeply like i have to
really put myself in a place where i

4034
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:28,960
really put myself in a place where i
 

4035
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,790
really put myself in a place where i
think deeply about a problem it takes a

4036
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
think deeply about a problem it takes a
 

4037
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,110
think deeply about a problem it takes a
lot of effort it's like a it's like an

4038
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:33,120
lot of effort it's like a it's like an
 

4039
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,630
lot of effort it's like a it's like an
airplane taking off or something you

4040
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:34,640
airplane taking off or something you
 

4041
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,350
airplane taking off or something you
have to achieve deep focus he he's just

4042
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:37,360
have to achieve deep focus he he's just
 

4043
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,470
have to achieve deep focus he he's just
uh

4044
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480
uh
 

4045
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,990
uh
he's what is it

4046
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,000
he's what is it
 

4047
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,430
he's what is it
his brain is like a vertical takeoff

4048
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,440
his brain is like a vertical takeoff
 

4049
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,910
his brain is like a vertical takeoff
in terms of airplane analogy so it's

4050
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:45,920
in terms of airplane analogy so it's
 

4051
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,669
in terms of airplane analogy so it's
interesting but

4052
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
interesting but
 

4053
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,590
interesting but
it i mean cal newport talks about this

4054
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
it i mean cal newport talks about this
 

4055
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,830
it i mean cal newport talks about this
as ideas of deep work

4056
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:51,840
as ideas of deep work
 

4057
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,390
as ideas of deep work
it's you know most of us don't work much

4058
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:54,400
it's you know most of us don't work much
 

4059
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,470
it's you know most of us don't work much
at all in terms of like

4060
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:56,480
at all in terms of like
 

4061
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,550
at all in terms of like
like deeply think about particular

4062
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:58,560
like deeply think about particular
 

4063
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,870
like deeply think about particular
problems whether it's math engineering

4064
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:00,880
problems whether it's math engineering
 

4065
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,950
problems whether it's math engineering
all that kind of stuff

4066
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:02,960
all that kind of stuff
 

4067
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,110
all that kind of stuff
you want to go to that place often and

4068
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:05,120
you want to go to that place often and
 

4069
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,590
you want to go to that place often and
that's real hard work and some of us are

4070
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:07,600
that's real hard work and some of us are
 

4071
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,669
that's real hard work and some of us are
better than others at that so i think

4072
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
better than others at that so i think
 

4073
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,830
better than others at that so i think
that the big piece has to do with

4074
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:11,840
that the big piece has to do with
 

4075
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,669
that the big piece has to do with
actually even engineering your

4076
01:14:13,669 --> 01:14:13,679
actually even engineering your
 

4077
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,830
actually even engineering your
environment such that it's conducive to

4078
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:15,840
environment such that it's conducive to
 

4079
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,990
environment such that it's conducive to
that yeah so um

4080
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
that yeah so um
 

4081
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,430
that yeah so um
see both ilia and i uh on the frequent

4082
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
see both ilia and i uh on the frequent
 

4083
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,510
see both ilia and i uh on the frequent
basis we kind of disconnect ourselves

4084
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:23,520
basis we kind of disconnect ourselves
 

4085
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,910
basis we kind of disconnect ourselves
from the world in order to be able to do

4086
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:25,920
from the world in order to be able to do
 

4087
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,550
from the world in order to be able to do
extensive amount of thinking yes so ilia

4088
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:28,560
extensive amount of thinking yes so ilia
 

4089
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,990
extensive amount of thinking yes so ilia
usually

4090
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
usually
 

4091
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,590
usually
he just

4092
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:31,600
he just
 

4093
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,189
he just
leaves ipad

4094
01:14:33,189 --> 01:14:33,199
leaves ipad
 

4095
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,149
leaves ipad
at hand he loves his ipad

4096
01:14:36,149 --> 01:14:36,159
at hand he loves his ipad
 

4097

days to different location to airbnb i'm
turning off my phone

4106
01:14:45,270 --> 01:14:45,280
turning off my phone
 

4107
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,990
turning off my phone
and there is no access to me yeah

4108

that's extremely important for me to be
 

4113
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,590
that's extremely important for me to be
able to actually just formulate new

question

4132
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:12,239
question
 

4133
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:14,790
question
can you give an overview of what gpt 3

4134
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:14,800
can you give an overview of what gpt 3
 

4135
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,750
can you give an overview of what gpt 3
is

4136
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:15,760
is
 

4137
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,149
is
or like you say in your twitter bio gpt

4138
01:15:18,149 --> 01:15:18,159
or like you say in your twitter bio gpt
 

4139
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:20,310
or like you say in your twitter bio gpt
n plus one

4140
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,320
n plus one
 

4141
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,590
n plus one
how it works

4142
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:21,600
how it works
 

4143
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,950
how it works
and why it works so um gpt 3 is a

4144
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:26,960
and why it works so um gpt 3 is a
 

4145
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,430
and why it works so um gpt 3 is a
humongous neural network and let's

4146
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:29,440
humongous neural network and let's
 

4147
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,870
humongous neural network and let's
assume that we know what is neural

4148
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:30,880
assume that we know what is neural
 

4149
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,270
assume that we know what is neural
network okay by the definition

4150
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
network okay by the definition
 

4151
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,390
network okay by the definition
and it is trained on the entire internet

4152
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
and it is trained on the entire internet
 

4153
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,709
and it is trained on the entire internet
and just to predict

4154
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
and just to predict
 

4155
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:41,110
and just to predict
next word so let's say it sees part of

4156
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:41,120
next word so let's say it sees part of
 

4157
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,709
next word so let's say it sees part of
the uh article and it the only task that

4158
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:44,719
the uh article and it the only task that
 

4159
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,870
the uh article and it the only task that
it has at hand it is to say what would

4160
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,880
it has at hand it is to say what would
 

4161
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,870
it has at hand it is to say what would
be the next word uh what would be the

4162
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:48,880
be the next word uh what would be the
 

4163
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,070
be the next word uh what would be the
next word

4164
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:50,080
next word
 

4165
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,550
next word
and it becomes uh

4166
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:52,560
and it becomes uh
 

4167
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,229
and it becomes uh
really exceptional at the task of

4168
01:15:54,229 --> 01:15:54,239
really exceptional at the task of
 

4169
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,470
really exceptional at the task of
figuring out what's the next word so you

4170
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,480
figuring out what's the next word so you
 

4171
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,510
figuring out what's the next word so you
might ask

4172
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:57,520
might ask
 

4173
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,590
might ask
why would this be an important task why

4174
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:01,600
why would this be an important task why
 

4175
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,430
why would this be an important task why
would it be important to predict what's

4176
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:03,440
would it be important to predict what's
 

4177
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,870
would it be important to predict what's
the next word

4178
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:04,880
the next word
 

4179
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:07,669
the next word
and it turns out that a lot of problems

4180
01:16:07,669 --> 01:16:07,679
and it turns out that a lot of problems
 

4181
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,830
and it turns out that a lot of problems
uh can be formulated

4182
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:09,840
uh can be formulated
 

4183
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,630
uh can be formulated
uh

4184
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:10,640
uh
 

4185
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,510
uh
as a text completion problem so gpt is

4186
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
as a text completion problem so gpt is
 

4187
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,470
as a text completion problem so gpt is
purely uh learning to complete the text

4188
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,480
purely uh learning to complete the text
 

4189
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,070
purely uh learning to complete the text
and you could imagine for instance if

4190
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:18,080
and you could imagine for instance if
 

4191
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,870
and you could imagine for instance if
you are asking a question who is a

4192
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:20,880
you are asking a question who is a
 

4193
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,790
you are asking a question who is a
president of united states

4194
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:22,800
president of united states
 

4195
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,830
president of united states
then gpt can give you an answer to it

4196
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:25,840
then gpt can give you an answer to it
 

4197
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,990
then gpt can give you an answer to it
it turns out that many more things can

4198
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,000
it turns out that many more things can
 

4199
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,390
it turns out that many more things can
be formulated this way you can format

4200
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:30,400
be formulated this way you can format
 

4201
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,270
be formulated this way you can format
text

4202
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280
text
 

4203
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,950
text
in the way that you have sentence in

4204
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:32,960
in the way that you have sentence in
 

4205
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,470
in the way that you have sentence in
english

4206
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:34,480
english
 

4207
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,310
english
you make it even look like a some

4208
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:36,320
you make it even look like a some
 

4209
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,790
you make it even look like a some
content of a website uh elsewhere which

4210
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:38,800
content of a website uh elsewhere which
 

4211
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,229
content of a website uh elsewhere which
would be teaching people how to

4212
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:40,239
would be teaching people how to
 

4213
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,070
would be teaching people how to
translate things between languages so it

4214
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:42,080
translate things between languages so it
 

4215
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,229
translate things between languages so it
would be en colon

4216
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:44,239
would be en colon
 

4217
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:48,709
would be en colon
text in english fr colon and then you uh

4218
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:48,719
text in english fr colon and then you uh
 

4219
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,470
text in english fr colon and then you uh
and then you ask people and then you ask

4220
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:50,480
and then you ask people and then you ask
 

4221
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,790
and then you ask people and then you ask
model to to continue and it turns out

4222
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:52,800
model to to continue and it turns out
 

4223
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,189
model to to continue and it turns out
that the such a model is predicting

4224
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:55,199
that the such a model is predicting
 

4225
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,430
that the such a model is predicting
translation from english to french the

4226
01:16:57,430 --> 01:16:57,440
translation from english to french the
 

4227
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:00,310
translation from english to french the
crazy thing is that

4228
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:00,320
crazy thing is that
 

4229
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,590
crazy thing is that
this model

4230
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
this model
 

4231
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,910
this model
can be used for way more sophisticated

4232
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:03,920
can be used for way more sophisticated
 

4233
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,390
can be used for way more sophisticated
tasks so you can format text such that

4234
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:06,400
tasks so you can format text such that
 

4235
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,229
tasks so you can format text such that
it looks like a conversation between two

4236
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
it looks like a conversation between two
 

4237
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,709
it looks like a conversation between two
people and that might be a conversation

4238
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:10,719
people and that might be a conversation
 

4239
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:13,189
people and that might be a conversation
between you and elon musk and because

4240
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199
between you and elon musk and because
 

4241
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:15,669
between you and elon musk and because
the model read all the texts about elon

4242
01:17:15,669 --> 01:17:15,679
the model read all the texts about elon
 

4243
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:16,630
the model read all the texts about elon
musk

4244

musk
 

4245
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,790
musk
it will be able to predict elon musk

4246
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
it will be able to predict elon musk
 

4247
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,550
it will be able to predict elon musk
words as it would be elon musk it will

4248
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:20,560
words as it would be elon musk it will
 

4249
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,790
words as it would be elon musk it will
speak about colonization of

4250
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:22,800
speak about colonization of
 

4251
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,750
speak about colonization of
mars

4252

01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:30,239
it's also possible to
 

4257
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,470
it's also possible to
to even give arbitrary personality to

4258
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:32,480
to even give arbitrary personality to
 

4259
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,229
to even give arbitrary personality to
the model you can say here is a

4260
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:34,239
the model you can say here is a
 

4261
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:37,830
the model you can say here is a
conversation with a friendly ai bot

4262
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:37,840
conversation with a friendly ai bot
 

4263
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,270
conversation with a friendly ai bot
and the model uh will complete the text

4264
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:41,280
and the model uh will complete the text
 

4265
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,669
and the model uh will complete the text
as a friendly ai bot so i mean

4266
01:17:45,669 --> 01:17:45,679
as a friendly ai bot so i mean
 

4267
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:47,510
as a friendly ai bot so i mean
how do i express how

4268
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:47,520
how do i express how
 

4269
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,669
how do i express how
amazing this is so

4270
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:49,679
amazing this is so
 

4271
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:51,669
amazing this is so
just to clarify

4272
01:17:51,669 --> 01:17:51,679
just to clarify
 

4273
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,070
just to clarify
a conversation generating a conversation

4274
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:54,080
a conversation generating a conversation
 

4275
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,990
a conversation generating a conversation
between me and elon musk

between me and elon musk
 

4277
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,510
between me and elon musk
it wouldn't just generate good

4278
01:17:59,510 --> 01:17:59,520
it wouldn't just generate good
 

4279
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,830
it wouldn't just generate good
examples of what elon would say

4280
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:01,840
examples of what elon would say
 

4281
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,310
examples of what elon would say
it would get the syntax all correct so

4282
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:04,320
it would get the syntax all correct so
 

4283
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,709
it would get the syntax all correct so
like interview style you would say like

4284
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:06,719
like interview style you would say like
 

4285
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,750

elon colon and lex con like it it's not
 

4287

01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,080
you go to uh longer pieces it actually
 

4313
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,310
you go to uh longer pieces it actually
goes off the rails okay if you would uh

4314
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
goes off the rails okay if you would uh
 

4315
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,790
goes off the rails okay if you would uh
try to write a book it won't work out uh

4316
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
try to write a book it won't work out uh
 

4317
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,030
try to write a book it won't work out uh
this way what way does it go off the

4318
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:47,040
this way what way does it go off the
 

4319
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,550
this way what way does it go off the
rails by the way is there interesting

4320
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:48,560
rails by the way is there interesting
 

4321
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:51,270
rails by the way is there interesting
ways in which it goes off the rails like

4322
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:51,280
ways in which it goes off the rails like
 

4323
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:54,870
ways in which it goes off the rails like
what falls apart first so the model is

4324
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:54,880
what falls apart first so the model is
 

4325
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,830
what falls apart first so the model is

trained on the all the existing data
 

4327
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,149
trained on the all the existing data
that is out there which means that it is

4328
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:00,159
that is out there which means that it is
 

4329
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:02,550
that is out there which means that it is
not trained on its own mistakes so for

4330
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:02,560
not trained on its own mistakes so for
 

4331
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,189
not trained on its own mistakes so for
instance if it would make a mistake then

4332
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:05,199

uh i kept so to give give you an example

4334
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:08,239
uh i kept so to give give you an example
 

4335
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,189
uh i kept so to give give you an example
so let's say i have a conversation with

4336
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
so let's say i have a conversation with
 

4337
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:11,990
so let's say i have a conversation with
a

4338
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:12,000
a
 

4339
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,470
a
model pretending that is elon musk

model pretending that is elon musk
 

4341
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,590
model pretending that is elon musk
and then i start putting some i'm start

4342
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:17,600
and then i start putting some i'm start
 

4343
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,830
and then i start putting some i'm start
actually making up things which are not

01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:19,840
actually making up things which are not
 

4345
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,430

factual

4346
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:21,440
factual
 

4347
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,950
factual
um i would say like twitter

4348
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960

 

4349
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,470

but i gotcha sorry yeah um okay

4350
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:28,480
but i gotcha sorry yeah um okay
 

4351
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,630
but i gotcha sorry yeah um okay
i don't know i would say that elon is my

4352
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:30,640
i don't know i would say that elon is my
 

4353
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,070
i don't know i would say that elon is my
wife

4354
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:32,080
wife
 

4355
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,830
wife
and the model will just

4356
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:33,840
and the model will just
 

4357
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,229
and the model will just
keep on carrying it on and as if it's

4358
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:36,239
keep on carrying it on and as if it's
 

4359
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,110
keep on carrying it on and as if it's
true

4360
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:37,120
true
 

4361
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,510
true
yes and in some sense if you would have

4362
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
yes and in some sense if you would have
 

4363
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,910
yes and in some sense if you would have
a normal conversation with elon he would

4364
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:41,920
a normal conversation with elon he would
 

4365
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,189
a normal conversation with elon he would
be what the [\h__\h]

4366
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:43,199
be what the [\h__\h]
 

4367
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,910
be what the [\h__\h]
yeah there would be some feedback

4368
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,920
yeah there would be some feedback
 

4369
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,149
yeah there would be some feedback
between so the the model is trained on

4370
01:19:48,149 --> 01:19:48,159
between so the the model is trained on
 

4371
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,550
between so the the model is trained on
things that humans have written but

4372
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:50,560
things that humans have written but
 

4373
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,229
things that humans have written but
through the generation process there's

4374
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:52,239
through the generation process there's
 

4375
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:55,189
through the generation process there's
no human in the loop feedback correct

4376
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:55,199
no human in the loop feedback correct
 

4377
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,270
no human in the loop feedback correct
that's fascinating makes sense so it's

4378
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,280
that's fascinating makes sense so it's
 

4379
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,030
that's fascinating makes sense so it's
magnified it's like the errors get

4380
01:19:59,030 --> 01:19:59,040
magnified it's like the errors get
 

4381
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,910
magnified it's like the errors get
magnified and magnified right and it's a

4382
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:01,920
magnified and magnified right and it's a
 

4383
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,790
magnified and magnified right and it's a
it's also interesting

4384
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:04,800
it's also interesting
 

4385
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,390
it's also interesting
i mean first of all humans have the same

4386
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:06,400
i mean first of all humans have the same
 

4387
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,390
i mean first of all humans have the same
problem it's just that we

4388
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:08,400
problem it's just that we
 

4389
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,470
problem it's just that we
uh we make

4390
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:10,480
uh we make
 

4391
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,030
uh we make
fewer errors and magnify the errors

4392
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,040
fewer errors and magnify the errors
 

4393
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,110
fewer errors and magnify the errors
slower i think that actually what

4394
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:15,120
slower i think that actually what
 

4395
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,110
slower i think that actually what
happens with humans is if you have a

4396
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,120
happens with humans is if you have a
 

4397
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,750
happens with humans is if you have a
wrong belief about the world as a kid

4398
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:19,760
wrong belief about the world as a kid
 

4399
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,590
wrong belief about the world as a kid
then very quickly you will learn that

4400
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:21,600
then very quickly you will learn that
 

4401
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,350
then very quickly you will learn that
it's not correct because you are

4402
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,360
it's not correct because you are
 

4403
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,270
it's not correct because you are
grounded in reality and you are learning

4404
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:25,280
grounded in reality and you are learning
 

4405
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,510
grounded in reality and you are learning
from your new experience yes

4406
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:27,520
from your new experience yes
 

4407
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,590
from your new experience yes
but do you think the model can correct

4408
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:29,600
but do you think the model can correct
 

4409
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,430
but do you think the model can correct
itself too

4410
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:31,440
itself too
 

4411
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,950
itself too
it through the power of the

4412
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:32,960
it through the power of the
 

4413
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,790
it through the power of the

4414
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:34,800
representation
 

4415
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,030
representation
and so the absence

4416
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:37,040
and so the absence
 

4417
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:37,750
and so the absence
of

4418
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:37,760
of
 

4419
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,750
of

information on the internet want to

4422
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:41,840
information on the internet want to
 

4423
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,750
information on the internet want to
correct itself

4424
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
correct itself
 

4425
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,910
correct itself
there won't be examples like that so the

4426
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:45,920
there won't be examples like that so the
 

4427
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,390
there won't be examples like that so the
errors would be subtle at first

4428
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,400
errors would be subtle at first
 

4429
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,590
errors would be subtle at first
saddle at first and in some sense

4430
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:51,600
saddle at first and in some sense
 

4431
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,430
saddle at first and in some sense
you can also say that the data that is

4432
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:53,440
you can also say that the data that is
 

4433
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,189
you can also say that the data that is
not out there is the data which would

4434
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:55,199
not out there is the data which would
 

4435
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:57,830
not out there is the data which would
represent how the human learns

4436
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
represent how the human learns
 

4437
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,709
represent how the human learns
that's an a and and maybe model would be

4438
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:00,719
that's an a and and maybe model would be
 

4439
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,550
that's an a and and maybe model would be
trained on such a data then it would be

4440
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:02,560
trained on such a data then it would be
 

4441
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,990
trained on such a data then it would be
better off how intelligent is gpt 3 do

4442
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,000
better off how intelligent is gpt 3 do
 

4443
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,669
better off how intelligent is gpt 3 do
you think like when you think about the

4444
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:07,679
you think like when you think about the
 

4445
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,830
you think like when you think about the
nature of intelligence

4446
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:09,840
nature of intelligence
 

4447
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,830
nature of intelligence
it seems exceptionally

4448
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:12,840
it seems exceptionally
 

4449
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,470
it seems exceptionally
impressive

4450
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:14,480
impressive
 

4451
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,470
impressive
but then if you think about the big agi

4452
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:16,480
but then if you think about the big agi
 

4453
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,270
but then if you think about the big agi
problem is this footsteps along the way

4454
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
problem is this footsteps along the way
 

4455
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,870
problem is this footsteps along the way
to agi

4456
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:20,880
to agi
 

4457
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,830
to agi
so

4458
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:21,840
so
 

4459
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,910
so
let's see seems that intelligence itself

4460
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:23,920
let's see seems that intelligence itself
 

4461
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,750
let's see seems that intelligence itself
is there are multiple axis of it and

4462
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:27,760
is there are multiple axis of it and
 

4463
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,790
is there are multiple axis of it and
i would expect that the

4464
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:30,800
i would expect that the
 

4465
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,870
i would expect that the
the systems that we are building they

4466
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:32,880
the systems that we are building they
 

4467
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,189
the systems that we are building they
may end up being super human on some

4468
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:35,199
may end up being super human on some
 

4469
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,310
may end up being super human on some
axis

4470
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:36,320
axis
 

4471
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,070
axis
and sub human on some other axis it

4472
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:38,080
and sub human on some other axis it
 

4473
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,229
and sub human on some other axis it
would be surprising to me on all axis

4474
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:40,239
would be surprising to me on all axis
 

4475
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:41,430
would be surprising to me on all axis
simultaneously they would become

4476
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:41,440
simultaneously they would become
 

4477
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,669
simultaneously they would become
superhuman

4478
01:21:43,669 --> 01:21:43,679
superhuman
 

4479
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,590
superhuman
of course people ask this question is

4480
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,600
of course people ask this question is
 

4481
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,229
of course people ask this question is
gpt a spaceship that

4482
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:48,239
gpt a spaceship that
 

4483
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,550
gpt a spaceship that
that would take us to moon or are we

4484
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:50,560
that would take us to moon or are we
 

4485
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,790
that would take us to moon or are we
putting a building a ladder to heaven

4486
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:52,800
putting a building a ladder to heaven
 

4487
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,149
putting a building a ladder to heaven
that we are just building bigger and

4488
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:54,159
that we are just building bigger and
 

4489
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,030
that we are just building bigger and
bigger ladder and we don't know in some

4490
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,040
bigger ladder and we don't know in some
 

4491
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:57,830
bigger ladder and we don't know in some
sense

4492
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:57,840
sense
 

4493
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,550
sense
uh which one of these two which one is

4494
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:00,560
uh which one of these two which one is
 

4495
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:02,950
uh which one of these two which one is
better

4496
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:02,960

 

4497
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,950

i'm trying to i like stairway to heaven

4498
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:04,960
i'm trying to i like stairway to heaven
 

4499
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,470
i'm trying to i like stairway to heaven
that's a good song so i'm not exactly

4500
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:06,480
that's a good song so i'm not exactly
 

4501
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,070
that's a good song so i'm not exactly
sure which one is better but you're

4502
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,080
sure which one is better but you're
 

4503
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,669
sure which one is better but you're
saying like the the spaceship to the

4504
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:09,679
saying like the the spaceship to the
 

4505
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,430
saying like the the spaceship to the
moon is actually effective

4506
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:11,440
moon is actually effective
 

4507
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,790
moon is actually effective
correct so people who criticize gpt yeah

4508
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:14,800
correct so people who criticize gpt yeah
 

4509
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,669
correct so people who criticize gpt yeah
they say jarga is just

4510
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:17,679
they say jarga is just
 

4511
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:18,950
they say jarga is just
building a

4512
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:18,960
building a
 

4513
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,470
building a
taller a ladder

4514
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:20,480
taller a ladder
 

4515
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,189
taller a ladder
and it will never reach the moon

4516
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:23,199
and it will never reach the moon
 

4517
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,950
and it will never reach the moon
and

4518
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:24,960
and
 

4519
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,030
and
at the moment i would say the way i'm

4520
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:27,040
at the moment i would say the way i'm
 

4521
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,550
at the moment i would say the way i'm
thinking is this like a scientific

4522
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
thinking is this like a scientific
 

4523
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,430
thinking is this like a scientific
question

4524
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:29,440
question
 

4525
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:32,790
question
and i'm also in heart i'm a builder

4526
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:32,800
and i'm also in heart i'm a builder
 

4527
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,189
and i'm also in heart i'm a builder
creator and like i'm thinking let's try

4528
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:35,199
creator and like i'm thinking let's try
 

4529
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:38,950
creator and like i'm thinking let's try
out let's see how far it goes and so far

4530
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
out let's see how far it goes and so far
 

4531
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,950
out let's see how far it goes and so far
we see constantly that there is a

4532
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:40,960
we see constantly that there is a
 

4533
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,629
we see constantly that there is a
progress yeah

4534
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:42,639
progress yeah
 

4535
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,550
progress yeah
so what do you think

4536
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:44,560
so what do you think
 

4537
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,350
so what do you think
gpt4

4538
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:47,360
gpt4
 

4539
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:51,189
gpt4
gpt5 gpt n plus one

4540
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:51,199
gpt5 gpt n plus one
 

4541
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:52,870
gpt5 gpt n plus one
will uh

4542
01:22:52,870 --> 01:22:52,880
will uh
 

4543
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,470
will uh
there'll be a phase shift like a

4544
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:54,480
there'll be a phase shift like a
 

4545
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,030
there'll be a phase shift like a
transition to a to a place where

4546
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
transition to a to a place where
 

4547
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,870
transition to a to a place where
we'll be truly surprised then again like

4548
01:22:58,870 --> 01:22:58,880
we'll be truly surprised then again like
 

4549
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,110
we'll be truly surprised then again like
gpt3 is already very like truly

4550
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:01,120
gpt3 is already very like truly
 

4551
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:03,189
gpt3 is already very like truly
surprising the people that criticize

4552
01:23:03,189 --> 01:23:03,199
surprising the people that criticize
 

4553
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:06,070
surprising the people that criticize
gpg3 as it's there as a what is it

4554
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,080
gpg3 as it's there as a what is it
 

4555
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,510
gpg3 as it's there as a what is it
ladder to heaven

4556
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
ladder to heaven
 

4557
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,510
ladder to heaven
i think too quickly get accustomed to

4558
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:09,520
i think too quickly get accustomed to
 

4559
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,830
i think too quickly get accustomed to
how impressive it is that the prediction

4560
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:11,840
how impressive it is that the prediction
 

4561
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,550
how impressive it is that the prediction
of the next word can achieve such

4562
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:14,560
of the next word can achieve such
 

4563
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:17,590
of the next word can achieve such
depth of semantics accuracy of syntax

4564
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:17,600
depth of semantics accuracy of syntax
 

4565
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,550
depth of semantics accuracy of syntax
grammar and semantics

4566
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:20,560
grammar and semantics
 

4567
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,189
grammar and semantics
um do you do you think

4568
01:23:23,189 --> 01:23:23,199
um do you do you think
 

4569
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,750
um do you do you think
gpt four and five and six will continue

4570
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:25,760
gpt four and five and six will continue
 

4571
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,070
gpt four and five and six will continue
to surprise us

4572
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:28,080
to surprise us
 

4573
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,750
to surprise us
i mean definitely there will be more

4574
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
i mean definitely there will be more
 

4575
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,669
i mean definitely there will be more
impressive models there is a question of

4576
01:23:31,669 --> 01:23:31,679
impressive models there is a question of
 

4577
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:34,790
impressive models there is a question of
course if there will be a phase shift

4578
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:34,800
course if there will be a phase shift
 

4579
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,430
course if there will be a phase shift
and

4580
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:37,440

 

4581
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,590

the also even the way i'm thinking about

4582
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:39,600
the also even the way i'm thinking about
 

4583
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,910
the also even the way i'm thinking about
the about these models is that

4584
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920
the about these models is that
 

4585
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,830
the about these models is that
when we build these models

4586
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:43,840
when we build these models
 

4587
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,510
when we build these models
you know we see some level of the

4588
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:45,520
you know we see some level of the
 

4589
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,510
you know we see some level of the
capabilities but we don't even fully

4590
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:47,520
capabilities but we don't even fully
 

4591
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,669
capabilities but we don't even fully
understand everything that the model can

4592
01:23:49,669 --> 01:23:49,679
understand everything that the model can
 

4593
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,590
understand everything that the model can
do and actually one of the best things

4594
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:51,600
do and actually one of the best things
 

4595
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,510
do and actually one of the best things
to do is to

4596
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:53,520
to do is to
 

4597
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,229
to do is to
allow other people to probe the model to

4598
01:23:56,229 --> 01:23:56,239
allow other people to probe the model to
 

4599
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:58,790
allow other people to probe the model to
even see what is possible

4600
01:23:58,790 --> 01:23:58,800
even see what is possible
 

4601
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,149
even see what is possible
hence the

4602
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:00,159
hence the
 

4603
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,669
hence the
using gpg as an api

4604
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
using gpg as an api
 

4605
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,590
using gpg as an api
and opening it up to the world yeah i

4606
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:05,600
and opening it up to the world yeah i
 

4607
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,430
and opening it up to the world yeah i
mean so when i'm thinking from

4608
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:07,440
mean so when i'm thinking from
 

4609
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,430
mean so when i'm thinking from
perspective of

4610
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:09,440
perspective of
 

4611
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,189
perspective of
there like a obviously various people

4612
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:11,199
there like a obviously various people
 

4613
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:13,350
there like a obviously various people
are that have concerns about agi

4614
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:13,360
are that have concerns about agi
 

4615
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:15,590
are that have concerns about agi
including myself

4616
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:15,600
including myself
 

4617
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,629
including myself
and then when i'm thinking from

4618
01:24:16,629 --> 01:24:16,639
and then when i'm thinking from
 

4619
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,870
and then when i'm thinking from
perspective what's the strategy even to

4620
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:18,880
perspective what's the strategy even to
 

4621
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,790
perspective what's the strategy even to
deploy these things to the world

4622
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:20,800
deploy these things to the world
 

4623
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:21,590
deploy these things to the world
the

4624
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:21,600
the
 

4625
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,830
the
the one strategy that i have seen many

4626
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:23,840
the one strategy that i have seen many
 

4627
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,669
the one strategy that i have seen many
times working is the iterative

4628
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:25,679
times working is the iterative
 

4629
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:28,310
times working is the iterative
deployment that you deploy

4630
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:28,320
deployment that you deploy
 

4631
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,709
deployment that you deploy
um slightly better versions and you

4632
01:24:30,709 --> 01:24:30,719
um slightly better versions and you
 

4633
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:32,709
um slightly better versions and you
allow other people to criticize you so

4634
01:24:32,709 --> 01:24:32,719
allow other people to criticize you so
 

4635
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:35,270
allow other people to criticize you so
you actually are tried out you see where

4636
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:35,280
you actually are tried out you see where
 

4637
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,669
you actually are tried out you see where
are their fundamental issues and it's

4638
01:24:37,669 --> 01:24:37,679
are their fundamental issues and it's
 

4639
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,590
are their fundamental issues and it's
almost you don't want to be in that

4640
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:39,600
almost you don't want to be in that
 

4641
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,149
almost you don't want to be in that
situation that you are holding into

4642
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:44,159
situation that you are holding into
 

4643
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,830
situation that you are holding into
powerful system and there's like a huge

4644
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:45,840
powerful system and there's like a huge
 

4645
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,550
powerful system and there's like a huge
overhang then you deploy it and it might

4646
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:48,560
overhang then you deploy it and it might
 

4647
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,790
overhang then you deploy it and it might
have a random chaotic impact on the

4648
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:50,800
have a random chaotic impact on the
 

4649
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,550
have a random chaotic impact on the
world so you actually want to be in the

4650
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:52,560
world so you actually want to be in the
 

4651
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,550
world so you actually want to be in the
situation that they are gradually

4652
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:54,560
situation that they are gradually
 

4653
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,550
situation that they are gradually
deploying systems

4654
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:56,560
deploying systems
 

4655
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,629
deploying systems
i asked this question of ilio let me ask

4656
01:24:58,629 --> 01:24:58,639
i asked this question of ilio let me ask
 

4657
01:24:58,639 --> 01:24:59,669
i asked this question of ilio let me ask
you

4658
01:24:59,669 --> 01:24:59,679
you
 

4659
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:01,430
you
you this question

4660
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:01,440
you this question
 

4661
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,110
you this question
i've been reading a lot

4662
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:03,120
i've been reading a lot
 

4663
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:10,070
i've been reading a lot
about stalin and power

4664
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:10,080

 

4665
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,990

if you're in possession of a system

4666
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
if you're in possession of a system
 

4667
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,350
if you're in possession of a system
that's

4668
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,360
that's
 

4669
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:17,189
that's
like agi that's exceptionally powerful

4670
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:17,199
like agi that's exceptionally powerful
 

4671
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,990
like agi that's exceptionally powerful
do you think your character integrity

4672
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,000
do you think your character integrity
 

4673
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,669
do you think your character integrity
might become corrupted

4674
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
might become corrupted
 

4675
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,430
might become corrupted
like famously power corrupts and

4676
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:23,440
like famously power corrupts and
 

4677
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,750
like famously power corrupts and
absolute power corrupts absolutely

4678
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,760
absolute power corrupts absolutely
 

4679
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,510
absolute power corrupts absolutely
so i believe that

4680
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:27,520
so i believe that
 

4681
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,149
so i believe that
you want at some point to

4682
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
you want at some point to
 

4683
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,870
you want at some point to
work toward distributing the power

4684
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:32,880
work toward distributing the power
 

4685
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,149
work toward distributing the power
i think that

4686
01:25:34,149 --> 01:25:34,159
i think that
 

4687
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,070
i think that
you want to be in the situation

4688
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,080
you want to be in the situation
 

4689
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,709
you want to be in the situation
that actually agi is not controlled by a

4690
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:38,719
that actually agi is not controlled by a
 

4691
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,629
that actually agi is not controlled by a
small number of people

4692
01:25:40,629 --> 01:25:40,639
small number of people
 

4693
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:41,590
small number of people
but

4694
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:41,600
but
 

4695
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,270
but
essentially

4696
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:43,280
essentially
 

4697
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,910
essentially
by a larger collective so the thing is

4698
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:45,920
by a larger collective so the thing is
 

4699
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,550
by a larger collective so the thing is
that requires a george washington style

4700
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:48,560
that requires a george washington style
 

4701
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,709
that requires a george washington style
move

4702
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:50,719
move
 

4703
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:53,510
move
in the ascent to power there's always a

4704
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:53,520
in the ascent to power there's always a
 

4705
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,390
in the ascent to power there's always a
moment when somebody gets a lot of power

4706
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:56,400
moment when somebody gets a lot of power
 

4707
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,189
moment when somebody gets a lot of power
and they have to have the integrity

4708
01:25:59,189 --> 01:25:59,199
and they have to have the integrity
 

4709
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,990
and they have to have the integrity
and uh the moral compass to give away

4710
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,000
and uh the moral compass to give away
 

4711
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,430
and uh the moral compass to give away
that power

4712
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:03,440
that power
 

4713
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:05,350
that power
that humans have been

4714
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:05,360
that humans have been
 

4715
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,510
that humans have been
good and bad throughout history at this

4716
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:07,520
good and bad throughout history at this
 

4717
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,990
good and bad throughout history at this
particular step and i wonder

4718
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:10,000
particular step and i wonder
 

4719
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,870
particular step and i wonder
i wonder we like blind ourselves in uh

4720
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:12,880
i wonder we like blind ourselves in uh
 

4721
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,229
i wonder we like blind ourselves in uh
for example

4722
01:26:14,229 --> 01:26:14,239
for example
 

4723
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,870
for example
between nations a race

4724
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:16,880
between nations a race
 

4725
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,270
between nations a race
uh towards uh

4726
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:19,280
uh towards uh
 

4727
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,990
uh towards uh
yeah ai race between nations we might

4728
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:22,000
yeah ai race between nations we might
 

4729
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,229
yeah ai race between nations we might
blind ourselves and justify to ourselves

4730
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:24,239
blind ourselves and justify to ourselves
 

4731
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,149
blind ourselves and justify to ourselves
the development of ai without

4732
01:26:26,149 --> 01:26:26,159
the development of ai without
 

4733
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,149
the development of ai without
distributing the power

4734
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:28,159
distributing the power
 

4735
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:29,590
distributing the power
because we want to defend ourselves

4736
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:29,600
because we want to defend ourselves
 

4737
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,990
because we want to defend ourselves
against china against russia that kind

4738
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:32,000
against china against russia that kind
 

4739
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,070
against china against russia that kind
of that kind of logic

4740
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:34,080
of that kind of logic
 

4741
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,430
of that kind of logic
and

4742
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:35,440
and
 

4743
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,950
and
i wonder

4744
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:36,960
i wonder
 

4745
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,709
i wonder
how we um

4746
01:26:38,709 --> 01:26:38,719
how we um
 

4747
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,430
how we um
how we design governance mechanisms that

4748
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:41,440
how we design governance mechanisms that
 

4749
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,070
how we design governance mechanisms that
um prevent us from

4750
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,080
um prevent us from
 

4751
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,229
um prevent us from
becoming power hungry and in the process

4752
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:46,239
becoming power hungry and in the process
 

4753
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:48,229
becoming power hungry and in the process
destroying ourselves

4754

to admit that
uh once again i actually want to rely

4762
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:56,000
uh once again i actually want to rely
 

4763
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,790

01:27:04,709 --> 01:27:04,719
on how even to distribute wealth
 

4769
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,830
on how even to distribute wealth

01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:34,080
that like gives me i guess
 

4795
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:36,229
that like gives me i guess
maybe some level of trust to him but i

4796

i wonder because we're sort of summoning
 

4805
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,590
i wonder because we're sort of summoning

a new set of technologies
 

4807
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,990
a new set of technologies
i wonder if we'll be

4808
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:50,000
i wonder if we'll be
 

4809
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,390
i wonder if we'll be
cognizant like you're describing the

4810
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:52,400
cognizant like you're describing the
 

4811
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,950
cognizant like you're describing the
process of open ai but it could also be

4812
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:54,960
process of open ai but it could also be
 

4813
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,709
process of open ai but it could also be
at other places like in the us

4814
01:27:56,709 --> 01:27:56,719
at other places like in the us
 

4815
01:27:56,719 --> 01:27:59,430
at other places like in the us
government right

4816
01:27:59,430 --> 01:27:59,440
government right
 

4817
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,870
government right
both china and the us are now

4818
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:02,880
both china and the us are now

01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,950
both china and the us are now
full steam ahead on autonomous weapons

systems development

4822
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:07,040
systems development
 

4823
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,709
systems development
and that's really worrying to me because

4824
01:28:10,709 --> 01:28:10,719
and that's really worrying to me because
 

4825
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:13,350
and that's really worrying to me because
in the framework of something being

4826
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:13,360
in the framework of something being
 

4827
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,990
in the framework of something being
a national security danger or military

4828
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:16,000
a national security danger or military
 

4829
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,709
a national security danger or military
danger you can do a lot of pretty dark

4830
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:18,719
danger you can do a lot of pretty dark
 

4831
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:19,910
danger you can do a lot of pretty dark
things

4832
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:19,920
things
 

4833
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,270
things
that blind our moral compass

4834
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,280
that blind our moral compass
 

4835
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,950
that blind our moral compass
and i think ai will be one of those

4836
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:24,960
and i think ai will be one of those
 

4837
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,470
and i think ai will be one of those
things

4838
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,480
things
 

4839
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,950
things
in some sense the the mission

4840
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:28,960
in some sense the the mission
 

4841
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:31,430
in some sense the the mission
and the work you're doing at openai

4842
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:31,440
and the work you're doing at openai
 

4843
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,590
and the work you're doing at openai
is like the counterbalance to that so

4844
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:33,600
is like the counterbalance to that so
 

4845
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,070
is like the counterbalance to that so
you want to have more open ai and less

4846
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,080
you want to have more open ai and less
 

4847
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,189
you want to have more open ai and less
autonomous weapon systems i i i like

4848
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:39,199
autonomous weapon systems i i i like
 

4849
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:40,790
autonomous weapon systems i i i like
these statements like to be clear like

4850
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:40,800
these statements like to be clear like
 

4851
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,470
these statements like to be clear like
this interesting and i'm thinking about

4852
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,480
this interesting and i'm thinking about
 

4853
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,790
this interesting and i'm thinking about
it myself but uh

4854
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
it myself but uh
 

4855
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,350
it myself but uh
this is a place that i i okay

4856
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:47,360
this is a place that i i okay
 

4857
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,430
this is a place that i i okay
i put my trust actually

4858
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:49,440
i put my trust actually
 

4859
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,350
i put my trust actually
in some hence because it's extremely

4860
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,360
in some hence because it's extremely
 

4861
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,830
in some hence because it's extremely
hard for me to reason about it yeah i

4862
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:53,840
hard for me to reason about it yeah i
 

4863
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,070
hard for me to reason about it yeah i
mean one important statement to make is

4864
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,080
mean one important statement to make is
 

4865
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,189
mean one important statement to make is
um

4866
01:28:57,189 --> 01:28:57,199
um
 

4867
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,590
um
it's good to think about this yeah no

4868
01:28:59,590 --> 01:28:59,600
it's good to think about this yeah no
 

4869
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,510
it's good to think about this yeah no
question about right no question even

4870
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:01,520
question about right no question even
 

4871
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,030
question about right no question even
like

4872
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:03,040
like
 

4873
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,149

low-level quote-unquote engineer
 

4875
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:08,709
low-level quote-unquote engineer
like there's such a

4876
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:08,719
like there's such a
 

4877
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,750
like there's such a
i remember i i programmed a car uh our

4878
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:11,760
i remember i i programmed a car uh our
 

4879
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,709
i remember i i programmed a car uh our
rc car

4880
01:29:14,709 --> 01:29:14,719

 

4881
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,030

they went really fast like 30 40 miles

4882
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,040
they went really fast like 30 40 miles
 

4883
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,310
they went really fast like 30 40 miles
an hour

4884
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:18,320
an hour
 

4885
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,870
an hour
and i remember i was like sleep deprived

4886
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:20,880
and i remember i was like sleep deprived
 

4887
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:22,550
and i remember i was like sleep deprived
so i programmed it

4888
01:29:22,550 --> 01:29:22,560
so i programmed it
 

4889
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,110
so i programmed it
pretty crappily and it like uh

4890
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:25,120
pretty crappily and it like uh
 

4891
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,870
pretty crappily and it like uh
the the code froze so it's doing some

4892
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:26,880
the the code froze so it's doing some
 

4893
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,870
the the code froze so it's doing some
basic computer vision and it's going

4894
01:29:28,870 --> 01:29:28,880
basic computer vision and it's going
 

4895
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,870
basic computer vision and it's going
around on track but it's going full

4896
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:30,880
around on track but it's going full
 

4897
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,390
around on track but it's going full
speed

4898
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:32,400
speed
 

4899
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,350
speed
and uh there's a bug in the code that uh

4900
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:35,360
and uh there's a bug in the code that uh
 

4901
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,830
and uh there's a bug in the code that uh
the car just

4902
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:36,840
the car just
 

4903
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,990
the car just
went it didn't turn it went straight

4904
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:40,000
went it didn't turn it went straight
 

4905
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,470
went it didn't turn it went straight
full speed and smashed into the wall i

4906
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
full speed and smashed into the wall i
 

4907
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,390
full speed and smashed into the wall i
remember thinking

4908
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:44,400
remember thinking
 

4909
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:48,470
remember thinking
the seriousness with which you need to

approach the design of artificial
 

4913
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:52,390
approach the design of artificial

01:30:02,470 --> 01:30:02,480
for some reason i immediately thought of
 

4925
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,709
for some reason i immediately thought of
like an algorithm that controls nuclear

in approaching this problem and thinking

01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:15,360
in approaching this problem and thinking
 

4939
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,590
in approaching this problem and thinking
about the worst case consequences so i

4940
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:17,600
about the worst case consequences so i
 

4941
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,470
about the worst case consequences so i
think that is true i mean the

4942
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:20,480
think that is true i mean the
 

4943
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,590
think that is true i mean the
what i also recognize in myself and

4944

what i also recognize in myself and
 

4945
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,830
what i also recognize in myself and
others even asking this question is that

4946
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:25,840
others even asking this question is that
 

4947
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,910
others even asking this question is that
it evokes a lot of fear

4948
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:27,920
it evokes a lot of fear
 

4949
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,310
it evokes a lot of fear
and fear itself ends up being actually

4950
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:30,320
and fear itself ends up being actually
 

4951
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,229
and fear itself ends up being actually
quite debilitating

4952
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:32,239
quite debilitating

01:30:58,950 --> 01:30:58,960
i'm not saying that the fear doesn't
 

4975
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,270
i'm not saying that the fear doesn't
exist out there and like it totally

can we just take a step back to
 

5021
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,390
can we just take a step back to
something else super cool which is uh

open-air codecs and github co-pilot is
 

5029
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,870
open-air codecs and github co-pilot is
how it works

5030
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:54,880
how it works
 

5031
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,830
how it works
and why the hell it works so

5032
01:31:56,830 --> 01:31:56,840
and why the hell it works so
 

5033
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:01,110
and why the hell it works so
well so with gpd3 we noticed that the

5034
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:01,120
well so with gpd3 we noticed that the
 

5035
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,070
well so with gpd3 we noticed that the
system

5036
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:02,080
system
 

5037
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,149
system
um you know that system training all the

5038
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:04,159
um you know that system training all the
 

5039
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,229
um you know that system training all the
language out there started having some

5040
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:06,239
language out there started having some
 

5041
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,709
language out there started having some
rudimentary coding capabilities so we're

5042
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:08,719
rudimentary coding capabilities so we're
 

5043
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:11,669
rudimentary coding capabilities so we're
able to ask it you know to

5044
01:32:11,669 --> 01:32:11,679
able to ask it you know to
 

5045
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,750
able to ask it you know to
implement addition function between two

5046
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:13,760
implement addition function between two
 

5047
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,229
implement addition function between two
numbers and indeed it can write python

5048
01:32:16,229 --> 01:32:16,239
numbers and indeed it can write python
 

5049
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,470
numbers and indeed it can write python
or javascript code for that and then we

5050
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:18,480
or javascript code for that and then we
 

5051
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:21,669
or javascript code for that and then we
thought um we might as well just go full

5052
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:21,679
thought um we might as well just go full
 

5053
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,149
thought um we might as well just go full
steam ahead and try to create a system

5054
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:24,159
steam ahead and try to create a system
 

5055
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:25,669
steam ahead and try to create a system
that is actually good

5056
01:32:25,669 --> 01:32:25,679
that is actually good
 

5057
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:28,470
that is actually good

01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,229
at what we are doing every day ourselves
which is programming

01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:32,400
we optimize models
 

5063
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,110
we optimize models
for proficiency in coding we actually

for proficiency in coding we actually
even created models that both have a

5066
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:38,320
even created models that both have a
 

5067
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,590
even created models that both have a
comprehension of language and code

5068

comprehension of language and code
 

5069
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,750

and codex is api for these models so

5070
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:45,760
and codex is api for these models so
 

5071
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,470
and codex is api for these models so
it's first pre-trained on language

it's first pre-trained on language
and then

5074
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:50,400
and then
 

5075
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,709
and then
i don't know if you can say fine-tuned

5076
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:52,719
i don't know if you can say fine-tuned
 

5077
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:54,470
i don't know if you can say fine-tuned
because there's a lot of code

5078
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
because there's a lot of code
 

5079
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,790
because there's a lot of code
but it's language and code it's language

5080
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:56,800
but it's language and code it's language
 

5081
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,149
but it's language and code it's language
and code

5082
01:32:58,149 --> 01:32:58,159
and code
 

5083
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,070
and code
it's also optimized for various things

5084
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:00,080
it's also optimized for various things
 

5085
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,470
it's also optimized for various things
like let's say low latency and so on

5086
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:02,480
like let's say low latency and so on
 

5087
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,830
like let's say low latency and so on
codex is the api that's similar to gpd3

5088
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:05,840
codex is the api that's similar to gpd3
 

5089
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,030
codex is the api that's similar to gpd3
we expect that there will be

5090
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:07,040
we expect that there will be
 

5091
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,669
we expect that there will be
proliferation of the potential products

5092
01:33:09,669 --> 01:33:09,679
proliferation of the potential products
 

5093
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:11,669
proliferation of the potential products
that can use coding capabilities and i

5094
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:11,679
that can use coding capabilities and i
 

5095
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:12,550
that can use coding capabilities and i
can

5096
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:12,560
can
 

5097
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,790
can
i can speak about it in a second

5098
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:14,800
i can speak about it in a second
 

5099
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,870
i can speak about it in a second
compiled is the first product

5100
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:16,880
compiled is the first product
 

5101
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,110
compiled is the first product
and developed by github so as we're

5102
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:19,120
and developed by github so as we're
 

5103
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,350
and developed by github so as we're
building uh models we wanted to make

5104
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,360
building uh models we wanted to make
 

5105
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,510
building uh models we wanted to make
sure that these models are useful

5106
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:23,520
sure that these models are useful
 

5107
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,430
sure that these models are useful
and we work together with github on

5108
01:33:25,430 --> 01:33:25,440
and we work together with github on
 

5109
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,990
and we work together with github on
building the first product co-pilot is

5110
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:28,000
building the first product co-pilot is
 

5111
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,030
building the first product co-pilot is
actually as you code it suggests you

5112
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:31,040
actually as you code it suggests you
 

5113
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,350
actually as you code it suggests you
code completions and we have seen in the

5114
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:33,360
code completions and we have seen in the
 

5115
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,189
code completions and we have seen in the
past they're like a various tools that

5116
01:33:35,189 --> 01:33:35,199
past they're like a various tools that
 

5117
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,870
past they're like a various tools that
can suggest how to like a few characters

5118
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:38,880
can suggest how to like a few characters
 

5119
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,750
can suggest how to like a few characters
of the code or the line of code the the

5120
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:41,760
of the code or the line of code the the
 

5121
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,669
of the code or the line of code the the
thing about copilot is it can generate

5122
01:33:43,669 --> 01:33:43,679
thing about copilot is it can generate
 

5123
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:45,990
thing about copilot is it can generate
10 lines of code you

5124
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:46,000
10 lines of code you
 

5125
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,229
10 lines of code you
it's often the way how it works is you

5126
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:48,239
it's often the way how it works is you
 

5127
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,310
it's often the way how it works is you
often write in the comment what you want

5128
01:33:50,310 --> 01:33:50,320
often write in the comment what you want
 

5129
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,590
often write in the comment what you want
to happen because

5130
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:51,600
to happen because
 

5131
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,189
to happen because
people in comments they describe what

5132
01:33:53,189 --> 01:33:53,199
people in comments they describe what
 

5133
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:55,110
people in comments they describe what
happens next so

5134
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,120
happens next so
 

5135
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,270
happens next so
um these days when i code instead of

5136
01:33:57,270 --> 01:33:57,280
um these days when i code instead of
 

5137
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:00,149
um these days when i code instead of
going to google to search

5138
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:00,159
going to google to search
 

5139
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:01,990
going to google to search
for the appropriate code to solve my

5140
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:02,000
for the appropriate code to solve my
 

5141
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,070
for the appropriate code to solve my
problem i say oh for this array could

5142
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:06,080
problem i say oh for this array could
 

5143
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,550
problem i say oh for this array could
you smooth it and then you know it

5144
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:08,560
you smooth it and then you know it
 

5145
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,310
you smooth it and then you know it
imports some appropriate libraries and

5146
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:10,320
imports some appropriate libraries and
 

5147
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,030
imports some appropriate libraries and
say it uses numpy convolution or so i

5148
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,040
say it uses numpy convolution or so i
 

5149
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,950
say it uses numpy convolution or so i
that i was not even aware that exists

5150
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:14,960
that i was not even aware that exists
 

5151
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,950
that i was not even aware that exists
and it does the appropriate thing

5152
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:16,960
and it does the appropriate thing
 

5153
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,550
and it does the appropriate thing
um so you you write a comment maybe the

5154
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:20,560
um so you you write a comment maybe the
 

5155
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,229
um so you you write a comment maybe the
header of a function and it completes

5156
01:34:22,229 --> 01:34:22,239
header of a function and it completes
 

5157
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,350
header of a function and it completes
the function

5158
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:23,360
the function
 

5159
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,030
the function
of course you don't know what is the

5160
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:25,040
of course you don't know what is the
 

5161
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,030
of course you don't know what is the
space of all the possible

5162
01:34:27,030 --> 01:34:27,040
space of all the possible
 

5163
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,189
space of all the possible
small programs it can generate

5164
01:34:29,189 --> 01:34:29,199
small programs it can generate
 

5165
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,110
small programs it can generate
what are the failure cases how many edge

5166
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:31,120
what are the failure cases how many edge
 

5167
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,350
what are the failure cases how many edge
cases how many subtle

5168
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:33,360
cases how many subtle
 

5169
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,030
cases how many subtle
errors there are how many big errors

5170
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:35,040
errors there are how many big errors
 

5171
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,870
errors there are how many big errors
there are it's hard to know but the fact

5172
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:36,880
there are it's hard to know but the fact
 

5173
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,950
there are it's hard to know but the fact
that it works at all on in a large

5174
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:38,960
that it works at all on in a large
 

5175
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,590
that it works at all on in a large
number of cases is incredible it's like

5176
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:41,600
number of cases is incredible it's like
 

5177
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,390
number of cases is incredible it's like

it's a kind of search engine

5180
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:45,199
it's a kind of search engine
 

5181
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:46,709
it's a kind of search engine
into code that's been written on the

into code that's been written on the
 

5183
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:47,830

correct so for instance

5186
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:49,760
correct so for instance
 

5187
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,910
correct so for instance
when you search things online then

5188
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:51,920
when you search things online then
 

5189
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:53,910
when you search things online then
usually you get to the

5190
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:53,920
usually you get to the
 

5191
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,510
usually you get to the
some particular

5192
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:55,520
some particular
 

5193
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,669
some particular
case like if you go to stack overflow

5194
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
case like if you go to stack overflow
 

5195
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:00,070
case like if you go to stack overflow
people describe that one particular

5196
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:00,080
people describe that one particular
 

5197
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,709
people describe that one particular
situation uh and then they seek for a

5198
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:02,719
situation uh and then they seek for a
 

5199
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,510
situation uh and then they seek for a
solution but in case of uh co-pilot it's

5200
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
solution but in case of uh co-pilot it's
 

5201
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,149
solution but in case of uh co-pilot it's
aware of your entire context and in

5202
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:08,159
aware of your entire context and in
 

5203
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:09,990
aware of your entire context and in
contexts oh these are the libraries that

5204
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:10,000
contexts oh these are the libraries that
 

5205
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,310
contexts oh these are the libraries that
they are using that's the set of the

5206
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:12,320
they are using that's the set of the
 

5207
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,870
they are using that's the set of the
variables that is initialized and on the

5208
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:14,880
variables that is initialized and on the
 

5209
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:17,350
variables that is initialized and on the
spot it can actually tell you what to do

5210
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
spot it can actually tell you what to do
 

5211
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,189
spot it can actually tell you what to do
so the interesting thing is

5212
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,199
so the interesting thing is
 

5213
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,350
so the interesting thing is
and we think that the copilot is one

5214
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:21,360
and we think that the copilot is one
 

5215
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,990
and we think that the copilot is one
possible product using codex but there

5216
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,000
possible product using codex but there
 

5217
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,990
possible product using codex but there
is a place for many more so

5218
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:26,000
is a place for many more so
 

5219
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,149
is a place for many more so
internally we tried out you know to

5220
01:35:28,149 --> 01:35:28,159
internally we tried out you know to
 

5221
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,550
internally we tried out you know to
create other fun products so it turns

5222
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:30,560
create other fun products so it turns
 

5223
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,189
create other fun products so it turns
out that a lot of tools out there

5224
01:35:33,189 --> 01:35:33,199
out that a lot of tools out there
 

5225
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,189
out that a lot of tools out there
let's say google calendar or microsoft

5226
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:35,199
let's say google calendar or microsoft
 

5227
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:36,390
let's say google calendar or microsoft
word or so

01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,270
word or so
they all have uh internal api to build

5230
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:39,280
they all have uh internal api to build
 

5231
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,350
they all have uh internal api to build

01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:41,360
plugins around them
 

5233
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,149
plugins around them
so there is a way in the sophisticated

01:35:44,149 --> 01:35:44,159
so there is a way in the sophisticated
 

5235
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:46,870
so there is a way in the sophisticated
way to control calendar or microsoft

5236
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:46,880
way to control calendar or microsoft
 

5237
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,270
way to control calendar or microsoft

if you want more complicated behaviors

5240
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:50,960
if you want more complicated behaviors
 

5241
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,629
if you want more complicated behaviors
from these programs you have to add a

5242
01:35:52,629 --> 01:35:52,639
from these programs you have to add a
 

5243
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:55,189
from these programs you have to add a
new button for every behavior

5244
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:55,199
new button for every behavior
 

5245
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:58,070
new button for every behavior
but it is possible to use codex and

5246
01:35:58,070 --> 01:35:58,080
but it is possible to use codex and
 

5247
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,950
but it is possible to use codex and
tell for instance to calendar

5248
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:00,960
tell for instance to calendar
 

5249
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,350
tell for instance to calendar
could you schedule an appointment with

5250
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:03,360
could you schedule an appointment with
 

5251
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:04,310
could you schedule an appointment with
blacks

5252
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,320
blacks
 

5253
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,109
blacks
next week after 2 pm and either writes

5254
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:07,119
next week after 2 pm and either writes
 

5255
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,510
next week after 2 pm and either writes
corresponding piece of code

5256
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:09,520
corresponding piece of code
 

5257
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:11,030
corresponding piece of code
and that's the thing that actually you

5258
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:11,040
and that's the thing that actually you
 

5259
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,109
and that's the thing that actually you
want so interesting so

5260
01:36:13,109 --> 01:36:13,119
want so interesting so
 

5261
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:14,550
want so interesting so
what you figure out is there's a lot of

5262
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:14,560
what you figure out is there's a lot of
 

5263
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,310
what you figure out is there's a lot of
programs with which you can interact

5264
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:16,320
programs with which you can interact
 

5265
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,590
programs with which you can interact
through code

5266
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:17,600
through code
 

5267
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:21,109
through code
and so there you can generate that code

5268
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:21,119
and so there you can generate that code
 

5269
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:22,950
and so there you can generate that code
from natural language

5270
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:22,960
from natural language
 

5271
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:24,790
from natural language
that's fascinating and that's somewhat

5272
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:24,800
that's fascinating and that's somewhat
 

5273
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,950
that's fascinating and that's somewhat
like also closest to

5274
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:26,960
like also closest to
 

5275
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,590
like also closest to
uh what was the promise of siri or alexa

5276
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:29,600
uh what was the promise of siri or alexa
 

5277
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:31,430
uh what was the promise of siri or alexa
yeah so previously all these behaviors

5278
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
yeah so previously all these behaviors
 

5279
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:32,550
yeah so previously all these behaviors
they were had

5280
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:32,560
they were had
 

5281
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,590
they were had
hard coded yeah and it seems that codex

5282
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:35,600
hard coded yeah and it seems that codex
 

5283
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:38,790
hard coded yeah and it seems that codex
on the fly can pick up the api of let's

5284
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:38,800
on the fly can pick up the api of let's
 

5285
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,189
on the fly can pick up the api of let's
say given software yeah and then it can

5286
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:41,199
say given software yeah and then it can
 

5287
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,350
say given software yeah and then it can
turn the language into use of this api

5288
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:43,360
turn the language into use of this api
 

5289
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,510
turn the language into use of this api
without hard coding you can find it can

5290
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:45,520
without hard coding you can find it can
 

5291
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,149
without hard coding you can find it can
translate to machine language correct it

5292
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:48,159
translate to machine language correct it
 

5293
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:49,830
translate to machine language correct it
to uh so for example this would be

5294
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:49,840
to uh so for example this would be
 

5295
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:53,189
to uh so for example this would be
really exciting for me like for um adobe

5296
01:36:53,189 --> 01:36:53,199
really exciting for me like for um adobe
 

5297
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,350
really exciting for me like for um adobe
products like photoshop

5298
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:55,360
products like photoshop
 

5299
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,990
products like photoshop
uh which is the i think actionscript i

5300
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:58,000
uh which is the i think actionscript i
 

5301
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,270
uh which is the i think actionscript i
think there's a scripting language that

5302
01:36:59,270 --> 01:36:59,280
think there's a scripting language that
 

5303
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,470
think there's a scripting language that
communicates with them same with

5304
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:00,480
communicates with them same with
 

5305
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,430
communicates with them same with
premiere

5306
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:01,440
premiere
 

5307
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,189
premiere
and you could imagine that that allows

5308
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:03,199
and you could imagine that that allows
 

5309
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,470
and you could imagine that that allows
event to

5310
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:04,480
event to
 

5311
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,510
event to
do coding by voice on your phone

5312
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:07,520
do coding by voice on your phone
 

5313
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,149
do coding by voice on your phone
so for instance in the past okay as of

5314
01:37:10,149 --> 01:37:10,159
so for instance in the past okay as of
 

5315
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:13,350
so for instance in the past okay as of
today i'm not editing word documents on

5316
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:13,360
today i'm not editing word documents on
 

5317
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,510
today i'm not editing word documents on
my phone because it's just the keyboard

5318
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:15,520
my phone because it's just the keyboard
 

5319
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,510
my phone because it's just the keyboard
is too small but if i would be able to

5320
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:17,520
is too small but if i would be able to
 

5321
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,030
is too small but if i would be able to
tell

5322
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,040
tell
 

5323
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,830
tell
to my phone you know uh make the header

5324
01:37:21,830 --> 01:37:21,840
to my phone you know uh make the header
 

5325
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:23,990
to my phone you know uh make the header
large and then move the paragraphs

5326
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:24,000
large and then move the paragraphs
 

5327
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,790
large and then move the paragraphs
around and it does actually what i want

5328
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:26,800
around and it does actually what i want
 

5329
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,790
around and it does actually what i want
so i can tell you one more cool thing or

5330
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:28,800
so i can tell you one more cool thing or
 

5331
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,669
so i can tell you one more cool thing or
even how i'm thinking about codex

5332
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:31,679
even how i'm thinking about codex
 

5333
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:34,310
even how i'm thinking about codex
so if you look actually at the evolution

5334
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:34,320
so if you look actually at the evolution
 

5335
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,590
so if you look actually at the evolution
of

5336
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:35,600
of
 

5337
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,109
of
of computers

5338
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:37,119
of computers
 

5339
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,590
of computers
we started with very primitive

5340
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
we started with very primitive
 

5341
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,430
we started with very primitive
interfaces which is a punch card and

5342
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:41,440
interfaces which is a punch card and
 

5343
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,430
interfaces which is a punch card and
punch card essentially

5344
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,440
punch card essentially
 

5345
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,750
punch card essentially
you make a holes in the

5346
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:45,760
you make a holes in the
 

5347
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:47,510
you make a holes in the
in the plastic card to indicate zeros

5348
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:47,520
in the plastic card to indicate zeros
 

5349
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,950
in the plastic card to indicate zeros
and ones

5350
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960
and ones
 

5351
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:50,149
and ones
and

5352
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:50,159
and
 

5353
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,510
and
during that time there was a small

5354
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:51,520
during that time there was a small
 

5355
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,109
during that time there was a small
number of specialists who were able to

5356
01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:53,119
number of specialists who were able to
 

5357
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:55,270
number of specialists who were able to
use computers and by the way people even

5358
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:55,280
use computers and by the way people even
 

5359
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,109
use computers and by the way people even
suspected that there is no need for many

5360
01:37:57,109 --> 01:37:57,119
suspected that there is no need for many
 

5361
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:59,750
suspected that there is no need for many
more people to use computers

5362
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
more people to use computers
 

5363
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,030
more people to use computers
but then we moved from punch cards to

5364
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:03,040
but then we moved from punch cards to
 

5365
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,350
but then we moved from punch cards to
at first assembly then c

5366
01:38:05,350 --> 01:38:05,360
at first assembly then c
 

5367
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,590
at first assembly then c
and these programming languages they

5368
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:07,600
and these programming languages they
 

5369
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,990
and these programming languages they
were slightly higher level they allowed

5370
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:10,000
were slightly higher level they allowed
 

5371
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,109
were slightly higher level they allowed
many more people to code and they also

5372
01:38:13,109 --> 01:38:13,119
many more people to code and they also
 

5373
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:15,030
many more people to code and they also
led to more of a proliferation of

5374
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:15,040
led to more of a proliferation of
 

5375
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:17,430
led to more of a proliferation of
technology and

5376
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:17,440
technology and
 

5377
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,669
technology and
you know further on there was a jump to

5378
01:38:19,669 --> 01:38:19,679
you know further on there was a jump to
 

5379
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:22,229
you know further on there was a jump to
say from c plus plus to java and python

5380
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:22,239
say from c plus plus to java and python
 

5381
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:24,310
say from c plus plus to java and python
and every time it has happened

5382
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:24,320
and every time it has happened
 

5383
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,550
and every time it has happened
more people are able to code and we

5384
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:26,560
more people are able to code and we
 

5385
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,350
more people are able to code and we
build more technology and it's even you

5386
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:29,360
build more technology and it's even you
 

5387
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:30,790
build more technology and it's even you
know

5388
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:30,800
know
 

5389
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,470
know
hard to imagine now if someone will tell

5390
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:32,480
hard to imagine now if someone will tell
 

5391
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,709
hard to imagine now if someone will tell
you that you should write code in

5392
01:38:34,709 --> 01:38:34,719
you that you should write code in
 

5393
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,109
you that you should write code in
assembly instead of let's say python or

5394
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:37,119
assembly instead of let's say python or
 

5395
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:37,830
assembly instead of let's say python or
or

5396
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:37,840
or
 

5397
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,870
or
or java or javascript and codex is yet

5398
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,880
or java or javascript and codex is yet
 

5399
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,709
or java or javascript and codex is yet
another step toward kind of bringing

5400
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:42,719
another step toward kind of bringing
 

5401
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:45,350
another step toward kind of bringing
computers closer to humans such that you

5402
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:45,360
computers closer to humans such that you
 

5403
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,510
computers closer to humans such that you
communicate with a computer

5404
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:47,520
communicate with a computer
 

5405
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,189
communicate with a computer
with your own language

5406
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:49,199
with your own language
 

5407
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:51,430
with your own language
rather than with a specialized language

5408
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:51,440
rather than with a specialized language
 

5409
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,470
rather than with a specialized language
and

5410
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:52,480
and
 

5411
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:54,950
and
i think that it will lead to

5412
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:54,960
i think that it will lead to
 

5413
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:56,790
i think that it will lead to
an increase of number of people who can

5414
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:56,800
an increase of number of people who can
 

5415
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,750
an increase of number of people who can
code

5416
01:38:57,750 --> 01:38:57,760
code
 

5417
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:58,870
code
yeah and then and the kind of

5418
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:58,880
yeah and then and the kind of
 

5419
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,629
yeah and then and the kind of
technologies that those people will

5420
01:39:00,629 --> 01:39:00,639
technologies that those people will
 

5421
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:01,990
technologies that those people will
create is

5422
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:02,000
create is
 

5423
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,990
create is
like it's innumerable it could you know

5424
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:04,000
like it's innumerable it could you know
 

5425
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,590
like it's innumerable it could you know
it could be a huge number of

5426
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
it could be a huge number of
 

5427
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,149
it could be a huge number of
technologies we're not predicting at all

5428
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:08,159
technologies we're not predicting at all
 

5429
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:10,070
technologies we're not predicting at all
because that's less and less requirement

5430
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:10,080
because that's less and less requirement
 

5431
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:11,109
because that's less and less requirement
of uh

5432
01:39:11,109 --> 01:39:11,119
of uh
 

5433
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,109
of uh
having a technical mind

5434
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:13,119
having a technical mind
 

5435
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:15,270
having a technical mind
a programming mind you're not opening it

5436
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,280
a programming mind you're not opening it
 

5437
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:17,350
a programming mind you're not opening it
to the world of

5438
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:17,360
to the world of
 

5439
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:18,709
to the world of
um

5440
01:39:18,709 --> 01:39:18,719
um
 

5441
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,390
um
other kinds of minds creative minds

5442
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:20,400
other kinds of minds creative minds
 

5443
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,310
other kinds of minds creative minds
artistic minds all that kind of stuff i

5444
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:22,320
artistic minds all that kind of stuff i
 

5445
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,830
artistic minds all that kind of stuff i
would like for instance biologists who

5446
01:39:23,830 --> 01:39:23,840
would like for instance biologists who
 

5447
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,550
would like for instance biologists who
work on dna to be able to program and

5448
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:26,560
work on dna to be able to program and
 

5449
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,870
work on dna to be able to program and
not to need to spend a lot of time uh

5450
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:28,880
not to need to spend a lot of time uh
 

5451
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,470
not to need to spend a lot of time uh
learning it and i i believe that's a

5452
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,480
learning it and i i believe that's a
 

5453
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,229
learning it and i i believe that's a
good thing to the word and i would

5454
01:39:32,229 --> 01:39:32,239
good thing to the word and i would
 

5455
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:35,030
good thing to the word and i would
actually add out that so at the moment

5456
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,040
actually add out that so at the moment
 

5457
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,350
actually add out that so at the moment
i'm a managing codex team and also

5458
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
i'm a managing codex team and also
 

5459
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,189
i'm a managing codex team and also
language team and i believe that there

5460
01:39:39,189 --> 01:39:39,199
language team and i believe that there
 

5461
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:41,510
language team and i believe that there
is like a plenty of brilliant people out

5462
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
is like a plenty of brilliant people out
 

5463
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,310
is like a plenty of brilliant people out
there

5464
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:42,320
there
 

5465
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,229
there
and they should apply

5466
01:39:44,229 --> 01:39:44,239
and they should apply
 

5467
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:46,310
and they should apply
oh okay yeah awesome so what's the

5468
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:46,320
oh okay yeah awesome so what's the
 

5469
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,910
oh okay yeah awesome so what's the
language in the codexes so those are

5470
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:47,920
language in the codexes so those are
 

5471
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:48,950
language in the codexes so those are
kind of

5472
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:48,960
kind of
 

5473
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,950
kind of
they're overlapping teams so it's like

5474
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:50,960
they're overlapping teams so it's like
 

5475
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,550
they're overlapping teams so it's like
gpt the raw language and then the codex

5476
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:54,560
gpt the raw language and then the codex
 

5477
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,030
gpt the raw language and then the codex
is like applied to programming

5478
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:57,040
is like applied to programming
 

5479
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,910
is like applied to programming
correct and they are quite intertwined

5480
01:39:59,910 --> 01:39:59,920
correct and they are quite intertwined
 

5481
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,430
correct and they are quite intertwined
there are many more teams involved

5482
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:01,440
there are many more teams involved
 

5483
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,350
there are many more teams involved
making these uh

5484
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:03,360
making these uh
 

5485
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,390
making these uh
models

5486
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:04,400
models
 

5487
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,629
models
extremely efficient and deployable for

5488
01:40:06,629 --> 01:40:06,639
extremely efficient and deployable for
 

5489
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:07,750
extremely efficient and deployable for
instance there are people who are

5490
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:07,760
instance there are people who are
 

5491
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,910
instance there are people who are
working to you know

5492
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:09,920
working to you know
 

5493
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,470
working to you know
make our data centers uh amazing or

5494
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:12,480
make our data centers uh amazing or
 

5495
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,629
make our data centers uh amazing or
there are people who work on pro putting

5496
01:40:14,629 --> 01:40:14,639
there are people who work on pro putting
 

5497
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,470
there are people who work on pro putting
these models into production

5498
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:16,480
these models into production
 

5499
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:17,510
these models into production
or uh

5500
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:17,520
or uh
 

5501
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,590
or uh
or even pushing it at the very limit of

5502
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:19,600
or even pushing it at the very limit of
 

5503
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,590
or even pushing it at the very limit of
the scale

5504
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:21,600
the scale
 

5505
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,350
the scale
so all aspects from from the

5506
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:23,360
so all aspects from from the
 

5507
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,030
so all aspects from from the
infrastructure to the actual machine

5508
01:40:25,030 --> 01:40:25,040
infrastructure to the actual machine
 

5509
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:25,990
infrastructure to the actual machine
learning so i'm just saying that

5510
01:40:25,990 --> 01:40:26,000
learning so i'm just saying that
 

5511
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,229
learning so i'm just saying that
multiple teams while the

5512
01:40:28,229 --> 01:40:28,239
multiple teams while the
 

5513
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,070
multiple teams while the
and the team working on codex and

5514
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:30,080
and the team working on codex and
 

5515
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,550
and the team working on codex and
language uh i guess i'm i'm directly

5516
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:32,560
language uh i guess i'm i'm directly
 

5517
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,470
language uh i guess i'm i'm directly
managing them i would like i would love

5518
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:34,480
managing them i would like i would love
 

5519
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,550
managing them i would like i would love
to hire yeah if you're interested in

5520
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:36,560
to hire yeah if you're interested in
 

5521
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,990
to hire yeah if you're interested in
machine learning

5522
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:38,000
machine learning
 

5523
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,189
machine learning
this is probably one of the most

5524
01:40:39,189 --> 01:40:39,199
this is probably one of the most
 

5525
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:42,550
this is probably one of the most
exciting uh problems and like systems to

5526
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:42,560
exciting uh problems and like systems to
 

5527
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,189
exciting uh problems and like systems to
be working on because it's actually it's

5528
01:40:45,189 --> 01:40:45,199
be working on because it's actually it's
 

5529
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:47,669
be working on because it's actually it's
it's pretty cool like what what uh the

5530
01:40:47,669 --> 01:40:47,679
it's pretty cool like what what uh the
 

5531
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:49,350
it's pretty cool like what what uh the
program synthesis like generating of

5532
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:49,360
program synthesis like generating of
 

5533
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,350
program synthesis like generating of
programs is very interesting very

5534
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:51,360
programs is very interesting very
 

5535
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:55,030
programs is very interesting very
interesting problem that has echoes of

5536
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:55,040
interesting problem that has echoes of
 

5537
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,590
interesting problem that has echoes of
reasoning and intelligence in it

5538
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:57,600
reasoning and intelligence in it
 

5539
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,109
reasoning and intelligence in it
it and i think there's a lot of

5540
01:40:59,109 --> 01:40:59,119
it and i think there's a lot of
 

5541
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:01,189
it and i think there's a lot of
fundamental questions that you might be

5542
01:41:01,189 --> 01:41:01,199
fundamental questions that you might be
 

5543
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:03,430
fundamental questions that you might be
able to sneak

5544
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:03,440
able to sneak
 

5545
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:06,390
able to sneak
sneak up to by generating programs yeah

5546
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:06,400
sneak up to by generating programs yeah
 

5547
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:08,390
sneak up to by generating programs yeah
the one more exciting thing about the

5548
01:41:08,390 --> 01:41:08,400
the one more exciting thing about the
 

5549
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:11,109
the one more exciting thing about the
programs is that so i said that the

5550
01:41:11,109 --> 01:41:11,119
programs is that so i said that the
 

5551
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,430
programs is that so i said that the
um you know the in case of language that

5552
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,440
um you know the in case of language that
 

5553
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,430
um you know the in case of language that
one of the troubles is even evaluating

5554
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:15,440
one of the troubles is even evaluating
 

5555
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:17,270
one of the troubles is even evaluating
language so when the things are made up

5556
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,280
language so when the things are made up
 

5557
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,149
language so when the things are made up
you you need somehow

5558
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:20,159
you you need somehow
 

5559
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:21,510
you you need somehow
either a human

5560
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:21,520
either a human
 

5561
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,910
either a human
to say that this doesn't make sense or

5562
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:23,920
to say that this doesn't make sense or
 

5563
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,070
to say that this doesn't make sense or
so in case of program there is one extra

5564
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:26,080
so in case of program there is one extra
 

5565
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,830
so in case of program there is one extra
level that we can actually execute

5566
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:27,840
level that we can actually execute
 

5567
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,310
level that we can actually execute
programs and see what they evaluate to

5568
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:30,320
programs and see what they evaluate to
 

5569
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:34,149
programs and see what they evaluate to
so that process might be somewhat

5570
01:41:34,149 --> 01:41:34,159
so that process might be somewhat
 

5571
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,629
so that process might be somewhat
more automated in in order to improve

5572
01:41:36,629 --> 01:41:36,639
more automated in in order to improve
 

5573
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:39,270
more automated in in order to improve
the uh qualities of generations and

5574
01:41:39,270 --> 01:41:39,280
the uh qualities of generations and
 

5575
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:41,830
the uh qualities of generations and
that's not saying so like the wow that's

5576
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:41,840
that's not saying so like the wow that's
 

5577
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,149
that's not saying so like the wow that's
really interesting so for the language

5578
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:44,159
really interesting so for the language
 

5579
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,470
really interesting so for the language
that you know the simulation to actually

5580
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:46,480
that you know the simulation to actually
 

5581
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,270
that you know the simulation to actually
execute it as a human mind yeah for

5582
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:49,280
execute it as a human mind yeah for
 

5583
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:52,070
execute it as a human mind yeah for
programs there is a there is a computer

5584
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:52,080
programs there is a there is a computer
 

5585
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,709
programs there is a there is a computer
on which you can evaluate it

5586
01:41:54,709 --> 01:41:54,719
on which you can evaluate it
 

5587
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:55,750
on which you can evaluate it
wow

5588
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:55,760
wow
 

5589
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:56,709
wow
that's a

5590
01:41:56,709 --> 01:41:56,719
that's a
 

5591
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:58,830
that's a
brilliant little

5592
01:41:58,830 --> 01:41:58,840
brilliant little
 

5593
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,550
brilliant little
insight that the thing compiles and runs

5594
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:02,560
insight that the thing compiles and runs
 

5595
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:03,910
insight that the thing compiles and runs
that's first

5596
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:03,920
that's first
 

5597
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,030
that's first
and second you can evaluate on a like do

5598
01:42:07,030 --> 01:42:07,040
and second you can evaluate on a like do
 

5599
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,350
and second you can evaluate on a like do
automated unit testing

5600
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:09,360
automated unit testing
 

5601
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,790
automated unit testing
and in some sense

5602
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:10,800
and in some sense
 

5603
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,550
and in some sense
it seems to me that we will be able to

5604
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:12,560
it seems to me that we will be able to
 

5605
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,709
it seems to me that we will be able to
make a tremendous progress you know

5606
01:42:14,709 --> 01:42:14,719
make a tremendous progress you know
 

5607
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,270
make a tremendous progress you know
we are in the paradigm that there is

5608
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,280
we are in the paradigm that there is
 

5609
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:20,310
we are in the paradigm that there is
way more data and there is like a

5610
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
way more data and there is like a
 

5611
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:23,350
way more data and there is like a
transcription of millions of uh of uh

5612
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:23,360
transcription of millions of uh of uh
 

5613
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,510
transcription of millions of uh of uh
software engineers yeah

5614
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:25,520
software engineers yeah
 

5615
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,189
software engineers yeah
yeah

5616
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:27,199
yeah
 

5617
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:28,149
yeah
so

5618
01:42:28,149 --> 01:42:28,159
so
 

5619
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:29,669
so
i mean you just me because i was going

5620
01:42:29,669 --> 01:42:29,679
i mean you just me because i was going
 

5621
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:31,830
i mean you just me because i was going
to ask you about reliability the thing

5622
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:31,840
to ask you about reliability the thing
 

5623
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,750
to ask you about reliability the thing
about programs is you don't know if

5624
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:33,760
about programs is you don't know if
 

5625
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,149
about programs is you don't know if
they're going to

5626
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:36,159
they're going to
 

5627
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,149
they're going to
like a program that's controlling a

5628
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:38,159
like a program that's controlling a
 

5629
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:40,390
like a program that's controlling a
nuclear power plant has to be very

5630
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:40,400
nuclear power plant has to be very
 

5631
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,030
nuclear power plant has to be very
reliable so i i wouldn't start with

5632
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:43,040
reliable so i i wouldn't start with
 

5633
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,870
reliable so i i wouldn't start with
controlling nuclear power plant can i be

5634
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:44,880
controlling nuclear power plant can i be
 

5635
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,870
controlling nuclear power plant can i be
one day but that that's not actually

5636
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:46,880
one day but that that's not actually
 

5637
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,790
one day but that that's not actually
that's not on the current roadmap that's

5638
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:48,800
that's not on the current roadmap that's
 

5639
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,830
that's not on the current roadmap that's
not that's step one and you know it's

5640
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:51,840
not that's step one and you know it's
 

5641
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,430
not that's step one and you know it's
the russian thing you just want to go to

5642
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:53,440
the russian thing you just want to go to
 

5643
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,189
the russian thing you just want to go to
the most powerful destructive thing

5644
01:42:55,189 --> 01:42:55,199
the most powerful destructive thing
 

5645
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:56,390
the most powerful destructive thing
right away

5646
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:56,400
right away
 

5647
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:58,550
right away
run by javascript but i got you so it's

5648
01:42:58,550 --> 01:42:58,560
run by javascript but i got you so it's
 

5649
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,470
run by javascript but i got you so it's
a lower impact but nevertheless what

5650
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:00,480
a lower impact but nevertheless what
 

5651
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:01,910
a lower impact but nevertheless what
you're making me realize

5652
01:43:01,910 --> 01:43:01,920
you're making me realize
 

5653
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,669
you're making me realize
it is possible to achieve some levels of

5654
01:43:03,669 --> 01:43:03,679
it is possible to achieve some levels of
 

5655
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,470
it is possible to achieve some levels of
reliability by doing testing

5656
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:06,480
reliability by doing testing
 

5657
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:07,910
reliability by doing testing
and i thought you could imagine that

5658
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:07,920
and i thought you could imagine that
 

5659
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,750
and i thought you could imagine that
them you know maybe there are ways for a

5660
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:09,760
them you know maybe there are ways for a
 

5661
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:10,870
them you know maybe there are ways for a
model to

5662
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:10,880
model to
 

5663
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,870
model to
write even code for testing itself and

5664
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:12,880
write even code for testing itself and
 

5665
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:13,830
write even code for testing itself and
so on

5666
01:43:13,830 --> 01:43:13,840
so on
 

5667
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,229
so on
and there exists a ways to create the

5668
01:43:16,229 --> 01:43:16,239
and there exists a ways to create the
 

5669
01:43:16,239 --> 01:43:18,550
and there exists a ways to create the
feedback loops that the model could keep

5670
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:18,560
feedback loops that the model could keep
 

5671
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,350
feedback loops that the model could keep
on improving

5672
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:21,360

 

5673
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:23,830

by writing programs that generate tests

5674
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:23,840
by writing programs that generate tests
 

5675
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:26,950
by writing programs that generate tests
for the instance for instance

5676
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:26,960
for the instance for instance
 

5677
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,870
for the instance for instance
and that's how we get consciousness

5678
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:28,880
and that's how we get consciousness
 

5679
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,790
and that's how we get consciousness
because it's meta compression that's

5680
01:43:30,790 --> 01:43:30,800
because it's meta compression that's
 

5681
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:31,990
because it's meta compression that's
what you're going to write that's the

5682
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:32,000
what you're going to write that's the
 

5683
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,669
what you're going to write that's the
comment that's the prompt that generates

5684
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:33,679
comment that's the prompt that generates
 

5685
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:34,870
comment that's the prompt that generates

5686
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:34,880
consciousness
 

5687
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,189
consciousness
compressor of compressors you just write

5688
01:43:37,189 --> 01:43:37,199
compressor of compressors you just write
 

5689
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:38,390
compressor of compressors you just write
that

5690
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,400
that
 

5691
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,990
that
do you think the code that generates

5692
01:43:39,990 --> 01:43:40,000
do you think the code that generates
 

5693
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,390
do you think the code that generates
consciousness would be simple

5694
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:42,400
consciousness would be simple
 

5695
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,590
consciousness would be simple
so

5696
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:43,600
so
 

5697
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,229
so
let's see i mean ultimately the core

5698
01:43:46,229 --> 01:43:46,239
let's see i mean ultimately the core
 

5699
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,470
let's see i mean ultimately the core
idea behind will be simple but there

5700
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:48,480
idea behind will be simple but there
 

5701
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,990
idea behind will be simple but there
will be also decent amount of

5702
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:50,000
will be also decent amount of
 

5703
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,030
will be also decent amount of
engineering

5704
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,040

 

5705
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:56,070

involved like in some sense

5706
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:56,080
involved like in some sense
 

5707
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,229
involved like in some sense
it seems that you know spreading these

5708
01:43:58,229 --> 01:43:58,239
it seems that you know spreading these
 

5709
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:00,629
it seems that you know spreading these
models on many machines

5710
01:44:00,629 --> 01:44:00,639
models on many machines
 

5711
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:03,350
models on many machines
and it's not that trivial yeah and

5712
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:03,360
and it's not that trivial yeah and
 

5713
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:06,229
and it's not that trivial yeah and
we find all sorts of innovations that

5714
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:06,239
we find all sorts of innovations that
 

5715
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,550
we find all sorts of innovations that
make our models more efficient

5716
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:08,560
make our models more efficient
 

5717
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:10,149
make our models more efficient
i believe that

5718
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:10,159
i believe that
 

5719
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,149
i believe that
first models

5720
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:12,159
first models
 

5721
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:13,750
first models
that i guess are conscious are like a

5722
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:13,760
that i guess are conscious are like a
 

5723
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,830
that i guess are conscious are like a
truly intelligent they will have all

5724
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:15,840
truly intelligent they will have all
 

5725
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:16,790
truly intelligent they will have all
sorts of

5726
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,800
sorts of
 

5727
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,950
sorts of
tricks

5728
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:18,960
tricks
 

5729
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,950
tricks
but then again there's uh

5730
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:20,960
but then again there's uh
 

5731
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,750
but then again there's uh
which is certain argument that maybe

5732
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:23,760
which is certain argument that maybe
 

5733
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:25,750
which is certain argument that maybe
the tricks are temporary thing yeah they

5734
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:25,760
the tricks are temporary thing yeah they
 

5735
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,109
the tricks are temporary thing yeah they
might be temporary things and in some

5736
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:27,119
might be temporary things and in some
 

5737
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,510
might be temporary things and in some
sense it's also even important

5738
01:44:29,510 --> 01:44:29,520
sense it's also even important
 

5739
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,510
sense it's also even important
to um

5740
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:31,520
to um
 

5741
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:32,310
to um
to

5742
01:44:32,310 --> 01:44:32,320
to
 

5743
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,229
to
know that even the cost of a trick so

5744
01:44:34,229 --> 01:44:34,239
know that even the cost of a trick so
 

5745
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:36,629
know that even the cost of a trick so
sometimes people are eager to put the

5746
01:44:36,629 --> 01:44:36,639
sometimes people are eager to put the
 

5747
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:37,510
sometimes people are eager to put the
trick

5748
01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:37,520
trick
 

5749
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,070
trick
while forgetting that there is a cost of

5750
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,080
while forgetting that there is a cost of
 

5751
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:41,189
while forgetting that there is a cost of
maintenance

5752
01:44:41,189 --> 01:44:41,199
maintenance
 

5753
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:43,669
maintenance
or like a long-term cost long-term cost

5754
01:44:43,669 --> 01:44:43,679
or like a long-term cost long-term cost
 

5755
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:46,790
or like a long-term cost long-term cost
or maintenance or maybe even

5756
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
or maintenance or maybe even
 

5757
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,470
or maintenance or maybe even
flexibility of code to actually

5758
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:48,480
flexibility of code to actually
 

5759
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,149
flexibility of code to actually
implement new ideas so even if you have

5760
01:44:50,149 --> 01:44:50,159
implement new ideas so even if you have
 

5761
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,310
implement new ideas so even if you have
something that gives you 2x but it

5762
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:52,320
something that gives you 2x but it
 

5763
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:55,109
something that gives you 2x but it
requires you know 1000 lines of code i'm

5764
01:44:55,109 --> 01:44:55,119
requires you know 1000 lines of code i'm
 

5765
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:57,189
requires you know 1000 lines of code i'm
not sure if it's actually worth it so in

5766
01:44:57,189 --> 01:44:57,199
not sure if it's actually worth it so in
 

5767
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:59,430
not sure if it's actually worth it so in
some sense you know if it's five lines

5768
01:44:59,430 --> 01:44:59,440
some sense you know if it's five lines
 

5769
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:02,629
some sense you know if it's five lines
of code and 2x i would take it

5770
01:45:02,629 --> 01:45:02,639
of code and 2x i would take it
 

5771
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:05,590
of code and 2x i would take it
and and we we we see many of this but

5772
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:05,600
and and we we we see many of this but
 

5773
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,830
and and we we we see many of this but
also you know that requires some level

5774
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:07,840
also you know that requires some level
 

5775
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,270
also you know that requires some level
of

5776
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:09,280
of
 

5777
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,830
of
i guess lack of attachment to code that

5778
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:11,840
i guess lack of attachment to code that
 

5779
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,669
i guess lack of attachment to code that
we are willing to remove it yeah

5780
01:45:15,669 --> 01:45:15,679
we are willing to remove it yeah
 

5781
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:18,870
we are willing to remove it yeah
so you led the open ai robotics team can

5782
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:18,880
so you led the open ai robotics team can
 

5783
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,790
so you led the open ai robotics team can
you give an overview of of the cool

5784
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:20,800
you give an overview of of the cool
 

5785
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,310
you give an overview of of the cool
things you're able to accomplish what

5786
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,320
things you're able to accomplish what
 

5787
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:23,910
things you're able to accomplish what
are you most proud of

5788
01:45:23,910 --> 01:45:23,920
are you most proud of
 

5789
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,750
are you most proud of
so when we started robotics we knew that

5790
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:25,760
so when we started robotics we knew that
 

5791
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,270
so when we started robotics we knew that
actually reinforcement learning works

5792
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:27,280
actually reinforcement learning works
 

5793
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,109
actually reinforcement learning works
and it is possible to

5794
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:29,119
and it is possible to
 

5795
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:31,350
and it is possible to
solve very complicated problems

5796
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:31,360
solve very complicated problems
 

5797
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,510
solve very complicated problems
like for instance alphago is an evidence

5798
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:33,520
like for instance alphago is an evidence
 

5799
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:36,310
like for instance alphago is an evidence
that it is possible to to build

5800
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:36,320
that it is possible to to build
 

5801
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:40,149
that it is possible to to build
superhuman and gold players dota 2 is a

5802
01:45:40,149 --> 01:45:40,159
superhuman and gold players dota 2 is a
 

5803
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:42,629
superhuman and gold players dota 2 is a
an evidence that is possible to

5804
01:45:42,629 --> 01:45:42,639
an evidence that is possible to
 

5805
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:45,430
an evidence that is possible to
build superhuman uh

5806
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:45,440
build superhuman uh
 

5807
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,990
build superhuman uh
agents playing dota so i asked myself a

5808
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:48,000
agents playing dota so i asked myself a
 

5809
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,990
agents playing dota so i asked myself a
question you know what about robots out

5810
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:50,000
question you know what about robots out
 

5811
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,870
question you know what about robots out
there could we train machines to solve

5812
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:52,880
there could we train machines to solve
 

5813
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,510
there could we train machines to solve
arbitrary tasks in the physical world

5814
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:55,520
arbitrary tasks in the physical world
 

5815
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,310
arbitrary tasks in the physical world
our approach was i guess let's pick a

5816
01:45:58,310 --> 01:45:58,320
our approach was i guess let's pick a
 

5817
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,790
our approach was i guess let's pick a
complicated problem that

5818
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:00,800
complicated problem that
 

5819
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,790
complicated problem that
if we would solve it that means that we

5820
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:02,800
if we would solve it that means that we
 

5821
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:05,430
if we would solve it that means that we
made some uh significant progress in the

5822
01:46:05,430 --> 01:46:05,440
made some uh significant progress in the
 

5823
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,270
made some uh significant progress in the
domain and then we went after the

5824
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:07,280
domain and then we went after the
 

5825
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,229
domain and then we went after the
problem

5826
01:46:08,229 --> 01:46:08,239
problem
 

5827
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:11,590
problem
so um we noticed that actually the

5828
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:11,600
so um we noticed that actually the
 

5829
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,350
so um we noticed that actually the
robots out there they are kind of at the

5830
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:13,360
robots out there they are kind of at the
 

5831
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,350
robots out there they are kind of at the
moment optimized per task so you can

5832
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:15,360
moment optimized per task so you can
 

5833
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:17,830
moment optimized per task so you can
have a robot that it's like if you have

5834
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:17,840
have a robot that it's like if you have
 

5835
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,990
have a robot that it's like if you have
a robot opening a battle it's very

5836
01:46:19,990 --> 01:46:20,000
a robot opening a battle it's very
 

5837
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,910
a robot opening a battle it's very
likely that the end factor is a battle

5838
01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:21,920
likely that the end factor is a battle
 

5839
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,990
likely that the end factor is a battle
opener

5840
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:24,000
opener
 

5841
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:24,950
opener
and

5842
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:24,960
and
 

5843
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,709
and
and in some sense that's a hack to be

5844
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:26,719
and in some sense that's a hack to be
 

5845
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:28,629
and in some sense that's a hack to be
able to solve a task which makes any

5846
01:46:28,629 --> 01:46:28,639
able to solve a task which makes any
 

5847
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:31,990
able to solve a task which makes any
task easier and um ask myself so what

5848
01:46:31,990 --> 01:46:32,000
task easier and um ask myself so what
 

5849
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,750
task easier and um ask myself so what
would be a robot that can actually solve

5850
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:33,760
would be a robot that can actually solve
 

5851
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,790
would be a robot that can actually solve
many tasks yeah and we conclude that

5852
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:36,800
many tasks yeah and we conclude that
 

5853
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:37,910
many tasks yeah and we conclude that
that

5854
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:37,920
that
 

5855
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,109
that
like a human hands have such a quality

5856
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:41,119
like a human hands have such a quality
 

5857
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:44,070
like a human hands have such a quality
that indeed they are you know you have

5858
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:44,080
that indeed they are you know you have
 

5859
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,109
that indeed they are you know you have
five kind of tiny arms attached

5860
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:47,119
five kind of tiny arms attached
 

5861
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:49,750
five kind of tiny arms attached
individually they can manipulate

5862
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:49,760
individually they can manipulate
 

5863
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:52,149
individually they can manipulate
pretty broad spectrum of objects so we

5864
01:46:52,149 --> 01:46:52,159
pretty broad spectrum of objects so we
 

5865
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:55,030
pretty broad spectrum of objects so we
went after a single hand like a trying

5866
01:46:55,030 --> 01:46:55,040
went after a single hand like a trying
 

5867
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:57,430
went after a single hand like a trying
to solve rubik's cube single-handed we

5868
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:57,440
to solve rubik's cube single-handed we
 

5869
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,350
to solve rubik's cube single-handed we
picked this task because we thought that

5870
01:46:59,350 --> 01:46:59,360
picked this task because we thought that
 

5871
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,950
picked this task because we thought that
there is no way to

5872
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:00,960
there is no way to
 

5873
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,109
there is no way to
harcode it and it's also we picked the

5874
01:47:03,109 --> 01:47:03,119
harcode it and it's also we picked the
 

5875
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:04,870
harcode it and it's also we picked the
robot on which it would be hard to

5876
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:04,880
robot on which it would be hard to
 

5877
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,629
robot on which it would be hard to
hardcode it and

5878
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:06,639
hardcode it and
 

5879
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,430
hardcode it and
we went after the solution such that

5880
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:09,440
we went after the solution such that
 

5881
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,350
we went after the solution such that
it could generalize to other problems

5882
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:11,360
it could generalize to other problems
 

5883
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:13,590
it could generalize to other problems
and just to clarify it's

5884
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:13,600
and just to clarify it's
 

5885
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,750
and just to clarify it's
one robotic hand solving the rubik's

5886
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:15,760
one robotic hand solving the rubik's
 

5887
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,070
one robotic hand solving the rubik's
cube the hard part isn't the solution to

5888
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:18,080
cube the hard part isn't the solution to
 

5889
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,470
cube the hard part isn't the solution to
the rubik's cube is the manipulation of

5890
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:20,480
the rubik's cube is the manipulation of
 

5891
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:23,270
the rubik's cube is the manipulation of
the uh of like having it not fall out of

5892
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:23,280
the uh of like having it not fall out of
 

5893
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,030
the uh of like having it not fall out of
the hand having it

5894
01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:25,040
the hand having it
 

5895
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,550
the hand having it
use the uh

5896
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:26,560
use the uh
 

5897
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,629
use the uh
five baby arms

5898
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:28,639
five baby arms
 

5899
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:30,790
five baby arms
to uh what is it like rotate different

5900
01:47:30,790 --> 01:47:30,800
to uh what is it like rotate different
 

5901
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,709
to uh what is it like rotate different
parts of the rubik's cube to achieve the

5902
01:47:32,709 --> 01:47:32,719
parts of the rubik's cube to achieve the
 

5903
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:36,229
parts of the rubik's cube to achieve the
solution correct yeah so what uh what

5904
01:47:36,229 --> 01:47:36,239
solution correct yeah so what uh what
 

5905
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:38,550
solution correct yeah so what uh what
was the hardest part about that

5906
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:38,560
was the hardest part about that
 

5907
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,470
was the hardest part about that
what was the approach taken there what

5908
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:40,480
what was the approach taken there what
 

5909
01:47:40,480 --> 01:47:42,310
what was the approach taken there what
are you most proud of obviously we have

5910
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:42,320
are you most proud of obviously we have
 

5911
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,149
are you most proud of obviously we have
like a strong belief in reinforcement

5912
01:47:44,149 --> 01:47:44,159
like a strong belief in reinforcement
 

5913
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,189
like a strong belief in reinforcement
learning

5914
01:47:45,189 --> 01:47:45,199

5915
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:46,709

and uh

5916
01:47:46,709 --> 01:47:46,719
and uh
 

5917
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:48,550
and uh
you know one path it is to do

5918
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:48,560
you know one path it is to do
 

5919
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,950
you know one path it is to do
reinforcement learning the real world

5920
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:50,960
reinforcement learning the real world
 

5921
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:52,870
reinforcement learning the real world
other path is to

5922
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:52,880
other path is to
 

5923
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,590
other path is to
the simulation in some sense the

5924
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:55,600
the simulation in some sense the
 

5925
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,590
the simulation in some sense the
tricky part about the real world is at

5926
01:47:57,590 --> 01:47:57,600
tricky part about the real world is at
 

5927
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,750
tricky part about the real world is at
the moment our models they require a lot

5928
01:47:59,750 --> 01:47:59,760
the moment our models they require a lot
 

5929
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,830
the moment our models they require a lot
of data there is essentially no data

5930
01:48:02,830 --> 01:48:02,840
of data there is essentially no data
 

5931
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:05,990
of data there is essentially no data
and i did we decided to go through the

5932
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:06,000
and i did we decided to go through the
 

5933
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,990
and i did we decided to go through the
path of the simulation and in simulation

5934
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:08,000
path of the simulation and in simulation
 

5935
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,070
path of the simulation and in simulation
you can have infinite amount of data the

5936
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:10,080
you can have infinite amount of data the
 

5937
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,830
you can have infinite amount of data the
tricky part is the fidelity of the

5938
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:11,840
tricky part is the fidelity of the
 

5939
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:14,709
tricky part is the fidelity of the
simulation and also can you in

5940
01:48:14,709 --> 01:48:14,719
simulation and also can you in
 

5941
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:16,390
simulation and also can you in
simulation represent everything that you

5942
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:16,400
simulation represent everything that you
 

5943
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:19,030
simulation represent everything that you
represent otherwise in the real world

5944
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:19,040
represent otherwise in the real world
 

5945
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,830
represent otherwise in the real world
and you know it turned out that uh

5946
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:21,840
and you know it turned out that uh
 

5947
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,350
and you know it turned out that uh
that you know because there is lack of

5948
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:23,360
that you know because there is lack of
 

5949
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,950
that you know because there is lack of
fidelity it is possible to that what we

5950
01:48:26,950 --> 01:48:26,960
fidelity it is possible to that what we
 

5951
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,070
fidelity it is possible to that what we
what we

5952
01:48:28,070 --> 01:48:28,080
what we
 

5953
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,390
what we
arrived at is training a model that

5954
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:30,400
arrived at is training a model that
 

5955
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,629
arrived at is training a model that
doesn't solve one simulation but it

5956
01:48:32,629 --> 01:48:32,639
doesn't solve one simulation but it
 

5957
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:34,229
doesn't solve one simulation but it
actually solves the

5958
01:48:34,229 --> 01:48:34,239
actually solves the
 

5959
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:36,629
actually solves the
entire range of simulations which uh

5960
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:36,639
entire range of simulations which uh
 

5961
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:39,830
entire range of simulations which uh
vary uh in terms of like uh what's the

5962
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:39,840
vary uh in terms of like uh what's the
 

5963
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,310
vary uh in terms of like uh what's the
exactly the friction of that cube or the

5964
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:42,320
exactly the friction of that cube or the
 

5965
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:43,590
exactly the friction of that cube or the
weight or so

5966
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:43,600
weight or so
 

5967
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,629
weight or so
and the

5968
01:48:44,629 --> 01:48:44,639
and the
 

5969
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:46,870
and the
single ai that can solve all of them

5970
01:48:46,870 --> 01:48:46,880
single ai that can solve all of them
 

5971
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:49,270
single ai that can solve all of them
ends up working well with the reality

5972
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:49,280
ends up working well with the reality
 

5973
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,550
ends up working well with the reality
how do you generate the different

5974
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:50,560
how do you generate the different
 

5975
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,390
how do you generate the different
simulations so

5976
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:52,400
simulations so
 

5977
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,910
simulations so
you know there's plenty of parameters

5978
01:48:53,910 --> 01:48:53,920
you know there's plenty of parameters
 

5979
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,189
you know there's plenty of parameters
out there we just pick them randomly and

5980
01:48:57,189 --> 01:48:57,199
out there we just pick them randomly and
 

5981
01:48:57,199 --> 01:49:00,070
out there we just pick them randomly and
and in simulation model just goes for

5982
01:49:00,070 --> 01:49:00,080
and in simulation model just goes for
 

5983
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,229
and in simulation model just goes for
thousands of years and keeps on solving

5984
01:49:02,229 --> 01:49:02,239
thousands of years and keeps on solving
 

5985
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:04,070
thousands of years and keeps on solving
rubik's cube in each of them and the

5986
01:49:04,070 --> 01:49:04,080
rubik's cube in each of them and the
 

5987
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,950
rubik's cube in each of them and the
thing is the neural network that we used

5988
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:06,960
thing is the neural network that we used
 

5989
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,350
thing is the neural network that we used
it has a memory

5990
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:09,360
it has a memory
 

5991
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,550
it has a memory
and as it presses for instance the side

5992
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:12,560
and as it presses for instance the side
 

5993
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,070
and as it presses for instance the side
of the of the cube it can sense oh

5994
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,080
of the of the cube it can sense oh
 

5995
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:18,229
of the of the cube it can sense oh
that's actually this side was

5996
01:49:18,229 --> 01:49:18,239
that's actually this side was
 

5997
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:20,629
that's actually this side was
uh difficult to press i should press it

5998
01:49:20,629 --> 01:49:20,639
uh difficult to press i should press it
 

5999
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,109
uh difficult to press i should press it
stronger and throughout this process

6000
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:23,119
stronger and throughout this process
 

6001
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:24,229

you know sometimes when you
 

6013
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:36,229
you know sometimes when you
go to a gym and after

6014
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:36,239
go to a gym and after
 

6015
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:38,709
go to a gym and after
after bench press you

6016
01:49:38,709 --> 01:49:38,719
after bench press you
 

6017
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:41,830
after bench press you
try to lift the

6018
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:41,840
try to lift the
 

6019
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,109
try to lift the
and you kind of forgot uh and and your

6020
01:49:45,109 --> 01:49:45,119
and you kind of forgot uh and and your
 

6021
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:47,270
and you kind of forgot uh and and your
hand goes like yeah right away because

6022
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:47,280
hand goes like yeah right away because
 

6023
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,669
hand goes like yeah right away because
kind of you got this to maybe different

6024
01:49:49,669 --> 01:49:49,679
kind of you got this to maybe different
 

6025
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:51,430
kind of you got this to maybe different
weight yeah and it takes a second to

6026
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:51,440
weight yeah and it takes a second to
 

6027
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:52,950
weight yeah and it takes a second to
adjust yeah

6028
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:52,960
adjust yeah
 

6029
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:55,750
adjust yeah
and this kind of of a memory that model

6030
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:55,760
and this kind of of a memory that model
 

6031

i appreciate you speaking to the
 

6039
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:03,270
i appreciate you speaking to the
audience with the bench press all the

6040
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:03,280
audience with the bench press all the
 

6041
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,950
audience with the bench press all the
bros in the audience

6042
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:04,960
bros in the audience
 

6043
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,390
bros in the audience
probably working out right now there's

6044
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:06,400
probably working out right now there's
 

6045
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,750
probably working out right now there's
probably somebody listening to this

6046
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:07,760
probably somebody listening to this
 

6047
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:10,070
probably somebody listening to this
actually doing bench press

6048
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:10,080
actually doing bench press
 

6049
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,430
actually doing bench press
so maybe

6050
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:11,440
so maybe
 

6051
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:13,189
so maybe
uh put the bar down and pick up the

6052
01:50:13,189 --> 01:50:13,199
uh put the bar down and pick up the
 

6053
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:15,669
uh put the bar down and pick up the
water bottle and you'll know exactly

6054
01:50:15,669 --> 01:50:15,679
water bottle and you'll know exactly
 

6055
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,550
water bottle and you'll know exactly
what uh what check is talking about okay

6056
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:18,560
what uh what check is talking about okay
 

6057
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,149
what uh what check is talking about okay
so what uh

6058
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:22,159

 

6059
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:23,750

what was the hardest part of getting the

6060
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:23,760
what was the hardest part of getting the
 

6061
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:25,830
what was the hardest part of getting the
whole thing to work so the hardest part

6062
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:25,840
whole thing to work so the hardest part
 

6063
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,350
whole thing to work so the hardest part
is

6064
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:27,360
is
 

6065
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,589
is
at the moment when it comes to a

6066
01:50:29,589 --> 01:50:29,599
at the moment when it comes to a
 

6067
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:31,270
at the moment when it comes to a
physical world

6068
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:31,280
physical world
 

6069
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,430
physical world
when it comes to robots

6070
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:33,440
when it comes to robots
 

6071
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:35,990
when it comes to robots
they require maintenance it's hard to

6072
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:36,000
they require maintenance it's hard to
 

6073
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,790
they require maintenance it's hard to
replicate a million times it's

6074
01:50:38,790 --> 01:50:38,800
replicate a million times it's
 

6075
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:41,030
replicate a million times it's
it's also it's hard to replay things

6076
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:41,040
it's also it's hard to replay things
 

6077
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,070
it's also it's hard to replay things
exactly

6078
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:42,080
exactly
 

6079
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:45,189
exactly
i remember this situation that

6080
01:50:45,189 --> 01:50:45,199
i remember this situation that
 

6081
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:46,310
i remember this situation that
one guy

6082
01:50:46,310 --> 01:50:46,320
one guy
 

6083
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,950
one guy
at our company he had like a model that

6084
01:50:48,950 --> 01:50:48,960
at our company he had like a model that
 

6085
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,589
at our company he had like a model that
performs way better than other models in

6086
01:50:51,589 --> 01:50:51,599
performs way better than other models in
 

6087
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:53,990
performs way better than other models in
solving rubik's cube and

6088
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,000
solving rubik's cube and
 

6089
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,149
solving rubik's cube and
you know we kind of didn't know what's

6090
01:50:56,149 --> 01:50:56,159
you know we kind of didn't know what's
 

6091
01:50:56,159 --> 01:50:57,350
you know we kind of didn't know what's
going on

6092
01:50:57,350 --> 01:50:57,360
going on
 

6093
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,870
going on
why it's that

6094
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:58,880
why it's that
 

6095
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,470
why it's that
and

6096
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,480
and
 

6097
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,070
and
it turned out

6098
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:02,080
it turned out
 

6099
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:04,470
it turned out
that you know he was running it from his

6100
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:04,480
that you know he was running it from his
 

6101
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,470
that you know he was running it from his
laptop that had better cpu

6102
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:06,480
laptop that had better cpu
 

6103
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:07,350
laptop that had better cpu
or

6104
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:07,360
or
 

6105
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:10,390
or
uh or better or maybe local gpu as well

6106
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:10,400
uh or better or maybe local gpu as well
 

6107
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,709
uh or better or maybe local gpu as well
and uh because of that there was less of

6108
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:12,719
and uh because of that there was less of
 

6109
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,589
and uh because of that there was less of
a latency and the model was the same

6110
01:51:15,589 --> 01:51:15,599
a latency and the model was the same
 

6111
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:17,350
a latency and the model was the same
and that actually

6112
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:17,360
and that actually
 

6113
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:19,510
and that actually
made solving rubik's cube more reliable

6114
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:19,520
made solving rubik's cube more reliable
 

6115
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,350
made solving rubik's cube more reliable
so in some sense there might be some

6116
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:21,360
so in some sense there might be some
 

6117
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,510
so in some sense there might be some
saddlebacks like that when it comes to

6118
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:23,520
saddlebacks like that when it comes to
 

6119
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,430
saddlebacks like that when it comes to
running things in the real world

6120
01:51:25,430 --> 01:51:25,440
running things in the real world
 

6121
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,510
running things in the real world
even hinting on that

6122
01:51:27,510 --> 01:51:27,520
even hinting on that
 

6123
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:29,270
even hinting on that
you could imagine that the initial

6124
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:29,280
you could imagine that the initial
 

6125
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,950
you could imagine that the initial
models you would like to have models

6126
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:30,960
models you would like to have models
 

6127
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:33,510
models you would like to have models
which are insanely huge neural networks

6128
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:33,520
which are insanely huge neural networks
 

6129
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,910
which are insanely huge neural networks
and you would like to give them even

6130
01:51:35,910 --> 01:51:35,920
and you would like to give them even
 

6131
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:37,669
and you would like to give them even
more time for thinking

6132
01:51:37,669 --> 01:51:37,679
more time for thinking
 

6133
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:39,669
more time for thinking
and when you have these real-time

6134
01:51:39,669 --> 01:51:39,679
and when you have these real-time
 

6135
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:41,430
and when you have these real-time
systems

6136
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:41,440
systems
 

6137
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,229
systems
then

6138
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:42,239
then
 

6139
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:43,990
then
you might be constrained actually by the

6140
01:51:43,990 --> 01:51:44,000
you might be constrained actually by the
 

6141
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,910
you might be constrained actually by the
amount of latency

6142
01:51:45,910 --> 01:51:45,920
amount of latency
 

6143
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,109
amount of latency
and

6144
01:51:47,109 --> 01:51:47,119
and
 

6145
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:48,629
and
ultimately i would like to build the

6146
01:51:48,629 --> 01:51:48,639
ultimately i would like to build the
 

6147
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:50,470
ultimately i would like to build the
system that it is

6148
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:50,480
system that it is
 

6149
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,870
system that it is
worth for you to wait five minutes

6150
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:52,880
worth for you to wait five minutes
 

6151
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,950
worth for you to wait five minutes
because it gives you the answer

6152
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:54,960
because it gives you the answer
 

6153
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,709
because it gives you the answer
that you are willing to wait for five

6154
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:56,719
that you are willing to wait for five
 

6155
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:59,350
that you are willing to wait for five
minutes so latency is a very unpleasant

6156
01:51:59,350 --> 01:51:59,360
minutes so latency is a very unpleasant
 

6157
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:01,830
minutes so latency is a very unpleasant
constraint underwish to operate correct

6158
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:01,840
constraint underwish to operate correct
 

6159
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,750
constraint underwish to operate correct
and also there is actually one more

6160
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:03,760
and also there is actually one more
 

6161
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:06,470
and also there is actually one more
thing which is tricky about robots

6162
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:06,480
thing which is tricky about robots
 

6163
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,229
thing which is tricky about robots
there is actually

6164
01:52:08,229 --> 01:52:08,239
there is actually
 

6165
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:10,709
there is actually
no not much data so the data that i'm

6166
01:52:10,709 --> 01:52:10,719
no not much data so the data that i'm
 

6167
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:14,390
no not much data so the data that i'm
speaking about would be a data of

6168
01:52:14,390 --> 01:52:14,400
speaking about would be a data of
 

6169
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,870
speaking about would be a data of
first person experience from the robot

6170
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:16,880
first person experience from the robot
 

6171
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,030
first person experience from the robot
and like a gigabytes of data like that

6172
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:19,040
and like a gigabytes of data like that
 

6173
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,950
and like a gigabytes of data like that
if we would have gigabytes of data like

6174
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:20,960
if we would have gigabytes of data like
 

6175
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:23,270
if we would have gigabytes of data like
that of robot solving various problems

6176
01:52:23,270 --> 01:52:23,280
that of robot solving various problems
 

6177
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,270
that of robot solving various problems
it would be very easy to make a progress

6178
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:25,280
it would be very easy to make a progress
 

6179
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:27,669
it would be very easy to make a progress
on robotics and you can see that in case

6180
01:52:27,669 --> 01:52:27,679
on robotics and you can see that in case
 

6181
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,310
on robotics and you can see that in case
of text or code there is a lot of data

6182
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:30,320
of text or code there is a lot of data
 

6183
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:32,629
of text or code there is a lot of data
like a first person perspective data on

6184
01:52:32,629 --> 01:52:32,639
like a first person perspective data on
 

6185
01:52:32,639 --> 01:52:34,709
like a first person perspective data on
the writing code

6186
01:52:34,709 --> 01:52:34,719
the writing code
 

6187
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:36,470
the writing code
yeah so you had this

6188
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:36,480
yeah so you had this
 

6189
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,149
yeah so you had this
you mentioned this really interesting

6190
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:38,159
you mentioned this really interesting
 

6191
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:39,750
you mentioned this really interesting
idea that

6192
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:39,760
idea that
 

6193
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,830
idea that
if you were to build like a successful

6194
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:41,840
if you were to build like a successful
 

6195
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,470
if you were to build like a successful
robotics company so open as mission is

6196
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:44,480
robotics company so open as mission is
 

6197
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,229
robotics company so open as mission is
much bigger than robotics this is one of

6198
01:52:46,229 --> 01:52:46,239
much bigger than robotics this is one of
 

6199
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:47,030
much bigger than robotics this is one of
the

6200
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:47,040
the
 

6201
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,950
the
one of the things you've worked on

6202
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:48,960
one of the things you've worked on
 

6203
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,510
one of the things you've worked on
but if it was a robotics company they

6204
01:52:51,510 --> 01:52:51,520
but if it was a robotics company they
 

6205
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:53,350
but if it was a robotics company they
you wouldn't so quickly dismiss

6206
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:53,360
you wouldn't so quickly dismiss
 

6207
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,750
you wouldn't so quickly dismiss
supervised learning i correct that you

6208
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:55,760
supervised learning i correct that you
 

6209
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,629
supervised learning i correct that you
would build a robot

6210
01:52:58,629 --> 01:52:58,639
would build a robot
 

6211
01:52:58,639 --> 01:52:59,830
would build a robot
that

6212
01:52:59,830 --> 01:52:59,840
that
 

6213
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,229
that
was perhaps one like

6214
01:53:02,229 --> 01:53:02,239
was perhaps one like
 

6215
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,870
was perhaps one like
um an empty shell like dumb and they

6216
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:04,880
um an empty shell like dumb and they
 

6217
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,589
um an empty shell like dumb and they
would operate under tele operation

6218
01:53:07,589 --> 01:53:07,599
would operate under tele operation
 

6219
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:09,510
would operate under tele operation
so you would invest

6220
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:09,520
so you would invest
 

6221
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,830
so you would invest
that's just one way to do it invest in

6222
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:11,840
that's just one way to do it invest in
 

6223
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,149
that's just one way to do it invest in
human super like direct human control of

6224
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:14,159
human super like direct human control of
 

6225
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,709
human super like direct human control of
the robots as it's learning and over

6226
01:53:16,709 --> 01:53:16,719
the robots as it's learning and over
 

6227
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:19,270
the robots as it's learning and over
time add more and more automation

6228
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:19,280
time add more and more automation
 

6229
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,350
time add more and more automation
that's correct so let's say that's how i

6230
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:21,360
that's correct so let's say that's how i
 

6231
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:23,669
that's correct so let's say that's how i
would build a robotics company today

6232
01:53:23,669 --> 01:53:23,679
would build a robotics company today
 

6233
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:24,950
would build a robotics company today
if i would be building a robotics

6234
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
if i would be building a robotics
 

6235
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,470
if i would be building a robotics
company which is you know spent 10

6236
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:26,480
company which is you know spent 10
 

6237
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,629
company which is you know spent 10
million dollars or so

6238
01:53:28,629 --> 01:53:28,639
million dollars or so
 

6239
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:31,109
million dollars or so
recording human trajectories controlling

6240
01:53:31,109 --> 01:53:31,119
recording human trajectories controlling
 

6241
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:34,390
recording human trajectories controlling
a robot after you find

6242
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:34,400
a robot after you find
 

6243
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,550
a robot after you find
a thing that the robot should be doing

6244
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:36,560
a thing that the robot should be doing
 

6245
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,709
a thing that the robot should be doing
that there's a market fit for like that

6246
01:53:38,709 --> 01:53:38,719
that there's a market fit for like that
 

6247
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:39,990
that there's a market fit for like that
you can make a lot of money with that

6248
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:40,000
you can make a lot of money with that
 

6249
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,070
you can make a lot of money with that
product correct correct yeah

6250
01:53:42,070 --> 01:53:42,080
product correct correct yeah
 

6251
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:43,109
product correct correct yeah
so

6252
01:53:43,109 --> 01:53:43,119
so
 

6253
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:44,790
so
i would record data and then i would

6254
01:53:44,790 --> 01:53:44,800
i would record data and then i would
 

6255
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:46,950
i would record data and then i would
essentially train supervised learning

6256
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:46,960
essentially train supervised learning
 

6257
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,149
essentially train supervised learning
model on it

6258
01:53:48,149 --> 01:53:48,159
model on it
 

6259
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:50,310
model on it
that might be the path today

6260
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:50,320
that might be the path today
 

6261
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,229
that might be the path today
long term i think that actually what is

6262
01:53:52,229 --> 01:53:52,239
long term i think that actually what is
 

6263
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:56,310
long term i think that actually what is
needed is to train powerful models over

6264
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:56,320
needed is to train powerful models over
 

6265
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,510
needed is to train powerful models over
video

6266
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:57,520
video
 

6267
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:58,390
video
so

6268
01:53:58,390 --> 01:53:58,400
so
 

6269
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:01,189
so
um you have seen maybe a models that can

6270
01:54:01,189 --> 01:54:01,199
um you have seen maybe a models that can
 

6271
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:03,830
um you have seen maybe a models that can
generate images like dali

6272
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:03,840
generate images like dali
 

6273
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,830
generate images like dali
and people are looking into models

6274
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:05,840
and people are looking into models
 

6275
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,310
and people are looking into models
generating videos they're like various

6276
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:08,320
generating videos they're like various
 

6277
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,470
generating videos they're like various
algorithmic questions even how to do it

6278
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:10,480
algorithmic questions even how to do it
 

6279
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:11,910
algorithmic questions even how to do it
and it's unclear if there is enough

6280
01:54:11,910 --> 01:54:11,920
and it's unclear if there is enough
 

6281
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,669
and it's unclear if there is enough
compute for this purpose

6282
01:54:13,669 --> 01:54:13,679
compute for this purpose
 

6283
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:14,629
compute for this purpose
but

6284
01:54:14,629 --> 01:54:14,639
but
 

6285
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,669
but
i i suspect that the models that which

6286
01:54:17,669 --> 01:54:17,679
i i suspect that the models that which
 

6287
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:19,589
i i suspect that the models that which
would have a

6288
01:54:19,589 --> 01:54:19,599
would have a
 

6289
01:54:19,599 --> 01:54:22,310
would have a

to train robots to solve tasks they

6298
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:29,440
to train robots to solve tasks they
 

6299
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:32,550
to train robots to solve tasks they
would have a lot of common sense

6300
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:32,560
would have a lot of common sense
 

6301
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:33,830
would have a lot of common sense
if one day

if one day
 

6303
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,510
if one day
i'm pretty sure one day

01:54:46,229 --> 01:54:46,239
that is worth over
 

6313
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:48,709
that is worth over
1 trillion dollars

what do you think that company will do i
think self-driving cars no

6318
01:54:53,109 --> 01:54:53,119
think self-driving cars no
 

6319
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,109
think self-driving cars no
it's interesting because my mind went to

01:54:55,109 --> 01:54:55,119
it's interesting because my mind went to
 

6321
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:57,750
it's interesting because my mind went to
personal robotics robots in the home

it seems like there's much more market

6324
01:54:59,510 --> 01:54:59,520
it seems like there's much more market
 

6325
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:00,870
it seems like there's much more market
opportunity there

6326
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:00,880
opportunity there
 

6327
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:04,950
opportunity there
i think it's very difficult to achieve

6328
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:04,960
i think it's very difficult to achieve
 

6329
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,870
i think it's very difficult to achieve
i mean this this

6330
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:06,880
i mean this this
 

6331
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,950
i mean this this
this might speak to something important

6332
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:08,960
this might speak to something important
 

6333
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,870
this might speak to something important
which is i understand self-driving much

6334
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:10,880
which is i understand self-driving much
 

6335
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,390
which is i understand self-driving much
better than understand robotics in the

6336
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:12,400
better than understand robotics in the
 

6337
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,790
better than understand robotics in the
home so i understand how difficult it is

6338
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:14,800
home so i understand how difficult it is
 

6339
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:17,669
home so i understand how difficult it is
to actually solve self-driving

that's autonomous that creates
a similar or better experience in terms

6366
01:55:43,589 --> 01:55:43,599
a similar or better experience in terms
 

6367
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:45,990
a similar or better experience in terms
of how quickly you get from a to b or

6368
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,000
of how quickly you get from a to b or
 

6369
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,070
of how quickly you get from a to b or
just whatever the the pleasantness of

6370
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:48,080
just whatever the the pleasantness of
 

6371
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:49,350
just whatever the the pleasantness of
the experience

6372
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:49,360
the experience
 

6373
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:51,030
the experience
the efficiency of the experience the

6374
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:51,040
the efficiency of the experience the
 

6375
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,950
the efficiency of the experience the
value of the experience and at the same

6376
01:55:52,950 --> 01:55:52,960
value of the experience and at the same
 

6377
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:56,310
value of the experience and at the same
time the car itself costs cheaper

6378
01:55:56,310 --> 01:55:56,320
time the car itself costs cheaper
 

6379
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,390
time the car itself costs cheaper
i think that's very difficult to achieve

6380
01:55:58,390 --> 01:55:58,400
i think that's very difficult to achieve
 

6381
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:01,030
i think that's very difficult to achieve
i think there's a lot more

6382
01:56:01,030 --> 01:56:01,040
i think there's a lot more
 

6383
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:04,790
i think there's a lot more
um low hanging fruit in the home

6384
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:04,800
um low hanging fruit in the home
 

6385
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,109
um low hanging fruit in the home
that that could be i also want to give

6386
01:56:07,109 --> 01:56:07,119
that that could be i also want to give
 

6387
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:08,709
that that could be i also want to give
you perspective on

6388
01:56:08,709 --> 01:56:08,719
you perspective on
 

6389
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:11,270
you perspective on
like how challenging it would be at home

6390
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
like how challenging it would be at home
 

6391
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,589
like how challenging it would be at home
or like it maybe kind of depends on the

6392
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:13,599
or like it maybe kind of depends on the
 

6393
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:15,910
or like it maybe kind of depends on the
exact problem that you'd be solving okay

6394
01:56:15,910 --> 01:56:15,920
exact problem that you'd be solving okay
 

6395
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:18,390
exact problem that you'd be solving okay
if we are speaking about these robotic

6396
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:18,400
if we are speaking about these robotic
 

6397
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,430
if we are speaking about these robotic
arms

6398
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:19,440
arms
 

6399
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:20,790
arms
and hence

6400
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:20,800
and hence
 

6401
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,790
and hence
these things they cost tens of thousands

6402
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:22,800
these things they cost tens of thousands
 

6403
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,750
these things they cost tens of thousands
of dollars or maybe 100k

6404
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:25,760
of dollars or maybe 100k
 

6405
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:28,149
of dollars or maybe 100k
and

6406
01:56:28,149 --> 01:56:28,159
and
 

6407
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:30,070
and
you know maybe obviously maybe there

6408
01:56:30,070 --> 01:56:30,080
you know maybe obviously maybe there
 

6409
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,589
you know maybe obviously maybe there
would be economy of scale these things

6410
01:56:31,589 --> 01:56:31,599
would be economy of scale these things
 

6411
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:33,030
would be economy of scale these things
would be cheaper

6412
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,040
would be cheaper
 

6413
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,669
would be cheaper
but actually for any household to buy

6414
01:56:35,669 --> 01:56:35,679
but actually for any household to buy
 

6415
01:56:35,679 --> 01:56:37,589
but actually for any household to buy
the price would have to go down to maybe

6416
01:56:37,589 --> 01:56:37,599
the price would have to go down to maybe
 

6417
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:39,030
the price would have to go down to maybe
thousand bucks

6418
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:39,040
thousand bucks
 

6419
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,270
thousand bucks
yeah i personally think

6420
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:41,280
yeah i personally think
 

6421
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:42,950
yeah i personally think
that uh

6422
01:56:42,950 --> 01:56:42,960
that uh
 

6423
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,950
that uh
so self-driving car it provides a clear

6424
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:44,960
so self-driving car it provides a clear
 

6425
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:47,990
so self-driving car it provides a clear
service i don't think robots in the home

6426
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:48,000
service i don't think robots in the home
 

6427
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,510
service i don't think robots in the home
they'll be a trillion dollar company

6428
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:49,520
they'll be a trillion dollar company
 

6429
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,990
they'll be a trillion dollar company
will just be all about service

6430
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,000
will just be all about service
 

6431
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,390
will just be all about service
meaning it will not necessarily be about

6432
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:54,400
meaning it will not necessarily be about
 

6433
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,709
meaning it will not necessarily be about
like a robotic arm that

6434
01:56:56,709 --> 01:56:56,719
like a robotic arm that
 

6435
01:56:56,719 --> 01:57:00,149
like a robotic arm that
helps you i don't know open a bottle

6436
01:57:00,149 --> 01:57:00,159
helps you i don't know open a bottle
 

6437
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:02,950
helps you i don't know open a bottle
or wash the dishes or

6438
01:57:02,950 --> 01:57:02,960
or wash the dishes or
 

6439
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:04,550
or wash the dishes or
any of that kind of stuff it has to be

6440
01:57:04,550 --> 01:57:04,560
any of that kind of stuff it has to be
 

6441
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,470
any of that kind of stuff it has to be
able to take care of that whole the

6442
01:57:06,470 --> 01:57:06,480
able to take care of that whole the
 

6443
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:08,390
able to take care of that whole the
therapist thing you mentioned

6444
01:57:08,390 --> 01:57:08,400
therapist thing you mentioned
 

6445
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:11,189
therapist thing you mentioned
i i think that's um of course there's a

6446
01:57:11,189 --> 01:57:11,199
i i think that's um of course there's a
 

6447
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:13,430
i i think that's um of course there's a
line between what is a robot and what is

6448
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:13,440
line between what is a robot and what is
 

6449
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:14,229
line between what is a robot and what is
not

6450
01:57:14,229 --> 01:57:14,239
not
 

6451
01:57:14,239 --> 01:57:16,229
not
like doesn't really need a body but you

6452
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:16,239
like doesn't really need a body but you
 

6453
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:17,830
like doesn't really need a body but you
know some

6454
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:17,840
know some
 

6455
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:20,629
know some
uh ai system with some embodiment i

6456
01:57:20,629 --> 01:57:20,639
uh ai system with some embodiment i
 

6457
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:21,750
uh ai system with some embodiment i
think

6458
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:21,760
think
 

6459
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:23,350
think
so the tricky part when you think

6460
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:23,360
so the tricky part when you think
 

6461
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,589
so the tricky part when you think
actually what's the difficult part is

6462
01:57:25,589 --> 01:57:25,599
actually what's the difficult part is
 

6463
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:26,709
actually what's the difficult part is
um

6464
01:57:26,709 --> 01:57:26,719
um
 

6465
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:28,790
um
when the robot has

6466
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:28,800
when the robot has
 

6467
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,550
when the robot has
like when there is a diversity of the

6468
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:30,560
like when there is a diversity of the
 

6469
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:32,149
like when there is a diversity of the
environment with which the robot has to

6470
01:57:32,149 --> 01:57:32,159
environment with which the robot has to
 

6471
01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:34,149
environment with which the robot has to
interact that becomes hard so you know

6472
01:57:34,149 --> 01:57:34,159
interact that becomes hard so you know
 

6473
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:36,310
interact that becomes hard so you know
on one spectrum you have

6474
01:57:36,310 --> 01:57:36,320
on one spectrum you have
 

6475
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,790
on one spectrum you have
industrial robots as they are doing over

6476
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:38,800
industrial robots as they are doing over
 

6477
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,189
industrial robots as they are doing over
and over the same thing it is possible

6478
01:57:41,189 --> 01:57:41,199
and over the same thing it is possible
 

6479
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:42,950
and over the same thing it is possible
to some extent to prescribe the

6480
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:42,960
to some extent to prescribe the
 

6481
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:45,430
to some extent to prescribe the
movements and with very small amount of

6482
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:45,440
movements and with very small amount of
 

6483
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:48,310
movements and with very small amount of
intelligence the the movement can be

6484
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:48,320
intelligence the the movement can be
 

6485
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:51,669
intelligence the the movement can be
repeated millions of times um the it

6486
01:57:51,669 --> 01:57:51,679
repeated millions of times um the it
 

6487
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:53,189
repeated millions of times um the it
there are also you know various pieces

6488
01:57:53,189 --> 01:57:53,199
there are also you know various pieces
 

6489
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:54,790
there are also you know various pieces
of industrial robots where it becomes

6490
01:57:54,790 --> 01:57:54,800
of industrial robots where it becomes
 

6491
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:57,189
of industrial robots where it becomes
harder and harder like for instance in

6492
01:57:57,189 --> 01:57:57,199
harder and harder like for instance in
 

6493
01:57:57,199 --> 01:57:59,669
harder and harder like for instance in
case of tesla it might be a matter of

6494
01:57:59,669 --> 01:57:59,679
case of tesla it might be a matter of
 

6495
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:02,790
case of tesla it might be a matter of
putting a a rack inside of a car

6496
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:02,800
putting a a rack inside of a car
 

6497
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,790
putting a a rack inside of a car
and you know because the rack kind of

6498
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:04,800
and you know because the rack kind of
 

6499
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,030
and you know because the rack kind of
moves around it's it's not that easy

6500
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:07,040
moves around it's it's not that easy
 

6501
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,669
moves around it's it's not that easy
it's not exactly the same every time it

6502
01:58:09,669 --> 01:58:09,679
it's not exactly the same every time it
 

6503
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:10,950
it's not exactly the same every time it
ends up being the case that you need

6504
01:58:10,950 --> 01:58:10,960
ends up being the case that you need
 

6505
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:13,109
ends up being the case that you need
actually humans to do it

6506
01:58:13,109 --> 01:58:13,119
actually humans to do it
 

6507
01:58:13,119 --> 01:58:15,430
actually humans to do it
and while you know welding cars together

6508
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:15,440
and while you know welding cars together
 

6509
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:17,669
and while you know welding cars together
it's a very repetitive process

6510
01:58:17,669 --> 01:58:17,679
it's a very repetitive process
 

6511
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:21,910
it's a very repetitive process
and then in case of self-driving itself

6512
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:21,920
and then in case of self-driving itself
 

6513
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:24,870
and then in case of self-driving itself
the difficulty has to do with the

6514
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:24,880
the difficulty has to do with the
 

6515
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:27,109
the difficulty has to do with the
diversity of the environment but still

6516
01:58:27,109 --> 01:58:27,119
diversity of the environment but still
 

6517
01:58:27,119 --> 01:58:29,669
diversity of the environment but still
the car itself and the problem that you

6518
01:58:29,669 --> 01:58:29,679
the car itself and the problem that you
 

6519
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:31,350
the car itself and the problem that you
are solving is

6520
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:31,360
are solving is
 

6521
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,669
are solving is
you try to avoid even interacting with

6522
01:58:33,669 --> 01:58:33,679
you try to avoid even interacting with
 

6523
01:58:33,679 --> 01:58:35,589
you try to avoid even interacting with
things you are not touching anything

6524
01:58:35,589 --> 01:58:35,599
things you are not touching anything
 

6525
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:37,910
things you are not touching anything
around because touching itself is hard

6526
01:58:37,910 --> 01:58:37,920
around because touching itself is hard
 

6527
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:40,149
around because touching itself is hard
and then if you would have in the home

6528
01:58:40,149 --> 01:58:40,159
and then if you would have in the home
 

6529
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:42,550
and then if you would have in the home
uh robot that you know has to touch

6530
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:42,560
uh robot that you know has to touch
 

6531
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:44,070
uh robot that you know has to touch
things and like if these things they

6532
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:44,080
things and like if these things they
 

6533
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,830
things and like if these things they
change the shape if there is a huge

6534
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:45,840
change the shape if there is a huge
 

6535
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,669
change the shape if there is a huge
variety of things to be touched then

6536
01:58:47,669 --> 01:58:47,679
variety of things to be touched then
 

6537
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:49,270
variety of things to be touched then
that's difficult if you are speaking

6538
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:49,280
that's difficult if you are speaking
 

6539
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,109
that's difficult if you are speaking
about the robot which there is you know

6540
01:58:51,109 --> 01:58:51,119
about the robot which there is you know
 

6541
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:53,430
about the robot which there is you know
head that is smiling in some way with

6542
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:53,440
head that is smiling in some way with
 

6543
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,750
head that is smiling in some way with
cameras that it doesn't you know touch

6544
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:55,760
cameras that it doesn't you know touch
 

6545
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:58,709
cameras that it doesn't you know touch
things that's relatively simple

6546
01:58:58,709 --> 01:58:58,719
things that's relatively simple
 

6547
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:00,149
things that's relatively simple
okay so

6548
01:59:00,149 --> 01:59:00,159
okay so
 

6549
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:02,790
okay so
to both agree and to push back

6550
01:59:02,790 --> 01:59:02,800
to both agree and to push back
 

6551
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:05,990
to both agree and to push back
so you're referring to touch like

6552
01:59:05,990 --> 01:59:06,000
so you're referring to touch like
 

6553
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,430
so you're referring to touch like
soft robotics like the actual touch

6554
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:09,440
soft robotics like the actual touch
 

6555
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:10,709
soft robotics like the actual touch
but

6556
01:59:10,709 --> 01:59:10,719
but
 

6557
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:12,950
but
i would argue that you could formulate

6558
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:12,960
i would argue that you could formulate
 

6559
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,830
i would argue that you could formulate
just basic interaction

6560
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:14,840
just basic interaction
 

6561
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:18,310
just basic interaction
between um like non-contact interaction

6562
01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:18,320
between um like non-contact interaction
 

6563
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:20,550
between um like non-contact interaction
is also a kind of touch and that might

6564
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:20,560
is also a kind of touch and that might
 

6565
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:22,070
is also a kind of touch and that might
be very difficult to solve that's the

6566
01:59:22,070 --> 01:59:22,080
be very difficult to solve that's the
 

6567
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,470
be very difficult to solve that's the
basic this not disagreement but that's

6568
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:24,480
basic this not disagreement but that's
 

6569
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,629
basic this not disagreement but that's
the basic open question to me

6570
01:59:26,629 --> 01:59:26,639
the basic open question to me
 

6571
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:28,629
the basic open question to me
with self-driving cars and disagreement

6572
01:59:28,629 --> 01:59:28,639
with self-driving cars and disagreement
 

6573
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:31,910
with self-driving cars and disagreement
with elon which is how much interaction

6574
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:31,920
with elon which is how much interaction
 

6575
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:33,990
with elon which is how much interaction
is required to solve self-driving cars

6576
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
is required to solve self-driving cars
 

6577
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,510
is required to solve self-driving cars
how much touch is required you said that

6578
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:37,520
how much touch is required you said that
 

6579
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:40,149
how much touch is required you said that
in your intuition touch is not required

6580
01:59:40,149 --> 01:59:40,159
in your intuition touch is not required
 

6581
01:59:40,159 --> 01:59:42,550
in your intuition touch is not required
and my intuition to create a product

6582
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:42,560
and my intuition to create a product
 

6583
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,709
and my intuition to create a product
that's compelling to use you're going to

6584
01:59:44,709 --> 01:59:44,719
that's compelling to use you're going to
 

6585
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:46,229
that's compelling to use you're going to
have to uh

6586
01:59:46,229 --> 01:59:46,239
have to uh
 

6587
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:48,790
have to uh
interact with pedestrians not just avoid

6588
01:59:48,790 --> 01:59:48,800
interact with pedestrians not just avoid
 

6589
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,510
interact with pedestrians not just avoid
pedestrians but interact with them

6590
01:59:51,510 --> 01:59:51,520
pedestrians but interact with them
 

6591
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:54,229
pedestrians but interact with them
when we drive around in major cities

6592
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:54,239
when we drive around in major cities
 

6593
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:55,990
when we drive around in major cities
we're constantly threatening everybody's

6594
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:56,000
we're constantly threatening everybody's
 

6595
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,189
we're constantly threatening everybody's
life with our movements

6596
01:59:59,189 --> 01:59:59,199
life with our movements
 

6597
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:00,870
life with our movements
and that's how they respect us there's a

6598
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:00,880
and that's how they respect us there's a
 

6599
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,070
and that's how they respect us there's a
game theoretically going on with

6600
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,080
game theoretically going on with
 

6601
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,510
game theoretically going on with
pedestrians

6602
02:00:03,510 --> 02:00:03,520
pedestrians
 

6603
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:04,310
pedestrians
and

6604
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:04,320
and
 

6605
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,550
and
i am afraid you can't just

6606
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:06,560
i am afraid you can't just
 

6607
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:07,830
i am afraid you can't just
formulate

6608
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:07,840
formulate
 

6609
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,229
formulate
autonomous driving as a collision

6610
02:00:10,229 --> 02:00:10,239
autonomous driving as a collision
 

6611
02:00:10,239 --> 02:00:13,189
autonomous driving as a collision
avoidance problem so i i think it goes

6612
02:00:13,189 --> 02:00:13,199
avoidance problem so i i think it goes
 

6613
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:15,189
avoidance problem so i i think it goes
beyond like a collision avoidance is the

6614
02:00:15,189 --> 02:00:15,199
beyond like a collision avoidance is the
 

6615
02:00:15,199 --> 02:00:17,430
beyond like a collision avoidance is the
first order approximation

6616
02:00:17,430 --> 02:00:17,440
first order approximation
 

6617
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:20,229
first order approximation
but then at least in case of tesla they

6618
02:00:20,229 --> 02:00:20,239
but then at least in case of tesla they
 

6619
02:00:20,239 --> 02:00:22,229
but then at least in case of tesla they
are gathering data from people driving

6620
02:00:22,229 --> 02:00:22,239
are gathering data from people driving
 

6621
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:23,430
are gathering data from people driving
their cars

6622
02:00:23,430 --> 02:00:23,440
their cars
 

6623
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,109
their cars
and i believe that's an example of

6624
02:00:25,109 --> 02:00:25,119
and i believe that's an example of
 

6625
02:00:25,119 --> 02:00:26,790
and i believe that's an example of
supervised learning data that they can

6626
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:26,800
supervised learning data that they can
 

6627
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:29,669
supervised learning data that they can
train their models uh on and they are

6628
02:00:29,669 --> 02:00:29,679
train their models uh on and they are
 

6629
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:31,270
train their models uh on and they are
doing it

6630
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:31,280
doing it
 

6631
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,510
doing it
which you know can give the model this

6632
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:33,520
which you know can give the model this
 

6633
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:34,390
which you know can give the model this
like

6634
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:34,400
like
 

6635
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:36,470
like
another level of

6636
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:36,480
another level of
 

6637
02:00:36,480 --> 02:00:39,589
another level of
of a behavior that is needed to actually

6638
02:00:39,589 --> 02:00:39,599
of a behavior that is needed to actually
 

6639
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,430
of a behavior that is needed to actually
interact with the real world yeah it's

6640
02:00:41,430 --> 02:00:41,440
interact with the real world yeah it's
 

6641
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:43,510
interact with the real world yeah it's
interesting how much data

6642
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:43,520
interesting how much data
 

6643
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:46,390
interesting how much data
is required to achieve that

6644
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:46,400
is required to achieve that
 

6645
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:47,430
is required to achieve that
um

6646
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:47,440
um
 

6647
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:48,790
um
what do you think of the whole tesla

6648
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:48,800
what do you think of the whole tesla
 

6649
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,629
what do you think of the whole tesla
autopilot approach the computer vision

6650
02:00:50,629 --> 02:00:50,639
autopilot approach the computer vision
 

6651
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:53,189
autopilot approach the computer vision
based approach with multiple cameras and

6652
02:00:53,189 --> 02:00:53,199
based approach with multiple cameras and
 

6653
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:55,350
based approach with multiple cameras and
there's a data engine it's a multi-task

6654
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:55,360
there's a data engine it's a multi-task
 

6655
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:57,510
there's a data engine it's a multi-task
multi-headed neural network and it's

6656
02:00:57,510 --> 02:00:57,520
multi-headed neural network and it's
 

6657
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:00,470
multi-headed neural network and it's
this fascinating process of uh similar

6658
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,480
this fascinating process of uh similar
 

6659
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:01,990
this fascinating process of uh similar
to what you're talking about

6660
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:02,000
to what you're talking about
 

6661
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,790
to what you're talking about
with the the robotics approach

6662
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:04,800
with the the robotics approach
 

6663
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:06,950
with the the robotics approach
uh which is you know you deploy neural

6664
02:01:06,950 --> 02:01:06,960
uh which is you know you deploy neural
 

6665
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:09,030
uh which is you know you deploy neural
network and then there's humans that use

6666
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:09,040
network and then there's humans that use
 

6667
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:09,750
network and then there's humans that use
it

6668
02:01:09,750 --> 02:01:09,760
it
 

6669
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:11,750
it
and then it runs into trouble in a bunch

6670
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:11,760
and then it runs into trouble in a bunch
 

6671
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:13,830
and then it runs into trouble in a bunch
of places and that stuff is sent back so

6672
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:13,840
of places and that stuff is sent back so
 

6673
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:15,350
of places and that stuff is sent back so
like

6674
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:15,360
like
 

6675
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,430
like
the deployment discovers a bunch of edge

6676
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:17,440
the deployment discovers a bunch of edge
 

6677
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,830
the deployment discovers a bunch of edge
cases and those edge cases are sent back

6678
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:19,840
cases and those edge cases are sent back
 

6679
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,229
cases and those edge cases are sent back
for supervised annotation thereby

6680
02:01:22,229 --> 02:01:22,239
for supervised annotation thereby
 

6681
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:23,669
for supervised annotation thereby
improving the neural network and that's

6682
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:23,679
improving the neural network and that's
 

6683
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:25,109
improving the neural network and that's
deployed again

6684
02:01:25,109 --> 02:01:25,119
deployed again
 

6685
02:01:25,119 --> 02:01:27,669
deployed again
it goes over and over until the the

6686
02:01:27,669 --> 02:01:27,679
it goes over and over until the the
 

6687
02:01:27,679 --> 02:01:29,910
it goes over and over until the the
network becomes really good at the task

6688
02:01:29,910 --> 02:01:29,920
network becomes really good at the task
 

6689
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:32,310
network becomes really good at the task
of driving becomes safer and safer what

6690
02:01:32,310 --> 02:01:32,320
of driving becomes safer and safer what
 

6691
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,310
of driving becomes safer and safer what
do you think of that kind of approach to

6692
02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:34,320
do you think of that kind of approach to
 

6693
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,709
do you think of that kind of approach to
robotics i believe that's the way to go

6694
02:01:36,709 --> 02:01:36,719
robotics i believe that's the way to go
 

6695
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:38,790
robotics i believe that's the way to go
so in some sense even when i was

6696
02:01:38,790 --> 02:01:38,800
so in some sense even when i was
 

6697
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,550
so in some sense even when i was
speaking about you know collecting

6698
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:40,560
speaking about you know collecting
 

6699
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,629
speaking about you know collecting
trajectories from humans that's like a

6700
02:01:42,629 --> 02:01:42,639
trajectories from humans that's like a
 

6701
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:44,310
trajectories from humans that's like a
first step and then you deploy the

6702
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:44,320
first step and then you deploy the
 

6703
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:46,229
first step and then you deploy the
system and then you have humans revising

6704
02:01:46,229 --> 02:01:46,239
system and then you have humans revising
 

6705
02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:46,950
system and then you have humans revising
the

6706
02:01:46,950 --> 02:01:46,960
the
 

6707
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:49,669
the
all the issues and in some sense

6708
02:01:49,669 --> 02:01:49,679
all the issues and in some sense
 

6709
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:51,910
all the issues and in some sense
like this approach converges to system

6710
02:01:51,910 --> 02:01:51,920
like this approach converges to system
 

6711
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:53,669
like this approach converges to system
that doesn't make mistakes because for

6712
02:01:53,669 --> 02:01:53,679
that doesn't make mistakes because for
 

6713
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:55,270
that doesn't make mistakes because for
the cases where there are mistakes you

6714
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:55,280
the cases where there are mistakes you
 

6715
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,350
the cases where there are mistakes you
got their data how to fix them and the

6716
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:57,360
got their data how to fix them and the
 

6717
02:01:57,360 --> 02:01:59,510
got their data how to fix them and the
system will keep on improving so there's

6718
02:01:59,510 --> 02:01:59,520
system will keep on improving so there's
 

6719
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,629
system will keep on improving so there's
a very

6720
02:02:00,629 --> 02:02:00,639
a very
 

6721
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:02,470
a very
to me difficult question of how hard

6722
02:02:02,470 --> 02:02:02,480
to me difficult question of how hard
 

6723
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,550
to me difficult question of how hard
that you know how long that converging

6724
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:04,560
that you know how long that converging
 

6725
02:02:04,560 --> 02:02:06,709
that you know how long that converging
takes how hard it is

6726
02:02:06,709 --> 02:02:06,719
takes how hard it is
 

6727
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:08,790
takes how hard it is
uh the other aspect of autonomous

6728
02:02:08,790 --> 02:02:08,800
uh the other aspect of autonomous
 

6729
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,870
uh the other aspect of autonomous
vehicles this probably applies to

6730
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:10,880
vehicles this probably applies to
 

6731
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,950
vehicles this probably applies to
certain robotics applications

6732
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:12,960
certain robotics applications
 

6733
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:16,629
certain robotics applications
is society right they put

6734
02:02:16,629 --> 02:02:16,639
is society right they put
 

6735
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:18,709
is society right they put
as as the quality of the system

6736
02:02:18,709 --> 02:02:18,719
as as the quality of the system
 

6737
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:20,229
as as the quality of the system
converges

6738
02:02:20,229 --> 02:02:20,239
converges
 

6739
02:02:20,239 --> 02:02:21,669
converges
so one there's a human factors

6740
02:02:21,669 --> 02:02:21,679
so one there's a human factors
 

6741
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:23,589
so one there's a human factors

being able to supervise those uh even

6744
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:25,840
being able to supervise those uh even
 

6745
02:02:25,840 --> 02:02:27,990
being able to supervise those uh even
with teleoperation those robots and the

6746
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:28,000
with teleoperation those robots and the
 

6747
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,189

other society willing to accept robots

6748
02:02:31,189 --> 02:02:31,199
other society willing to accept robots
 

6749
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:32,870
other society willing to accept robots
currently society is much harsher on

6750
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:32,880
currently society is much harsher on
 

6751
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:34,629
currently society is much harsher on
self-driving cars than it is on human

6752
02:02:34,629 --> 02:02:34,639
self-driving cars than it is on human
 

6753
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:36,790
self-driving cars than it is on human
driven cars in terms of the expectation

6754
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:36,800
driven cars in terms of the expectation
 

6755
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:39,669
driven cars in terms of the expectation
of safety so the bar is set much higher

6756
02:02:39,669 --> 02:02:39,679
of safety so the bar is set much higher
 

6757
02:02:39,679 --> 02:02:42,310
of safety so the bar is set much higher
than for humans and we're so if there's

6758
02:02:42,310 --> 02:02:42,320
than for humans and we're so if there's
 

6759
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,629
than for humans and we're so if there's
a death in an autonomous vehicle that's

6760
02:02:44,629 --> 02:02:44,639
a death in an autonomous vehicle that's
 

6761
02:02:44,639 --> 02:02:49,350
a death in an autonomous vehicle that's
seen as much more

6762
02:02:49,350 --> 02:02:49,360

 

6763
02:02:49,360 --> 02:02:51,270

much more dramatic than a death in a

6764
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:51,280
much more dramatic than a death in a
 

6765
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:52,950
much more dramatic than a death in a
human driven vehicle

6766
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:52,960
human driven vehicle
 

6767
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,550

part of the success of deployment of

6768
02:02:54,550 --> 02:02:54,560
part of the success of deployment of
 

6769
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:56,870
part of the success of deployment of
robots is figuring out how to make

6770
02:02:56,870 --> 02:02:56,880
robots is figuring out how to make
 

6771
02:02:56,880 --> 02:03:00,229
robots is figuring out how to make
robots part of society both on the just

6772
02:03:00,229 --> 02:03:00,239
robots part of society both on the just
 

6773
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:03,030
robots part of society both on the just
the human side on the media journalist

6774
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:03,040
the human side on the media journalist
 

6775
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:05,030
the human side on the media journalist
side and also on the policy government

6776
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:05,040
side and also on the policy government
 

6777
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:07,430
side and also on the policy government
side and that seems to be uh

6778
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:07,440
side and that seems to be uh
 

6779
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,709
side and that seems to be uh
maybe you can put that into the

6780
02:03:08,709 --> 02:03:08,719
maybe you can put that into the
 

6781
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:10,790
maybe you can put that into the
objective function to optimize

6782
02:03:10,790 --> 02:03:10,800
objective function to optimize
 

6783
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:15,030
objective function to optimize
but that is that is definitely um

6784
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:15,040
but that is that is definitely um
 

6785
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:17,109
but that is that is definitely um
a tricky one and i wonder if that is

6786
02:03:17,109 --> 02:03:17,119
a tricky one and i wonder if that is
 

6787
02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:18,390
a tricky one and i wonder if that is
actually the trickiest part for

6788
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:18,400
actually the trickiest part for
 

6789
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,390
actually the trickiest part for
self-driving cars or any system that's

6790
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:20,400
self-driving cars or any system that's
 

6791
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:22,310
self-driving cars or any system that's
safety critical

6792
02:03:22,310 --> 02:03:22,320
safety critical
 

6793
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:24,870
safety critical
it's not the algorithm it's the society

6794
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:24,880
it's not the algorithm it's the society
 

6795
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:27,270
it's not the algorithm it's the society
accepting it

6796
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:27,280
accepting it
 

6797
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,189
accepting it
yeah i i would say

6798
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:29,199
yeah i i would say
 

6799
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,109
yeah i i would say
i believe that

6800
02:03:31,109 --> 02:03:31,119
i believe that
 

6801
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:33,189
i believe that
the part of the process of deployment is

6802
02:03:33,189 --> 02:03:33,199
the part of the process of deployment is
 

6803
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:35,430
the part of the process of deployment is
actually showing people that the given

6804
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:35,440
actually showing people that the given
 

6805
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:38,790
actually showing people that the given
things can be trusted yeah and you know

6806
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:38,800
things can be trusted yeah and you know
 

6807
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:40,830
things can be trusted yeah and you know
trust is also like a glass that is

6808
02:03:40,830 --> 02:03:40,840
trust is also like a glass that is
 

6809
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:44,149
trust is also like a glass that is
actually really easy to crack it yeah

6810
02:03:44,149 --> 02:03:44,159
actually really easy to crack it yeah
 

6811
02:03:44,159 --> 02:03:47,189
actually really easy to crack it yeah
and damage it and

6812
02:03:47,189 --> 02:03:47,199
and damage it and
 

6813
02:03:47,199 --> 02:03:48,870
and damage it and
i think that's actually

6814
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880
i think that's actually
 

6815
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:52,550
i think that's actually
very common with uh

6816
02:03:52,550 --> 02:03:52,560

 

6817
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:53,990

with innovation

6818
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:54,000
with innovation
 

6819
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,069
with innovation
that there is some resistance toward it

6820
02:03:56,069 --> 02:03:56,079
that there is some resistance toward it
 

6821
02:03:56,079 --> 02:03:56,870
that there is some resistance toward it
yeah

6822
02:03:56,870 --> 02:03:56,880
yeah
 

6823
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:57,669
yeah
and

6824
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
and
 

6825
02:03:57,679 --> 02:03:59,430
and
it's just the natural progression so in

6826
02:03:59,430 --> 02:03:59,440
it's just the natural progression so in
 

6827
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,430
it's just the natural progression so in
some sense people will have to keep on

6828
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
some sense people will have to keep on
 

6829
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,750
some sense people will have to keep on
proving that indeed these systems are

6830
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:03,760
proving that indeed these systems are
 

6831
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:06,790
proving that indeed these systems are
worth being used and i would say

6832
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:06,800
worth being used and i would say
 

6833
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,950
worth being used and i would say
i also found out that

6834
02:04:08,950 --> 02:04:08,960
i also found out that
 

6835
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:11,750
i also found out that
often the best way to convince people

6836
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:11,760
often the best way to convince people
 

6837
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:14,390
often the best way to convince people
is by letting them experience it yeah

6838
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:14,400
is by letting them experience it yeah
 

6839
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:15,910
is by letting them experience it yeah
absolutely that's the case for tesla

6840
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:15,920
absolutely that's the case for tesla
 

6841
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,589
absolutely that's the case for tesla
autopilot for example

6842
02:04:17,589 --> 02:04:17,599
autopilot for example
 

6843
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:19,830
autopilot for example
that's the case with uh yeah with

6844
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:19,840
that's the case with uh yeah with
 

6845
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,830
that's the case with uh yeah with
basically robots in general it's it's

6846
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:21,840
basically robots in general it's it's
 

6847
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:23,750
basically robots in general it's it's
kind of funny to hear people talk about

6848
02:04:23,750 --> 02:04:23,760
kind of funny to hear people talk about
 

6849
02:04:23,760 --> 02:04:25,109
kind of funny to hear people talk about
robots like

6850
02:04:25,109 --> 02:04:25,119
robots like
 

6851
02:04:25,119 --> 02:04:27,189
robots like
there's a lot of fear

6852
02:04:27,189 --> 02:04:27,199
there's a lot of fear
 

6853
02:04:27,199 --> 02:04:29,750
there's a lot of fear
even like legged robots but when they

6854
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:29,760
even like legged robots but when they
 

6855
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:32,310
even like legged robots but when they
actually interact with them

6856
02:04:32,310 --> 02:04:32,320
actually interact with them
 

6857
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:33,750
actually interact with them
there's joy

6858
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
there's joy
 

6859
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:35,350
there's joy
i love interacting with them and the

6860
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:35,360
i love interacting with them and the
 

6861
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:36,790
i love interacting with them and the
same with the car

6862
02:04:36,790 --> 02:04:36,800
same with the car
 

6863
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:38,629
same with the car
with the robot

6864
02:04:38,629 --> 02:04:38,639
with the robot
 

6865
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:40,870
with the robot
if it starts being useful

6866
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:40,880
if it starts being useful
 

6867
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,870
if it starts being useful
i think people immediately understand

6868
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:42,880
i think people immediately understand
 

6869
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,870
i think people immediately understand
and if the product is designed well they

6870
02:04:44,870 --> 02:04:44,880
and if the product is designed well they
 

6871
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:46,790
and if the product is designed well they
fall in love you're right

6872
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:46,800
fall in love you're right
 

6873
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,310
fall in love you're right
it's actually even similar when i'm

6874
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,320
it's actually even similar when i'm
 

6875
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,470
it's actually even similar when i'm
thinking about co-pilot the github

6876
02:04:50,470 --> 02:04:50,480
thinking about co-pilot the github
 

6877
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:52,149
thinking about co-pilot the github
co-pilot there was a spectrum of

6878
02:04:52,149 --> 02:04:52,159
co-pilot there was a spectrum of
 

6879
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:55,189
co-pilot there was a spectrum of
responses that people had and uh

6880
02:04:55,189 --> 02:04:55,199
responses that people had and uh
 

6881
02:04:55,199 --> 02:04:56,470
responses that people had and uh
ultimately

6882
02:04:56,470 --> 02:04:56,480
ultimately
 

6883
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:57,270
ultimately
uh

6884
02:04:57,270 --> 02:04:57,280
uh
 

6885
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,189
uh
the important piece was to let people

6886
02:04:59,189 --> 02:04:59,199
the important piece was to let people
 

6887
02:04:59,199 --> 02:05:01,750
the important piece was to let people
try it out and then many people just

6888
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:01,760
try it out and then many people just
 

6889
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:03,750
try it out and then many people just
loved it especially like

6890
02:05:03,750 --> 02:05:03,760
loved it especially like
 

6891
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:05,990
loved it especially like
programmers yeah programmers but like

6892
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,000
programmers yeah programmers but like
 

6893
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,430
programmers yeah programmers but like
some of them you know they came with a

6894
02:05:07,430 --> 02:05:07,440
some of them you know they came with a
 

6895
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:08,229
some of them you know they came with a
fear

6896
02:05:08,229 --> 02:05:08,239
fear
 

6897
02:05:08,239 --> 02:05:10,069
fear
yeah but then you try it out and you

6898
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:10,079
yeah but then you try it out and you
 

6899
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:11,990
yeah but then you try it out and you
think actually that's cool okay and you

6900
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:12,000
think actually that's cool okay and you
 

6901
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,589
think actually that's cool okay and you
know you can try to resist the same way

6902
02:05:13,589 --> 02:05:13,599
know you can try to resist the same way
 

6903
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:16,310
know you can try to resist the same way
as you know you could resist moving from

6904
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:16,320
as you know you could resist moving from
 

6905
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,790
as you know you could resist moving from

and
 

6911
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:23,910
and
it's a little bit futile

6912
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:23,920
it's a little bit futile
 

6913
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:26,390
it's a little bit futile
so we talked about generation program

6914
02:05:26,390 --> 02:05:26,400
so we talked about generation program
 

6915
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:29,350
so we talked about generation program

02:06:09,189 --> 02:06:09,199
impressive so theorem proving
 

6953
02:06:09,199 --> 02:06:11,669
impressive so theorem proving
is that to you proving theorems is a

oh oh like one thing that the machine

6958
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:14,480
oh oh like one thing that the machine
 

6959
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:16,550
oh oh like one thing that the machine
did you would say damn

6960

that would be quite
 

6967
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,750
that would be quite
quite impressive i mean the the tricky

6968
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:23,760
quite impressive i mean the the tricky
 

6969
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:26,069
quite impressive i mean the the tricky
part about the benchmarks is

6970
02:06:26,069 --> 02:06:26,079
part about the benchmarks is
 

6971
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:27,589
part about the benchmarks is
um you know as we are getting closer

6972
02:06:27,589 --> 02:06:27,599
um you know as we are getting closer
 

6973
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:28,870
um you know as we are getting closer
with them we have to invent new

benchmark out there yeah see my thought

6978
02:06:33,109 --> 02:06:33,119
benchmark out there yeah see my thought
 

6979
02:06:33,119 --> 02:06:35,510
benchmark out there yeah see my thought
with the riemann hypothesis would be

6980
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:35,520
with the riemann hypothesis would be
 

6981
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,830
with the riemann hypothesis would be
the moment the machine proves it would

6982
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:37,840
the moment the machine proves it would
 

6983
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,950
the moment the machine proves it would
say okay well then the problem was easy

6984
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:40,960

6985
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:43,189
say okay well then the problem was easy
that's what happens and i mean in some

6986
02:06:43,189 --> 02:06:43,199
that's what happens and i mean in some
 

6987
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:45,589
that's what happens and i mean in some
sense um that's actually what happens

6988
02:06:45,589 --> 02:06:45,599
sense um that's actually what happens
 

6989
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:48,069
sense um that's actually what happens
over the years in ai that like uh

he called alpha zero homework problem

6998
02:06:57,109 --> 02:06:57,119
he called alpha zero homework problem
 

6999
02:06:57,119 --> 02:06:58,550
he called alpha zero homework problem
because he was saying like there's

7000
02:06:58,550 --> 02:06:58,560
because he was saying like there's
 

7001
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,470
because he was saying like there's

7011
02:07:09,679 --> 02:07:11,270
the founding of irobot which deployed
now tens of millions of robot in the

7012
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:11,280
now tens of millions of robot in the
 

7013
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,870
now tens of millions of robot in the
home so

7014
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:12,880
home so
 

7015
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,830
home so
if you see robots

7016
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:15,840
if you see robots
 

7017
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:18,069
if you see robots
that are actually in the homes of people

7018
02:07:18,069 --> 02:07:18,079
that are actually in the homes of people
 

7019
02:07:18,079 --> 02:07:19,910
that are actually in the homes of people
as the legitimate

7020
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:19,920
as the legitimate
 

7021
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,750
as the legitimate
instantiation of artificial intelligence

7022
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:21,760
instantiation of artificial intelligence
 

7023
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:24,149
instantiation of artificial intelligence
then yes maybe an ai that plays a silly

7024
02:07:24,149 --> 02:07:24,159
then yes maybe an ai that plays a silly
 

7025
02:07:24,159 --> 02:07:25,910
then yes maybe an ai that plays a silly
game like going chess is not a real

7026
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:25,920
game like going chess is not a real
 

7027
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:28,149
game like going chess is not a real
accomplishment but to me it's it's a

7028
02:07:28,149 --> 02:07:28,159
accomplishment but to me it's it's a
 

7029
02:07:28,159 --> 02:07:30,069
accomplishment but to me it's it's a
fundamental leap but i think we as

7030
02:07:30,069 --> 02:07:30,079
fundamental leap but i think we as
 

7031
02:07:30,079 --> 02:07:32,470
fundamental leap but i think we as
humans then say okay well then

7032
02:07:32,470 --> 02:07:32,480
humans then say okay well then
 

7033
02:07:32,480 --> 02:07:34,790
humans then say okay well then
that uh that game of chess or go wasn't

7034
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:34,800
that uh that game of chess or go wasn't
 

7035
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,030
that uh that game of chess or go wasn't
that difficult compared to the thing

7036
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:37,040
that difficult compared to the thing
 

7037
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:38,950
that difficult compared to the thing
that's currently unsolved so my

7038
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:38,960
that's currently unsolved so my
 

7039
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:40,870
that's currently unsolved so my
intuition is that

7040
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:40,880
intuition is that
 

7041
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:44,149
intuition is that
from perspective of the evolution of

7042
02:07:44,149 --> 02:07:44,159
from perspective of the evolution of
 

7043
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:46,629
from perspective of the evolution of
you know these ai systems we'll at first

7044
02:07:46,629 --> 02:07:46,639
you know these ai systems we'll at first
 

7045
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:49,109
you know these ai systems we'll at first
see the tremendous progress in digital

7046
02:07:49,109 --> 02:07:49,119
see the tremendous progress in digital
 

7047
02:07:49,119 --> 02:07:51,109
see the tremendous progress in digital
space and the you know the main thing

7048
02:07:51,109 --> 02:07:51,119
space and the you know the main thing
 

7049
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:53,270
space and the you know the main thing
about digital space is also that you can

7050
02:07:53,270 --> 02:07:53,280
about digital space is also that you can
 

7051
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:55,030
about digital space is also that you can
everything is that there is a lot of

7052
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:55,040
everything is that there is a lot of
 

7053
02:07:55,040 --> 02:07:57,830
everything is that there is a lot of
recorded data plus you can very rapidly

7054
02:07:57,830 --> 02:07:57,840
recorded data plus you can very rapidly
 

7055
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,910
recorded data plus you can very rapidly
deploy things to billions of people

7056
02:07:59,910 --> 02:07:59,920
deploy things to billions of people
 

7057
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,350
deploy things to billions of people
while in case of uh physical space the

7058
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:03,360
while in case of uh physical space the
 

7059
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:05,669
while in case of uh physical space the
deployment part takes multiple years you

7060
02:08:05,669 --> 02:08:05,679
deployment part takes multiple years you
 

7061
02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:08,709
deployment part takes multiple years you
have to manufacture things and

7062
02:08:08,709 --> 02:08:08,719
have to manufacture things and
 

7063
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:11,030
have to manufacture things and
you know delivering it to actual people

7064
02:08:11,030 --> 02:08:11,040
you know delivering it to actual people
 

7065
02:08:11,040 --> 02:08:13,589
you know delivering it to actual people
it's very hard

7066
02:08:13,589 --> 02:08:13,599
it's very hard
 

7067
02:08:13,599 --> 02:08:17,669
it's very hard
so i'm expecting that the first and the

7068
02:08:17,669 --> 02:08:17,679
so i'm expecting that the first and the
 

7069
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:19,750
so i'm expecting that the first and the
prices in digital space

7070
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:19,760
prices in digital space
 

7071
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:22,950
prices in digital space
of goods they would go you know down to

7072
02:08:22,950 --> 02:08:22,960
of goods they would go you know down to
 

7073
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:25,030
of goods they would go you know down to
the let's say marginal costs are to zero

7074
02:08:25,030 --> 02:08:25,040
the let's say marginal costs are to zero
 

7075
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:26,629
the let's say marginal costs are to zero
and also the question is how much of our

7076
02:08:26,629 --> 02:08:26,639
and also the question is how much of our
 

7077
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:29,189
and also the question is how much of our
life will be in digital because it seems

7078
02:08:29,189 --> 02:08:29,199
life will be in digital because it seems
 

7079
02:08:29,199 --> 02:08:31,109
life will be in digital because it seems
like we're heading towards more and more

7080
02:08:31,109 --> 02:08:31,119
like we're heading towards more and more
 

7081
02:08:31,119 --> 02:08:33,270
like we're heading towards more and more
of our lives being in the digital space

7082
02:08:33,270 --> 02:08:33,280
of our lives being in the digital space
 

7083
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,550
of our lives being in the digital space
so like

7084
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:34,560
so like
 

7085
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,229
so like
innovation in the physical space might

7086
02:08:36,229 --> 02:08:36,239
innovation in the physical space might
 

7087
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:38,390
innovation in the physical space might
become less and less significant like

7088
02:08:38,390 --> 02:08:38,400
become less and less significant like
 

7089
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,950
become less and less significant like
why do you need to drive anywhere

7090
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:40,960
why do you need to drive anywhere
 

7091
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:43,109
why do you need to drive anywhere
if most of your life is spent in virtual

7092
02:08:43,109 --> 02:08:43,119
if most of your life is spent in virtual
 

7093
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:46,390
if most of your life is spent in virtual
reality i still would like you know to

7094
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:46,400
reality i still would like you know to
 

7095
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,149
reality i still would like you know to
at least at the moment my impression is

7096
02:08:48,149 --> 02:08:48,159
at least at the moment my impression is
 

7097
02:08:48,159 --> 02:08:49,990
at least at the moment my impression is
that i would like to have a physical

7098
02:08:49,990 --> 02:08:50,000
that i would like to have a physical
 

7099
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,270
that i would like to have a physical
contact with other people and that's

7100
02:08:51,270 --> 02:08:51,280
contact with other people and that's
 

7101
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:53,510
contact with other people and that's
very important to me and we don't have a

7102
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:53,520
very important to me and we don't have a
 

7103
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:55,270
very important to me and we don't have a
way to replicate it in the computer it

7104
02:08:55,270 --> 02:08:55,280
way to replicate it in the computer it
 

7105
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,790
way to replicate it in the computer it
might be the case that over the time it

7106
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:56,800
might be the case that over the time it
 

7107
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,069
might be the case that over the time it
will change

7108
02:08:58,069 --> 02:08:58,079
will change
 

7109
02:08:58,079 --> 02:09:00,550
will change
like in 10 years from now why not have

7110
02:09:00,550 --> 02:09:00,560
like in 10 years from now why not have
 

7111
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:02,470
like in 10 years from now why not have
like an arbitrary infinite number of

7112
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:02,480
like an arbitrary infinite number of
 

7113
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,310
like an arbitrary infinite number of
people you can interact with some of

7114
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:04,320
people you can interact with some of
 

7115
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:06,709
people you can interact with some of
them are real some are not

7116
02:09:06,709 --> 02:09:06,719
them are real some are not
 

7117
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:09,669
them are real some are not
with uh arbitrary characteristics that

7118
02:09:09,669 --> 02:09:09,679
with uh arbitrary characteristics that
 

7119
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:11,750
with uh arbitrary characteristics that
you can define based on your own

7120
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:11,760
you can define based on your own
 

7121
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:13,750
you can define based on your own
preferences i think that's maybe where

7122
02:09:13,750 --> 02:09:13,760
preferences i think that's maybe where
 

7123
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:15,750
preferences i think that's maybe where
we are heading and maybe i'm resisting

7124
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:15,760
we are heading and maybe i'm resisting
 

7125
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:18,229
we are heading and maybe i'm resisting
the future yeah

7126
02:09:18,229 --> 02:09:18,239
the future yeah
 

7127
02:09:18,239 --> 02:09:20,149
the future yeah
i'm telling you

7128
02:09:20,149 --> 02:09:20,159
i'm telling you
 

7129
02:09:20,159 --> 02:09:23,350
i'm telling you
i if i got to choose

7130
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:23,360
i if i got to choose
 

7131
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:26,709
i if i got to choose
if i could live in elder scrolls skyrim

7132
02:09:26,709 --> 02:09:26,719
if i could live in elder scrolls skyrim
 

7133
02:09:26,719 --> 02:09:29,270
if i could live in elder scrolls skyrim
versus the real world i'm not so sure i

7134
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:29,280
versus the real world i'm not so sure i
 

7135
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:31,430
versus the real world i'm not so sure i
would stay with the real world

7136
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:31,440
would stay with the real world
 

7137
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:34,229
would stay with the real world
yeah i mean the question is so will vr

7138
02:09:34,229 --> 02:09:34,239
yeah i mean the question is so will vr
 

7139
02:09:34,239 --> 02:09:36,470
yeah i mean the question is so will vr
be sufficient to get us there or do do

02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:36,480
be sufficient to get us there or do do
 

7141
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:38,470
be sufficient to get us there or do do
you need to you know plug electrodes in

7142
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:38,480
you need to you know plug electrodes in
 

7143
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,149
you need to you know plug electrodes in
the brain

7144
02:09:40,149 --> 02:09:40,159
the brain
 

7145
02:09:40,159 --> 02:09:42,470
the brain
and it would be nice if these electrodes

7146
02:09:42,470 --> 02:09:42,480
and it would be nice if these electrodes
 

7147
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:45,030
and it would be nice if these electrodes
wouldn't be invasive yeah

7148
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:45,040
wouldn't be invasive yeah
 

7149
02:09:45,040 --> 02:09:46,470
wouldn't be invasive yeah
or at least like provably

7150
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:46,480
or at least like provably
 

7151
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:48,950
or at least like provably
non-destructive

7152
02:09:48,950 --> 02:09:48,960
non-destructive
 

7153
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:51,830
non-destructive
but in in the digital space do you do

7154
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:51,840
but in in the digital space do you do
 

7155
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:53,430
but in in the digital space do you do
you think we'll be able to solve the

02:09:53,430 --> 02:09:53,440
you think we'll be able to solve the
 

7157

02:10:01,430 --> 02:10:01,440
achieve compelling natural language
 

7165
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:03,669
achieve compelling natural language
conversation between people like have

7166
02:10:03,669 --> 02:10:03,679
conversation between people like have
 

7167
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:05,830

02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:07,030
friends that are ai systems on the
internet

7170
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:07,040
internet
 

7171
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:08,950
internet
i thought i think it's doable do you

7172
02:10:08,950 --> 02:10:08,960
i thought i think it's doable do you
 

7173
02:10:08,960 --> 02:10:11,669
i thought i think it's doable do you
think the current approach of gbt

7174
02:10:11,669 --> 02:10:11,679
think the current approach of gbt
 

7175
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:13,669
think the current approach of gbt
will take us there so there is you know

7176
02:10:13,669 --> 02:10:13,679
will take us there so there is you know
 

7177
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:16,149
will take us there so there is you know
the the part of at first learning all

7178
02:10:16,149 --> 02:10:16,159
the the part of at first learning all
 

7179
02:10:16,159 --> 02:10:18,069
the the part of at first learning all
the content out there and i i think that

7180
02:10:18,069 --> 02:10:18,079
the content out there and i i think that
 

7181
02:10:18,079 --> 02:10:19,990
the content out there and i i think that
steel system should keep on learning as

7182
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:20,000
steel system should keep on learning as
 

7183
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,310
steel system should keep on learning as
it speaks with you yeah

7184
02:10:22,310 --> 02:10:22,320
it speaks with you yeah
 

7185
02:10:22,320 --> 02:10:24,069
it speaks with you yeah
and i think that should work the

7186
02:10:24,069 --> 02:10:24,079
and i think that should work the
 

7187
02:10:24,079 --> 02:10:25,830
and i think that should work the
question is how exactly to do it and you

7188
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:25,840
question is how exactly to do it and you
 

7189
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,430
question is how exactly to do it and you
know obviously

7190
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:27,440
know obviously
 

7191
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:29,750
know obviously
we have people at open air asking these

7192
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:29,760
we have people at open air asking these
 

7193
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:31,030
we have people at open air asking these
questions

7194
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:31,040
questions
 

7195
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:34,149
questions
and kind of at first pre-training on all

7196
02:10:34,149 --> 02:10:34,159
and kind of at first pre-training on all
 

7197
02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:36,550
and kind of at first pre-training on all
existing content is like a backbone and

7198
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:36,560
existing content is like a backbone and
 

7199
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:39,350
existing content is like a backbone and
it's a decent backbone

7200
02:10:39,350 --> 02:10:39,360
it's a decent backbone
 

7201
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:41,030
it's a decent backbone
do you think ai

7202
02:10:41,030 --> 02:10:41,040
do you think ai
 

7203
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:42,790
do you think ai
needs a body

7204
02:10:42,790 --> 02:10:42,800
needs a body
 

7205
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:45,189
needs a body
connecting to our robotics question

7206
02:10:45,189 --> 02:10:45,199
connecting to our robotics question
 

7207
02:10:45,199 --> 02:10:47,669
connecting to our robotics question
to uh truly connect with humans or can

7208
02:10:47,669 --> 02:10:47,679
to uh truly connect with humans or can
 

7209
02:10:47,679 --> 02:10:49,109
to uh truly connect with humans or can
can most of the connection be in the

7210
02:10:49,109 --> 02:10:49,119
can most of the connection be in the
 

7211
02:10:49,119 --> 02:10:50,390
can most of the connection be in the
digital space

7212
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:50,400
digital space
 

7213
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,310
digital space
so let's see

7214
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:52,320
so let's see
 

7215
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,470
so let's see
we know that there are people who met

7216
02:10:54,470 --> 02:10:54,480
we know that there are people who met
 

7217
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:57,750
we know that there are people who met
each other online and they felt in love

7218
02:10:57,750 --> 02:10:57,760
each other online and they felt in love
 

7219
02:10:57,760 --> 02:10:58,629
each other online and they felt in love
yeah

7220
02:10:58,629 --> 02:10:58,639
yeah
 

7221
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:01,750
yeah
so it seems that it's conceivable to

7222
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:01,760
so it seems that it's conceivable to
 

7223
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:05,189
so it seems that it's conceivable to
establish connection which is purely

7224
02:11:05,189 --> 02:11:05,199
establish connection which is purely
 

7225
02:11:05,199 --> 02:11:06,950
establish connection which is purely
through internet

7226
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:06,960
through internet
 

7227
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:08,550
through internet
and of course it might be more

7228
02:11:08,550 --> 02:11:08,560
and of course it might be more
 

7229
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:12,229
and of course it might be more
compelling than more modalities you add

7230
02:11:12,229 --> 02:11:12,239
compelling than more modalities you add
 

7231
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:13,830
compelling than more modalities you add
so it would be like you're proposing

7232
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:13,840
so it would be like you're proposing
 

7233
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,310
so it would be like you're proposing
like a tinder but for ai

7234
02:11:16,310 --> 02:11:16,320
like a tinder but for ai
 

7235
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:18,069
like a tinder but for ai
are you like swipe right and left and

7236
02:11:18,069 --> 02:11:18,079
are you like swipe right and left and
 

7237
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:20,229
are you like swipe right and left and
half the systems are ai and the other is

7238
02:11:20,229 --> 02:11:20,239
half the systems are ai and the other is
 

7239
02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:21,109
half the systems are ai and the other is
uh

7240
02:11:21,109 --> 02:11:21,119
uh
 

7241
02:11:21,119 --> 02:11:24,390
uh
humans and you don't know which is which

7242
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:24,400
humans and you don't know which is which
 

7243
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:25,990
humans and you don't know which is which
that would be ours that would be our

02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:26,000
that would be ours that would be our

02:11:28,149 --> 02:11:28,159
formulation of touring test the the
 

7247
02:11:28,159 --> 02:11:31,430
formulation of touring test the the
moment ai is able to achieve more swipe

7248
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:31,440
moment ai is able to achieve more swipe
 

7249
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,109
moment ai is able to achieve more swipe
right or left whatever

7250
02:11:33,109 --> 02:11:33,119
right or left whatever
 

7251
02:11:33,119 --> 02:11:34,709
right or left whatever
the the moment is able to be more

7252
02:11:34,709 --> 02:11:34,719
the the moment is able to be more
 

7253
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:36,790
the the moment is able to be more
attractive than other humans

7254
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:36,800
attractive than other humans
 

7255
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,470
attractive than other humans
it passes the torrent test then you

7256
02:11:38,470 --> 02:11:38,480
it passes the torrent test then you
 

7257
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:39,589
it passes the torrent test then you
would pass the turing test in

7258
02:11:39,589 --> 02:11:39,599
would pass the turing test in
 

7259
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:41,750
would pass the turing test in
attractiveness that's right well no like

7260
02:11:41,750 --> 02:11:41,760
attractiveness that's right well no like
 

7261
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:44,069
attractiveness that's right well no like
attractiveness just declare conversation

7262
02:11:44,069 --> 02:11:44,079
attractiveness just declare conversation
 

7263
02:11:44,079 --> 02:11:46,069
attractiveness just declare conversation
not just visual right it's also

7264
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:46,079
not just visual right it's also
 

7265
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:47,510
not just visual right it's also
attractiveness

7266
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:47,520
attractiveness
 

7267
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:50,950
attractiveness
with wit and humor and uh whatever

7268
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:50,960
with wit and humor and uh whatever
 

7269
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:52,709
with wit and humor and uh whatever
whatever makes conversations pleasant

7270
02:11:52,709 --> 02:11:52,719
whatever makes conversations pleasant
 

7271
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:56,069
whatever makes conversations pleasant
for humans

7272
02:11:56,069 --> 02:11:56,079

 

7273
02:11:56,079 --> 02:11:58,709

okay all right um

7274
02:11:58,709 --> 02:11:58,719
okay all right um
 

7275
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:01,270
okay all right um
so so you're saying uh it's possible to

7276
02:12:01,270 --> 02:12:01,280
so so you're saying uh it's possible to
 

7277
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:02,950
so so you're saying uh it's possible to
achieve in the digital space in some

7278
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:02,960
achieve in the digital space in some
 

7279
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:05,109
achieve in the digital space in some
sense i would almost ask that question

7280
02:12:05,109 --> 02:12:05,119
sense i would almost ask that question
 

7281
02:12:05,119 --> 02:12:07,189
sense i would almost ask that question
why wouldn't that be possible

7282
02:12:07,189 --> 02:12:07,199
why wouldn't that be possible
 

7283
02:12:07,199 --> 02:12:07,990
why wouldn't that be possible
right

7284
02:12:07,990 --> 02:12:08,000
right
 

7285
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:08,950
right
well

7286
02:12:08,950 --> 02:12:08,960
well
 

7287
02:12:08,960 --> 02:12:10,790
well
i have this argument with my dad all the

7288
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:10,800
i have this argument with my dad all the
 

7289
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:13,109
i have this argument with my dad all the
time he thinks that touch and smell are

7290
02:12:13,109 --> 02:12:13,119
time he thinks that touch and smell are
 

7291
02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:14,390
time he thinks that touch and smell are
really important

7292
02:12:14,390 --> 02:12:14,400
really important
 

7293
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:17,109
really important
so they can be very important and i'm

7294
02:12:17,109 --> 02:12:17,119
so they can be very important and i'm
 

7295
02:12:17,119 --> 02:12:18,870
so they can be very important and i'm
saying the initial systems they won't

7296
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:18,880
saying the initial systems they won't
 

7297
02:12:18,880 --> 02:12:20,390
saying the initial systems they won't
have it

7298
02:12:20,390 --> 02:12:20,400
have it
 

7299
02:12:20,400 --> 02:12:23,750
have it
still i wouldn't like their people being

7300
02:12:23,750 --> 02:12:23,760
still i wouldn't like their people being
 

7301
02:12:23,760 --> 02:12:24,550
still i wouldn't like their people being
born

7302
02:12:24,550 --> 02:12:24,560
born
 

7303
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:26,470
born
without these senses

7304
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:26,480
without these senses
 

7305
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:27,430
without these senses
and

7306
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:27,440
and
 

7307
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,270
and
you know i believe that they can still

7308
02:12:29,270 --> 02:12:29,280
you know i believe that they can still
 

7309
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:32,149
you know i believe that they can still
fall in love and have meaningful life

7310
02:12:32,149 --> 02:12:32,159
fall in love and have meaningful life
 

7311
02:12:32,159 --> 02:12:35,510
fall in love and have meaningful life
yeah i wonder if it's uh possible to go

7312
02:12:35,510 --> 02:12:35,520
yeah i wonder if it's uh possible to go
 

7313
02:12:35,520 --> 02:12:37,910
yeah i wonder if it's uh possible to go
close to all the way by just training on

7314
02:12:37,910 --> 02:12:37,920
close to all the way by just training on
 

7315
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:40,390
close to all the way by just training on
transcripts of conversations

7316
02:12:40,390 --> 02:12:40,400
transcripts of conversations
 

7317
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:42,629
transcripts of conversations
like i wonder how far that takes us so i

7318
02:12:42,629 --> 02:12:42,639
like i wonder how far that takes us so i
 

7319
02:12:42,639 --> 02:12:44,310
like i wonder how far that takes us so i
i think that actually still you want

7320
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:44,320
i think that actually still you want
 

7321
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:46,629
i think that actually still you want
images like i would like so i don't have

7322
02:12:46,629 --> 02:12:46,639
images like i would like so i don't have
 

7323
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:49,030
images like i would like so i don't have
kids but like i could imagine the

7324
02:12:49,030 --> 02:12:49,040
kids but like i could imagine the
 

7325
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:52,390
kids but like i could imagine the
having ai tutor it has to see you know

7326
02:12:52,390 --> 02:12:52,400
having ai tutor it has to see you know
 

7327
02:12:52,400 --> 02:12:53,510
having ai tutor it has to see you know
kids

7328
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:53,520
kids
 

7329
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,669
kids
drawing some pictures on their paper

7330
02:12:55,669 --> 02:12:55,679
drawing some pictures on their paper
 

7331
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:57,750
drawing some pictures on their paper
and and also facial expressions and all

7332
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:57,760
and and also facial expressions and all
 

7333
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:00,069
and and also facial expressions and all
that kind of stuff we use uh dogs and

7334
02:13:00,069 --> 02:13:00,079
that kind of stuff we use uh dogs and
 

7335
02:13:00,079 --> 02:13:02,390
that kind of stuff we use uh dogs and
humans use their eyes and

7336
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:02,400
humans use their eyes and
 

7337
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,149
humans use their eyes and
uh to communicate with each other i

7338
02:13:04,149 --> 02:13:04,159
uh to communicate with each other i
 

7339
02:13:04,159 --> 02:13:05,990
uh to communicate with each other i
think this that's that's a really

7340
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:06,000
think this that's that's a really
 

7341
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,830
think this that's that's a really
powerful mechanism of communication body

7342
02:13:07,830 --> 02:13:07,840
powerful mechanism of communication body
 

7343
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:09,030
powerful mechanism of communication body
language too

7344
02:13:09,030 --> 02:13:09,040
language too
 

7345
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:11,910
language too
that uh words are much uh lower

7346
02:13:11,910 --> 02:13:11,920
that uh words are much uh lower
 

7347
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:13,830
that uh words are much uh lower
bandwidth and for body language we still

7348
02:13:13,830 --> 02:13:13,840
bandwidth and for body language we still
 

7349
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:15,589
bandwidth and for body language we still
you know we kind of have a system that

7350
02:13:15,589 --> 02:13:15,599
you know we kind of have a system that
 

7351
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:17,270
you know we kind of have a system that
displays an image

7352
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:17,280
displays an image
 

7353
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:18,950
displays an image
of its or facial expression on the

7354
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:18,960
of its or facial expression on the
 

7355
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:21,189
of its or facial expression on the
computer it doesn't have to move you

7356
02:13:21,189 --> 02:13:21,199
computer it doesn't have to move you
 

7357
02:13:21,199 --> 02:13:24,229
computer it doesn't have to move you
know mechanical pieces or so so i think

7358
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:24,239
know mechanical pieces or so so i think
 

7359
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:26,709
know mechanical pieces or so so i think
that uh you know there is like kind of a

7360
02:13:26,709 --> 02:13:26,719
that uh you know there is like kind of a
 

7361
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:28,950
that uh you know there is like kind of a
progression you can imagine that text

7362
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:28,960
progression you can imagine that text
 

7363
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:31,669
progression you can imagine that text
might be the simplest to tackle

7364
02:13:31,669 --> 02:13:31,679
might be the simplest to tackle
 

7365
02:13:31,679 --> 02:13:32,870
might be the simplest to tackle
but

7366
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:32,880
but
 

7367
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:35,109
but
this is not a complete

7368
02:13:35,109 --> 02:13:35,119
this is not a complete
 

7369
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:37,910
this is not a complete
human experience at all you expand it to

7370
02:13:37,910 --> 02:13:37,920
human experience at all you expand it to
 

7371
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,030
human experience at all you expand it to
let's say

7372
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:39,040
let's say
 

7373
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:41,510
let's say
images both for input and output and

7374
02:13:41,510 --> 02:13:41,520
images both for input and output and
 

7375
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:44,550

what you describe is actually the final

7376
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:44,560
what you describe is actually the final
 

7377
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:47,189
what you describe is actually the final
i guess frontier what makes us human the

7378
02:13:47,189 --> 02:13:47,199
i guess frontier what makes us human the
 

7379
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:48,950
i guess frontier what makes us human the
fact that we can touch each other or

7380
02:13:48,950 --> 02:13:48,960
fact that we can touch each other or
 

7381
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:51,750
fact that we can touch each other or
smell or so and it's the hardest from

7382
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:51,760
smell or so and it's the hardest from
 

7383
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:54,149
smell or so and it's the hardest from
perspective of data and deployment

7384
02:13:54,149 --> 02:13:54,159
perspective of data and deployment
 

7385
02:13:54,159 --> 02:13:54,870
perspective of data and deployment
and

7386
02:13:54,870 --> 02:13:54,880
and
 

7387
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:57,350
and
i okay i believe that these things might

7388
02:13:57,350 --> 02:13:57,360
i okay i believe that these things might
 

7389
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:59,589
i okay i believe that these things might
happen gradually

7390
02:13:59,589 --> 02:13:59,599
happen gradually
 

7391
02:13:59,599 --> 02:14:01,510
happen gradually
are you excited by that possibility this

7392
02:14:01,510 --> 02:14:01,520
are you excited by that possibility this
 

7393
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:04,229
are you excited by that possibility this
particular application of

7394
02:14:04,229 --> 02:14:04,239
particular application of

friendship and interaction so let's see

7398
02:14:09,669 --> 02:14:09,679
friendship and interaction so let's see
 

7399
02:14:09,679 --> 02:14:11,189
friendship and interaction so let's see
like would you uh do you look forward to

7400
02:14:11,189 --> 02:14:11,199
like would you uh do you look forward to
 

7401
02:14:11,199 --> 02:14:13,350
like would you uh do you look forward to
a world you you said you're living with

7402
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:13,360
a world you you said you're living with
 

7403
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:14,709
a world you you said you're living with
a few folks and you're very close

7404
02:14:14,709 --> 02:14:14,719
a few folks and you're very close
 

7405
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:16,069
a few folks and you're very close
friends with them

7406
02:14:16,069 --> 02:14:16,079
friends with them
 

7407
02:14:16,079 --> 02:14:17,669
friends with them
do you look forward to a day where one

7408
02:14:17,669 --> 02:14:17,679
do you look forward to a day where one
 

7409
02:14:17,679 --> 02:14:19,589
do you look forward to a day where one
or two of those friends are ai systems

7410
02:14:19,589 --> 02:14:19,599
or two of those friends are ai systems
 

7411
02:14:19,599 --> 02:14:22,470
or two of those friends are ai systems
so if the system would be truly wishing

7412
02:14:22,470 --> 02:14:22,480
so if the system would be truly wishing
 

7413
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:23,510
so if the system would be truly wishing
me well

7414
02:14:23,510 --> 02:14:23,520
me well
 

7415
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:25,430
me well
rather than being in the situation that

7416
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:25,440
rather than being in the situation that
 

7417
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:27,750
rather than being in the situation that
it optimizes for my time to interact

7418
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:27,760
it optimizes for my time to interact
 

7419
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:29,350
it optimizes for my time to interact
with the system

7420
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:29,360
with the system
 

7421
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:30,470
with the system
the line

7422
02:14:30,470 --> 02:14:30,480
the line
 

7423
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:33,109
the line
between those is it's a gray

7424
02:14:33,109 --> 02:14:33,119
between those is it's a gray
 

7425
02:14:33,119 --> 02:14:35,990
between those is it's a gray
it's a gray area i i think that's the

7426
02:14:35,990 --> 02:14:36,000
it's a gray area i i think that's the
 

7427
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,910
it's a gray area i i think that's the
distinction between

7428
02:14:37,910 --> 02:14:37,920
distinction between
 

7429
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:41,189
distinction between
love and possession and these things

7430
02:14:41,189 --> 02:14:41,199
love and possession and these things
 

7431
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:43,189
love and possession and these things
they might be often correlated for

7432
02:14:43,189 --> 02:14:43,199
they might be often correlated for
 

7433
02:14:43,199 --> 02:14:46,550
they might be often correlated for
humans but it's it like like a you you

7434
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:46,560
humans but it's it like like a you you
 

7435
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:47,910
humans but it's it like like a you you
might find that there like some friends

7436
02:14:47,910 --> 02:14:47,920
might find that there like some friends
 

7437
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:50,470
might find that there like some friends
with whom you haven't spoken for months

7438
02:14:50,470 --> 02:14:50,480
with whom you haven't spoken for months
 

7439
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:52,149
with whom you haven't spoken for months
yeah and then you know you pick up the

7440
02:14:52,149 --> 02:14:52,159
yeah and then you know you pick up the
 

7441
02:14:52,159 --> 02:14:55,589
yeah and then you know you pick up the
phone it's as the time hasn't passed

7442
02:14:55,589 --> 02:14:55,599
phone it's as the time hasn't passed
 

7443
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:57,750
phone it's as the time hasn't passed
they are not holding to you

7444
02:14:57,750 --> 02:14:57,760
they are not holding to you
 

7445
02:14:57,760 --> 02:14:59,589
they are not holding to you
and i will i wouldn't like to have ai

7446
02:14:59,589 --> 02:14:59,599
and i will i wouldn't like to have ai
 

7447
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:01,990
and i will i wouldn't like to have ai
system that you know it's

7448
02:15:01,990 --> 02:15:02,000
system that you know it's
 

7449
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,030
system that you know it's
it's

7450
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:03,040
it's
 

7451
02:15:03,040 --> 02:15:04,870
it's
trying to convince me to spend time with

7452
02:15:04,870 --> 02:15:04,880
trying to convince me to spend time with
 

7453
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:08,550
trying to convince me to spend time with
it i would like the system to optimize

7454
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:08,560
it i would like the system to optimize
 

7455
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:11,350
it i would like the system to optimize
for what i care about and help me

7456
02:15:11,350 --> 02:15:11,360
for what i care about and help me
 

7457
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:14,069
for what i care about and help me
in achieving my own goals

in achieving my own goals
 

7459
02:15:14,079 --> 02:15:17,030
in achieving my own goals
but there's some i mean i don't know

7460
02:15:17,030 --> 02:15:17,040
but there's some i mean i don't know
 

7461
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:18,790
but there's some i mean i don't know
there's some manipulation there's some

02:15:18,790 --> 02:15:18,800
there's some manipulation there's some
 

7463
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:21,030
there's some manipulation there's some
possessiveness there's some insecurities

possessiveness there's some insecurities
 

7465
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:22,950

this fragility all those things are

7466
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:22,960
this fragility all those things are
 

7467
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:24,229
this fragility all those things are
necessary

7468
02:15:24,229 --> 02:15:24,239
necessary
 

7469
02:15:24,239 --> 02:15:26,629
necessary
to form a close friendship over time to

to form a close friendship over time to
 

7471
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:29,109
to form a close friendship over time to
go through some dark [\h__\h] together some

7472
02:15:29,109 --> 02:15:29,119
go through some dark [\h__\h] together some

02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,000
bliss and happiness together i feel like
 

7475
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,069
bliss and happiness together i feel like
there's a lot of greedy self-centered

7476
02:15:34,069 --> 02:15:34,079
there's a lot of greedy self-centered
 

7477
02:15:34,079 --> 02:15:36,790
there's a lot of greedy self-centered
behavior within that process

7478
02:15:36,790 --> 02:15:36,800
behavior within that process
 

7479
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:39,030
behavior within that process
my intuition but i might be wrong is

7480
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:39,040
my intuition but i might be wrong is
 

7481
02:15:39,040 --> 02:15:40,390
my intuition but i might be wrong is
that

7482
02:15:40,390 --> 02:15:40,400
that
 

7483
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:42,870
that
human computer interaction doesn't have

7484
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:42,880
human computer interaction doesn't have
 

7485
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:45,109
human computer interaction doesn't have
to go through uh

7486
02:15:45,109 --> 02:15:45,119
to go through uh
 

7487
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:47,669
to go through uh
computer being greedy possessive and so

7488
02:15:47,669 --> 02:15:47,679
computer being greedy possessive and so
 

7489
02:15:47,679 --> 02:15:50,790
computer being greedy possessive and so
on it is possible to train systems maybe

7490
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:50,800
on it is possible to train systems maybe
 

7491
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:53,510
on it is possible to train systems maybe
that they actually

7492
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:53,520
that they actually
 

7493
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,510
that they actually
you know they are i guess prompted or

7494
02:15:55,510 --> 02:15:55,520
you know they are i guess prompted or
 

7495
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:57,430
you know they are i guess prompted or
fine-tuned or so

7496
02:15:57,430 --> 02:15:57,440
fine-tuned or so
 

7497
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:59,510
fine-tuned or so
to truly optimize for what you care

7498
02:15:59,510 --> 02:15:59,520
to truly optimize for what you care
 

7499
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:01,270
to truly optimize for what you care
about and you could imagine that you

7500
02:16:01,270 --> 02:16:01,280
about and you could imagine that you
 

7501
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:02,470
about and you could imagine that you
know

7502
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:02,480
know
 

7503
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:04,229
know
that the way how the process would look

7504
02:16:04,229 --> 02:16:04,239
that the way how the process would look
 

7505
02:16:04,239 --> 02:16:07,669
that the way how the process would look
like is at some point

7506
02:16:07,669 --> 02:16:07,679

 

7507
02:16:07,679 --> 02:16:09,030

we as a human as we look at the

7508
02:16:09,030 --> 02:16:09,040
we as a human as we look at the
 

7509
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:11,430
we as a human as we look at the
transcript of the conversation or like

7510
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:11,440
transcript of the conversation or like
 

7511
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:13,910
transcript of the conversation or like
an entire interaction and we say

7512
02:16:13,910 --> 02:16:13,920
an entire interaction and we say
 

7513
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:16,229
an entire interaction and we say
actually here there was more loving way

7514
02:16:16,229 --> 02:16:16,239
actually here there was more loving way
 

7515
02:16:16,239 --> 02:16:19,189
actually here there was more loving way
to go about it and we supervise system

7516
02:16:19,189 --> 02:16:19,199
to go about it and we supervise system
 

7517
02:16:19,199 --> 02:16:21,350
to go about it and we supervise system
toward being more loving

7518
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,360
toward being more loving
 

7519
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,750
toward being more loving
or maybe we train the system such that

7520
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:23,760
or maybe we train the system such that
 

7521
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:25,270
or maybe we train the system such that
it has a reward function toward being

7522
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:25,280
it has a reward function toward being
 

7523
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:27,669
it has a reward function toward being
more loving yeah or maybe the

7524
02:16:27,669 --> 02:16:27,679
more loving yeah or maybe the
 

7525
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:29,430
more loving yeah or maybe the
possibility of the system being an

7526
02:16:29,430 --> 02:16:29,440
possibility of the system being an
 

7527
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:30,870
possibility of the system being an
[\h__\h]

7528
02:16:30,870 --> 02:16:30,880
[\h__\h]
 

7529
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:33,190
[\h__\h]
and manipulative and possessive every

7530
02:16:33,190 --> 02:16:33,200
and manipulative and possessive every
 

7531
02:16:33,200 --> 02:16:36,549
and manipulative and possessive every
once in a while is a feature not a bug

7532
02:16:36,549 --> 02:16:36,559
once in a while is a feature not a bug
 

7533
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:39,349
once in a while is a feature not a bug
because some of the

7534
02:16:39,349 --> 02:16:39,359
because some of the
 

7535
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:41,990
because some of the
happiness that we experience when two

7536
02:16:41,990 --> 02:16:42,000
happiness that we experience when two
 

7537
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,830
happiness that we experience when two
souls meet each other when two humans

7538
02:16:43,830 --> 02:16:43,840
souls meet each other when two humans
 

7539
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:46,389
souls meet each other when two humans
meet each other is a kind of break from

7540
02:16:46,389 --> 02:16:46,399
meet each other is a kind of break from
 

7541
02:16:46,399 --> 02:16:48,309
meet each other is a kind of break from
the [\h__\h] in the world

7542
02:16:48,309 --> 02:16:48,319
the [\h__\h] in the world
 

7543
02:16:48,319 --> 02:16:51,990
the [\h__\h] in the world
and so you need [\h__\h] and ai as well

7544
02:16:51,990 --> 02:16:52,000
and so you need [\h__\h] and ai as well
 

7545
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,270
and so you need [\h__\h] and ai as well
because like

7546
02:16:53,270 --> 02:16:53,280
because like
 

7547
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,030
because like
it'll be like a breath of fresh air to

7548
02:16:55,030 --> 02:16:55,040
it'll be like a breath of fresh air to
 

7549
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,509
it'll be like a breath of fresh air to
discover an ai that

7550
02:16:57,509 --> 02:16:57,519
discover an ai that
 

7551
02:16:57,519 --> 02:17:00,150
discover an ai that
the three previous ais you had are too

7552
02:17:00,150 --> 02:17:00,160
the three previous ais you had are too
 

7553
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:01,190
the three previous ais you had are too
friendly

7554
02:17:01,190 --> 02:17:01,200
friendly
 

7555
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:04,469
friendly
or no no or or cruel or whatever it's

7556
02:17:04,469 --> 02:17:04,479
or no no or or cruel or whatever it's
 

7557
02:17:04,479 --> 02:17:05,990
or no no or or cruel or whatever it's
like some kind of mix

7558
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:06,000
like some kind of mix
 

7559
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,309
like some kind of mix
and then this one is just right but you

7560
02:17:08,309 --> 02:17:08,319
and then this one is just right but you
 

7561
02:17:08,319 --> 02:17:10,309
and then this one is just right but you
need to experience the full spectrum

7562
02:17:10,309 --> 02:17:10,319
need to experience the full spectrum
 

7563
02:17:10,319 --> 02:17:11,990
need to experience the full spectrum
like i think you need to be able to

7564
02:17:11,990 --> 02:17:12,000
like i think you need to be able to
 

7565
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,110
like i think you need to be able to
engineer [\h__\h] so let's see

7566
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:17,120
engineer [\h__\h] so let's see
 

7567
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:19,910
engineer [\h__\h] so let's see
because there's some level to us of

7568
02:17:19,910 --> 02:17:19,920
because there's some level to us of
 

7569
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:22,230
because there's some level to us of
being appreciate to appreciate the human

7570
02:17:22,230 --> 02:17:22,240
being appreciate to appreciate the human
 

7571
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,990
being appreciate to appreciate the human
experience

7572
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:24,000
experience
 

7573
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,150
experience
we need the dark

7577
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:32,150
and the light so that kind of reminds me

snail fell into the salad and apparently
 

7601
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:00,950
snail fell into the salad and apparently
there are neurotoxic

7602
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:00,960
there are neurotoxic
 

7603
02:18:00,960 --> 02:18:03,509
there are neurotoxic
snails over there and she got into coma

7604
02:18:03,509 --> 02:18:03,519
snails over there and she got into coma
 

7605
02:18:03,519 --> 02:18:05,750
snails over there and she got into coma
for a year okay oh wow

7606
02:18:05,750 --> 02:18:05,760
for a year okay oh wow
 

7607

and
 

7609
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:08,709
and
apparently there is you know high chance

7610
02:18:08,709 --> 02:18:08,719
apparently there is you know high chance
 

7611
02:18:08,719 --> 02:18:10,309
apparently there is you know high chance
of even just dying but she was in the

7612
02:18:10,309 --> 02:18:10,319
of even just dying but she was in the
 

7613
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:12,549
of even just dying but she was in the
coma at some point

7614
02:18:12,549 --> 02:18:12,559
coma at some point
 

7615
02:18:12,559 --> 02:18:15,110
coma at some point
she regained partially consciousness she

7616
02:18:15,110 --> 02:18:15,120
she regained partially consciousness she
 

7617
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:18,309
she regained partially consciousness she
was able to hear people in the room

people behave as she wouldn't be there
you know at some point she started being

7622
02:18:23,509 --> 02:18:23,519
you know at some point she started being
 

7623
02:18:23,519 --> 02:18:25,589
you know at some point she started being
able to speak but she was mumbling like

7624
02:18:25,589 --> 02:18:25,599
able to speak but she was mumbling like
 

7625
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:28,709
able to speak but she was mumbling like
a barely able to to express herself and

7626
02:18:28,709 --> 02:18:28,719
a barely able to to express herself and
 

7627
02:18:28,719 --> 02:18:31,270
a barely able to to express herself and
at some point she got into wheelchair

7628
02:18:31,270 --> 02:18:31,280
at some point she got into wheelchair
 

7629
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:33,509
at some point she got into wheelchair
then at some point she actually noticed

7630
02:18:33,509 --> 02:18:33,519
then at some point she actually noticed
 

7631
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:36,309
then at some point she actually noticed
that she can move her uh

7632
02:18:36,309 --> 02:18:36,319
that she can move her uh
 

7633
02:18:36,319 --> 02:18:37,669
that she can move her uh
a toe

7634
02:18:37,669 --> 02:18:37,679
a toe
 

7635
02:18:37,679 --> 02:18:39,349
a toe
and then she knew that she will be able

7636
02:18:39,349 --> 02:18:39,359
and then she knew that she will be able
 

7637
02:18:39,359 --> 02:18:40,790
and then she knew that she will be able
to walk

7638
02:18:40,790 --> 02:18:40,800
to walk
 

7639
02:18:40,800 --> 02:18:42,309
to walk
and then you know that's where she was

7640
02:18:42,309 --> 02:18:42,319
and then you know that's where she was
 

7641
02:18:42,319 --> 02:18:44,709
and then you know that's where she was
five years after and she said that since

7642
02:18:44,709 --> 02:18:44,719
five years after and she said that since
 

7643
02:18:44,719 --> 02:18:46,790
five years after and she said that since
then she appreciates the fact that she

7644
02:18:46,790 --> 02:18:46,800
then she appreciates the fact that she
 

7645
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:48,950
then she appreciates the fact that she
can move her toe

7646
02:18:48,950 --> 02:18:48,960
can move her toe
 

7647
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:50,790
can move her toe
and i was thinking

7648
02:18:50,790 --> 02:18:50,800
and i was thinking
 

7649
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:52,870
and i was thinking
do i need to go through such experience

7650
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:52,880
do i need to go through such experience
 

7651
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:55,030
do i need to go through such experience

02:21:39,190 --> 02:21:39,200
of hours
 

7815
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:41,110
of hours
you're forced to then operate at the

7816
02:21:41,110 --> 02:21:41,120
you're forced to then operate at the
 

7817
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:42,790
you're forced to then operate at the
same set of hours

7818
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:42,800
same set of hours
 

7819
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:44,950
same set of hours
but

7820
02:21:44,950 --> 02:21:44,960
but
 

7821
02:21:44,960 --> 02:21:46,950
but
i'm not quite there yet

7822
02:21:46,950 --> 02:21:46,960
i'm not quite there yet
 

7823
02:21:46,960 --> 02:21:49,190
i'm not quite there yet
i found a lot of joy just like you said

7824
02:21:49,190 --> 02:21:49,200
i found a lot of joy just like you said
 

7825
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:50,870
i found a lot of joy just like you said
working through the night

7826
02:21:50,870 --> 02:21:50,880
working through the night
 

7827
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:52,469
working through the night
because it's quiet

7828
02:21:52,469 --> 02:21:52,479
because it's quiet
 

7829
02:21:52,479 --> 02:21:54,230
because it's quiet
because the world doesn't disturb you

7830
02:21:54,230 --> 02:21:54,240
because the world doesn't disturb you
 

7831
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:56,070
because the world doesn't disturb you
and there's some aspect

7832
02:21:56,070 --> 02:21:56,080
and there's some aspect
 

7833
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:58,070
and there's some aspect
counter to everything you're saying

7834
02:21:58,070 --> 02:21:58,080
counter to everything you're saying
 

7835
02:21:58,080 --> 02:22:00,309
counter to everything you're saying
there's some joyful aspect to sleeping

7836
02:22:00,309 --> 02:22:00,319
there's some joyful aspect to sleeping
 

7837
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:02,630
there's some joyful aspect to sleeping
through the mess of the day

7838
02:22:02,630 --> 02:22:02,640
through the mess of the day
 

7839
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:04,710
through the mess of the day
because uh people are having meetings

7840
02:22:04,710 --> 02:22:04,720
because uh people are having meetings
 

7841
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:06,950
because uh people are having meetings
and sending emails and there's drama

7842
02:22:06,950 --> 02:22:06,960
and sending emails and there's drama
 

7843
02:22:06,960 --> 02:22:09,270
and sending emails and there's drama
meetings i can sleep through all the

7844
02:22:09,270 --> 02:22:09,280
meetings i can sleep through all the
 

7845
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:11,190
meetings i can sleep through all the
meetings you know i have meetings every

7846
02:22:11,190 --> 02:22:11,200
meetings you know i have meetings every
 

7847
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:13,190
meetings you know i have meetings every
day and they prevent me from having

7848
02:22:13,190 --> 02:22:13,200
day and they prevent me from having
 

7849
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:15,110
day and they prevent me from having
sufficient amount of time for

7850
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:15,120
sufficient amount of time for
 

7851
02:22:15,120 --> 02:22:16,790
sufficient amount of time for
focus work

7852
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:16,800
focus work
 

7853
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:18,870
focus work
and

7854
02:22:18,870 --> 02:22:18,880
and
 

7855
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:19,750
and
then

7856
02:22:19,750 --> 02:22:19,760
then
 

7857
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:22,150
then
i modified my calendar and i said that

7858
02:22:22,150 --> 02:22:22,160
i modified my calendar and i said that
 

7859
02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:24,070
i modified my calendar and i said that
i'm out of office wednesday thursday and

7860
02:22:24,070 --> 02:22:24,080
i'm out of office wednesday thursday and
 

7861
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:26,389
i'm out of office wednesday thursday and
friday every day and i'm having meetings

7862
02:22:26,389 --> 02:22:26,399
friday every day and i'm having meetings
 

7863
02:22:26,399 --> 02:22:28,150
friday every day and i'm having meetings
only monday and tuesday

7864
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:28,160
only monday and tuesday
 

7865
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:30,070
only monday and tuesday
and that vastly

7866
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:30,080
and that vastly
 

7867
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:31,990
and that vastly
positively influenced my mood that i

7868
02:22:31,990 --> 02:22:32,000
positively influenced my mood that i
 

7869
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,990
positively influenced my mood that i
have literally like had three days for

7870
02:22:33,990 --> 02:22:34,000
have literally like had three days for
 

7871
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,870
have literally like had three days for
fully focused work yeah so there's

7872
02:22:36,870 --> 02:22:36,880
fully focused work yeah so there's
 

7873
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:39,110
fully focused work yeah so there's
better solutions to this problem than

7874
02:22:39,110 --> 02:22:39,120
better solutions to this problem than
 

7875
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:41,830
better solutions to this problem than
staying awake all night okay

7876
02:22:41,830 --> 02:22:41,840
staying awake all night okay
 

7877
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:43,670
staying awake all night okay
you've been part of development of some

7878
02:22:43,670 --> 02:22:43,680
you've been part of development of some
 

7879
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:45,190
you've been part of development of some
of the greatest ideas in artificial

7880
02:22:45,190 --> 02:22:45,200
of the greatest ideas in artificial
 

7881
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:47,110
of the greatest ideas in artificial
intelligence what would you say is your

7882
02:22:47,110 --> 02:22:47,120
intelligence what would you say is your
 

7883
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:50,389
intelligence what would you say is your
process for developing good novel ideas

7884
02:22:50,389 --> 02:22:50,399
process for developing good novel ideas
 

7885
02:22:50,399 --> 02:22:52,150
process for developing good novel ideas
you have to be aware that

7886
02:22:52,150 --> 02:22:52,160
you have to be aware that
 

7887
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:53,750
you have to be aware that
clearly there are many other brilliant

7888
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:53,760
clearly there are many other brilliant
 

7889
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:55,270
clearly there are many other brilliant
people around

7890
02:22:55,270 --> 02:22:55,280
people around
 

7891
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:56,309
people around
so

7892
02:22:56,309 --> 02:22:56,319
so
 

7893
02:22:56,319 --> 02:22:58,790
so
you have to ask yourself a question

7894
02:22:58,790 --> 02:22:58,800
you have to ask yourself a question
 

7895
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:02,070
you have to ask yourself a question
why the given idea

7896
02:23:02,070 --> 02:23:02,080
why the given idea
 

7897
02:23:02,080 --> 02:23:04,790
why the given idea
let's say wasn't uh tried by someone

7898
02:23:04,790 --> 02:23:04,800
let's say wasn't uh tried by someone
 

7899
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,150
let's say wasn't uh tried by someone
else

7900
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:06,160
else
 

7901
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:08,630
else
and in some sense it has to

7902
02:23:08,630 --> 02:23:08,640
and in some sense it has to
 

7903
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:09,910
and in some sense it has to
do with

7904
02:23:09,910 --> 02:23:09,920
do with
 

7905
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:12,070
do with
you know kind of simple it might sound

7906
02:23:12,070 --> 02:23:12,080
you know kind of simple it might sound
 

7907
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:13,750
you know kind of simple it might sound
simple but like i'm thinking outside of

7908
02:23:13,750 --> 02:23:13,760
simple but like i'm thinking outside of
 

7909
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,150
simple but like i'm thinking outside of
the box and what do i mean here

7910
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:16,160
the box and what do i mean here
 

7911
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:18,550
the box and what do i mean here
so for instance for a while

7912
02:23:18,550 --> 02:23:18,560
so for instance for a while
 

7913
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:22,070
so for instance for a while
people in academia they assumed

7914
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:22,080
people in academia they assumed
 

7915
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:23,110
people in academia they assumed
that

7916
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:23,120
that
 

7917
02:23:23,120 --> 02:23:25,429
that
you have a fixed data set

7918
02:23:25,429 --> 02:23:25,439
you have a fixed data set
 

7919
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:28,469
you have a fixed data set
and then you optimize the algorithms

7920
02:23:28,469 --> 02:23:28,479
and then you optimize the algorithms
 

7921
02:23:28,479 --> 02:23:31,510
and then you optimize the algorithms
in order to get the best performance

7922
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:31,520
in order to get the best performance
 

7923
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:32,790
in order to get the best performance
and

7924
02:23:32,790 --> 02:23:32,800
and
 

7925
02:23:32,800 --> 02:23:35,349
and
that was so in great assumption

7926
02:23:35,349 --> 02:23:35,359
that was so in great assumption
 

7927
02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:37,670
that was so in great assumption
that no one thought about

7928
02:23:37,670 --> 02:23:37,680
that no one thought about
 

7929
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:41,270
that no one thought about
training models on anti-internet

7930
02:23:41,270 --> 02:23:41,280
training models on anti-internet
 

7931
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:43,750
training models on anti-internet
or like that that maybe some people

7932
02:23:43,750 --> 02:23:43,760
or like that that maybe some people
 

7933
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:47,349
or like that that maybe some people
thought about it but if it felt too too

7934
02:23:47,349 --> 02:23:47,359
thought about it but if it felt too too
 

7935
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:49,670
thought about it but if it felt too too
many as unfair

7936
02:23:49,670 --> 02:23:49,680
many as unfair
 

7937
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:52,230
many as unfair
and in some sense that's almost like a

7938
02:23:52,230 --> 02:23:52,240
and in some sense that's almost like a
 

7939
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:53,910
and in some sense that's almost like a
it's not my idea or so but that's an

7940
02:23:53,910 --> 02:23:53,920
it's not my idea or so but that's an
 

7941
02:23:53,920 --> 02:23:56,870
it's not my idea or so but that's an
example of breaking a typical assumption

7942
02:23:56,870 --> 02:23:56,880
example of breaking a typical assumption
 

7943
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:59,190
example of breaking a typical assumption
so you want to be in the paradigm that

7944
02:23:59,190 --> 02:23:59,200
so you want to be in the paradigm that
 

7945
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,670
so you want to be in the paradigm that
you are breaking a typical assumption

7946
02:24:01,670 --> 02:24:01,680
you are breaking a typical assumption
 

7947
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:05,429
you are breaking a typical assumption
in the context of the ai community

7948
02:24:05,429 --> 02:24:05,439
in the context of the ai community
 

7949
02:24:05,439 --> 02:24:07,910
in the context of the ai community
getting to pick your dataset as cheating

7950
02:24:07,910 --> 02:24:07,920
getting to pick your dataset as cheating
 

7951
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:10,389
getting to pick your dataset as cheating
correct and in some sense so that was a

7952
02:24:10,389 --> 02:24:10,399
correct and in some sense so that was a
 

7953
02:24:10,399 --> 02:24:12,070
correct and in some sense so that was a
that was assumption that many people had

7954
02:24:12,070 --> 02:24:12,080
that was assumption that many people had
 

7955
02:24:12,080 --> 02:24:13,270
that was assumption that many people had
out there

7956
02:24:13,270 --> 02:24:13,280
out there
 

7957
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:16,230
out there
and then if you free yourself from

7958
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:16,240
and then if you free yourself from
 

7959
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:17,510
and then if you free yourself from
assumptions

7960
02:24:17,510 --> 02:24:17,520
assumptions
 

7961
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:18,710
assumptions
then

7962
02:24:18,710 --> 02:24:18,720
then
 

7963
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:19,910
then
they are

7964
02:24:19,910 --> 02:24:19,920
they are
 

7965
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:21,670
they are
likely to achieve something that others

7966
02:24:21,670 --> 02:24:21,680
likely to achieve something that others
 

7967
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:23,270
likely to achieve something that others
cannot do and in some sense if you are

7968
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:23,280
cannot do and in some sense if you are
 

7969
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,270
cannot do and in some sense if you are
trying to do exactly the same things as

7970
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:25,280
trying to do exactly the same things as
 

7971
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:26,230
trying to do exactly the same things as
others

7972
02:24:26,230 --> 02:24:26,240
others
 

7973
02:24:26,240 --> 02:24:27,750
others
it's very likely that you're gonna have

7974
02:24:27,750 --> 02:24:27,760
it's very likely that you're gonna have
 

7975
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:30,230
it's very likely that you're gonna have
the same results yeah i

7976
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:30,240
the same results yeah i
 

7977
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:31,910
the same results yeah i
but there's also that kind of tension

7978
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:31,920
but there's also that kind of tension
 

7979
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:33,270
but there's also that kind of tension
which is uh

7980
02:24:33,270 --> 02:24:33,280
which is uh
 

7981
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:36,070
which is uh
asking yourself the question why

7982
02:24:36,070 --> 02:24:36,080
asking yourself the question why
 

7983
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:38,389
asking yourself the question why
haven't others done this

7984
02:24:38,389 --> 02:24:38,399
haven't others done this
 

7985
02:24:38,399 --> 02:24:41,110
haven't others done this
because um

7986
02:24:41,110 --> 02:24:41,120
because um
 

7987
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:43,990
because um
i mean i get a lot of good ideas

7988
02:24:43,990 --> 02:24:44,000
i mean i get a lot of good ideas
 

7989
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,110
i mean i get a lot of good ideas
but i think probably most of them suck

7990
02:24:47,110 --> 02:24:47,120
but i think probably most of them suck
 

7991
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:48,870
but i think probably most of them suck
when they meet reality

7992
02:24:48,870 --> 02:24:48,880
when they meet reality
 

7993
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:51,429
when they meet reality
so so actually i think the other big

7994
02:24:51,429 --> 02:24:51,439
so so actually i think the other big
 

7995
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:52,550
so so actually i think the other big
piece

7996
02:24:52,550 --> 02:24:52,560
piece
 

7997
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:53,429
piece
is

7998
02:24:53,429 --> 02:24:53,439
is
 

7999
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:55,750
is
uh getting into habit of generating

8000
02:24:55,750 --> 02:24:55,760
uh getting into habit of generating
 

8001
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:57,270
uh getting into habit of generating
ideas training your brain toward

8002
02:24:57,270 --> 02:24:57,280
ideas training your brain toward
 

8003
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:01,190
ideas training your brain toward
generating ideas and not even

8004
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:01,200
generating ideas and not even
 

8005
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,990
generating ideas and not even
suspending judgment of the ideas

8006
02:25:03,990 --> 02:25:04,000
suspending judgment of the ideas
 

8007
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,030
suspending judgment of the ideas
so in some sense i noticed myself that

8008
02:25:07,030 --> 02:25:07,040
so in some sense i noticed myself that
 

8009
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:08,870
so in some sense i noticed myself that
even if i'm in the process of generating

8010
02:25:08,870 --> 02:25:08,880
even if i'm in the process of generating
 

8011
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:11,830
even if i'm in the process of generating
ideas if i tell myself oh that was a bad

8012
02:25:11,830 --> 02:25:11,840
ideas if i tell myself oh that was a bad
 

8013
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:13,110
ideas if i tell myself oh that was a bad
idea

8014
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:13,120
idea
 

8015
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:15,590
idea
then that actually interrupts the

8016
02:25:15,590 --> 02:25:15,600
then that actually interrupts the
 

8017
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:18,070
then that actually interrupts the
process and i cannot generate more ideas

8018
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:18,080
process and i cannot generate more ideas
 

8019
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,590
process and i cannot generate more ideas
because i'm actually focused on the

8020
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:19,600
because i'm actually focused on the
 

8021
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:22,230
because i'm actually focused on the
negative part why it won't work yes

8022
02:25:22,230 --> 02:25:22,240
negative part why it won't work yes
 

8023
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:23,270
negative part why it won't work yes
but

8024
02:25:23,270 --> 02:25:23,280
but
 

8025
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:25,190
but
i created also environment in the way

8026
02:25:25,190 --> 02:25:25,200
i created also environment in the way
 

8027
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,750
i created also environment in the way
that it's very easy for me to to store

8028
02:25:27,750 --> 02:25:27,760
that it's very easy for me to to store
 

8029
02:25:27,760 --> 02:25:30,790
that it's very easy for me to to store
new ideas so for instance next to my bed

8030
02:25:30,790 --> 02:25:30,800
new ideas so for instance next to my bed
 

8031
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:31,910
new ideas so for instance next to my bed
i have a

8032
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:31,920
i have a
 

8033
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:33,590
i have a
voice recorder

8034
02:25:33,590 --> 02:25:33,600
voice recorder
 

8035
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:36,070
voice recorder
and it happens to me often like i wake

8036
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:36,080
and it happens to me often like i wake
 

8037
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:37,670
and it happens to me often like i wake
up in that during the night and i have

8038
02:25:37,670 --> 02:25:37,680
up in that during the night and i have
 

8039
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:40,070
up in that during the night and i have
some idea in the past i was

8040
02:25:40,070 --> 02:25:40,080
some idea in the past i was
 

8041
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:41,990
some idea in the past i was
writing them down on my phone but that

8042
02:25:41,990 --> 02:25:42,000
writing them down on my phone but that
 

8043
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:43,750
writing them down on my phone but that
means you know turning off this turning

8044
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:43,760
means you know turning off this turning
 

8045
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,990
means you know turning off this turning
on the screen and that wakes me up or

8046
02:25:45,990 --> 02:25:46,000
on the screen and that wakes me up or
 

8047
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,389
on the screen and that wakes me up or
like pulling a paper which requires you

a problem right before sleep so that he
 

8063
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:05,590
a problem right before sleep so that he
can sleep through it and solve it in a

days when i was doing mathematics
 

8081
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:24,630
days when i was doing mathematics
that i had the solution to my problem as

substantial amount of time to think
 

8093
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:37,510
substantial amount of time to think
about important problems not just before

so maybe maybe of some

8260
02:29:22,469 --> 02:29:22,479
so maybe maybe of some
 

8261
02:29:22,479 --> 02:29:23,990
so maybe maybe of some
something there might be something there

8262
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:24,000
something there might be something there
 

8263

might sound like a
 

8269
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:31,270
might sound like a
simplistic or so but i would say

8270
02:29:31,270 --> 02:29:31,280
simplistic or so but i would say
 

8271
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:33,750
simplistic or so but i would say
literally just

and i remember
 

8289
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:52,070
and i remember
for some time i gave up on math because

8290
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:52,080
for some time i gave up on math because
 

8291
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:54,309
for some time i gave up on math because
my school teacher she told me that i'm

8302
02:30:04,790 --> 02:30:04,800
you mentioned something offline about
 

8303
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:06,950
you mentioned something offline about
chemistry and explosives

8304
02:30:06,950 --> 02:30:06,960
chemistry and explosives
 

8305
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:08,550
chemistry and explosives
um

8306
02:30:08,550 --> 02:30:08,560
um
 

8307
02:30:08,560 --> 02:30:11,830
um
what was that about so let's see

8308
02:30:11,830 --> 02:30:11,840
what was that about so let's see
 

8309
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:16,870
what was that about so let's see
so a story goes like that i can

8310
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:16,880

 

8311
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:19,670

i got into chemistry maybe i was like a

8312
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:19,680
i got into chemistry maybe i was like a
 

8313
02:30:19,680 --> 02:30:22,070
i got into chemistry maybe i was like a
second grade of my elementary school

8314
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:22,080
second grade of my elementary school
 

8315
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:23,270
second grade of my elementary school
third grade

8316
02:30:23,270 --> 02:30:23,280
third grade
 

8317
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:26,550
third grade
uh i started going to chemistry classes

8318
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:26,560
uh i started going to chemistry classes
 

8319
02:30:26,560 --> 02:30:27,750
uh i started going to chemistry classes
uh

8320
02:30:27,750 --> 02:30:27,760
uh
 

8321
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:31,030
uh
i i really love building stuff

8322
02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:31,040
i i really love building stuff
 

8323
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:32,150
i i really love building stuff
and

8324
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:32,160
and
 

8325
02:30:32,160 --> 02:30:33,510
and
i did all the experiments that they

8326
02:30:33,510 --> 02:30:33,520
i did all the experiments that they
 

8327
02:30:33,520 --> 02:30:36,230
i did all the experiments that they
described in the book okay you know how

8328
02:30:36,230 --> 02:30:36,240
described in the book okay you know how
 

8329
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:39,429
described in the book okay you know how
to create oxygen with vinegar and

8330
02:30:39,429 --> 02:30:39,439
to create oxygen with vinegar and
 

8331
02:30:39,439 --> 02:30:41,670
to create oxygen with vinegar and
and baking soda so okay

8332
02:30:41,670 --> 02:30:41,680
and baking soda so okay
 

8333
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:44,070
and baking soda so okay
so i did all the experiments

8334
02:30:44,070 --> 02:30:44,080
so i did all the experiments
 

8335
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:46,150
so i did all the experiments
and at some point i was you know so

8336
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:46,160
and at some point i was you know so
 

8337
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:48,309
and at some point i was you know so
what's next what can i do

8338
02:30:48,309 --> 02:30:48,319
what's next what can i do
 

8339
02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:49,830
what's next what can i do
and uh

8340
02:30:49,830 --> 02:30:49,840
and uh
 

8341
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:51,990
and uh
explosives they also it's like a you

8342
02:30:51,990 --> 02:30:52,000
explosives they also it's like a you
 

8343
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,070
explosives they also it's like a you
have a clear reward signal you know if

8344
02:30:54,070 --> 02:30:54,080
have a clear reward signal you know if
 

8345
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:56,469
have a clear reward signal you know if
the thing worked or not

8346
02:30:56,469 --> 02:30:56,479
the thing worked or not
 

8347
02:30:56,479 --> 02:30:59,030
the thing worked or not
so i remember

8348
02:30:59,030 --> 02:30:59,040
so i remember
 

8349
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:02,070
so i remember
at first i got i got interested in

8350
02:31:02,070 --> 02:31:02,080
at first i got i got interested in
 

8351
02:31:02,080 --> 02:31:03,990
at first i got i got interested in
producing hydrogen that was kind of

8352
02:31:03,990 --> 02:31:04,000
producing hydrogen that was kind of
 

8353
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,670
producing hydrogen that was kind of
funny experiment from school you can

8354
02:31:05,670 --> 02:31:05,680
funny experiment from school you can
 

8355
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:08,389
funny experiment from school you can
just burn it and then i moved to

8356
02:31:08,389 --> 02:31:08,399
just burn it and then i moved to
 

8357
02:31:08,399 --> 02:31:10,950
just burn it and then i moved to
uh nitroglycerin so that's also

8358
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:10,960
uh nitroglycerin so that's also
 

8359
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:13,429
uh nitroglycerin so that's also
relatively easy to synthesize

8360
02:31:13,429 --> 02:31:13,439
relatively easy to synthesize
 

8361
02:31:13,439 --> 02:31:15,910
relatively easy to synthesize
i started producing essentially

8362
02:31:15,910 --> 02:31:15,920
i started producing essentially
 

8363
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:18,230
i started producing essentially
dynamite and detonating with it with my

8364
02:31:18,230 --> 02:31:18,240
dynamite and detonating with it with my
 

8365
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:20,150
dynamite and detonating with it with my
friend i remember there was a you know

8366
02:31:20,150 --> 02:31:20,160
friend i remember there was a you know
 

8367
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:21,910
friend i remember there was a you know
there was at first like maybe

8368
02:31:21,910 --> 02:31:21,920
there was at first like maybe
 

8369
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:23,590
there was at first like maybe
two attempts that i went with a friend

8370
02:31:23,590 --> 02:31:23,600
two attempts that i went with a friend
 

8371
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:25,910
two attempts that i went with a friend
to detonate what we built

8372
02:31:25,910 --> 02:31:25,920
to detonate what we built
 

8373
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:27,830
to detonate what we built
and it didn't work out and like a third

8374
02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:27,840
and it didn't work out and like a third
 

8375
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:30,070
and it didn't work out and like a third
time he was like ah it won't work like

8376
02:31:30,070 --> 02:31:30,080
time he was like ah it won't work like
 

8377
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:32,309
time he was like ah it won't work like
uh let's don't waste time

8378
02:31:32,309 --> 02:31:32,319
uh let's don't waste time
 

8379
02:31:32,319 --> 02:31:35,349
uh let's don't waste time
and um now we were

8380
02:31:35,349 --> 02:31:35,359
and um now we were
 

8381
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:37,830
and um now we were
i was carrying this uh

8382
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:37,840
i was carrying this uh
 

8383
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:39,030
i was carrying this uh
this

8384
02:31:39,030 --> 02:31:39,040
this
 

8385
02:31:39,040 --> 02:31:40,950
this
you know that tube with dynamite i don't

8386
02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:40,960
you know that tube with dynamite i don't
 

8387
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:42,550
you know that tube with dynamite i don't
know pound or so

8388
02:31:42,550 --> 02:31:42,560
know pound or so
 

8389
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:45,429
know pound or so
dynamite in my backpack or like riding

8390
02:31:45,429 --> 02:31:45,439
dynamite in my backpack or like riding
 

8391
02:31:45,439 --> 02:31:47,940
dynamite in my backpack or like riding
on the bike to the edges of the city

8392
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:47,950
on the bike to the edges of the city
 

8393
02:31:47,950 --> 02:31:50,469
on the bike to the edges of the city
[Laughter]

8394
02:31:50,469 --> 02:31:50,479
[Laughter]
 

8395
02:31:50,479 --> 02:31:52,150
[Laughter]
yeah and

8396
02:31:52,150 --> 02:31:52,160
yeah and
 

8397
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:54,070
yeah and
attempt number three

8398
02:31:54,070 --> 02:31:54,080
attempt number three
 

8399
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:56,389
attempt number three
this would be to number three attempt

8400
02:31:56,389 --> 02:31:56,399
this would be to number three attempt
 

8401
02:31:56,399 --> 02:31:57,510
this would be to number three attempt
number three

8402
02:31:57,510 --> 02:31:57,520
number three
 

8403
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:58,710
number three
and uh

8404
02:31:58,710 --> 02:31:58,720
and uh
 

8405
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:00,870
and uh
now we we dig a hole to

8406
02:32:00,870 --> 02:32:00,880
now we we dig a hole to
 

8407
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:03,990
now we we dig a hole to
uh put it inside it actually had the uh

8408
02:32:03,990 --> 02:32:04,000
uh put it inside it actually had the uh
 

8409
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,950
uh put it inside it actually had the uh
you know electrical detonator

8410
02:32:06,950 --> 02:32:06,960
you know electrical detonator
 

8411
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:10,389
you know electrical detonator
we we draw a cable behind the tree

8412
02:32:10,389 --> 02:32:10,399
we we draw a cable behind the tree
 

8413
02:32:10,399 --> 02:32:12,870
we we draw a cable behind the tree
i even i never had i haven't ever seen

8414
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:12,880
i even i never had i haven't ever seen
 

8415
02:32:12,880 --> 02:32:15,270
i even i never had i haven't ever seen
like a explosion before so i thought

8416
02:32:15,270 --> 02:32:15,280
like a explosion before so i thought
 

8417
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:17,750
like a explosion before so i thought
that there will be a lot of sound

8418
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:17,760
that there will be a lot of sound
 

8419
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,590
that there will be a lot of sound
and but you know we're like laying down

8420
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:19,600
and but you know we're like laying down
 

8421
02:32:19,600 --> 02:32:21,429
and but you know we're like laying down
and i'm holding the cable and the

8422
02:32:21,429 --> 02:32:21,439
and i'm holding the cable and the
 

8423
02:32:21,439 --> 02:32:23,429
and i'm holding the cable and the
battery at some point you know it kind

8424
02:32:23,429 --> 02:32:23,439
battery at some point you know it kind
 

8425
02:32:23,439 --> 02:32:25,190
battery at some point you know it kind
of like a three to one

8426
02:32:25,190 --> 02:32:25,200
of like a three to one
 

8427
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:26,389
of like a three to one
and uh

8428
02:32:26,389 --> 02:32:26,399
and uh
 

8429
02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:28,950
and uh
i just connected it and it felt like at

8430
02:32:28,950 --> 02:32:28,960
i just connected it and it felt like at
 

8431
02:32:28,960 --> 02:32:31,270
i just connected it and it felt like at
the ground shake it was like a more like

8432
02:32:31,270 --> 02:32:31,280
the ground shake it was like a more like
 

8433
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:32,550
the ground shake it was like a more like
a

8434
02:32:32,550 --> 02:32:32,560
a
 

8435
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:33,910
a
sound and then

8436
02:32:33,910 --> 02:32:33,920
sound and then
 

8437
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:36,469
sound and then
the soil started kind of lifting up and

8438
02:32:36,469 --> 02:32:36,479
the soil started kind of lifting up and
 

8439
02:32:36,479 --> 02:32:38,389
the soil started kind of lifting up and
started falling on us yeah

8440
02:32:38,389 --> 02:32:38,399
started falling on us yeah
 

8441
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:40,469
started falling on us yeah
wow and then uh

8442
02:32:40,469 --> 02:32:40,479
wow and then uh
 

8443
02:32:40,479 --> 02:32:42,309
wow and then uh
now the friends said let's let's make

8444
02:32:42,309 --> 02:32:42,319
now the friends said let's let's make
 

8445
02:32:42,319 --> 02:32:45,590
now the friends said let's let's make
sure next time we have helmets

8446
02:32:45,590 --> 02:32:45,600
sure next time we have helmets
 

8447
02:32:45,600 --> 02:32:47,270
sure next time we have helmets
but also you know

8448
02:32:47,270 --> 02:32:47,280
but also you know
 

8449
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:49,110
but also you know
i'm happy that nothing happened to me it

8450
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:49,120
i'm happy that nothing happened to me it
 

8451
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:51,110
i'm happy that nothing happened to me it
could have been the case that i i lost

8452
02:32:51,110 --> 02:32:51,120
could have been the case that i i lost
 

8453
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:56,710
could have been the case that i i lost
the limb or so yeah but that's childhood

8454
02:32:56,710 --> 02:32:56,720

 

8455
02:32:56,720 --> 02:32:58,950

of an engineering mind

8456
02:32:58,950 --> 02:32:58,960
of an engineering mind
 

8457
02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:01,590
of an engineering mind
with a strong reward signal

8458
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:01,600
with a strong reward signal
 

8459
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:03,670
with a strong reward signal
of an explosion

8460
02:33:03,670 --> 02:33:03,680
of an explosion
 

8461
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:05,429
of an explosion
i love it

8462
02:33:05,429 --> 02:33:05,439
i love it
 

8463
02:33:05,439 --> 02:33:07,830
i love it
my there's some aspect of uh chemists

8464
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:07,840
my there's some aspect of uh chemists
 

8465
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:10,630
my there's some aspect of uh chemists
the the the chemist i know like my dad

8466
02:33:10,630 --> 02:33:10,640
the the the chemist i know like my dad
 

8467
02:33:10,640 --> 02:33:12,469
the the the chemist i know like my dad
with plasma chemistry plasma physics he

8468
02:33:12,469 --> 02:33:12,479
with plasma chemistry plasma physics he
 

8469
02:33:12,479 --> 02:33:15,030
with plasma chemistry plasma physics he
was very much into explosives too it's a

8470
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,040
was very much into explosives too it's a
 

8471
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:16,790
was very much into explosives too it's a
worrying quality of

8472
02:33:16,790 --> 02:33:16,800
worrying quality of
 

8473
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:18,550
worrying quality of
people that work in chemistry that they

8474
02:33:18,550 --> 02:33:18,560
people that work in chemistry that they
 

8475
02:33:18,560 --> 02:33:22,070
people that work in chemistry that they
love i think it is that exactly is the

8476
02:33:22,070 --> 02:33:22,080
love i think it is that exactly is the
 

8477
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:24,710
love i think it is that exactly is the
the strong signal that the thing worked

8478
02:33:24,710 --> 02:33:24,720
the strong signal that the thing worked
 

8479
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:26,630
the strong signal that the thing worked
there is no doubt there's no doubt

8480
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:26,640
there is no doubt there's no doubt
 

8481
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:28,630
there is no doubt there's no doubt
there's some magic it's almost like a

8482
02:33:28,630 --> 02:33:28,640
there's some magic it's almost like a
 

8483
02:33:28,640 --> 02:33:31,110
there's some magic it's almost like a
reminder that physics works that

8484
02:33:31,110 --> 02:33:31,120
reminder that physics works that
 

8485
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:33,670
reminder that physics works that
chemistry works it's cool it's almost

8486
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:33,680
chemistry works it's cool it's almost
 

8487
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:36,550
chemistry works it's cool it's almost
like a little glimpse at nature that you

8488
02:33:36,550 --> 02:33:36,560
like a little glimpse at nature that you
 

8489
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:39,110
like a little glimpse at nature that you
yourself engineer i that's why i really

8490
02:33:39,110 --> 02:33:39,120
yourself engineer i that's why i really
 

8491
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:40,870
yourself engineer i that's why i really
like artificial intelligence especially

8492
02:33:40,870 --> 02:33:40,880
like artificial intelligence especially
 

8493
02:33:40,880 --> 02:33:44,070
like artificial intelligence especially
robotics is you create

8494
02:33:44,070 --> 02:33:44,080
robotics is you create
 

8495
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,230
robotics is you create
a little piece of nature

8496
02:33:46,230 --> 02:33:46,240
a little piece of nature
 

8497
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,830
a little piece of nature
and in some sense even for me with

8498
02:33:47,830 --> 02:33:47,840
and in some sense even for me with
 

8499
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:50,150
and in some sense even for me with
explosives the motivation was creation

8500
02:33:50,150 --> 02:33:50,160
explosives the motivation was creation
 

8501
02:33:50,160 --> 02:33:52,790
explosives the motivation was creation
rather than distraction yes exactly

8502
02:33:52,790 --> 02:33:52,800
rather than distraction yes exactly
 

8503
02:33:52,800 --> 02:33:55,830
rather than distraction yes exactly
in terms of advice i forgot to ask

8504
02:33:55,830 --> 02:33:55,840
in terms of advice i forgot to ask
 

8505
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:57,590
in terms of advice i forgot to ask
about just machine learning and deep

8506
02:33:57,590 --> 02:33:57,600
about just machine learning and deep
 

8507
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:59,910
about just machine learning and deep
learning for people who are specifically

8508
02:33:59,910 --> 02:33:59,920
learning for people who are specifically
 

8509
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:01,349
learning for people who are specifically
interested in

8510
02:34:01,349 --> 02:34:01,359
interested in
 

8511
02:34:01,359 --> 02:34:02,950
interested in
machine learning how would you recommend

8512
02:34:02,950 --> 02:34:02,960
machine learning how would you recommend
 

8513
02:34:02,960 --> 02:34:04,469
machine learning how would you recommend
they get into the field

8514
02:34:04,469 --> 02:34:04,479
they get into the field
 

8515
02:34:04,479 --> 02:34:07,429
they get into the field
so um i would say implement everything

8516
02:34:07,429 --> 02:34:07,439
so um i would say implement everything
 

8517
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:09,670
so um i would say implement everything
and also there is plenty of courses

8518
02:34:09,670 --> 02:34:09,680
and also there is plenty of courses
 

8519
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:12,309
and also there is plenty of courses
so like from scratch um so on different

8520
02:34:12,309 --> 02:34:12,319
so like from scratch um so on different
 

8521
02:34:12,319 --> 02:34:14,070
so like from scratch um so on different
levels of abstraction in some sense but

8522
02:34:14,070 --> 02:34:14,080
levels of abstraction in some sense but
 

8523
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:15,670
levels of abstraction in some sense but
i would say brain or implement something

8524
02:34:15,670 --> 02:34:15,680
i would say brain or implement something
 

8525
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:17,670
i would say brain or implement something
from scratch or implement something from

8526
02:34:17,670 --> 02:34:17,680
from scratch or implement something from
 

8527
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:19,990
from scratch or implement something from
a paper or implement something you know

8528
02:34:19,990 --> 02:34:20,000
a paper or implement something you know
 

8529
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,309
a paper or implement something you know
from podcasts that you have heard about

8530
02:34:22,309 --> 02:34:22,319
from podcasts that you have heard about
 

8531
02:34:22,319 --> 02:34:24,150
from podcasts that you have heard about
i would say that's a powerful way to

8532
02:34:24,150 --> 02:34:24,160
i would say that's a powerful way to
 

8533
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:25,990
i would say that's a powerful way to
understand things so it's often the case

8534
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:26,000
understand things so it's often the case
 

8535
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,389
understand things so it's often the case
that you read the description and you

8536
02:34:28,389 --> 02:34:28,399
that you read the description and you
 

8537
02:34:28,399 --> 02:34:31,270
that you read the description and you
think you understand but you truly

8538
02:34:31,270 --> 02:34:31,280
think you understand but you truly
 

8539
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:33,349
think you understand but you truly
understand once you build it

8540
02:34:33,349 --> 02:34:33,359
understand once you build it
 

8541
02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:35,590
understand once you build it
then you actually know what really meant

8542
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:35,600
then you actually know what really meant
 

8543
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:37,190
then you actually know what really meant
that in the description

8544
02:34:37,190 --> 02:34:37,200
that in the description
 

8545
02:34:37,200 --> 02:34:39,429
that in the description
is there particular topics that you find

8546
02:34:39,429 --> 02:34:39,439
is there particular topics that you find
 

8547
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:40,550
is there particular topics that you find
people just

8548
02:34:40,550 --> 02:34:40,560
people just
 

8549
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:45,190
people just
fall in love with so i i've seen

8550
02:34:45,190 --> 02:34:45,200
fall in love with so i i've seen
 

8551
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:47,510
fall in love with so i i've seen
i tend to uh really enjoy reinforcement

8552
02:34:47,510 --> 02:34:47,520
i tend to uh really enjoy reinforcement
 

8553
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:48,790
i tend to uh really enjoy reinforcement
learning

8554
02:34:48,790 --> 02:34:48,800
learning
 

8555
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:51,270
learning
because it's it's much more

8556
02:34:51,270 --> 02:34:51,280
because it's it's much more
 

8557
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:54,070
because it's it's much more
it's much easier to get to a point where

8558
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:54,080
it's much easier to get to a point where
 

8559
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,429
it's much easier to get to a point where
you feel like you created something

8560
02:34:55,429 --> 02:34:55,439
you feel like you created something
 

8561
02:34:55,439 --> 02:34:56,710
you feel like you created something
special

8562
02:34:56,710 --> 02:34:56,720
special
 

8563
02:34:56,720 --> 02:34:58,710
special
like like fun games kind of things that

8564
02:34:58,710 --> 02:34:58,720
like like fun games kind of things that
 

8565
02:34:58,720 --> 02:35:01,510
like like fun games kind of things that
are rewarding it's rewarding yeah

8566
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:01,520
are rewarding it's rewarding yeah
 

8567
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:03,670
are rewarding it's rewarding yeah
uh as opposed to like

8568
02:35:03,670 --> 02:35:03,680
uh as opposed to like
 

8569
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:06,150
uh as opposed to like
uh reimplementing from scratch

8570
02:35:06,150 --> 02:35:06,160
uh reimplementing from scratch
 

8571
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:07,910
uh reimplementing from scratch
more like supervised learning kind of

8572
02:35:07,910 --> 02:35:07,920
more like supervised learning kind of
 

8573
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:12,630
more like supervised learning kind of
things it's it's yeah so you know if if

8574
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:12,640
things it's it's yeah so you know if if
 

8575
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:14,550
things it's it's yeah so you know if if
someone would optimize for things to be

8576
02:35:14,550 --> 02:35:14,560
someone would optimize for things to be
 

8577
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:16,469
someone would optimize for things to be
rewarding then it feels that the things

8578
02:35:16,469 --> 02:35:16,479
rewarding then it feels that the things
 

8579
02:35:16,479 --> 02:35:18,389
rewarding then it feels that the things
that are somewhat generative they have

8580
02:35:18,389 --> 02:35:18,399
that are somewhat generative they have
 

8581
02:35:18,399 --> 02:35:20,070
that are somewhat generative they have
such a property so yes you have for

8582
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:20,080
such a property so yes you have for
 

8583
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:22,469
such a property so yes you have for
instance yes adversarial networks or you

8584
02:35:22,469 --> 02:35:22,479
instance yes adversarial networks or you
 

8585
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:25,590
instance yes adversarial networks or you
have just even generated language models

8586
02:35:25,590 --> 02:35:25,600
have just even generated language models
 

8587
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:28,309
have just even generated language models
and you could you can even see

8588
02:35:28,309 --> 02:35:28,319
and you could you can even see
 

8589
02:35:28,319 --> 02:35:30,230
and you could you can even see
um internally we have seen this thing

8590
02:35:30,230 --> 02:35:30,240
um internally we have seen this thing
 

8591
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:33,429
um internally we have seen this thing
with our releases so we have a we

8592
02:35:33,429 --> 02:35:33,439
with our releases so we have a we
 

8593
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:35,110
with our releases so we have a we
released recently two models there is

8594
02:35:35,110 --> 02:35:35,120
released recently two models there is
 

8595
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:37,349
released recently two models there is
one model called dali that generates

8596
02:35:37,349 --> 02:35:37,359
one model called dali that generates
 

8597
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:39,510
one model called dali that generates
images and there is other model called

8598
02:35:39,510 --> 02:35:39,520
images and there is other model called
 

8599
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:42,070
images and there is other model called
clip that actually uh

8600
02:35:42,070 --> 02:35:42,080
clip that actually uh
 

8601
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:43,429
clip that actually uh
you provide

8602
02:35:43,429 --> 02:35:43,439
you provide
 

8603
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:45,590
you provide
various possibilities what could be the

8604
02:35:45,590 --> 02:35:45,600
various possibilities what could be the
 

8605
02:35:45,600 --> 02:35:47,510
various possibilities what could be the
answer to what is on the picture and it

8606
02:35:47,510 --> 02:35:47,520
answer to what is on the picture and it
 

8607
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:48,870
answer to what is on the picture and it
can tell you which one is the most

8608
02:35:48,870 --> 02:35:48,880
can tell you which one is the most
 

8609
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:50,550
can tell you which one is the most
likely okay

8610
02:35:50,550 --> 02:35:50,560
likely okay
 

8611
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:53,110
likely okay
and in some sense in case of the

8612
02:35:53,110 --> 02:35:53,120
and in some sense in case of the
 

8613
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:54,630
and in some sense in case of the
first one dali

8614
02:35:54,630 --> 02:35:54,640
first one dali
 

8615
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:57,349
first one dali
it is very easy for you to understand

8616
02:35:57,349 --> 02:35:57,359
it is very easy for you to understand
 

8617
02:35:57,359 --> 02:36:00,630
it is very easy for you to understand
that actually there is magic going on uh

8618
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:00,640
that actually there is magic going on uh
 

8619
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:02,550
that actually there is magic going on uh
and in the in case of the second one

8620
02:36:02,550 --> 02:36:02,560
and in the in case of the second one
 

8621
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:04,950
and in the in case of the second one
even though it is insanely powerful and

8622
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:04,960
even though it is insanely powerful and
 

8623
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:07,750
even though it is insanely powerful and
you know people from a vision community

8624
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:07,760
you know people from a vision community
 

8625
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:09,910
you know people from a vision community
they as they started probing it inside

8626
02:36:09,910 --> 02:36:09,920
they as they started probing it inside
 

8627
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:13,590
they as they started probing it inside
they actually understood

8628
02:36:13,590 --> 02:36:13,600

 

8629
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:16,150

how far it goes it's difficult for

8630
02:36:16,150 --> 02:36:16,160
how far it goes it's difficult for
 

8631
02:36:16,160 --> 02:36:19,110
how far it goes it's difficult for
person at first to see

8632
02:36:19,110 --> 02:36:19,120
person at first to see
 

8633
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:21,510
person at first to see
how well it works

8634
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:21,520
how well it works
 

8635
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:23,110
how well it works
and that's the same as you said that in

8636
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:23,120
and that's the same as you said that in
 

8637
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:25,030
and that's the same as you said that in
case of supervised learning models you

8638
02:36:25,030 --> 02:36:25,040
case of supervised learning models you
 

8639
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:26,870
case of supervised learning models you
might not kind of see

8640
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:26,880
might not kind of see
 

8641
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:28,309
might not kind of see
or it's not that easy for you to

8642
02:36:28,309 --> 02:36:28,319
or it's not that easy for you to
 

8643
02:36:28,319 --> 02:36:31,190
or it's not that easy for you to
understand the the strength

8644
02:36:31,190 --> 02:36:31,200
understand the the strength
 

8645
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:32,950
understand the the strength
even though you don't believe in magic

8646
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:32,960
even though you don't believe in magic
 

8647
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:35,030
even though you don't believe in magic
to see the magic let's say that magic

8648
02:36:35,030 --> 02:36:35,040
to see the magic let's say that magic
 

8649
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:36,870
to see the magic let's say that magic
it's a generative that's really

8650
02:36:36,870 --> 02:36:36,880
it's a generative that's really
 

8651
02:36:36,880 --> 02:36:39,590
it's a generative that's really
brilliant so anything that's generative

8652
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:39,600
brilliant so anything that's generative
 

8653
02:36:39,600 --> 02:36:41,429
brilliant so anything that's generative
because then you are

8654
02:36:41,429 --> 02:36:41,439
because then you are
 

8655
02:36:41,439 --> 02:36:43,349
because then you are
at the core of the creation you get to

8656
02:36:43,349 --> 02:36:43,359
at the core of the creation you get to
 

8657
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:45,270
at the core of the creation you get to
experience creation

8658
02:36:45,270 --> 02:36:45,280
experience creation
 

8659
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,270
experience creation
without much effort unless you have to

8660
02:36:47,270 --> 02:36:47,280
without much effort unless you have to
 

8661
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:50,070
without much effort unless you have to
do it from scratch but and it feels that

02:36:50,070 --> 02:36:50,080
do it from scratch but and it feels that
 

8663
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:52,469
do it from scratch but and it feels that
you know humans are wired there is some

8664
02:36:52,469 --> 02:36:52,479
you know humans are wired there is some
 

8665
02:36:52,479 --> 02:36:55,910
you know humans are wired there is some
level of reward for creating stuff yeah

8666
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:55,920
level of reward for creating stuff yeah
 

8667
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:57,670
level of reward for creating stuff yeah
like of course different people have a

like of course different people have a
 

8669
02:36:57,680 --> 02:37:00,469
like of course different people have a
different weight on this reward yeah

8670
02:37:00,469 --> 02:37:00,479
different weight on this reward yeah
 

8671
02:37:00,479 --> 02:37:02,150
different weight on this reward yeah
in the big objective function in the big

8672
02:37:02,150 --> 02:37:02,160
in the big objective function in the big
 

8673
02:37:02,160 --> 02:37:03,190
in the big objective function in the big

02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:11,280
experience these objects and then two i
 

8789
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:12,630
experience these objects and then two i
can't believe

8790
02:39:12,630 --> 02:39:12,640
can't believe
 

8791
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:14,230
can't believe
humans are clever enough to have built

8792
02:39:14,230 --> 02:39:14,240
humans are clever enough to have built
 

8793
02:39:14,240 --> 02:39:15,910
humans are clever enough to have built
these objects

8794
02:39:15,910 --> 02:39:15,920
these objects
 

8795
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:18,550
these objects
the the hierarchy of pleasure that that

8796
02:39:18,550 --> 02:39:18,560
the the hierarchy of pleasure that that
 

8797
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:21,190
the the hierarchy of pleasure that that
uh provides is infinite i mean even if

8798
02:39:21,190 --> 02:39:21,200
uh provides is infinite i mean even if
 

8799
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:23,190
uh provides is infinite i mean even if
you look at the cup of water so you know

8800
02:39:23,190 --> 02:39:23,200
you look at the cup of water so you know
 

8801
02:39:23,200 --> 02:39:25,110
you look at the cup of water so you know
you see first like a level of like a

8802
02:39:25,110 --> 02:39:25,120
you see first like a level of like a
 

8803
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:27,429
you see first like a level of like a
reflection of light but then you think

8804
02:39:27,429 --> 02:39:27,439
reflection of light but then you think
 

8805
02:39:27,439 --> 02:39:29,110
reflection of light but then you think
you know man there's like a trillions

8806
02:39:29,110 --> 02:39:29,120
you know man there's like a trillions
 

8807
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:31,510
you know man there's like a trillions
upon of trillions of particles bouncing

8808
02:39:31,510 --> 02:39:31,520
upon of trillions of particles bouncing
 

8809
02:39:31,520 --> 02:39:34,790
upon of trillions of particles bouncing
uh against each other there is also uh

8810
02:39:34,790 --> 02:39:34,800
uh against each other there is also uh
 

8811
02:39:34,800 --> 02:39:37,349
uh against each other there is also uh
the tension on the surface that you know

8812
02:39:37,349 --> 02:39:37,359
the tension on the surface that you know
 

8813
02:39:37,359 --> 02:39:39,750
the tension on the surface that you know
if the back back could like a stand on

8814
02:39:39,750 --> 02:39:39,760
if the back back could like a stand on
 

8815
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:42,230
if the back back could like a stand on
it and move around and you think it also

8816
02:39:42,230 --> 02:39:42,240
it and move around and you think it also
 

8817
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:44,550
it and move around and you think it also
has this like a magical property that as

8818
02:39:44,550 --> 02:39:44,560
has this like a magical property that as
 

8819
02:39:44,560 --> 02:39:46,469
has this like a magical property that as
you decrease temperature

8820
02:39:46,469 --> 02:39:46,479
you decrease temperature
 

8821
02:39:46,479 --> 02:39:48,630
you decrease temperature
it actually expands in volume which

8822
02:39:48,630 --> 02:39:48,640
it actually expands in volume which
 

8823
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:50,469
it actually expands in volume which
allows for the

8824
02:39:50,469 --> 02:39:50,479
allows for the
 

8825
02:39:50,479 --> 02:39:52,870
allows for the
you know legs to freeze on the on the

8826
02:39:52,870 --> 02:39:52,880
you know legs to freeze on the on the
 

8827
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:54,630
you know legs to freeze on the on the
surface and then at the bottom to have

8828
02:39:54,630 --> 02:39:54,640
surface and then at the bottom to have
 

8829
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:56,710
surface and then at the bottom to have
actually uh not freeze which allows for

8830
02:39:56,710 --> 02:39:56,720
actually uh not freeze which allows for
 

8831
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:58,150
actually uh not freeze which allows for
life like a

8832
02:39:58,150 --> 02:39:58,160
life like a
 

8833
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:00,550
life like a
crazy yeah you look

8834
02:40:00,550 --> 02:40:00,560
crazy yeah you look
 

8835
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:02,230
crazy yeah you look
in detail at some object and you think

8836
02:40:02,230 --> 02:40:02,240
in detail at some object and you think
 

8837
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:04,630
in detail at some object and you think
actually you know this table that was

8838
02:40:04,630 --> 02:40:04,640
actually you know this table that was
 

8839
02:40:04,640 --> 02:40:05,830
actually you know this table that was
just the figment of someone's

8840
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:05,840
just the figment of someone's
 

8841
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,830
just the figment of someone's
imagination at some point and then there

8842
02:40:07,830 --> 02:40:07,840
imagination at some point and then there
 

8843
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:09,510
imagination at some point and then there
was like thousands of people involved to

8844
02:40:09,510 --> 02:40:09,520
was like thousands of people involved to
 

8845
02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:11,670
was like thousands of people involved to
actually manufacture it yeah and put it

8846
02:40:11,670 --> 02:40:11,680
actually manufacture it yeah and put it
 

8847
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:14,890
actually manufacture it yeah and put it
here and by default no one cares

8848
02:40:14,890 --> 02:40:14,900
here and by default no one cares
 

8849
02:40:14,900 --> 02:40:16,389
here and by default no one cares
[Laughter]

8850
02:40:16,389 --> 02:40:16,399
[Laughter]
 

8851
02:40:16,399 --> 02:40:17,590
[Laughter]
and then you can start thinking about

8852
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:17,600
and then you can start thinking about
 

8853
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:19,429
and then you can start thinking about
evolution how it all started from single

8854
02:40:19,429 --> 02:40:19,439
evolution how it all started from single
 

8855
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:20,950
evolution how it all started from single
cell organisms

8856
02:40:20,950 --> 02:40:20,960
cell organisms
 

8857
02:40:20,960 --> 02:40:23,670
cell organisms
that led to this table and and okay

8858
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:23,680
that led to this table and and okay
 

8859
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:25,030
that led to this table and and okay
these thoughts they give me life

8860
02:40:25,030 --> 02:40:25,040
these thoughts they give me life
 

8861
02:40:25,040 --> 02:40:27,190
these thoughts they give me life
appreciation yeah and

8862
02:40:27,190 --> 02:40:27,200
appreciation yeah and
 

8863
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:28,870
appreciation yeah and
even lack of those just the pure raw

8864
02:40:28,870 --> 02:40:28,880
even lack of those just the pure raw
 

8865
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:30,469
even lack of those just the pure raw
signal also gives their life

8866
02:40:30,469 --> 02:40:30,479
signal also gives their life
 

8867
02:40:30,479 --> 02:40:33,510
signal also gives their life
appreciation see the thing is

8868
02:40:33,510 --> 02:40:33,520
appreciation see the thing is
 

8869
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:36,389
appreciation see the thing is
and then that's coupled

8870
02:40:36,389 --> 02:40:36,399
and then that's coupled
 

8871
02:40:36,399 --> 02:40:38,389
and then that's coupled
for me with the sadness that the whole

8872
02:40:38,389 --> 02:40:38,399
for me with the sadness that the whole
 

8873
02:40:38,399 --> 02:40:39,990
for me with the sadness that the whole
ride ends

8874
02:40:39,990 --> 02:40:40,000
ride ends
 

8875
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,710
ride ends
and perhaps is deeply coupled in that

8876
02:40:42,710 --> 02:40:42,720
and perhaps is deeply coupled in that
 

8877
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:44,469
and perhaps is deeply coupled in that
the fact that this experience this

8878
02:40:44,469 --> 02:40:44,479
the fact that this experience this
 

8879
02:40:44,479 --> 02:40:45,990
the fact that this experience this
moment ends

8880
02:40:45,990 --> 02:40:46,000
moment ends
 

8881
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,510
moment ends
gives it

8882
02:40:47,510 --> 02:40:47,520
gives it
 

8883
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:49,670
gives it
gives it an intensity that i'm not sure

8884
02:40:49,670 --> 02:40:49,680
gives it an intensity that i'm not sure
 

8885
02:40:49,680 --> 02:40:51,349
gives it an intensity that i'm not sure
i would otherwise have

8886
02:40:51,349 --> 02:40:51,359
i would otherwise have
 

8887
02:40:51,359 --> 02:40:53,830
i would otherwise have
so in that same way i try to meditate on

8888
02:40:53,830 --> 02:40:53,840
so in that same way i try to meditate on
 

8889
02:40:53,840 --> 02:40:56,150
so in that same way i try to meditate on
my own death often

8890
02:40:56,150 --> 02:40:56,160
my own death often
 

8891
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:59,190
my own death often
do you think about your mortality

8892
02:40:59,190 --> 02:40:59,200
do you think about your mortality
 

8893
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:03,190
do you think about your mortality
are you afraid of death

8894
02:41:03,190 --> 02:41:03,200

 

8895
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:04,070

so

8896
02:41:04,070 --> 02:41:04,080
so
 

8897
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:06,150
so
fear of death is like one of the most

8898
02:41:06,150 --> 02:41:06,160
fear of death is like one of the most
 

8899
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:09,269
fear of death is like one of the most
fundamental fears that each of us has we

8900
02:41:09,269 --> 02:41:09,279
fundamental fears that each of us has we
 

8901
02:41:09,279 --> 02:41:11,110
fundamental fears that each of us has we
might be not even aware of it it

8902
02:41:11,110 --> 02:41:11,120
might be not even aware of it it
 

8903
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:12,950
might be not even aware of it it
requires to look inside to even

8904
02:41:12,950 --> 02:41:12,960
requires to look inside to even
 

8905
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,790
requires to look inside to even
recognize that it's

8906
02:41:14,790 --> 02:41:14,800
recognize that it's
 

8907
02:41:14,800 --> 02:41:16,870
recognize that it's
out there and there is still let's say

8908
02:41:16,870 --> 02:41:16,880
out there and there is still let's say
 

8909
02:41:16,880 --> 02:41:18,710
out there and there is still let's say
this property

8910
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:18,720
this property
 

8911
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:22,230
this property
of uh nature that if things would last

8912
02:41:22,230 --> 02:41:22,240
of uh nature that if things would last
 

8913
02:41:22,240 --> 02:41:24,790
of uh nature that if things would last
forever then they would be also boring

8914
02:41:24,790 --> 02:41:24,800
forever then they would be also boring
 

8915
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:26,070
forever then they would be also boring
to us

8916
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:26,080
to us
 

8917
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:27,910
to us
the fact that the things change in some

8918
02:41:27,910 --> 02:41:27,920
the fact that the things change in some
 

8919
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:29,269
the fact that the things change in some
way

8920
02:41:29,269 --> 02:41:29,279
way
 

8921
02:41:29,279 --> 02:41:31,670
way
gives any meaning to them

8922
02:41:31,670 --> 02:41:31,680
gives any meaning to them
 

8923
02:41:31,680 --> 02:41:34,469
gives any meaning to them
i also you know found out that

8924
02:41:34,469 --> 02:41:34,479
i also you know found out that
 

8925
02:41:34,479 --> 02:41:36,950
i also you know found out that
it seems to be

8926
02:41:36,950 --> 02:41:36,960
it seems to be
 

8927
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:40,389
it seems to be
very healing to people to

8928
02:41:40,389 --> 02:41:40,399
very healing to people to
 

8929
02:41:40,399 --> 02:41:42,469
very healing to people to
have

8930
02:41:42,469 --> 02:41:42,479
have
 

8931
02:41:42,479 --> 02:41:44,870
have
this short experiences

8932
02:41:44,870 --> 02:41:44,880
this short experiences
 

8933
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:47,910
this short experiences
uh like i guess psychedelic experiences

8934
02:41:47,910 --> 02:41:47,920
uh like i guess psychedelic experiences
 

8935
02:41:47,920 --> 02:41:51,030
uh like i guess psychedelic experiences
in which they experience

8936
02:41:51,030 --> 02:41:51,040
in which they experience
 

8937
02:41:51,040 --> 02:41:53,750
in which they experience
death of self

8938
02:41:53,750 --> 02:41:53,760
death of self
 

8939
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:56,830
death of self
in which they let go of this fear and

8940
02:41:56,830 --> 02:41:56,840
in which they let go of this fear and
 

8941
02:41:56,840 --> 02:41:59,429
in which they let go of this fear and
then maybe can even increase the

8942
02:41:59,429 --> 02:41:59,439
then maybe can even increase the
 

8943
02:41:59,439 --> 02:42:01,990
then maybe can even increase the
appreciation of the moment and it seems

8944
02:42:01,990 --> 02:42:02,000
appreciation of the moment and it seems
 

8945
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:05,670
appreciation of the moment and it seems
that many people they uh

8946
02:42:05,670 --> 02:42:05,680
that many people they uh
 

8947
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:07,110
that many people they uh
they

8948
02:42:07,110 --> 02:42:07,120
they
 

8949
02:42:07,120 --> 02:42:10,150
they
they can easily comprehend fine the fact

8950
02:42:10,150 --> 02:42:10,160
they can easily comprehend fine the fact
 

8951
02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:13,030

say at some point found out that they

9114
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:10,720
say at some point found out that they
 

9115
02:45:10,720 --> 02:45:13,190
say at some point found out that they
have cancer and that also gives you know

9116
02:45:13,190 --> 02:45:13,200
have cancer and that also gives you know
 

9117
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:15,110
have cancer and that also gives you know
huge perspective with respect to what

9118
02:45:15,110 --> 02:45:15,120
huge perspective with respect to what
 

9119
02:45:15,120 --> 02:45:17,750
huge perspective with respect to what
matters now yeah and you know often

9120
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:17,760
matters now yeah and you know often
 

9121
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:19,269
matters now yeah and you know often
people in situations like that they

9122
02:45:19,269 --> 02:45:19,279
people in situations like that they
 

9123
02:45:19,279 --> 02:45:20,870
people in situations like that they
conclude that actually what matters is

9124
02:45:20,870 --> 02:45:20,880
conclude that actually what matters is
 

9125
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:22,710
conclude that actually what matters is
human connection

9126
02:45:22,710 --> 02:45:22,720
human connection
 

9127
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:23,429
human connection
and

9128
02:45:23,429 --> 02:45:23,439
and
 

9129
02:45:23,439 --> 02:45:26,630
and
love and uh that's people conclude also

9130
02:45:26,630 --> 02:45:26,640
love and uh that's people conclude also
 

9131
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:29,590
love and uh that's people conclude also
if you have kids because kids is family

9132
02:45:29,590 --> 02:45:29,600
if you have kids because kids is family
 

9133
02:45:29,600 --> 02:45:31,830
if you have kids because kids is family
you uh i think tweeted

9134
02:45:31,830 --> 02:45:31,840
you uh i think tweeted
 

9135
02:45:31,840 --> 02:45:33,990
you uh i think tweeted
we don't assign the minus infinity

9136
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:34,000
we don't assign the minus infinity
 

9137
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,150
we don't assign the minus infinity
reward to our death

9138
02:45:36,150 --> 02:45:36,160
reward to our death
 

9139
02:45:36,160 --> 02:45:37,990
reward to our death
such a reward would prevent us from

9140
02:45:37,990 --> 02:45:38,000
such a reward would prevent us from
 

9141
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,389
such a reward would prevent us from
taking any risk we wouldn't be able to

9142
02:45:40,389 --> 02:45:40,399
taking any risk we wouldn't be able to
 

9143
02:45:40,399 --> 02:45:42,469
taking any risk we wouldn't be able to
cross the road in fear of being hit by a

9144
02:45:42,469 --> 02:45:42,479
cross the road in fear of being hit by a
 

9145
02:45:42,479 --> 02:45:44,870
cross the road in fear of being hit by a
car so in the objective function you

9146
02:45:44,870 --> 02:45:44,880
car so in the objective function you
 

9147
02:45:44,880 --> 02:45:46,230
car so in the objective function you
mentioned fear of death might be

9148
02:45:46,230 --> 02:45:46,240
mentioned fear of death might be
 

9149
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:49,190
mentioned fear of death might be
fundamental to the human condition

9150
02:45:49,190 --> 02:45:49,200
fundamental to the human condition
 

9151
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:49,990
fundamental to the human condition
so

9152
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,000
so
 

9153
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,750
so
as i said let's assume that they're like

9154
02:45:51,750 --> 02:45:51,760
as i said let's assume that they're like
 

9155
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:54,150
as i said let's assume that they're like
a reward functions in our brain

9156
02:45:54,150 --> 02:45:54,160
a reward functions in our brain
 

9157
02:45:54,160 --> 02:45:55,830
a reward functions in our brain
and

9158
02:45:55,830 --> 02:45:55,840
and
 

9159
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:58,469
and
and the interesting thing is

9160
02:45:58,469 --> 02:45:58,479
and the interesting thing is
 

9161
02:45:58,479 --> 02:46:01,830
and the interesting thing is
even realization how different reward

9162
02:46:01,830 --> 02:46:01,840
even realization how different reward
 

9163
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:04,870
even realization how different reward
functions can play with your behavior

9164
02:46:04,870 --> 02:46:04,880
functions can play with your behavior
 

9165
02:46:04,880 --> 02:46:06,950
functions can play with your behavior
as a matter of fact i wouldn't say that

9166
02:46:06,950 --> 02:46:06,960
as a matter of fact i wouldn't say that
 

9167
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:09,190
as a matter of fact i wouldn't say that
you should assign infinite

9168
02:46:09,190 --> 02:46:09,200
you should assign infinite
 

9169
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:11,830
you should assign infinite
negative reward to anything because that

9170
02:46:11,830 --> 02:46:11,840
negative reward to anything because that
 

9171
02:46:11,840 --> 02:46:13,910
negative reward to anything because that
messes up the math

9172
02:46:13,910 --> 02:46:13,920
messes up the math
 

9173
02:46:13,920 --> 02:46:15,510
messes up the math
the math doesn't work out it doesn't

9174
02:46:15,510 --> 02:46:15,520
the math doesn't work out it doesn't
 

9175
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:17,990
the math doesn't work out it doesn't
work out and as you said even you know

9176
02:46:17,990 --> 02:46:18,000
work out and as you said even you know
 

9177
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:19,990
work out and as you said even you know
uh government or some insurance

9178
02:46:19,990 --> 02:46:20,000
uh government or some insurance
 

9179
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,150
uh government or some insurance
companies you said they assign 99

9180
02:46:22,150 --> 02:46:22,160
companies you said they assign 99
 

9181
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:24,389
companies you said they assign 99
million dollars to human life yeah and

9182
02:46:24,389 --> 02:46:24,399
million dollars to human life yeah and
 

9183
02:46:24,399 --> 02:46:28,230
million dollars to human life yeah and
i'm just saying it with respect to

9184
02:46:28,230 --> 02:46:28,240
i'm just saying it with respect to
 

9185
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:30,230
i'm just saying it with respect to
that might be a harsh statement to

9186
02:46:30,230 --> 02:46:30,240
that might be a harsh statement to
 

9187
02:46:30,240 --> 02:46:32,070
that might be a harsh statement to
ourselves but in some sense that there

9188
02:46:32,070 --> 02:46:32,080
ourselves but in some sense that there
 

9189
02:46:32,080 --> 02:46:35,990
ourselves but in some sense that there
is a finite value of our own life

9190
02:46:35,990 --> 02:46:36,000

 

9191
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,110

i'm trying to put it from perspective of

9192
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:39,120
i'm trying to put it from perspective of
 

9193
02:46:39,120 --> 02:46:39,910
i'm trying to put it from perspective of
being

9194
02:46:39,910 --> 02:46:39,920
being
 

9195
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:40,870
being
less

9196
02:46:40,870 --> 02:46:40,880
less
 

9197
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:43,750
less
of being more egoless

9198
02:46:43,750 --> 02:46:43,760
of being more egoless
 

9199
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:47,349
of being more egoless
and realizing fragility of my own life

9200
02:46:47,349 --> 02:46:47,359
and realizing fragility of my own life
 

9201
02:46:47,359 --> 02:46:48,230
and realizing fragility of my own life
and

9202
02:46:48,230 --> 02:46:48,240
and
 

9203
02:46:48,240 --> 02:46:49,510
and
in some sense

9204
02:46:49,510 --> 02:46:49,520
in some sense
 

9205
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:50,550
in some sense
the

9206
02:46:50,550 --> 02:46:50,560
the
 

9207
02:46:50,560 --> 02:46:52,630
the
fear of death

9208
02:46:52,630 --> 02:46:52,640
fear of death
 

9209
02:46:52,640 --> 02:46:54,790
fear of death
might prevent you from acting

9210
02:46:54,790 --> 02:46:54,800
might prevent you from acting
 

9211
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:58,469
might prevent you from acting
because anything can cause death

9212
02:46:58,469 --> 02:46:58,479
because anything can cause death
 

9213
02:46:58,479 --> 02:47:00,389
because anything can cause death
yeah and i'm sure actually if you were

9214
02:47:00,389 --> 02:47:00,399
yeah and i'm sure actually if you were
 

9215
02:47:00,399 --> 02:47:02,389
yeah and i'm sure actually if you were
to put death in the objective function

9216
02:47:02,389 --> 02:47:02,399
to put death in the objective function
 

9217
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:05,030
to put death in the objective function
there's probably so many aspects to

9218
02:47:05,030 --> 02:47:05,040
there's probably so many aspects to
 

9219
02:47:05,040 --> 02:47:07,269
there's probably so many aspects to
death and fear of death and

9220
02:47:07,269 --> 02:47:07,279
death and fear of death and
 

9221
02:47:07,279 --> 02:47:10,630
death and fear of death and
realization of death and mortality

9222
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:10,640
realization of death and mortality
 

9223
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:12,309
realization of death and mortality
there's just whole components of

9224
02:47:12,309 --> 02:47:12,319
there's just whole components of
 

9225
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:14,150
there's just whole components of
finiteness

9226
02:47:14,150 --> 02:47:14,160
finiteness
 

9227
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:16,469
finiteness
of not just your life but every

9228
02:47:16,469 --> 02:47:16,479
of not just your life but every
 

9229
02:47:16,479 --> 02:47:18,790
of not just your life but every
experience and so on you're gonna have

9230
02:47:18,790 --> 02:47:18,800
experience and so on you're gonna have
 

9231
02:47:18,800 --> 02:47:22,550
experience and so on you're gonna have
to formalize mathematically and also you

9232
02:47:22,550 --> 02:47:22,560
to formalize mathematically and also you
 

9233
02:47:22,560 --> 02:47:24,950
to formalize mathematically and also you
know that might lead to

9234
02:47:24,950 --> 02:47:24,960
know that might lead to
 

9235
02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:26,309
know that might lead to
um

9236
02:47:26,309 --> 02:47:26,319
um
 

9237
02:47:26,319 --> 02:47:29,269
um
you spending a lot of compute cycles

9238
02:47:29,269 --> 02:47:29,279
you spending a lot of compute cycles
 

9239
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:31,429
you spending a lot of compute cycles
on this like a

9240
02:47:31,429 --> 02:47:31,439
on this like a
 

9241
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:34,630
on this like a
and deliberating this terrible future

9242
02:47:34,630 --> 02:47:34,640
and deliberating this terrible future
 

9243
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:38,070
and deliberating this terrible future
instead of experiencing now

9244
02:47:38,070 --> 02:47:38,080
instead of experiencing now
 

9245
02:47:38,080 --> 02:47:40,070
instead of experiencing now
and that in some sense is also kind of

9246
02:47:40,070 --> 02:47:40,080
and that in some sense is also kind of
 

9247
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:41,750
and that in some sense is also kind of
unpleasant simulation to run in your

9248
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:41,760
unpleasant simulation to run in your
 

9249
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:44,790
unpleasant simulation to run in your
head yeah

9250
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:44,800

 

9251
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:46,150

do you think there's an objective

9252
02:47:46,150 --> 02:47:46,160
do you think there's an objective
 

9253
02:47:46,160 --> 02:47:48,790
do you think there's an objective
function that describes the entirety of

9254
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:48,800
function that describes the entirety of
 

9255
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:49,990
function that describes the entirety of
uh

9256
02:47:49,990 --> 02:47:50,000
uh
 

9257
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,510
uh
human life

9258
02:47:51,510 --> 02:47:51,520
human life
 

9259
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:53,910
human life
so you know usually the way you ask that

9260
02:47:53,910 --> 02:47:53,920
so you know usually the way you ask that
 

9261
02:47:53,920 --> 02:47:56,150
so you know usually the way you ask that
is what is the meaning of life

9262
02:47:56,150 --> 02:47:56,160
is what is the meaning of life
 

9263
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:57,750
is what is the meaning of life
is there um

9264
02:47:57,750 --> 02:47:57,760
is there um
 

9265
02:47:57,760 --> 02:47:59,590
is there um
a universal objective functions that

9266
02:47:59,590 --> 02:47:59,600
a universal objective functions that
 

9267
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:03,670
a universal objective functions that
captures the why of life so yeah i mean

9268
02:48:03,670 --> 02:48:03,680
captures the why of life so yeah i mean
 

9269
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:05,190
captures the why of life so yeah i mean
i suspected that they will ask this

9270
02:48:05,190 --> 02:48:05,200
i suspected that they will ask this
 

9271
02:48:05,200 --> 02:48:06,790
i suspected that they will ask this
question but it's also a question that i

9272
02:48:06,790 --> 02:48:06,800
question but it's also a question that i
 

9273
02:48:06,800 --> 02:48:09,190
question but it's also a question that i
asked myself many many times

9274
02:48:09,190 --> 02:48:09,200
asked myself many many times
 

9275
02:48:09,200 --> 02:48:10,630
asked myself many many times
see i can tell you a framework that i

9276
02:48:10,630 --> 02:48:10,640
see i can tell you a framework that i
 

9277
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:12,870
see i can tell you a framework that i
have these days to think about these

9278
02:48:12,870 --> 02:48:12,880
have these days to think about these
 

9279
02:48:12,880 --> 02:48:15,510
have these days to think about these
questions so i think that fundamentally

9280
02:48:15,510 --> 02:48:15,520
questions so i think that fundamentally
 

9281
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:17,429
questions so i think that fundamentally
meaning of life has to do

9282
02:48:17,429 --> 02:48:17,439
meaning of life has to do
 

9283
02:48:17,439 --> 02:48:19,590
meaning of life has to do
with some of our reward functions that

9284
02:48:19,590 --> 02:48:19,600
with some of our reward functions that
 

9285
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:21,429
with some of our reward functions that
we have in brain and they might have to

9286
02:48:21,429 --> 02:48:21,439
we have in brain and they might have to
 

9287
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:22,550
we have in brain and they might have to
do with

9288
02:48:22,550 --> 02:48:22,560
do with
 

9289
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:25,269
do with
let's say for instance curiosity

9290
02:48:25,269 --> 02:48:25,279
let's say for instance curiosity
 

9291
02:48:25,279 --> 02:48:26,150
let's say for instance curiosity
or

9292
02:48:26,150 --> 02:48:26,160
or
 

9293
02:48:26,160 --> 02:48:27,590
or
human connection which might mean

9294
02:48:27,590 --> 02:48:27,600
human connection which might mean
 

9295
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:31,349
human connection which might mean
understanding others

9296
02:48:31,349 --> 02:48:31,359

 

9297
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:33,750

it's also possible for a person to

9298
02:48:33,750 --> 02:48:33,760
it's also possible for a person to
 

9299
02:48:33,760 --> 02:48:35,670
it's also possible for a person to
slightly modify their reward function

9300
02:48:35,670 --> 02:48:35,680
slightly modify their reward function
 

9301
02:48:35,680 --> 02:48:37,990
slightly modify their reward function
usually they mostly stay fixed but it's

9302
02:48:37,990 --> 02:48:38,000
usually they mostly stay fixed but it's
 

9303
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,309
usually they mostly stay fixed but it's
possible to modify reward function and

9304
02:48:40,309 --> 02:48:40,319
possible to modify reward function and
 

9305
02:48:40,319 --> 02:48:42,309
possible to modify reward function and
you can pretty much choose so in some

9306
02:48:42,309 --> 02:48:42,319
you can pretty much choose so in some
 

9307
02:48:42,319 --> 02:48:44,230
you can pretty much choose so in some
sense reward functions optimizing reward

9308
02:48:44,230 --> 02:48:44,240
sense reward functions optimizing reward
 

9309
02:48:44,240 --> 02:48:45,910
sense reward functions optimizing reward
functions they will give you life

9310
02:48:45,910 --> 02:48:45,920
functions they will give you life
 

9311
02:48:45,920 --> 02:48:47,670
functions they will give you life
satisfaction

9312
02:48:47,670 --> 02:48:47,680
satisfaction
 

9313
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:49,590
satisfaction
is there some randomness in the function

9314
02:48:49,590 --> 02:48:49,600
is there some randomness in the function
 

9315
02:48:49,600 --> 02:48:50,950
is there some randomness in the function
i think when you are born there is some

9316
02:48:50,950 --> 02:48:50,960
i think when you are born there is some
 

9317
02:48:50,960 --> 02:48:53,030
i think when you are born there is some
randomness like you can see that some

9318
02:48:53,030 --> 02:48:53,040
randomness like you can see that some
 

9319
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:55,190
randomness like you can see that some
people for instance they

9320
02:48:55,190 --> 02:48:55,200
people for instance they
 

9321
02:48:55,200 --> 02:48:57,990
people for instance they
they care more about building stuff some

9322
02:48:57,990 --> 02:48:58,000
they care more about building stuff some
 

9323
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,790
they care more about building stuff some
people care more about caring for others

9324
02:49:00,790 --> 02:49:00,800
people care more about caring for others
 

9325
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:01,990
people care more about caring for others
some people

9326
02:49:01,990 --> 02:49:02,000
some people
 

9327
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,150
some people
that there are all sorts of uh default

9328
02:49:04,150 --> 02:49:04,160
that there are all sorts of uh default
 

9329
02:49:04,160 --> 02:49:05,830
that there are all sorts of uh default
reward functions and then in some sense

9330
02:49:05,830 --> 02:49:05,840
reward functions and then in some sense
 

9331
02:49:05,840 --> 02:49:09,670
reward functions and then in some sense
you can ask yourself what's this like

9332
02:49:09,670 --> 02:49:09,680

 

9333
02:49:09,680 --> 02:49:12,070

what is the satisfying way for you to go

9334
02:49:12,070 --> 02:49:12,080
what is the satisfying way for you to go
 

9335
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:14,150
what is the satisfying way for you to go
after this reward function and you just

9336
02:49:14,150 --> 02:49:14,160
after this reward function and you just
 

9337
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:16,070
after this reward function and you just
go after this reward function and you

9338
02:49:16,070 --> 02:49:16,080
go after this reward function and you
 

9339
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:18,070
go after this reward function and you
know some people also ask are these

9340
02:49:18,070 --> 02:49:18,080
know some people also ask are these
 

9341
02:49:18,080 --> 02:49:19,830
know some people also ask are these
reward functions real

9342
02:49:19,830 --> 02:49:19,840
reward functions real
 

9343
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:21,910
reward functions real
i almost think about it

9344
02:49:21,910 --> 02:49:21,920
i almost think about it
 

9345
02:49:21,920 --> 02:49:23,590
i almost think about it
as

9346
02:49:23,590 --> 02:49:23,600
as
 

9347
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:24,710
as
let's say

9348
02:49:24,710 --> 02:49:24,720
let's say
 

9349
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:26,230
let's say
if you would have to discover

9350
02:49:26,230 --> 02:49:26,240
if you would have to discover
 

9351
02:49:26,240 --> 02:49:27,510
if you would have to discover
mathematics

9352
02:49:27,510 --> 02:49:27,520
mathematics
 

9353
02:49:27,520 --> 02:49:29,750
mathematics
in mathematics you are likely to run

9354
02:49:29,750 --> 02:49:29,760
in mathematics you are likely to run
 

9355
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:32,150
in mathematics you are likely to run
into various objects like a complex

9356
02:49:32,150 --> 02:49:32,160
into various objects like a complex
 

9357
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:33,190
into various objects like a complex
numbers

9358
02:49:33,190 --> 02:49:33,200
numbers
 

9359
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:35,670
numbers
or differentiation some other objects

9360
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:35,680
or differentiation some other objects
 

9361
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:37,510
or differentiation some other objects
and these are very natural objects that

9362
02:49:37,510 --> 02:49:37,520
and these are very natural objects that
 

9363
02:49:37,520 --> 02:49:40,070
and these are very natural objects that
arise and similarly the reward functions

9364
02:49:40,070 --> 02:49:40,080
arise and similarly the reward functions
 

9365
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:42,150
arise and similarly the reward functions
that we are having in our brain they are

9366
02:49:42,150 --> 02:49:42,160
that we are having in our brain they are
 

9367
02:49:42,160 --> 02:49:44,469
that we are having in our brain they are
somewhat very natural that you know

9368
02:49:44,469 --> 02:49:44,479
somewhat very natural that you know
 

9369
02:49:44,479 --> 02:49:47,269
somewhat very natural that you know
there is a reward function for

9370
02:49:47,269 --> 02:49:47,279
there is a reward function for
 

9371
02:49:47,279 --> 02:49:49,269
there is a reward function for
for understanding

9372
02:49:49,269 --> 02:49:49,279
for understanding
 

9373
02:49:49,279 --> 02:49:52,070
for understanding
like a comprehension yeah uh

9374
02:49:52,070 --> 02:49:52,080
like a comprehension yeah uh
 

9375
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:54,070
like a comprehension yeah uh
curiosity and so on so in some sense

9376
02:49:54,070 --> 02:49:54,080
curiosity and so on so in some sense
 

9377
02:49:54,080 --> 02:49:56,950
curiosity and so on so in some sense
they are in the same way natural as

9378
02:49:56,950 --> 02:49:56,960
they are in the same way natural as
 

9379
02:49:56,960 --> 02:49:59,110
they are in the same way natural as
their natural objects in mathematics

9380
02:49:59,110 --> 02:49:59,120
their natural objects in mathematics
 

9381
02:49:59,120 --> 02:50:00,950
their natural objects in mathematics
interesting so you know there's the uh

9382
02:50:00,950 --> 02:50:00,960
interesting so you know there's the uh
 

9383
02:50:00,960 --> 02:50:01,830
interesting so you know there's the uh
the old

9384
02:50:01,830 --> 02:50:01,840
the old
 

9385
02:50:01,840 --> 02:50:04,469
the old
sort of debate is mathematics invented

9386
02:50:04,469 --> 02:50:04,479
sort of debate is mathematics invented
 

9387
02:50:04,479 --> 02:50:06,550
sort of debate is mathematics invented
or discovered you're saying reward

9388
02:50:06,550 --> 02:50:06,560
or discovered you're saying reward
 

9389
02:50:06,560 --> 02:50:09,349
or discovered you're saying reward
functions are discovered so nature so

9390
02:50:09,349 --> 02:50:09,359
functions are discovered so nature so
 

9391
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:11,110
functions are discovered so nature so
nature's provided some you can still

9392
02:50:11,110 --> 02:50:11,120
nature's provided some you can still
 

9393
02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:12,950
nature's provided some you can still
let's say expanded throughout the life

9394
02:50:12,950 --> 02:50:12,960
let's say expanded throughout the life
 

9395
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:14,550
let's say expanded throughout the life
some of the reward functions they might

9396
02:50:14,550 --> 02:50:14,560
some of the reward functions they might
 

9397
02:50:14,560 --> 02:50:16,550
some of the reward functions they might
be futile like for instance there might

9398
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:16,560
be futile like for instance there might
 

9399
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:19,269
be futile like for instance there might
be a reward function maximize amount of

9400
02:50:19,269 --> 02:50:19,279
be a reward function maximize amount of
 

9401
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:20,309
be a reward function maximize amount of
wealth

9402
02:50:20,309 --> 02:50:20,319
wealth
 

9403
02:50:20,319 --> 02:50:23,510
wealth
yeah and this is more like a a learning

9404
02:50:23,510 --> 02:50:23,520
yeah and this is more like a a learning
 

9405
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:25,269
yeah and this is more like a a learning
reward function

9406
02:50:25,269 --> 02:50:25,279
reward function
 

9407
02:50:25,279 --> 02:50:27,110
reward function
and but we know also that some reward

9408
02:50:27,110 --> 02:50:27,120
and but we know also that some reward
 

9409
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:28,710
and but we know also that some reward
functions if you optimize them you won't

9410
02:50:28,710 --> 02:50:28,720
functions if you optimize them you won't
 

9411
02:50:28,720 --> 02:50:29,750
functions if you optimize them you won't
be

9412
02:50:29,750 --> 02:50:29,760
be
 

9413
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:32,230
be
quite satisfied

9414
02:50:32,230 --> 02:50:32,240
quite satisfied

9416
02:50:33,910 --> 02:50:33,920
well i don't know which part of your
 

9417
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:36,389
well i don't know which part of your
reward function resulted in you coming

9418
02:50:36,389 --> 02:50:36,399
reward function resulted in you coming
 

9419
02:50:36,399 --> 02:50:38,550
reward function resulted in you coming
today but i am deeply appreciative that

9420
