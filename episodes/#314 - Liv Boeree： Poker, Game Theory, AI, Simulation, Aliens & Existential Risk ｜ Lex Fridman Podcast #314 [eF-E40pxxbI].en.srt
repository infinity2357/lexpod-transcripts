00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,080
evolutionarily we you know if we see a

evolutionarily we you know if we see a
lion running at us we didn't have time

00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
lion running at us we didn't have time
 

5
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,829
lion running at us we didn't have time
to sort of calculate the lion's kinetic

6
00:00:05,829 --> 00:00:05,839
to sort of calculate the lion's kinetic
 

7
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,230
to sort of calculate the lion's kinetic
energy and you know is it optimal to go

8
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
energy and you know is it optimal to go

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,390
energy and you know is it optimal to go
this way or that way you just reacted

10
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
this way or that way you just reacted
 

11
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,270
this way or that way you just reacted
and

12
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:11,280
and
 

13
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,190
and
physically our bodies are well attuned

14
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:13,200
physically our bodies are well attuned
 

15
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,870
physically our bodies are well attuned
to actually make right decisions but

16
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
to actually make right decisions but
 

17
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,390
to actually make right decisions but
when you're playing a game like poker

18
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
when you're playing a game like poker
 

19
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,910
when you're playing a game like poker
this is not something that you ever you

20
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
this is not something that you ever you
 

21
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,990
this is not something that you ever you
know evolved to do and yet you're in

22
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
know evolved to do and yet you're in
 

23
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,550
know evolved to do and yet you're in
that same flight or fight response um

24
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
that same flight or fight response um
 

25
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,310
that same flight or fight response um
and so that's a really important skill

26
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
and so that's a really important skill
 

27
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,750
and so that's a really important skill
to be able to develop to basically learn

28
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
to be able to develop to basically learn

meditate in the moment and calm yourself
 

33
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,310
meditate in the moment and calm yourself
so that you can think clearly

what role do you think luck plays in

62
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
what role do you think luck plays in
 

63
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,590
what role do you think luck plays in
poker and in life you can pick whichever

64
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
poker and in life you can pick whichever
 

65
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,789
poker and in life you can pick whichever
one you want poker or life and or life

66
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
one you want poker or life and or life
 

67
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,630
one you want poker or life and or life
the longer you play

68
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
the longer you play
 

69
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,710
the longer you play
the less influence luck has you know

70
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
the less influence luck has you know
 

71
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,990
the less influence luck has you know
like with all things the bigger your

72
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,000
like with all things the bigger your
 

73
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,429
like with all things the bigger your
sample size

74
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
sample size
 

75
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,109
sample size
um the more the quality of your

76
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
um the more the quality of your
 

77
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,230
um the more the quality of your
decisions or your strategies matter

78
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
decisions or your strategies matter
 

79
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,910
decisions or your strategies matter
um so

80
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
um so
 

81
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,670
um so
to answer that question yeah in poco it

82
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
to answer that question yeah in poco it
 

83
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,510
to answer that question yeah in poco it
really depends if you and i sat and

84
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
really depends if you and i sat and
 

85
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,469
really depends if you and i sat and
played

86
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:24,479
played
 

87
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,670
played
ten hands right now i might only win 52

88
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
ten hands right now i might only win 52
 

89
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,749
ten hands right now i might only win 52
of the time 53 maybe

90
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
of the time 53 maybe
 

91
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,749
of the time 53 maybe
um but if we played 10 000 hands then

92
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
um but if we played 10 000 hands then
 

93
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,350
um but if we played 10 000 hands then
i'll probably win like

94
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:33,360
i'll probably win like
 

95
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,149
i'll probably win like
over 98 99 of the time so

96
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
over 98 99 of the time so
 

97
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,069
over 98 99 of the time so
it's a question of sample sizes

98
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
it's a question of sample sizes
 

99
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,990
it's a question of sample sizes
and what are you figuring out over time

100
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
and what are you figuring out over time
 

101
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,190
and what are you figuring out over time
the betting strategy that this

102
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
the betting strategy that this
 

103
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,270
the betting strategy that this
individual does or literally doesn't

104
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
individual does or literally doesn't
 

105
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,749
individual does or literally doesn't
matter against any individual over time

106
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
matter against any individual over time
 

107
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,190
matter against any individual over time
against any individual over time the

108
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
against any individual over time the
 

109
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,630
against any individual over time the
better player because they're making

110
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
better player because they're making
 

111
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,149
better player because they're making
better decisions so what does that mean

112
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
better decisions so what does that mean
 

113
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,230
better decisions so what does that mean
to make a better decision well

114
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
to make a better decision well
 

115
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,230
to make a better decision well
ah to get into the real nitty-gritty

116
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
ah to get into the real nitty-gritty
 

117
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,389
ah to get into the real nitty-gritty
already um basically

118
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
already um basically
 

119
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,069
already um basically
poker is a game of math

120
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
poker is a game of math
 

121
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,149
poker is a game of math
um there are these strategies familiar

122
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
um there are these strategies familiar
 

123
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,069
um there are these strategies familiar
with like nash equilibria that's yes

124
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
with like nash equilibria that's yes
 

125
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,870
with like nash equilibria that's yes
right so there are these game theory

126
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
right so there are these game theory
 

127
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,229
right so there are these game theory
optimal strategies that you can adopt um

128
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
optimal strategies that you can adopt um
 

129
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,710
optimal strategies that you can adopt um
and the closer you play to them the less

130
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
and the closer you play to them the less
 

131
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,390
and the closer you play to them the less
exploitable you are

132
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
exploitable you are
 

133
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,670
exploitable you are
so

134
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
so
 

135
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,670
so
because i've studied the game a bunch um

136
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
because i've studied the game a bunch um
 

137
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,110
because i've studied the game a bunch um
although admittedly not for a few years

138
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
although admittedly not for a few years
 

139
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,550
although admittedly not for a few years
but back in you know when i was playing

140
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
but back in you know when i was playing
 

141
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,030
but back in you know when i was playing
all the time um i would study these game

142
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
all the time um i would study these game
 

143
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,949
all the time um i would study these game
theory optimal solutions

144
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
theory optimal solutions
 

145
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,710
theory optimal solutions
and try and then adopt those strategies

146
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
and try and then adopt those strategies
 

147
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,229
and try and then adopt those strategies
when i go and play so i'd play against

148
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
when i go and play so i'd play against
 

149
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,670
when i go and play so i'd play against
you and i would do that

150
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
you and i would do that
 

151
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,270
you and i would do that
and

152
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
and
 

153
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,030
and
because

154
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
because
 

155
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,229
because
the objective when you're playing game

156
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:32,239
the objective when you're playing game
 

157
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,710
the objective when you're playing game
theory optimal it's actually it's a loss

158
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
theory optimal it's actually it's a loss
 

159
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,390
theory optimal it's actually it's a loss
minimization thing that you're trying to

160
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
minimization thing that you're trying to
 

161
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,229
minimization thing that you're trying to
do um your best bet is to try and play

162
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
do um your best bet is to try and play
 

163
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,949
do um your best bet is to try and play
uh the sort of similar style you also

164
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
uh the sort of similar style you also
 

165
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,229
uh the sort of similar style you also
need to try and adopt this loss

166
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239

any kind of situation so game theory is
 

201
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,190

um i mean it's stately a branch of
 

209
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,509
um i mean it's stately a branch of
economics um but it also applies to like

00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
economics um but it also applies to like
 

211
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,550

213
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,830

you know usually when you see it it's

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
you know usually when you see it it's
 

215
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,670
you know usually when you see it it's
these like little payoff matrices and so

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
these like little payoff matrices and so
 

217
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,869
these like little payoff matrices and so
on that's how it's depicted but it's

on that's how it's depicted but it's
 

219
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,309
on that's how it's depicted but it's
essentially just like study of

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,710
and as it happens certain games in fact
many many games um have these things

00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
many many games um have these things
 

231
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,789
many many games um have these things
called nash equilibria and what that

232
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
called nash equilibria and what that
 

233
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,670
called nash equilibria and what that
means is when you're in a nash

234
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
means is when you're in a nash
 

235
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,270
means is when you're in a nash
equilibrium basically uh it is not

236
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280

237
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,429

00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
there is no strategy

00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,589
there is no strategy
that you can take

00:03:59,589 --> 00:03:59,599
that you can take
 

241
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,270
that you can take
that would be more beneficial than the

242
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
that would be more beneficial than the
 

243
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,949
that would be more beneficial than the
one you're currently taking assuming

244
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
one you're currently taking assuming
 

245
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,470
one you're currently taking assuming
your opponent is also doing the same

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
your opponent is also doing the same
 

247
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,550
your opponent is also doing the same
thing um so it'd be a bad idea you know

248
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
thing um so it'd be a bad idea you know
 

249
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,949
thing um so it'd be a bad idea you know
if we're both playing a in you know a

00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
great example of this like if we
 

263
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,150
great example of this like if we
to were to start playing rock paper

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
let's see

exactly you want to because you don't

you don't want to give anything about a

you don't want to give anything about a
 

293
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,710
you don't want to give anything about a
way about yourself so ideally you'd have

294
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:48,720
way about yourself so ideally you'd have
 

295
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,870
way about yourself so ideally you'd have
like a little dice or somewhat you know

296
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
like a little dice or somewhat you know
 

297
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,870
like a little dice or somewhat you know
perfect randomizer that makes you

298
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
perfect randomizer that makes you
 

299
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,710
perfect randomizer that makes you
randomize 33 of the time each of the

300
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
randomize 33 of the time each of the
 

301
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,550
randomize 33 of the time each of the
three different things and in response

302
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
three different things and in response
 

303
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,510
three different things and in response
to that

304
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
to that
 

305
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,950
to that
um well actually i can kind of do

306
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
um well actually i can kind of do
 

307
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,230
um well actually i can kind of do
anything but i would probably just

308
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
anything but i would probably just
 

309
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,749
anything but i would probably just
randomize back too but actually it

310
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
randomize back too but actually it
 

311
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,870
randomize back too but actually it
wouldn't matter because you're i know

312
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
wouldn't matter because you're i know
 

313
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,270
wouldn't matter because you're i know
that you're playing randomly um so that

314
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,280
that you're playing randomly um so that
 

315
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,430
that you're playing randomly um so that
would be us in a nash equilibrium um

316
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
would be us in a nash equilibrium um
 

317
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,550
would be us in a nash equilibrium um
where we're both playing this like

318
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
where we're both playing this like
 

319
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,469
where we're both playing this like
unexploitable strategy

320
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
unexploitable strategy
 

321
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,870

however if after a while you then notice

322
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
however if after a while you then notice
 

323
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,350
however if after a while you then notice
that i'm playing rock a little bit more

324
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
that i'm playing rock a little bit more
 

325
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,029
that i'm playing rock a little bit more
often than i should yeah you're the kind

326
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
often than i should yeah you're the kind
 

327
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,230
often than i should yeah you're the kind
of person that would do that wouldn't

328
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
of person that would do that wouldn't
 

329
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,150
of person that would do that wouldn't
you sure yes yes yes i'm more of a

330
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
you sure yes yes yes i'm more of a
 

331
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,550
you sure yes yes yes i'm more of a
scissors girl but anyway you are uh no

332
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
scissors girl but anyway you are uh no
 

333
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,350
scissors girl but anyway you are uh no
i'm a as i said randomizer uh

334
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
i'm a as i said randomizer uh
 

335
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,950
i'm a as i said randomizer uh
so you notice i'm throwing rock too much

336
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
so you notice i'm throwing rock too much
 

337
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,469
so you notice i'm throwing rock too much
or something like that right now you'd

338
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
or something like that right now you'd
 

339
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,990
or something like that right now you'd
be making a mistake by continuing

340
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
be making a mistake by continuing
 

341
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,110
be making a mistake by continuing
playing this game theory optimal

342
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
playing this game theory optimal
 

343
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,950
playing this game theory optimal
strategy because well the previous one

344
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
strategy because well the previous one
 

345
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,909
strategy because well the previous one
because

346
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
because
 

347
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,909
because
you are now

348
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
you are now
 

349
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,830
you are now
there's an i'm making a mistake and

350
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:37,840
there's an i'm making a mistake and
 

351
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,749
there's an i'm making a mistake and
you're not deviating and exploiting my

352
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
you're not deviating and exploiting my
 

353
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,830
you're not deviating and exploiting my
mistake um so you'd want to start

354
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
mistake um so you'd want to start
 

355
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,830
mistake um so you'd want to start
throwing paper a bit more often um in

356
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
throwing paper a bit more often um in
 

357
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,350
throwing paper a bit more often um in
whatever you figure is the right sort of

358
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
whatever you figure is the right sort of
 

359
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,950
whatever you figure is the right sort of
percentage of the time that i'm throwing

360
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
percentage of the time that i'm throwing
 

361
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,990
percentage of the time that i'm throwing
rock too often so that's basically an

362
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
rock too often so that's basically an
 

363
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,990
rock too often so that's basically an
example of where you know what what game

364
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
example of where you know what what game
 

365
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,510
example of where you know what what game
three optimal strategy is in terms of

366
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
three optimal strategy is in terms of
 

367
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,310
three optimal strategy is in terms of
loss minimization but it's not always uh

368
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:56,320
loss minimization but it's not always uh
 

369
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,150
loss minimization but it's not always uh
the maximally profitable thing if your

370
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
the maximally profitable thing if your
 

371
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,990
the maximally profitable thing if your
opponent is doing stupid stupid stuff

372
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
opponent is doing stupid stupid stuff
 

373
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,110
opponent is doing stupid stupid stuff
which you know in that example so that's

374
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
which you know in that example so that's
 

375
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,469
which you know in that example so that's
kind of then how it works in poker but

376
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
kind of then how it works in poker but
 

377
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,550
kind of then how it works in poker but
it's a lot more complex

378
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
it's a lot more complex
 

379
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,230
it's a lot more complex
um and the way poker players typically

380
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
um and the way poker players typically
 

381
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,990
um and the way poker players typically
you know nowadays they study the games

382
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
you know nowadays they study the games
 

383
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,270
you know nowadays they study the games
change so much and i think we should

384
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
change so much and i think we should
 

385
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,430
change so much and i think we should
talk about how it sort of evolved um but

386
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
talk about how it sort of evolved um but
 

387
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,990
talk about how it sort of evolved um but
nowadays like the top pros basically

388
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
nowadays like the top pros basically
 

389
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,270
nowadays like the top pros basically
spend all their time

390
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
spend all their time
 

391
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,790
spend all their time
in between sessions

392
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
in between sessions

00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
running these simulators
 

395
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,469
running these simulators
uh using like software where they do

396
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
uh using like software where they do
 

397
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,150
uh using like software where they do
basically monte carlo simulations sort

398
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,160
basically monte carlo simulations sort
 

399
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,110
basically monte carlo simulations sort
of doing

400
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
of doing
 

401
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,749
of doing
billions of fictitious self-play

402
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
billions of fictitious self-play
 

403
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,950

hands
 

405
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,710
hands
you input a

406
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
you input a
 

407
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,710
you input a
fictitious hand scenario like oh what do

408
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
fictitious hand scenario like oh what do
 

409
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,950
fictitious hand scenario like oh what do
i do with jack nine suited on a

410
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
i do with jack nine suited on a
 

411
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,830
i do with jack nine suited on a
king ten four two two spade board um uh

412
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
king ten four two two spade board um uh
 

413
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,749
king ten four two two spade board um uh
and and you know against this bet size

414
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
and and you know against this bet size
 

415
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,390
and and you know against this bet size
so you'd input that press play it'll run

416
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
so you'd input that press play it'll run
 

417
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,710
so you'd input that press play it'll run
it's it's uh you know it's billions of

418
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
it's it's uh you know it's billions of
 

419
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,150
it's it's uh you know it's billions of
fake hands and then it'll converge upon

420
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
fake hands and then it'll converge upon
 

421
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,830
fake hands and then it'll converge upon
what the game theory optimal strategies

422
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
what the game theory optimal strategies
 

423
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,270
what the game theory optimal strategies
are um

424
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
are um
 

425
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,629
are um
and then you want to try and memorize

426
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
and then you want to try and memorize
 

427
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,990
and then you want to try and memorize
what these are basically they're like

428
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
what these are basically they're like
 

429
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,830
what these are basically they're like
ratios of how often you know what types

430
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
ratios of how often you know what types
 

431
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,990
ratios of how often you know what types
of hands uh you want to bluff and what

432
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
of hands uh you want to bluff and what
 

433
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,670
of hands uh you want to bluff and what
percentage of the time so then there's

434
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
percentage of the time so then there's
 

435
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,029
percentage of the time so then there's
this additional layer of inbuilt

436
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
this additional layer of inbuilt
 

437
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,870
this additional layer of inbuilt
randomization built in yeah those those

438
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
randomization built in yeah those those
 

439
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,550
randomization built in yeah those those
kind of simulations incorporate all the

440
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
kind of simulations incorporate all the
 

441
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,990
kind of simulations incorporate all the
betting strategies and everything else

442
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,000
betting strategies and everything else
 

443
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,350
betting strategies and everything else
like that so they

444
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
like that so they
 

445
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,110
like that so they
so as opposed to some kind of very crude

446
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
so as opposed to some kind of very crude
 

447
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,710
so as opposed to some kind of very crude
mathematical model of what's the

448
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
mathematical model of what's the
 

449
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,550
mathematical model of what's the
probability you went just based on the

450
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
probability you went just based on the
 

451
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,589
probability you went just based on the
quality of the card uh it's including

452
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
quality of the card uh it's including
 

453
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,749
quality of the card uh it's including
everything else too the the game theory

454
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:19,759
everything else too the the game theory
 

455
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,950
everything else too the the game theory
of it yes

456
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
of it yes
 

457
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,550
of it yes
yeah essentially and what's interesting

458
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
yeah essentially and what's interesting
 

459
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,710
yeah essentially and what's interesting
is that nowadays if you want to be a top

460
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
is that nowadays if you want to be a top
 

461
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,909
is that nowadays if you want to be a top
pro and you go and play in these really

462
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
pro and you go and play in these really
 

463
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,430
pro and you go and play in these really
like the super high stakes tournaments

464
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,440
like the super high stakes tournaments
 

465
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,909
like the super high stakes tournaments
or tough cash games if you don't know

466
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:29,919
or tough cash games if you don't know
 

467
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,270
or tough cash games if you don't know
this stuff you're going to get eaten

468
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
this stuff you're going to get eaten
 

469
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,670
this stuff you're going to get eaten
alive in the long run yeah but of course

470
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
alive in the long run yeah but of course
 

471
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,029
alive in the long run yeah but of course
you could get lucky over the short run

472
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
you could get lucky over the short run
 

473
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,309
you could get lucky over the short run
and that's where this like luck factor

474
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:36,319
and that's where this like luck factor
 

475
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,589
and that's where this like luck factor
comes in because

476
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
comes in because
 

477
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,230
comes in because
luck is both a blessing and a curse

478
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240
luck is both a blessing and a curse
 

479
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,749
luck is both a blessing and a curse
if luck didn't you know if there wasn't

480
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
if luck didn't you know if there wasn't
 

481
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,270
if luck didn't you know if there wasn't
this random element and there wasn't the

482
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
this random element and there wasn't the
 

483
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,469
this random element and there wasn't the
ability for

484
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
ability for
 

485
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,550
ability for
worse players to win sometimes then

486
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
worse players to win sometimes then
 

487
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,070
worse players to win sometimes then
poker would fall apart

488
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
poker would fall apart
 

489
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,189
poker would fall apart
you know the same reason people don't

490
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199

somehow that being an optimal strategy

538
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
somehow that being an optimal strategy
 

539
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,990

a

540
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
a
 

541
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,709
a
game theoretically why

542
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
game theoretically why
 

543
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,709
game theoretically why
why what like i don't think i remember

544
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
why what like i don't think i remember
 

545
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,990
why what like i don't think i remember
don't imagine that there i mean there's

546
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,000
don't imagine that there i mean there's
 

547
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,630
don't imagine that there i mean there's
probably an optimal strategy is it

548
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:42,640
probably an optimal strategy is it
 

549
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,829
probably an optimal strategy is it
does that mean that there's an actual

550
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
does that mean that there's an actual
 

551
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,829
does that mean that there's an actual
nash equilibrium of like picking up

552
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
nash equilibrium of like picking up
 

553

problem it's optimal stopping yes so

556
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
problem it's optimal stopping yes so
 

557
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,070

where you
 

561
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,949
where you
uh do you remember yeah i think it's

562
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
uh do you remember yeah i think it's
 

563
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,310
uh do you remember yeah i think it's
like something like you you you know

00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
like something like you you you know
 

565
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,750
like something like you you you know
you've got like a set of 100 people

you've got like a set of 100 people
you're going to look through and after

568
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
you're going to look through and after
 

569
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,110
you're going to look through and after
how many

570
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
how many
 

571
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,310
how many
do you

572
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
do you
 

573
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,710
do you
now after that after going on this many

574
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
now after that after going on this many
 

575
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,550

dates out of a hundred at what point do

576
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
dates out of a hundred at what point do
 

577
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,389

you then go okay the next best person i

578
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
you then go okay the next best person i
 

579
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,829
you then go okay the next best person i
see is that the right one and i think

580
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
see is that the right one and i think
 

581
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,630
see is that the right one and i think
it's like something like 37 percent

582
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
it's like something like 37 percent
 

583
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,430
it's like something like 37 percent
uh

584
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
uh
 

585
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,750
uh
it's one over e whatever that is right

586
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
it's one over e whatever that is right
 

587
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,269
it's one over e whatever that is right
which i think is

588
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
which i think is
 

589
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,030
which i think is
yeah

590
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,040
yeah
 

591
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,670
yeah
we're gonna fact-check that

592
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
we're gonna fact-check that
 

593
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,790
we're gonna fact-check that
um

594
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
um
 

595
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,269
um
yeah so but it's funny under those

596
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
yeah so but it's funny under those
 

597
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,750
yeah so but it's funny under those
strict constraints then yes after that

598
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
strict constraints then yes after that
 

599
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,590
strict constraints then yes after that

there's kind of this advanced versions
of courses in high school and you take a

858
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
of courses in high school and you take a
 

859
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,350
of courses in high school and you take a
test that is like a broad test for that

860
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
test that is like a broad test for that
 

861
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,350

obviously just shakespeare i think a lot

864
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
obviously just shakespeare i think a lot
 

865
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,670
obviously just shakespeare i think a lot
of it was also writing

866
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
of it was also writing
 

867
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,150
of it was also writing
uh written you have like ap physics ap

868
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
uh written you have like ap physics ap
 

869
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,670
uh written you have like ap physics ap
computer science ap biology ep chemistry

870
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
computer science ap biology ep chemistry
 

871
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,990
computer science ap biology ep chemistry
and then ap english or ap literature i

872
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
and then ap english or ap literature i
 

873
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,350
and then ap english or ap literature i
forget what it was

874
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
forget what it was
 

875

that but i and you and your gamer the
 

879
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,590
that but i and you and your gamer the
point is you gamified it

880
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
point is you gamified it
 

881
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,470
point is you gamified it
well entirety i was into getting a's

882

i saw it as a game
 

885
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,949
i saw it as a game
i don't think any

886
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
i don't think any
 

887
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,230
i don't think any
i don't think all the learning i've done

888
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
i don't think all the learning i've done
 

889
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,110
i don't think all the learning i've done
has been outside of the outside of

890
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
has been outside of the outside of
 

891
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,949
has been outside of the outside of
school the deepest learning i've done

892
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
school the deepest learning i've done
 

893
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,550
school the deepest learning i've done
has been outside of school with a few

has been outside of school with a few
 

895
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,310
has been outside of school with a few
exceptions especially in grad school

896
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
exceptions especially in grad school
 

897
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,389
exceptions especially in grad school
like deep computer science courses but

898
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
like deep computer science courses but
 

899
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,150
like deep computer science courses but
that was still outside of school because

900
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
that was still outside of school because
 

901

when you read the chapter and you do
 

909
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,430
when you read the chapter and you do
many of the problems at the end of the

910
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
many of the problems at the end of the
 

911
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,509
many of the problems at the end of the
chapter which is usually not what's

you get the right one it's just like a
manual for

974
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
manual for
 

975
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,350
manual for
but what's interesting though

976
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
but what's interesting though
 

977
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,790
but what's interesting though
is

978
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
is
 

979
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,350
is
this is the tyranny of of having exams

980
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
this is the tyranny of of having exams
 

981
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,829
this is the tyranny of of having exams
and metrics it's the journey of exams

982
00:15:57,829 --> 00:15:57,839
and metrics it's the journey of exams
 

983
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,509
and metrics it's the journey of exams
and metrics yes i loved them because i

984
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
and metrics yes i loved them because i
 

985
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,430
and metrics yes i loved them because i
loved i'm very competitive and i liked

986
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
loved i'm very competitive and i liked
 

987
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,430
loved i'm very competitive and i liked
yes i liked finding ways to gamify

988
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
yes i liked finding ways to gamify
 

989
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,670
yes i liked finding ways to gamify
things and then like sort of dust off my

990
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
things and then like sort of dust off my
 

991
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,949
things and then like sort of dust off my
shoulders afterwards when i get get a

992
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
shoulders afterwards when i get get a
 

993
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,150
shoulders afterwards when i get get a
good grade or be annoyed at myself when

994
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
good grade or be annoyed at myself when
 

995
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,550
good grade or be annoyed at myself when
i didn't um but yeah you're absolutely

996
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
i didn't um but yeah you're absolutely
 

997
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,470
i didn't um but yeah you're absolutely
right and that the actual

998
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,480
right and that the actual
 

999
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,069
right and that the actual
you know how much of that physics

1000
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
you know how much of that physics
 

1001
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,790
you know how much of that physics
knowledge i've retained like i've

1002
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
knowledge i've retained like i've
 

1003
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,749
knowledge i've retained like i've
i learned how to cram and study and

1004
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
i learned how to cram and study and
 

1005
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,069
i learned how to cram and study and
please an examiner but did that give me

1006
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
please an examiner but did that give me
 

1007
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,629
please an examiner but did that give me
the deep lasting knowledge that i needed

1008
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
the deep lasting knowledge that i needed
 

1009
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,389
the deep lasting knowledge that i needed
i mean yes yes and no

1010
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
i mean yes yes and no
 

1011
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,550
i mean yes yes and no
um but really like nothing makes you

1012
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
um but really like nothing makes you
 

1013
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,509
um but really like nothing makes you
learn

1014
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519
learn
 

1015
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,590
learn
a topic better than when you actually

1016
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:31,600
a topic better than when you actually
 

1017
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,509
a topic better than when you actually
then have to teach it yourself

1018
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:33,519
then have to teach it yourself
 

1019
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,509
then have to teach it yourself
um you know like i'm trying to wrap my

1020
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:35,519
um you know like i'm trying to wrap my
 

1021
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,110
um you know like i'm trying to wrap my
teeth around this like game theory molok

1022
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
teeth around this like game theory molok
 

1023
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,949
teeth around this like game theory molok
stuff right now and

1024
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
stuff right now and
 

1025
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,509
stuff right now and
there's no exam at the end of it

1026
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
there's no exam at the end of it
 

1027
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,430
there's no exam at the end of it
uh that i can gamify there's no way to

1028
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
uh that i can gamify there's no way to
 

1029
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,110
uh that i can gamify there's no way to
gamify and sort of like shortcut my way

1030
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
gamify and sort of like shortcut my way
 

1031
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,550
gamify and sort of like shortcut my way
through it i have to understand it so

1032
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
through it i have to understand it so
 

1033
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,790
through it i have to understand it so
deeply from like deep foundational

1034
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
deeply from like deep foundational
 

1035
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,790
deeply from like deep foundational
levels to them to build upon it and then

1036
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
levels to them to build upon it and then
 

1037
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,310
levels to them to build upon it and then
try and explain it to other people and

1038
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
try and explain it to other people and
 

1039
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,430
try and explain it to other people and
like you know you're about to go and do

1040
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
like you know you're about to go and do
 

1041
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,430
like you know you're about to go and do
some lectures right you you

1042
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:55,440
some lectures right you you
 

1043
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,629
some lectures right you you
you can't you can't sort of just like

1044
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
you can't you can't sort of just like
 

1045
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,069
you can't you can't sort of just like
you probably presumably can't rely on

1046
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:00,079
you probably presumably can't rely on
 

1047
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,509
you probably presumably can't rely on
the knowledge that you got through when

1048
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
the knowledge that you got through when
 

1049
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,350
the knowledge that you got through when
you were studying for an exam

1050
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
you were studying for an exam
 

1051
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,829
you were studying for an exam
to reteach that yeah and especially high

1052
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
to reteach that yeah and especially high
 

1053
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,429
to reteach that yeah and especially high
level lectures especially the kind of

1054

stuff you do on youtube
 

1057
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,710
stuff you do on youtube
you're not just regurgitating material

1058
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
you're not just regurgitating material
 

1059
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,990
you're not just regurgitating material
you have to

1060
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
you have to
 

1061
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,270
you have to
think through

1062
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
think through
 

1063
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,710
think through
what is the core idea here and

1064
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
what is the core idea here and
 

1065
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,630
what is the core idea here and
when you do the lectures live especially

1066
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
when you do the lectures live especially
 

1067

that is a luxury you get if you're

1074
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
that is a luxury you get if you're
 

1075
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,950
that is a luxury you get if you're
recording a video for youtube or

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
recording a video for youtube or
 

1077

it definitely is a luxury you shouldn't
 

1083

i've gotten to interact with a few
 

1087
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,190
i've gotten to interact with a few
youtubers that lean on that too much

1092
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:43,520
you've gamified this system because
 

1093
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,230
you've gamified this system because
you're not really thinking deeply about

him on this podcast and he's somebody
 

1293
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,549
him on this podcast and he's somebody
that i was i found fascinating in terms

1294
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
that i was i found fascinating in terms
 

1295
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,549
that i was i found fascinating in terms
of the way he thinks about poker

1296
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,559
of the way he thinks about poker
 

1297
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,470
of the way he thinks about poker
verbalizes the way he thinks about poker

1298
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
verbalizes the way he thinks about poker
 

1299
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,149
verbalizes the way he thinks about poker
the way he plays poker

1300
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
the way he plays poker
 

1301
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:20,950
the way he plays poker
so

1302
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:20,960
so
 

1303
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,029
so
and he's still pretty damn good he's

1304
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
and he's still pretty damn good he's
 

1305
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,110
and he's still pretty damn good he's
been good for a long time so you

1306
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
been good for a long time so you
 

1307
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,070
been good for a long time so you
mentioned

1308
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,080
mentioned
 

1309
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,590
mentioned
that people are running these kind of

1310
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,600
that people are running these kind of
 

1311
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,669
that people are running these kind of
simulations and the game of poker has

1312
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:29,679
simulations and the game of poker has
 

1313
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,390
simulations and the game of poker has
changed

1314
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
changed
 

1315
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,029
changed
do you think he's adapting in this way

1316
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,039
do you think he's adapting in this way
 

1317
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,590
do you think he's adapting in this way
do you like the top pros do they have to

1318
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
do you like the top pros do they have to
 

1319
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,830
do you like the top pros do they have to
adopt this way or is there is there

1320
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:37,840
adopt this way or is there is there
 

1321
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,510
adopt this way or is there is there
still like

1322
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
still like
 

1323
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,830
still like
over years

1324
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:41,840
over years
 

1325
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,990
over years
you basically develop this gut feeling

1326
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,000
you basically develop this gut feeling
 

1327
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,190
you basically develop this gut feeling
about

1328
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:45,200
about
 

1329
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,470
about
like you you get to be like good the way

1330
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:48,480
like you you get to be like good the way
 

1331
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,870
like you you get to be like good the way
like alpha zero is good you look at the

1332
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
like alpha zero is good you look at the
 

1333
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,909
like alpha zero is good you look at the
board

1334
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
board
 

1335
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:52,710
board
and

1336
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:52,720
and
 

1337
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,870
and
somehow from the fog comes out the right

1338
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:54,880
somehow from the fog comes out the right
 

1339
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,190
somehow from the fog comes out the right
answer like this is likely what they

1340
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
answer like this is likely what they
 

1341
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,310
answer like this is likely what they
have this is likely the best way to move

1342
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320
have this is likely the best way to move
 

1343
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,390
have this is likely the best way to move
and you don't really you can't really

1344
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
and you don't really you can't really
 

1345
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,350
and you don't really you can't really
put a finger on exactly why

1346
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
put a finger on exactly why
 

1347
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,070
put a finger on exactly why
but it just comes from your gut feeling

1348
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
but it just comes from your gut feeling
 

1349
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,110
but it just comes from your gut feeling
or no

1350
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
or no
 

1351
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,549
or no
yes and no

1352
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
yes and no
 

1353
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,789
yes and no
so gut feelings are definitely very

1354
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
so gut feelings are definitely very
 

1355
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,430
so gut feelings are definitely very
important um you know that we've got our

1356
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
important um you know that we've got our
 

1357
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,710
important um you know that we've got our
two mo

1358
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
two mo
 

1359
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,149
two mo
you can distill it down to two modes of

1360
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:18,159
you can distill it down to two modes of
 

1361
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,270
you can distill it down to two modes of
decision making right you've got your

1362
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,280
decision making right you've got your
 

1363
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,430
decision making right you've got your
sort of logical linear voice in your

1364
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
sort of logical linear voice in your
 

1365
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,149
sort of logical linear voice in your
head system two as it's often called and

1366
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
head system two as it's often called and
 

1367
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,750
head system two as it's often called and
your system on your

1368
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:25,760
your system on your
 

1369
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,510
your system on your
your gut intuition

1370
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
your gut intuition
 

1371
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,870
your gut intuition
um

1372
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:28,880
um
 

1373
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,310
um
and

1374
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
and
 

1375
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,230
and
historically in poker

1376
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:32,240
historically in poker
 

1377
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,310
historically in poker
the very best players were playing

1378
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
the very best players were playing
 

1379
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,230
the very best players were playing
almost entirely by their gut

1380
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
almost entirely by their gut
 

1381
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,390
almost entirely by their gut
um you know often they'd do some kind of

1382
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
um you know often they'd do some kind of
 

1383
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,750
um you know often they'd do some kind of
inspired play and you'd ask them why

1384
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:39,760
inspired play and you'd ask them why
 

1385
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,190
inspired play and you'd ask them why
they do it and they wouldn't really be

1386
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
they do it and they wouldn't really be
 

1387
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,870
they do it and they wouldn't really be
able to explain it um and that's

1388
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
able to explain it um and that's
 

1389
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,630
able to explain it um and that's
not so much because their process was

1390
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640
not so much because their process was
 

1391
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,230
not so much because their process was
unintelligible but it was more just

1392
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,240
unintelligible but it was more just
 

1393
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,669
unintelligible but it was more just
because no one unders no one had the

1394
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:49,679
because no one unders no one had the
 

1395
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,190
because no one unders no one had the
language with which to describe what

1396
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
language with which to describe what
 

1397
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,630
language with which to describe what
optimal strategies were because no one

1398
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
optimal strategies were because no one
 

1399
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,230
optimal strategies were because no one
really understood how poker worked this

1400
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
really understood how poker worked this
 

1401
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,630
really understood how poker worked this
was before you know we had analysis

1402
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
was before you know we had analysis
 

1403
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,710
was before you know we had analysis
software you know no one was

1404
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
software you know no one was
 

1405
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,390
software you know no one was
writing you know if i guess some people

1406
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:00,400
writing you know if i guess some people
 

1407
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,750
writing you know if i guess some people
would write down their hands in a little

1408
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:01,760
would write down their hands in a little
 

1409
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,270
would write down their hands in a little
notebook but there was no way to

1410
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
notebook but there was no way to
 

1411
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,750
notebook but there was no way to
assimilate all this data and analyze it

1412
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:05,760
assimilate all this data and analyze it
 

1413
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,510
assimilate all this data and analyze it
but then you know with when computers

1414
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
but then you know with when computers
 

1415
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,270
but then you know with when computers
became cheaper and software started

1416
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,280
became cheaper and software started
 

1417
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,270
became cheaper and software started
emerging and then obviously online poker

1418
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280
emerging and then obviously online poker
 

1419
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,710
emerging and then obviously online poker
where it would like automatically save

1420
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:12,720
where it would like automatically save
 

1421
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,549
where it would like automatically save
your hand histories um now all of a

1422
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
your hand histories um now all of a
 

1423
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,549
your hand histories um now all of a
sudden you kind of had this this body of

1424
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:16,559
sudden you kind of had this this body of
 

1425
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,430
sudden you kind of had this this body of
data that you could run analysis on

1426
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:19,440
data that you could run analysis on
 

1427
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,750
data that you could run analysis on
and so that's when people started to see

1428
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:21,760
and so that's when people started to see
 

1429
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,990
and so that's when people started to see
you know these mathematical solutions

1430
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
you know these mathematical solutions
 

1431
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,630
you know these mathematical solutions
and

1432
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:24,640
and
 

1433
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,630
and
um

1434
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
um
 

1435
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,630
um
and so what that meant

1436
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:28,640
and so what that meant
 

1437
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,710
and so what that meant
is the

1438
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
is the
 

1439
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,190
is the
the role of intuition essentially became

1440
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,200
the role of intuition essentially became
 

1441
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,470
the role of intuition essentially became
smaller

1442
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,480
smaller
 

1443
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,430
smaller
um

1444
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
um
 

1445
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,750
um
and it it meant more into as as we

1446
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:37,760
and it it meant more into as as we
 

1447
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,029
and it it meant more into as as we
talked before about you know this game

1448
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
talked before about you know this game
 

1449
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,590
talked before about you know this game
theory optimal style but as

1450
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:41,600
theory optimal style but as
 

1451
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,270
theory optimal style but as
also as i said like game theory optimal

1452
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,280
also as i said like game theory optimal
 

1453
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,950
also as i said like game theory optimal
is about um

1454
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:44,960
is about um
 

1455
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,470
is about um
loss minimization and being

1456
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,480
loss minimization and being
 

1457
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,470
loss minimization and being
unexploitable but if you're playing

1458
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:48,480
unexploitable but if you're playing
 

1459
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,909
unexploitable but if you're playing
against people who aren't because no one

1460
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:49,919
against people who aren't because no one
 

1461
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,510
against people who aren't because no one
person no human being can play perfectly

1462
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,520
person no human being can play perfectly
 

1463
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,950
person no human being can play perfectly
game through optimal in poker not even

1464
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
game through optimal in poker not even
 

1465
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,950
game through optimal in poker not even
the best ais they're still like they're

1466
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:54,960
the best ais they're still like they're
 

1467
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,870
the best ais they're still like they're
not you know they're 99.99 of the way

1468
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
not you know they're 99.99 of the way
 

1469
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,390
not you know they're 99.99 of the way
there or whatever but this it's kind of

1470
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,400
there or whatever but this it's kind of
 

1471
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,990
there or whatever but this it's kind of
like the speed of light you can't reach

1472
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
like the speed of light you can't reach
 

1473
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,789
like the speed of light you can't reach
it perfectly so there's still a role for

1474
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:02,799
it perfectly so there's still a role for
 

1475
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,110
it perfectly so there's still a role for
intuition yes so

1476
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
intuition yes so
 

1477
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,549
intuition yes so
when yeah when

1478
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
when yeah when
 

1479
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,310
when yeah when
you're playing this unexploitable style

1480
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
you're playing this unexploitable style
 

1481
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,710
you're playing this unexploitable style
but when your opponents start doing uh

1482
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,720
but when your opponents start doing uh
 

1483
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,710
but when your opponents start doing uh
something you know sub-optimal that you

1484
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
something you know sub-optimal that you
 

1485
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,750
something you know sub-optimal that you
want to exploit well now that's where

1486
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
want to exploit well now that's where
 

1487
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,350
want to exploit well now that's where
not only your like logical brain will

1488
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
not only your like logical brain will
 

1489
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,029
not only your like logical brain will
need to be thinking well okay i know i

1490
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:19,039
need to be thinking well okay i know i
 

1491
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,190
need to be thinking well okay i know i
have this my i'm in the sort of top end

1492
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
have this my i'm in the sort of top end
 

1493
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,870
have this my i'm in the sort of top end
of my range here with this with this

1494
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:22,880
of my range here with this with this
 

1495
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,750
of my range here with this with this
hand

1496
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:23,760
hand
 

1497
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,669
hand
so that means i need to be calling x

1498
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:25,679
so that means i need to be calling x
 

1499
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,310
so that means i need to be calling x
percent of the time um and i put them on

1500
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
percent of the time um and i put them on
 

1501
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,390
percent of the time um and i put them on
this range et cetera

1502
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,400
this range et cetera
 

1503
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,750
this range et cetera
but then

1504
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,760
but then
 

1505
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,830
but then
sometimes you'll have this gut feeling

1506
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
sometimes you'll have this gut feeling
 

1507
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,190
sometimes you'll have this gut feeling
that will tell you

1508
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
that will tell you
 

1509
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,470
that will tell you
you know

1510
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:36,480
you know
 

1511
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,070
you know
you know what this time i know i know

1512
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
you know what this time i know i know
 

1513
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,070
you know what this time i know i know
mathematically i'm meant to call now you

1514
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
mathematically i'm meant to call now you
 

1515
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,830
mathematically i'm meant to call now you
know i've got i'm in the sort of top end

1516
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:41,840
know i've got i'm in the sort of top end
 

1517
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,269
know i've got i'm in the sort of top end
of my range and

1518
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279
of my range and
 

1519
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,110
of my range and
um these this is the odds i'm getting so

1520
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,120
um these this is the odds i'm getting so
 

1521
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,029
um these this is the odds i'm getting so
the math says i should call but there's

1522
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
the math says i should call but there's
 

1523
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,630
the math says i should call but there's
something in your gut saying they've got

1524
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
something in your gut saying they've got
 

1525
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,149
something in your gut saying they've got
it this time they've got it like uh

1526
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159
it this time they've got it like uh
 

1527
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,830
it this time they've got it like uh
they're beating you maybe your hand is

1528
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:53,840
they're beating you maybe your hand is
 

1529
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,870
they're beating you maybe your hand is
worse um so then the the real art this

1530
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
worse um so then the the real art this
 

1531
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,430
worse um so then the the real art this
is where the last remaining art in poker

1532
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
is where the last remaining art in poker
 

1533
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,549
is where the last remaining art in poker
the fuzziness uh is like do you listen

1534
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
the fuzziness uh is like do you listen
 

1535
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,350
the fuzziness uh is like do you listen
to your gut how do you quantify the

1536
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:05,360
to your gut how do you quantify the
 

1537
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,190
to your gut how do you quantify the
strength of it or can you even quantify

1538
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
strength of it or can you even quantify
 

1539
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,070
strength of it or can you even quantify
the strength of it um and i think that's

1540
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,080
the strength of it um and i think that's
 

1541
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,470
the strength of it um and i think that's
what daniel

1542
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
what daniel
 

1543
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,630
what daniel
has i mean i i can't speak for how much

1544
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,640
has i mean i i can't speak for how much
 

1545
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,470
has i mean i i can't speak for how much
he's studying with with with the

1546
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480
he's studying with with with the
 

1547
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,669
he's studying with with with the
simulators and that kind of thing i

1548
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:17,679
simulators and that kind of thing i
 

1549
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,789
simulators and that kind of thing i
think he has like he must be to still be

1550
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:20,799
think he has like he must be to still be
 

1551
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,470
think he has like he must be to still be
keeping up um but he has an incredible

1552
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:24,480
keeping up um but he has an incredible
 

1553
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,590
keeping up um but he has an incredible
intuition

1554
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,600
intuition
 

1555
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,990
intuition
for just he's seen so many hands of

1556
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,000
for just he's seen so many hands of
 

1557
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,070
for just he's seen so many hands of
poker in the flesh he's seen so many

1558
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:30,080
poker in the flesh he's seen so many
 

1559
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,990
poker in the flesh he's seen so many
people the way they behave when the

the line and you've got him staring you
down in the eye you know he's

1566
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
down in the eye you know he's
 

1567
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,310
down in the eye you know he's
intimidating he's got this like kind of

1568
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,320
intimidating he's got this like kind of
 

1569
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,110
intimidating he's got this like kind of
x factor vibe that he you know

1570
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,120
x factor vibe that he you know
 

1571
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,510
x factor vibe that he you know
gives out and he talks a lot which is an

00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,520
gives out and he talks a lot which is an
 

1573
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,590
gives out and he talks a lot which is an
interactive element which is he's

1574
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:45,600
interactive element which is he's
 

1575
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,830
interactive element which is he's
getting stuff from other people yes

1576

00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
yeah just like the subtlety so he's like
 

1579
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,830
yeah just like the subtlety so he's like
he's probing constantly yeah he's

1580
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
he's probing constantly yeah he's
 

1581
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,510
he's probing constantly yeah he's
probing and he's getting this extra

1582
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
probing and he's getting this extra
 

1583
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,750
probing and he's getting this extra
layer of information that others can't

1584
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:55,760
layer of information that others can't
 

1585
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,350
layer of information that others can't
now that said though he's good online as

1586
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:57,360
now that said though he's good online as
 

1587
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,510
now that said though he's good online as
well you know i don't know how again

1588
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
well you know i don't know how again
 

1589
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,350
well you know i don't know how again
would he be beating the top

1590
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
would he be beating the top
 

1591
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,070
would he be beating the top
cash game players online probably not no

1592
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080
cash game players online probably not no
 

1593
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,029
cash game players online probably not no
um

1594
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
um
 

1595
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,590
um
but when he's in in person and he's got

1596
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:07,600
but when he's in in person and he's got
 

1597
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,110
but when he's in in person and he's got
that additional layer of information he

1598
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,120
that additional layer of information he
 

1599
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,029
that additional layer of information he
he can not only extract it but he knows

1600
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
he can not only extract it but he knows
 

1601
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,990
he can not only extract it but he knows
what to do with it um still so well

1602
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,000
what to do with it um still so well
 

1603
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,510
what to do with it um still so well
there's one player who i would say is

1604
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,520
there's one player who i would say is
 

1605
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,190
there's one player who i would say is
the exception to all of this

1606
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,200
the exception to all of this
 

1607
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,350
the exception to all of this
um and he's one of my favorite people to

1608
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360

particularly if they're people who you

2000

any information i give them is going

2004
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
any information i give them is going
 

2005
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,190
any information i give them is going
into their little database and being i

2006
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,200
into their little database and being i
 

2007
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,470
into their little database and being i
assume it's going to be calculated and

2008
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:50,480
assume it's going to be calculated and
 

2009
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,669
assume it's going to be calculated and
used well

2010
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:51,679
used well
 

2011
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,389
used well
so i have to be really confident that my

2012
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:54,399
so i have to be really confident that my
 

2013
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,310
so i have to be really confident that my
like meta gaming that i'm going to then

like meta gaming that i'm going to then
 

2015
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,669
like meta gaming that i'm going to then
do or they've seen this so therefore

2016
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
do or they've seen this so therefore
 

2017
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,830
do or they've seen this so therefore
that i'm going to be on the right level

that i'm going to be on the right level
 

2019
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,549
that i'm going to be on the right level
um so it's better just to keep that

2020
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
um so it's better just to keep that
 

2021
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,389

miscalculated what's going on here what

2052
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:34,559
miscalculated what's going on here what
 

2053

what does that feel like
 

2057
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,590
what does that feel like
i mean it's

2058
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:41,600

 

2059
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,909

i imagine comparable to

2060
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:45,919

 

2061
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,430

you know running a

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,870
you know running a
i mean any kind of big bluff where you

2064
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
i mean any kind of big bluff where you
 

2065
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,710
i mean any kind of big bluff where you
have a lot of something that you care

2066

have a lot of something that you care
about on the line

00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
you know so if you're
 

2071
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,509

bluffing in a courtroom not that anyone
 

2073
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,630
bluffing in a courtroom not that anyone
should ever do that or you know

2078
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,240
incr
 

2079
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,070

you know in that scenario you know i

2080
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,080
you know in that scenario you know i
 

2081
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:04,950
you know in that scenario you know i
think it was the first time i'd ever

think it was the first time i'd ever
played a 20 i'd won my way into this 25k

2084
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
played a 20 i'd won my way into this 25k
 

2085
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,030
played a 20 i'd won my way into this 25k
tournament

2086
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,040
tournament
 

2087
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,190
tournament
so that was the buy in 25 000 euros and

2088
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
so that was the buy in 25 000 euros and
 

2089
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,270
so that was the buy in 25 000 euros and
i had satellited my way in because it

2090
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:13,280
i had satellited my way in because it
 

2091
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,710
i had satellited my way in because it
was much bigger than i would never ever

2092
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:14,720

2097
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,510
and you know i hadn't i wasn't that
experienced at the time and now i was

2098
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:19,520
experienced at the time and now i was
 

2099
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,109
experienced at the time and now i was
sitting there against all the big boys

2100
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
sitting there against all the big boys
 

2101

sitting there against all the big boys
you know the negra news the fill ivs and

2102
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:22,960
you know the negra news the fill ivs and
 

2103
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,629
you know the negra news the fill ivs and
so on um

2104
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:24,639
so on um
 

2105
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,069
so on um
and then

2106
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
and then
 

2107
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,069
and then
uh to like

2108
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:28,079
uh to like
 

2109
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,230
uh to like
you know each time you put the bets out

2110
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240
you know each time you put the bets out
 

2111
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,149
you know each time you put the bets out
you know you put another bet out

2112
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
you know you put another bet out
 

2113
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,230
you know you put another bet out
your car yeah i was on a what's called a

2114
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,240
your car yeah i was on a what's called a
 

2115
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,669
your car yeah i was on a what's called a
semi-bluff so there were some cards that

2116
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:35,679
semi-bluff so there were some cards that
 

2117
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,510
semi-bluff so there were some cards that
could come that would make my hand very

2118
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,520
could come that would make my hand very
 

2119
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,510
could come that would make my hand very
very strong and therefore win but most

2120
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:39,520
very strong and therefore win but most
 

2121
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,030
very strong and therefore win but most
of the time those cards don't come so

2122
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,040
of the time those cards don't come so
 

2123
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,310
of the time those cards don't come so
that it's the same above because you're

2124
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,320
that it's the same above because you're
 

2125
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,629
that it's the same above because you're
representing what are you representing

2126
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
representing what are you representing
 

2127
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,669
representing what are you representing
that you already have something

2128
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:47,679
that you already have something
 

2129
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,149
that you already have something
so i think in this scenario i had a

2130
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
so i think in this scenario i had a
 

2131
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,589
so i think in this scenario i had a
flush draw two two so i had two clubs

2132
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:53,599
flush draw two two so i had two clubs
 

2133
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,829
flush draw two two so i had two clubs
two two clubs came out on the flop and

2134
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:55,839
two two clubs came out on the flop and
 

2135
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,270
two two clubs came out on the flop and
then i'm hoping that on the turn in the

2136
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,280
then i'm hoping that on the turn in the
 

2137
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,829
then i'm hoping that on the turn in the
river one will come so i have some

2138
00:34:59,829 --> 00:34:59,839
river one will come so i have some
 

2139
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,750
river one will come so i have some
future equity i could hit a club and

2140
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:01,760
future equity i could hit a club and
 

2141
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,870
future equity i could hit a club and
then i'll have the best hand in which

2142
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:02,880
then i'll have the best hand in which
 

2143
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,990
then i'll have the best hand in which
case great um and so i can keep betting

2144
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
case great um and so i can keep betting
 

2145
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,230
case great um and so i can keep betting
and i'll want them to call but i'm also

2146
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:08,240
and i'll want them to call but i'm also
 

2147
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,510
and i'll want them to call but i'm also
got the other way of winning the hand

2148
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:09,520
got the other way of winning the hand
 

2149
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,710
got the other way of winning the hand
where if my

2150
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:10,720
where if my
 

2151
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,870
where if my
card doesn't come i can keep betting and

2152
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
card doesn't come i can keep betting and
 

2153
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,950
card doesn't come i can keep betting and
get them to fold their hand

2154
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:14,960
get them to fold their hand
 

2155
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,069
get them to fold their hand
and i'm pretty sure that's what the

2156
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:16,079
and i'm pretty sure that's what the
 

2157
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,349
and i'm pretty sure that's what the
scenario was

2158
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:17,359
scenario was
 

2159
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,910
scenario was
um so i had some future equity but it's

2160
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:19,920
um so i had some future equity but it's
 

2161
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,990
um so i had some future equity but it's
still you know most of the time i don't

2162
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,000
still you know most of the time i don't
 

2163
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,710
still you know most of the time i don't
hit that club and so i would rather him

2164
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
hit that club and so i would rather him
 

2165
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,150
hit that club and so i would rather him
just fold because i'm you know the pot

2166
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
just fold because i'm you know the pot
 

2167
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,990
just fold because i'm you know the pot
is now getting bigger and bigger and in

2168
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,000
is now getting bigger and bigger and in
 

2169
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,990
is now getting bigger and bigger and in
the end like i jam all jam all in on the

2170
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
the end like i jam all jam all in on the
 

2171
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,870
the end like i jam all jam all in on the
river

2172
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:30,880
river
 

2173
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,589
river
that's my entire tournament on the line

2174
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:33,599
that's my entire tournament on the line
 

2175
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,710
that's my entire tournament on the line
as far as i'm aware this might be the

2176
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:34,720
as far as i'm aware this might be the
 

2177
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,030
as far as i'm aware this might be the
one time i ever get to play a big 25k

a mixture of like okay what are the
cards so

2212

cards so
 

2213
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,950
cards so
in theory i'm thinking about like okay

look stronger which you know which cards
 

2219
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,109
look stronger which you know which cards
hit my perceived range from his

2220
00:36:13,109 --> 00:36:13,119
hit my perceived range from his
 

2221
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,750
hit my perceived range from his
perspective which cards don't um what's

2222
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:15,760
perspective which cards don't um what's
 

2223
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,230
perspective which cards don't um what's
the right amount of bet size to you know

2224

the right amount of bet size to you know
 

2225
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,829
the right amount of bet size to you know
maximize my fold equity in this

2226
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:19,839
maximize my fold equity in this
 

2227
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,750
maximize my fold equity in this
situation you know that's the logical

2228
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
situation you know that's the logical
 

2229
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,030
situation you know that's the logical
stuff that i should be thinking about

2230
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
stuff that i should be thinking about
 

2231
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,870
stuff that i should be thinking about
but i think in reality because i was so

2232
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:24,880
but i think in reality because i was so
 

2233
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,550
but i think in reality because i was so
scared because there's this at least for

2234
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,560
scared because there's this at least for
 

2235
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,870
scared because there's this at least for
me there's a certain threshold of like

2236
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:28,880
me there's a certain threshold of like
 

2237
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,109
me there's a certain threshold of like
nervousness or stress beyond which the

2238
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:31,119
nervousness or stress beyond which the
 

2239
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,270
nervousness or stress beyond which the
like logical brain shuts off

2240
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
like logical brain shuts off
 

2241
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,630
like logical brain shuts off
and now it just gets into this like

2242
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:36,640
and now it just gets into this like
 

2243
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,829
and now it just gets into this like
it's just like it feels like a game of

2244
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:37,839
it's just like it feels like a game of
 

2245
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,829
it's just like it feels like a game of
wits basically it's like of nerve can

2246
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
wits basically it's like of nerve can
 

2247
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,750
wits basically it's like of nerve can
you hold your hold your resolve

2248
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:41,760
you hold your hold your resolve
 

2249
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,589
you hold your hold your resolve
um and it certainly got by that like by

2250
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:43,599
um and it certainly got by that like by
 

2251
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,190
um and it certainly got by that like by
the river at this i think by that point

2252
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,200
the river at this i think by that point
 

2253
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,630
the river at this i think by that point
i was like i don't even know if this is

2254
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:46,640
i was like i don't even know if this is
 

2255
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,349
i was like i don't even know if this is
a good bluff anymore but it let's

2256
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:49,359
a good bluff anymore but it let's
 

2257
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,589
a good bluff anymore but it let's
do it your mind is almost numb from the

2258
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:51,599
do it your mind is almost numb from the
 

2259
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,670
do it your mind is almost numb from the
intensity of that feeling i call it the

2260
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:53,680
intensity of that feeling i call it the
 

2261
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,030
intensity of that feeling i call it the
white noise

2262
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,040
white noise
 

2263
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,030
white noise
and and that's this

2264
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,040
and and that's this
 

2265
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,390
and and that's this
and it happens in all kinds of decision

2266
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:58,400
and it happens in all kinds of decision
 

2267
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,990
and it happens in all kinds of decision
making i think anything that's really

2268
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
making i think anything that's really
 

2269
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,430

your flight or fight response you know
 

2291
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,270
your flight or fight response you know
what i think get from the sympathetic

2292
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,280
what i think get from the sympathetic
 

2293
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,109
what i think get from the sympathetic
into the parasympathetic so you can

2294
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,119
into the parasympathetic so you can
 

2295
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,670
into the parasympathetic so you can
actually you know engage the that voice

2296
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:23,680
actually you know engage the that voice
 

2297
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,349
actually you know engage the that voice
in your head and do those slow logical

2298
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:25,359
in your head and do those slow logical
 

2299
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,990
in your head and do those slow logical
calculations because evolutionarily we

2300
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
calculations because evolutionarily we
 

2301
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,510
calculations because evolutionarily we
you know if we see a lion running at us

2302
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:29,520
you know if we see a lion running at us
 

2303
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,510
you know if we see a lion running at us
we didn't have time to sort of calculate

2304
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,520
we didn't have time to sort of calculate
 

2305
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,910
we didn't have time to sort of calculate
the line's kinetic energy and you know

2306
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:33,920
the line's kinetic energy and you know
 

2307
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,349
the line's kinetic energy and you know
is it optimal to go this way or that way

2308
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:35,359
is it optimal to go this way or that way
 

2309
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,829
is it optimal to go this way or that way
you just reacted and

2310
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
you just reacted and
 

2311
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,750
you just reacted and
physically our bodies are well attuned

2312
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
physically our bodies are well attuned
 

2313
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,349
physically our bodies are well attuned
to actually make right decisions but

2314
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:41,359
to actually make right decisions but
 

2315
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,030
to actually make right decisions but
when you're playing a game like poker

2316
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,040
when you're playing a game like poker
 

2317
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,550
when you're playing a game like poker
this is not something that you ever you

2318
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
this is not something that you ever you
 

2319
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,630
this is not something that you ever you
know evolved to do and yet you're in

2320
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:46,640
know evolved to do and yet you're in
 

2321
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,190
know evolved to do and yet you're in
that same flight or fight response

2322
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,200
that same flight or fight response
 

2323
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,870
that same flight or fight response
and so that's a really important skill

2324
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:50,880
and so that's a really important skill
 

2325
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,390
and so that's a really important skill
to be able to develop to basically learn

2326
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:52,400
to be able to develop to basically learn

00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:01,280
a comparable thing it's interesting
 

2337
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,349
a comparable thing it's interesting
because i you just made me realize that

2338
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
because i you just made me realize that
 

2339
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,950

like an incredibly high stakes form of
 

2343
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,069
like an incredibly high stakes form of
lying

2344

00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
in in the context of game
 

2353
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,870
in in the context of game
it's not a negative kind of lying

2354
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:18,880
it's not a negative kind of lying
 

2355
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,630
it's not a negative kind of lying

you don't have and i was thinking like

2360
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:24,320
you don't have and i was thinking like
 

2361
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,790
you don't have and i was thinking like
in how often in life

2362
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:26,800
in how often in life
 

2363
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,150
in how often in life
do we have such high stakes of lying

2364
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,160
do we have such high stakes of lying
 

2365
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,870
do we have such high stakes of lying
because i was thinking um

2366
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:32,880
because i was thinking um
 

2367
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,310
because i was thinking um
certainly in

high-level military strategy i was
thinking um

2372
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:37,599

and uh you're fighting against the enemy
 

2385
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,790
and uh you're fighting against the enemy
whatever the the the formulation that

whatever the the the formulation that
 

2387
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,550
whatever the the the formulation that
enemy is but

2388
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:54,560
enemy is but
 

2389
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,390
enemy is but
meanwhile whole time you're building up

2390
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
meanwhile whole time you're building up
 

2391
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,990
meanwhile whole time you're building up
troops on the border

2392
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:58,000
troops on the border
 

2393
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,790

more importantly
 

3173
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,390
more importantly
because obviously game usually implies

3174
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:42,400
because obviously game usually implies
 

3175
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,069
because obviously game usually implies
zero sum like what

3176
00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:44,079
zero sum like what
 

3177
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,390

because
 

3185
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,790
because
if everyone plays zero sum games that's

3186
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:54,800
if everyone plays zero sum games that's
 

3187
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,549
if everyone plays zero sum games that's
a fast track to either completely

3188
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:56,559
a fast track to either completely
 

3189
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,309
a fast track to either completely
stagnate as a civilization but more

3190
00:51:58,309 --> 00:51:58,319
stagnate as a civilization but more
 

3191
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,549
stagnate as a civilization but more
actually far more likely to extinct

3192
00:52:00,549 --> 00:52:00,559
actually far more likely to extinct
 

3193
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,670
actually far more likely to extinct

3195
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,750

um you know like the playing field is

3196
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:03,760
um you know like the playing field is
 

3197
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,790
um you know like the playing field is
finite

3198

00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:06,960
yeah
 

3201
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,510
yeah
you know nuclear powers are playing uh

3202
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:09,520
you know nuclear powers are playing uh
 

3203
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,670
you know nuclear powers are playing uh
you know a game of poker with uh with

3204
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:11,680
you know a game of poker with uh with
 

3205
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,030
you know a game of poker with uh with
you know but their chips are nuclear

3206
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:13,040
you know but their chips are nuclear
 

3207
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,470

and
 

3211
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,430
and
the stakes have gotten so large that if

3212
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:17,440
the stakes have gotten so large that if
 

3213
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,430
the stakes have gotten so large that if
anyone makes a single bet you know fires

3214
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:19,440
anyone makes a single bet you know fires
 

3215
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,510
anyone makes a single bet you know fires
some weapons the the playing field

3216

some weapons the the playing field
 

3217
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,670

you know the the the fight the playing
 

3221
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,510
you know the the the fight the playing
field is finite and if we keep playing

it's just a matter of when what do you

00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:41,440
it's just a matter of when what do you
 

3239
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,510
it's just a matter of when what do you
think about that uh mutually sure

3240
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:43,520
think about that uh mutually sure
 

3241
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,710

caricaturing game theory idea that does
 

3247
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,670
caricaturing game theory idea that does
seem to be

00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:51,680
seem to be
 

3249
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,190
seem to be
at the core of why we haven't blown each

3250
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:53,200
at the core of why we haven't blown each
 

3251

other up yet with nuclear weapons
 

3253
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,430
other up yet with nuclear weapons
do you think there's some truth to that

3254
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,440
do you think there's some truth to that
 

3255
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,950
do you think there's some truth to that
this kind of

3256
00:52:58,950 --> 00:52:58,960
this kind of
 

3257
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,790
this kind of

stabilizing force of mutually sure
 

3259
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,230
stabilizing force of mutually sure
destruction and do you think that's

3260
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,240
destruction and do you think that's
 

3261
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,670
destruction and do you think that's
gonna

3262
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:03,680
gonna
 

3263
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,790
gonna
hold up

3264
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:04,800
hold up
 

3265
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,190
hold up
through the 21st century

3266
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:07,200
through the 21st century
 

3267
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,230
through the 21st century
i mean it's it has it has held yes

3268
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:10,240
i mean it's it has it has held yes
 

3269
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,589
i mean it's it has it has held yes
there's there's definitely truth to it

3270
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:11,599
there's there's definitely truth to it
 

3271
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,109
there's there's definitely truth to it
that it was a

3272
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:13,119
that it was a
 

3273
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,790
that it was a
you know it's a nash equilibrium yeah

3274
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
you know it's a nash equilibrium yeah
 

3275
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,030
you know it's a nash equilibrium yeah
are you surprised it held this long um

3276
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
are you surprised it held this long um
 

3277
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,309
are you surprised it held this long um
isn't crazy

3278
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:18,319
isn't crazy
 

3279
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,470
isn't crazy
it is crazy when you factor in all the

3280
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:20,480
it is crazy when you factor in all the
 

3281
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,190
it is crazy when you factor in all the
like

3282
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:21,200
like
 

3283
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,549
like
near-miss accidental firings

3284
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:24,559
near-miss accidental firings
 

3285
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,150
near-miss accidental firings
yes that's

3286
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:26,160
yes that's
 

3287
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,910
yes that's
makes me wonder like you know you know

3288
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:27,920
makes me wonder like you know you know
 

3289
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,190
makes me wonder like you know you know
they're familiar with the like quantum

3290
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:29,200
they're familiar with the like quantum
 

3291
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,349
they're familiar with the like quantum
suicide thought experiment where it's

3292
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:31,359
suicide thought experiment where it's
 

3293
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,470
suicide thought experiment where it's
basically like

3294
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:32,480
basically like
 

3295
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,549
basically like
uh you have a

3296
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
uh you have a
 

3297
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,470
uh you have a
you know like a russian roulette

3298
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
you know like a russian roulette
 

3299
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,549
you know like a russian roulette
type scenario uh

3300
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:38,559
type scenario uh
 

3301
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,470
type scenario uh
hooked up to some kind of quantum event

3302
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:40,480
hooked up to some kind of quantum event
 

3303
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,390
hooked up to some kind of quantum event
you know

3304
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:42,400
you know
 

3305
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,030
you know

00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:46,640
splitting and
 

3309
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,030
splitting and
if it you know if it goes a then the gun

3310
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:49,040
if it you know if it goes a then the gun
 

3311
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,309
if it you know if it goes a then the gun
doesn't go off and it goes b then it

00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
doesn't go off and it goes b then it
 

3313
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,390
doesn't go off and it goes b then it
does go off and it kills you

3314
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
does go off and it kills you
 

3315
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,470
does go off and it kills you
because you can only ever be in the

00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:11,349
the tree gets huge there's a million
different scenarios in but you'll always

3334
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:11,359
different scenarios in but you'll always
 

3335
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,109
different scenarios in but you'll always
find yourself in this in the one where

3336
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
find yourself in this in the one where
 

3337
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,790
find yourself in this in the one where
it didn't go off

3338
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:14,800
it didn't go off
 

3339
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,829
it didn't go off
and

3340
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:15,839

uh

00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:18,640
and so from that perspective
 

3345
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,549
and so from that perspective
you are essentially immortal

you are essentially immortal
 

3347
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,150
you are essentially immortal

00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,510

just like a fun thought experiment and
 

3369
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,990
just like a fun thought experiment and
the point is it like raises this thing

the point is it like raises this thing
 

3371
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,589
the point is it like raises this thing
of like these things called uh observer

00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:44,640
bostrom talks about a lot and i think
 

3377
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,390
bostrom talks about a lot and i think
people should go read um it's really

00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:46,400
people should go read um it's really
 

3379
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,430
people should go read um it's really
powerful but i think it could be

00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:47,440
powerful but i think it could be
 

3381
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,390

overextended that logic i'm not sure
 

3383
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,990
overextended that logic i'm not sure
exactly how it can be i just feel like

00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000
exactly how it can be i just feel like
 

3385
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,190

00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
you can get you can um overgeneralize
 

3387
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,790
you can get you can um overgeneralize
that logic somehow well no i mean it

3388
00:54:58,790 --> 00:54:58,800
that logic somehow well no i mean it
 

3389
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,950
that logic somehow well no i mean it
leads you into like solipsism which is a

3390
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:00,960
leads you into like solipsism which is a
 

3391
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,790
leads you into like solipsism which is a
very dangerous mindset again if everyone

3392
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:02,800
very dangerous mindset again if everyone
 

3393
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,390
very dangerous mindset again if everyone
like falls into solipsism of like well

like falls into solipsism of like well
 

3395
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,750

i'll be fine

3396
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:05,760
i'll be fine

you know
self-terminating environment um but my

3402
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:11,200
self-terminating environment um but my
 

3403
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,870
self-terminating environment um but my
point is is that with the nuclear

3404
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:12,880
point is is that with the nuclear
 

3405
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,430
point is is that with the nuclear
weapons thing um there have been at

3406
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
weapons thing um there have been at
 

3407
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,470
weapons thing um there have been at
least i think it's 12 or 11 um

3408
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:18,480
least i think it's 12 or 11 um
 

3409
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,630
least i think it's 12 or 11 um
near-misses were of like just stupid

00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
near-misses were of like just stupid
 

3411
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,670
near-misses were of like just stupid
things like

3412
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:21,680
things like
 

3413
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,470
things like
uh there was moon rise over norway and

3414
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:24,480
uh there was moon rise over norway and
 

3415
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,069
uh there was moon rise over norway and
it made weird reflections off some

3416
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:26,079
it made weird reflections off some
 

3417
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,710
it made weird reflections off some
glaciers in the mountains which set off

i think the alarms of norad
 

3421
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,549
i think the alarms of norad

alert nearly ready to shoot and it was
 

3425
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,589

the time that they go like well wait a
 

3433
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,549
the time that they go like well wait a
second why would

second why would
 

3435
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,470
second why would
why would they fire now when their guy

3436
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:46,480
why would they fire now when their guy
 

3437
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,549
why would they fire now when their guy
is there it was only that lucky

3438
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:48,559
is there it was only that lucky
 

3439
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,910
is there it was only that lucky

happenstance which doesn't happen very
 

3441
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,270
happenstance which doesn't happen very
often where they didn't then escalate

3442
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,280
often where they didn't then escalate
 

3443
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,190
often where they didn't then escalate
into firing and there's a bunch of these

3444
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:53,200
into firing and there's a bunch of these
 

3445
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,950
into firing and there's a bunch of these
different ones stanislav petrov like

3446
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:54,960
different ones stanislav petrov like
 

3447
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,829
different ones stanislav petrov like
saved

the person who should be the most famous
 

3451
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,950

of anyone like billions of people by
 

3457
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,430
of anyone like billions of people by
ignoring russian orders to fire because

3458
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:05,440
ignoring russian orders to fire because
 

3459
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,710
ignoring russian orders to fire because
he felt in his gut that actually this

3460
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:06,720
he felt in his gut that actually this
 

3461
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,069
he felt in his gut that actually this
was a false alarm and it turned out to

3462
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
was a false alarm and it turned out to
 

3463
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,030
was a false alarm and it turned out to
be you know very hard thing to do um and

3464
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:11,040
be you know very hard thing to do um and
 

3465
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,710
be you know very hard thing to do um and
there's so many of those scenarios that

3466
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:12,720
there's so many of those scenarios that
 

3467
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,390
there's so many of those scenarios that
i can't help but wonder at this point

3468
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,400
i can't help but wonder at this point
 

3469
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,069
i can't help but wonder at this point
that we aren't having this kind of like

3470
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
that we aren't having this kind of like
 

3471
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,910
that we aren't having this kind of like
selection effect thing going on because

3472
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:17,920
selection effect thing going on because
 

3473
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,670
selection effect thing going on because
you look back and you're like geez

3474
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
you look back and you're like geez
 

3475
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,270
you look back and you're like geez
that's a lot of near misses but of

3476
00:56:21,270 --> 00:56:21,280
that's a lot of near misses but of
 

3477
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,230
that's a lot of near misses but of
course we don't know the actual

3478
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,240
course we don't know the actual
 

3479
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,430
course we don't know the actual
probabilities that they would have lent

3480
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:23,440
probabilities that they would have lent
 

3481
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,630
probabilities that they would have lent
each one would have ended up in nuclear

3482
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:24,640
each one would have ended up in nuclear
 

3483
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,150
each one would have ended up in nuclear
war maybe they were not that likely but

3484
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
war maybe they were not that likely but
 

3485
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,630
war maybe they were not that likely but
still the point is it's a very dark

3486
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:28,640
still the point is it's a very dark
 

3487
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,589
still the point is it's a very dark
stupid game that we're playing um and

3488
00:56:31,589 --> 00:56:31,599
stupid game that we're playing um and
 

3489
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:33,190
stupid game that we're playing um and
it is

3490
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:33,200
it is
 

3491
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,109
it is
an absolute moral imperative if you ask

3492
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:35,119
an absolute moral imperative if you ask
 

3493
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,789
an absolute moral imperative if you ask
me to get as many people thinking about

3494
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:36,799
me to get as many people thinking about
 

3495
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,430
me to get as many people thinking about
ways to make this like very precarious

3496
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
ways to make this like very precarious
 

3497
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,109
ways to make this like very precarious
because we're in a nash equilibrium but

3498
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:41,119
because we're in a nash equilibrium but
 

3499
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:42,309
because we're in a nash equilibrium but
it's not like we're in the bottom of a

it's not like we're in the bottom of a
 

3501
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,390
it's not like we're in the bottom of a

3503
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,789
pit you know if you would like map it
topographically um it's not like a

topographically um it's not like a

4053
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,470

i i think that's the confidence thing

4054
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:36,480
i i think that's the confidence thing
 

4055
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,470
i i think that's the confidence thing
that uh

4056
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:38,480
that uh
 

4057
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,230

maybe you could do something special in
this world after all kind of feeling i i

4060

this world after all kind of feeling i i
definitely i mean

4062
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
definitely i mean
 

4063
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,910
definitely i mean
this is a thing i think everybody

4064
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:45,920
this is a thing i think everybody
 

4065
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,150
this is a thing i think everybody
wrestles with to an extent right we all

4066
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:48,160
wrestles with to an extent right we all
 

4067
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,390
wrestles with to an extent right we all
we are truly the protagonists in our own

4068
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
we are truly the protagonists in our own
 

4069
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:51,430
we are truly the protagonists in our own
lives

01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:51,440
lives
 

4071
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,150
lives
and so it's a natural bias human bias to

4072
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:56,160
and so it's a natural bias human bias to
 

4073
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,750
and so it's a natural bias human bias to
feel

4074
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
feel
 

4075
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,750
feel
to feel special and i think and in some

4076
01:05:59,750 --> 01:05:59,760
to feel special and i think and in some
 

4077
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,430
to feel special and i think and in some
ways we are special every single person

4078
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,440
ways we are special every single person
 

4079
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,589
ways we are special every single person
is special because that you are that

the universe does the world literally

4082
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,200
the universe does the world literally
 

4083
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,710
the universe does the world literally
does revolve around you that's the thing

4084

does revolve around you that's the thing
 

4085
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,190
does revolve around you that's the thing
in in some respect but

4086
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:09,200
in in some respect but
 

4087
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,630
in in some respect but
of course if you then zoom out and take

4088
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:10,640
of course if you then zoom out and take
 

4089
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,990
of course if you then zoom out and take
the amalgam of everyone's experiences

4090
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:12,000
the amalgam of everyone's experiences
 

4091
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,750
the amalgam of everyone's experiences
then no it doesn't so there is this

4092
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:13,760
then no it doesn't so there is this
 

4093
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,910
then no it doesn't so there is this
shared sort of objective reality but

4094
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:15,920
shared sort of objective reality but
 

4095
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,349
shared sort of objective reality but
sorry this objective reality that is

4096
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:17,359
sorry this objective reality that is
 

4097
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:18,309
sorry this objective reality that is
shared but then there's also this

4098
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:18,319
shared but then there's also this
 

4099
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,990
shared but then there's also this
subject of reality which is truly unique

4100
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:20,000
subject of reality which is truly unique
 

4101
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,670
subject of reality which is truly unique
to you and i think both of those things

4102
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:21,680
to you and i think both of those things
 

4103
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,829
to you and i think both of those things
coexist and it's not like one is correct

4104
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:23,839
coexist and it's not like one is correct
 

4105
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,190
coexist and it's not like one is correct
and one isn't and again anyone who's

4106
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:25,200
and one isn't and again anyone who's
 

4107
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,270
and one isn't and again anyone who's
like uh oh no your lived experience is

4108
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:27,280
like uh oh no your lived experience is
 

4109
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,670
like uh oh no your lived experience is
everything versus your lived experience

4110
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:29,680
everything versus your lived experience
 

4111
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,750
everything versus your lived experience
is nothing no it's it's a blend between

4112
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:31,760
is nothing no it's it's a blend between
 

4113
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:32,950
is nothing no it's it's a blend between
these two things they can exist

4114
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960
these two things they can exist
 

4115
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,549
these two things they can exist
concurrently but there's a certain kind

4116
01:06:34,549 --> 01:06:34,559
concurrently but there's a certain kind
 

4117
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:36,470
concurrently but there's a certain kind
of sense that at least i've had my whole

01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:36,480
of sense that at least i've had my whole

what if it's a game and the goal of the
 

4455
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,030
what if it's a game and the goal of the
game is to figure out like well either

4456
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:15,040
game is to figure out like well either

all the pieces of the puzzle figure out
 

4469
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:26,709
all the pieces of the puzzle figure out
how it works

4470
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:26,719
how it works
 

4471
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,390
how it works
in order to like unlock this like

4472
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,400
in order to like unlock this like
 

4473

hyper-dimensional key and get out beyond

4474
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:30,640
hyper-dimensional key and get out beyond
 

4475
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,630
hyper-dimensional key and get out beyond
what it is that's no but but then so

4476
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:32,640
what it is that's no but but then so
 

4477
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,229
what it is that's no but but then so
you're saying it's like different levels

4478
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:34,239
you're saying it's like different levels
 

4479
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:35,750
you're saying it's like different levels
and it's like a cage within a cage

4480
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:35,760
and it's like a cage within a cage
 

4481
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,750
and it's like a cage within a cage
within a cage and never locate one cage

4482
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:37,760
within a cage and never locate one cage
 

4483
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,430
within a cage and never locate one cage
at a time you figure out how to describe

4484
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
at a time you figure out how to describe
 

4485
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,390
at a time you figure out how to describe
that

4486
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:40,400
that
 

4487
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,550
that
um again you level up you know like us

4488
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:42,560
um again you level up you know like us
 

4489
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,830
um again you level up you know like us
becoming multi-planetary would be a

4490
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:43,840
becoming multi-planetary would be a
 

4491
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,149
becoming multi-planetary would be a
level up or us you know figuring out how

4492
01:12:46,149 --> 01:12:46,159
level up or us you know figuring out how
 

4493
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:47,910
level up or us you know figuring out how
to upload our consciousnesses to the

4494
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:47,920
to upload our consciousnesses to the
 

4495
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,189
to upload our consciousnesses to the
thing that would probably be a leveling

4496
01:12:49,189 --> 01:12:49,199
thing that would probably be a leveling
 

4497
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,550
thing that would probably be a leveling
up or

4498
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:50,560
up or
 

4499
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,630
up or
spiritually you know humanity becoming

4500
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:52,640
spiritually you know humanity becoming
 

4501
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,790
spiritually you know humanity becoming
more combined and and less adversarial

4502
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:54,800
more combined and and less adversarial
 

4503
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,750
more combined and and less adversarial
and and

4504
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:55,760
and and
 

4505
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,830
and and
uh bloodthirsty and us becoming a little

4506
01:12:57,830 --> 01:12:57,840
uh bloodthirsty and us becoming a little
 

4507
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,030
uh bloodthirsty and us becoming a little
bit more enlightened that would be a

4508
01:12:59,030 --> 01:12:59,040
bit more enlightened that would be a
 

4509
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,990
bit more enlightened that would be a
leveling up you know there's many

4510
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:00,000
leveling up you know there's many
 

4511
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,149
leveling up you know there's many
different frames to it whether it's

4512
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:02,159
different frames to it whether it's
 

4513
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,510
different frames to it whether it's
physical

4514
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,520
physical
 

4515
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,390
physical
you know digital uh or like metaphysical

4516
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:06,400
you know digital uh or like metaphysical
 

4517
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,790
you know digital uh or like metaphysical
levels i think i think level one for

4518
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:08,800
levels i think i think level one for
 

4519
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,870
levels i think i think level one for
earth is probably

4520
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:10,880
earth is probably
 

4521
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,830
earth is probably
the biological evolutionary process

4522
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:13,840
the biological evolutionary process
 

4523
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,430
the biological evolutionary process
it's like going from single cell

4524
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440
it's like going from single cell
 

4525
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,270
it's like going from single cell
organisms to to early humans and maybe

4526
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280
organisms to to early humans and maybe
 

4527
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,110
organisms to to early humans and maybe
level two is

4528
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,120
level two is
 

4529
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,550
level two is
what whatever is happening inside our

4530
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:22,560
what whatever is happening inside our
 

4531
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,310
what whatever is happening inside our
minds and creating ideas and creating

4532
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:24,320
minds and creating ideas and creating
 

4533
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,990
minds and creating ideas and creating
technologies

4534
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:26,000
technologies
 

4535
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,590
technologies
that's like

4536
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:27,600
that's like
 

4537
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,270
that's like
evolutionary process of ideas

4538
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:31,280
evolutionary process of ideas
 

4539
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,110
evolutionary process of ideas
and then uh multiplanetary is

4540
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:33,120
and then uh multiplanetary is
 

4541
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,470
and then uh multiplanetary is
interesting

4542
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,480
interesting
 

4543
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,910
interesting
is that fundamentally different from

4544
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:35,920
is that fundamentally different from
 

4545
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,830
is that fundamentally different from
what we're doing here on earth

4546
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:37,840
what we're doing here on earth
 

4547
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,910
what we're doing here on earth
probably because it allows us to like

4548
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:39,920
probably because it allows us to like
 

4549
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,669
probably because it allows us to like
exponentially scale

4550
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:41,679
exponentially scale
 

4551
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:42,950
exponentially scale
it

4552
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:42,960
it
 

4553
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,870
it
it delays the malthusian trap right it

4554
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:46,880
it delays the malthusian trap right it
 

4555
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,470
it delays the malthusian trap right it
it's a way to

4556
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:48,480
it's a way to
 

4557
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,270
it's a way to
keep the playing field get

4558
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:51,280
keep the playing field get
 

4559
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,350
keep the playing field get
lot to make the playing field get larger

4560
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:53,360
lot to make the playing field get larger
 

4561
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,870
lot to make the playing field get larger
so that we can it can accommodate more

4562
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:54,880
so that we can it can accommodate more
 

4563
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,189
so that we can it can accommodate more
of our stuff more of us

4564
01:13:57,189 --> 01:13:57,199
of our stuff more of us
 

4565
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,790
of our stuff more of us
um and that's a good thing but i don't

4566
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:58,800
um and that's a good thing but i don't
 

4567
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,470
um and that's a good thing but i don't
know if it like fully solves this issue

4568
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:02,480
know if it like fully solves this issue
 

4569
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,070
know if it like fully solves this issue
um of

4570
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
um of

talked about um
 

4653
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:25,350
talked about um
this is you you see that there was this

4654
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:25,360
this is you you see that there was this
 

4655
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,350
this is you you see that there was this
incredible futuristic city that everyone

4656
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:27,360
incredible futuristic city that everyone
 

4657
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,350
incredible futuristic city that everyone
was living great in um but then the

4658
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:29,360
was living great in um but then the
 

4659
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,870
was living great in um but then the
protagonist goes underground into the

4660
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:30,880
protagonist goes underground into the
 

4661
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,709
protagonist goes underground into the
sewers and sees that the city is run by

4662
01:15:32,709 --> 01:15:32,719
sewers and sees that the city is run by
 

4663
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,070
sewers and sees that the city is run by
this machine

4664
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:34,080
this machine
 

4665
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,750
this machine
and this machine basically would just

4666
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:35,760
and this machine basically would just
 

4667
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,910
and this machine basically would just
like kill the workers all the time

4668
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:37,920
like kill the workers all the time
 

4669
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,270
like kill the workers all the time
because it was just so hard to keep it

4670
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
because it was just so hard to keep it
 

4671
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,790
because it was just so hard to keep it
running they were always dying so

4672
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:40,800
running they were always dying so
 

4673
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,229

01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,390
there's all this suffering that was
required in order to keep the city going

4676
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:44,400
required in order to keep the city going
 

4677
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,750
required in order to keep the city going
and then the protagonist has this vision

4678
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:45,760
and then the protagonist has this vision
 

4679
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,270
and then the protagonist has this vision
that this machine is actually this demon

4680
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:47,280
that this machine is actually this demon
 

4681
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,030
that this machine is actually this demon
moloch so again it's like this sort of

moloch so again it's like this sort of
like mechanistic consumption of of

01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:51,520
like mechanistic consumption of of
 

4685
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,870
like mechanistic consumption of of
humans in order to get more power um and

uh so anyway so he writes he writes this

4774
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:23,760
uh so anyway so he writes he writes this
 

4775
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,590
uh so anyway so he writes he writes this
this piece meditations on molok and

4776
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
this piece meditations on molok and
 

4777
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,870
this piece meditations on molok and
basically

4778
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:26,880
basically
 

4779
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,950
basically
he analyzes the poem and he's like okay

4780
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:28,960
he analyzes the poem and he's like okay
 

4781
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,550
he analyzes the poem and he's like okay
so it seems to be something relating to

4782
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:30,560
so it seems to be something relating to
 

4783
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,950
so it seems to be something relating to
where competition goes wrong

4784
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:32,960
where competition goes wrong
 

4785
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,910
where competition goes wrong
and

4786
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:33,920
and
 

4787
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,750
and
you know moloch was historically this

4788
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:35,760
you know moloch was historically this
 

4789
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,270

um it's a force of bad incentives on a
 

4965
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,070
um it's a force of bad incentives on a

01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:27,360
you know prisoner's dilemma is
 

4969
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,430
you know prisoner's dilemma is
technically a kind of molecule

4970
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:29,440
technically a kind of molecule
 

4971
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,870
technically a kind of molecule
you know system as well but it's just a

01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:30,880
you know system as well but it's just a
 

4973
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,350
you know system as well but it's just a
two-player thing but um another word for

moloka's multi-polar trap
 

4977
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:36,950
moloka's multi-polar trap
where basically you just got a lot of

4978
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:36,960
where basically you just got a lot of
 

4979
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,790
where basically you just got a lot of
different people all competing for some

4980
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:38,800
different people all competing for some
 

4981
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,590
different people all competing for some
kind of prize um and

4982
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:41,600
kind of prize um and
 

4983
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,110
kind of prize um and
it would be better if everyone didn't do

4984
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:43,120
it would be better if everyone didn't do
 

4985
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,110
it would be better if everyone didn't do
this one shitty strategy but because

4986
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,120
this one shitty strategy but because
 

4987
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,709
this one shitty strategy but because
that strategy gives you a short-term

4988
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:46,719
that strategy gives you a short-term
 

4989
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,229
that strategy gives you a short-term
advantage everyone's incentivized to do

4990
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:48,239
advantage everyone's incentivized to do
 

4991
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:49,990
advantage everyone's incentivized to do
it and so everyone ends up doing it so

4992
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:50,000
it and so everyone ends up doing it so
 

4993
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,830
it and so everyone ends up doing it so
the responsibility for

4994
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:51,840
the responsibility for
 

4995
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,510
the responsibility for
i mean social media is a really nice

4996
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:53,520
i mean social media is a really nice
 

4997
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,590
i mean social media is a really nice
place for a large number of people to

4998
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:55,600
place for a large number of people to
 

4999
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,990
place for a large number of people to
play game theory and so

5000
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
play game theory and so
 

5001
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,910
play game theory and so
they also have the ability to then

5002
01:20:59,910 --> 01:20:59,920
they also have the ability to then
 

5003
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,550
they also have the ability to then
design the the rules of the game

5004
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:02,560
design the the rules of the game
 

5005
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,790
design the the rules of the game
and uh is it on them to try to

5006
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:04,800
and uh is it on them to try to
 

5007
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,790
and uh is it on them to try to
anticipate what kind of

5008
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:06,800
anticipate what kind of
 

5009
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,550

like to do the thing that poker players

5010
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:08,560
like to do the thing that poker players
 

5011
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,030
like to do the thing that poker players
are doing to run simulation

5012
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
are doing to run simulation
 

5013
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,790
are doing to run simulation
ideally that would have been great if

5014
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:12,800
ideally that would have been great if
 

5015
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,470
ideally that would have been great if

had at least just
 

5023
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,750
had at least just
run a few simulations of how

5024
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
run a few simulations of how
 

5025
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,189
run a few simulations of how
their algorithms would you know

5026
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:23,199
their algorithms would you know
 

5027
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:24,709
their algorithms would you know
different types of algorithms would turn

5028
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
different types of algorithms would turn
 

5029
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,709
different types of algorithms would turn
out for society that would have been

5030
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:26,719
out for society that would have been
 

5031
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:28,709
out for society that would have been
great that's really difficult to do that

5032
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:28,719
great that's really difficult to do that
 

5033
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,390
great that's really difficult to do that
kind of deep philosophical thinking

5034
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:30,400
kind of deep philosophical thinking

about thinking about humanity actually
so not

5038
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:35,760
so not
 

5039
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,310
so not
not kind of this level of how do we

5040
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,320
not kind of this level of how do we
 

5041
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,470
not kind of this level of how do we
optimize engagement

5042
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:40,480
optimize engagement
 

5043
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,229
optimize engagement

into something that
will change society forever that's that

will change society forever that's that
 

5057
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:00,149
will change society forever that's that
requires some deep thinking that's

so on um
it's

5270
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:22,639
it's
 

5271
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,470
it's
technology is not about values neutral

5272
01:25:24,470 --> 01:25:24,480
technology is not about values neutral
 

5273
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,149
technology is not about values neutral
thing people think i used to always

5274

5277
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,149
think this myself it's like this naive
view that oh technology is completely

5278
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
view that oh technology is completely
 

5279
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,310
view that oh technology is completely
neutral it's just it's the humans that

5280
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:32,320
neutral it's just it's the humans that
 

5281
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,030
neutral it's just it's the humans that
either make it good or bad no

5282
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:35,040
either make it good or bad no
 

5283
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,110
either make it good or bad no
to the point we're at now the technology

5284
01:25:37,110 --> 01:25:37,120
to the point we're at now the technology
 

5285
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,709
to the point we're at now the technology
that we are creating they are social

5286
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:38,719
that we are creating they are social
 

5287
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,550
that we are creating they are social
technologies they literally

5288
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:40,560
technologies they literally
 

5289
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,830
technologies they literally
dictate

5290
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:41,840
dictate
 

5291
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,590
dictate
how humans now form social groups and so

5292
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:45,600
how humans now form social groups and so
 

5293
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,030
how humans now form social groups and so
on beyond that and beyond that it also

5294
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:47,040
on beyond that and beyond that it also
 

5295
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,430
on beyond that and beyond that it also
then that gives rise to like the memes

5296
01:25:49,430 --> 01:25:49,440
then that gives rise to like the memes
 

5297
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,830
then that gives rise to like the memes
that we then like coalesce around

5298
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:51,840
that we then like coalesce around
 

5299
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,910
that we then like coalesce around
and that you know if you have the stack

5300
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:53,920
and that you know if you have the stack
 

5301
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,910
and that you know if you have the stack
that way where it's technology driving

5302
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:55,920
that way where it's technology driving
 

5303
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,590
that way where it's technology driving
social interaction which then drives

5304
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:57,600
social interaction which then drives
 

5305
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,870
social interaction which then drives
like mimetic

5306
01:25:58,870 --> 01:25:58,880
like mimetic
 

5307
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:01,430
like mimetic
uh mimetic culture and like

5308
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:01,440
uh mimetic culture and like
 

5309
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,629
uh mimetic culture and like
which ideas become popular that's molok

5310

which ideas become popular that's molok
 

5311
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:06,390
which ideas become popular that's molok
and the we need the other way around we

5312
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:06,400
and the we need the other way around we
 

5313
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,510
and the we need the other way around we
need it so we need to figure out what

5314
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:07,520
need it so we need to figure out what
 

5315
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,430
need it so we need to figure out what
are the good memes what are the good

5316
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:09,440
are the good memes what are the good
 

5317
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,470

um
 

5319
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,750
um
values

5320
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:11,760
values
 

5321
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,629
values
that we think are we we need to optimize

5322
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:14,639
that we think are we we need to optimize
 

5323
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,629
that we think are we we need to optimize
for the like makes people happy and

what the social structure around those
should be and only then do we figure out

01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:24,560
should be and only then do we figure out
 

5333
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,149
should be and only then do we figure out
technology but if we're doing the other

5334
01:26:26,149 --> 01:26:26,159
technology but if we're doing the other
 

5335
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,830
technology but if we're doing the other
way around and

5336
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
way around and
 

5337
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,110
way around and
you know like as much as i love

machine that we have created can you
 

5359
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,350
machine that we have created can you
redesign the machine within the game can

5360
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:53,360
redesign the machine within the game can
 

5361
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,430
redesign the machine within the game can
can you just have

5362
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:55,440
can you just have
 

5363
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,430
can you just have
can you understand the game enough okay

5364
01:26:57,430 --> 01:26:57,440
can you understand the game enough okay
 

5365
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,750
can you understand the game enough okay
this is the game and this is how we

5366
01:26:59,750 --> 01:26:59,760
this is the game and this is how we
 

5367
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,550
this is the game and this is how we
start to re-emphasize the memes that

5368
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:02,560
start to re-emphasize the memes that
 

5369
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,750
start to re-emphasize the memes that
matter

trying to redesign
 

5407
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:40,390
trying to redesign
some aspects of the game within the game

5408
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:40,400
some aspects of the game within the game
 

5409
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,110
some aspects of the game within the game
um is that possible

5410

i don't know
 

5413
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:46,550
i don't know
but i think we should try

5414
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:46,560
but i think we should try
 

5415
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:47,990
but i think we should try
uh i don't think we have an option but

5416
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:48,000
uh i don't think we have an option but
 

5417
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,070
uh i don't think we have an option but
to try well the other option is to

5418
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:50,080
to try well the other option is to
 

5419
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,310
to try well the other option is to
create new companies or to

01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,950
rules of the game i think we need to be
doing all of the above

5428
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:00,960
doing all of the above
 

5429
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,870
doing all of the above
i think we need to be thinking hard

5430
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:02,880
i think we need to be thinking hard
 

5431
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,870
i think we need to be thinking hard
about what are the kind of positive

5432
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:04,880
about what are the kind of positive
 

5433
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,229
about what are the kind of positive
healthy memes

5434
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
healthy memes
 

5435
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,149
healthy memes
um

5436
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,159
um
 

5437
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,110
um
uh

5438
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:09,120
uh
 

5439
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,669
uh
you know as elon said he who controls

5440
01:28:11,669 --> 01:28:11,679
you know as elon said he who controls
 

5441
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,229
you know as elon said he who controls
the memes controls the universe um i

5442
01:28:14,229 --> 01:28:14,239
the memes controls the universe um i
 

5443
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:15,590
the memes controls the universe um i
think he did yeah

5444
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:15,600
think he did yeah
 

5445
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,830
think he did yeah
um but there's truth to that

5446
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:17,840
um but there's truth to that
 

5447
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,350
um but there's truth to that
it's very there is wisdom in that

5448
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:19,360
it's very there is wisdom in that
 

5449
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,510
it's very there is wisdom in that
because

5450
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:21,520
because
 

5451
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,189
because
memes have driven history you know we

5452
01:28:23,189 --> 01:28:23,199
memes have driven history you know we
 

5453
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:24,950
memes have driven history you know we
are we are a cultural species that's

5454
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:24,960
are we are a cultural species that's
 

5455
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,110
are we are a cultural species that's
what sets us apart from chimpanzees and

5456
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:27,120
what sets us apart from chimpanzees and
 

5457
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,990
what sets us apart from chimpanzees and
everything else we have the ability to

5458
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:30,000
everything else we have the ability to
 

5459
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,390
everything else we have the ability to
learn and evolve through culture

5460
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:32,400
learn and evolve through culture
 

5461
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,790
learn and evolve through culture
as opposed to biology or like you know

5462
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:34,800
as opposed to biology or like you know
 

5463
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,270
as opposed to biology or like you know
classic physical constraints

5464
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:37,280
classic physical constraints
 

5465
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,430
classic physical constraints
and that means culture is incredibly

5466
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:39,440
and that means culture is incredibly
 

5467
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,830
and that means culture is incredibly
powerful

5468
01:28:40,830 --> 01:28:40,840
powerful
 

5469
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,910
powerful
and we can create and become victim to

5470
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:43,920
and we can create and become victim to
 

5471
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,629
and we can create and become victim to
very bad memes or very good ones um but

5472
01:28:46,629 --> 01:28:46,639
very bad memes or very good ones um but
 

5473
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,430
very bad memes or very good ones um but
we do have some agency over which means

5474
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:49,440
we do have some agency over which means
 

5475
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,669
we do have some agency over which means
you know we we sub but not only put out

5476
01:28:51,669 --> 01:28:51,679
you know we we sub but not only put out
 

5477
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:54,149
you know we we sub but not only put out
there but we also like subscribe to

5478
01:28:54,149 --> 01:28:54,159
there but we also like subscribe to
 

5479
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:55,590
there but we also like subscribe to
um so i think we need to take that

5480
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:55,600
um so i think we need to take that
 

5481
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,390
um so i think we need to take that
approach

5482
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:56,400
approach
 

5483
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,149
approach
we also need to

5484
01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:58,159
we also need to
 

5485
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,709
we also need to
you know because i don't want the the

5486
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:00,719
you know because i don't want the the
 

5487
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:01,430
you know because i don't want the the
the

5488
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:01,440
the
 

5489
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,629
the
i'm making this video right now are

5490
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:02,639
i'm making this video right now are
 

5491
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,310
i'm making this video right now are
called the attention wars which is about

5492
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:04,320
called the attention wars which is about
 

5493
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,709
called the attention wars which is about
like how molok like the media machine is

5494
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:06,719
like how molok like the media machine is
 

5495
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,270
like how molok like the media machine is
this moloch machine uh well is this is

5496
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:09,280
this moloch machine uh well is this is
 

5497
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,430
this moloch machine uh well is this is
this kind of like blind dumb thing that

5498
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:11,440
this kind of like blind dumb thing that
 

5499
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:12,629
this kind of like blind dumb thing that
where everyone is optimizing for

5500
01:29:12,629 --> 01:29:12,639
where everyone is optimizing for
 

5501
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:13,910
where everyone is optimizing for
engagement in order to win their share

5502
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:13,920
engagement in order to win their share
 

5503
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,790
engagement in order to win their share
of the attention pie um and then if you

5504
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:16,800
of the attention pie um and then if you
 

5505
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,310
of the attention pie um and then if you
zoom out it's really like molok that's

5506
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:18,320
zoom out it's really like molok that's
 

5507
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,430
zoom out it's really like molok that's
pulling the strings because the only

5508
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
pulling the strings because the only
 

5509
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,790
pulling the strings because the only
thing that benefits from this in the end

5510
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:20,800
thing that benefits from this in the end
 

5511
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,390
thing that benefits from this in the end
you know like oh our information

5512
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:22,400
you know like oh our information
 

5513
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,030
you know like oh our information
ecosystem is breaking down like we have

5514
01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:25,040
ecosystem is breaking down like we have
 

5515
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:26,790
ecosystem is breaking down like we have
you look at the state of the us it's in

5516
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:26,800
you look at the state of the us it's in
 

5517
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,709
you look at the state of the us it's in
we're we're in a civil war it's just not

5518
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719
we're we're in a civil war it's just not
 

5519
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,669
we're we're in a civil war it's just not
a physical war it's it's it's a

5520
01:29:31,669 --> 01:29:31,679
a physical war it's it's it's a
 

5521
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,750
a physical war it's it's it's a
it's an information war and people

5522
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:33,760
it's an information war and people
 

5523
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,030
it's an information war and people
people are becoming more fractured in

5524
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
people are becoming more fractured in
 

5525
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,390
people are becoming more fractured in
terms of what their actual shared

5526
01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:36,400
terms of what their actual shared
 

5527
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,950
terms of what their actual shared
reality is like truly like an extreme

5528
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:38,960
reality is like truly like an extreme
 

5529
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,470
reality is like truly like an extreme
left person an extreme right person like

5530
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:40,480
left person an extreme right person like
 

5531
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:41,830
left person an extreme right person like
they

5532
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:41,840
they
 

5533
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,270
they
they literally live in different worlds

5534
01:29:43,270 --> 01:29:43,280
they literally live in different worlds
 

5535
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,870
they literally live in different worlds
in their in their in their minds at this

5536
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:44,880
in their in their in their minds at this
 

5537
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,470
in their in their in their minds at this
point and it's getting more and more

5538
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:46,480
point and it's getting more and more
 

5539
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,189
point and it's getting more and more
amplified and this this force is like a

5540
01:29:49,189 --> 01:29:49,199
amplified and this this force is like a
 

5541
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,350
amplified and this this force is like a
like razor blade pushing through

5542
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:51,360
like razor blade pushing through
 

5543
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:52,229
like razor blade pushing through
everything it doesn't matter how

5544
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:52,239
everything it doesn't matter how
 

5545
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:53,750
everything it doesn't matter how
innocuous the topic is it will find a

5546
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:53,760
innocuous the topic is it will find a
 

5547
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,430
innocuous the topic is it will find a
way to split into this you know

5548
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:55,440
way to split into this you know
 

5549
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,590
way to split into this you know
bifurcated culture war and it's

5550
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:57,600
bifurcated culture war and it's
 

5551
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,270
bifurcated culture war and it's
terrifying because that maximizes the

5552
01:29:59,270 --> 01:29:59,280
terrifying because that maximizes the
 

5553
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,189
terrifying because that maximizes the
tension and that's like an emergent

5554
01:30:01,189 --> 01:30:01,199
tension and that's like an emergent
 

5555
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:05,350
tension and that's like an emergent
moloch type force right that takes any

5556
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:05,360
moloch type force right that takes any
 

5557
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,790
moloch type force right that takes any
any topic

5558
01:30:06,790 --> 01:30:06,800
any topic
 

5559
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:07,510
any topic
and

5560
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:07,520
and
 

5561
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,590
and
cuts through it so they it can split

5562
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:09,600
cuts through it so they it can split
 

5563
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,030
cuts through it so they it can split
nicely

5564
01:30:11,030 --> 01:30:11,040
nicely
 

5565
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:14,310
nicely
into two groups one one that's well it's

5566
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,320
into two groups one one that's well it's
 

5567
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,229
into two groups one one that's well it's
whatever yeah

5568
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:16,239
whatever yeah
 

5569
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,590
whatever yeah
all everyone is trying to do within the

5570
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:17,600
all everyone is trying to do within the
 

5571
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,510
all everyone is trying to do within the
system is just maximize whatever gets

5572
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:19,520
system is just maximize whatever gets
 

5573
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,350
system is just maximize whatever gets
them the most attention because they're

5574
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:21,360
them the most attention because they're
 

5575
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,550
them the most attention because they're
just trying to make money so they can

5576
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:22,560
just trying to make money so they can
 

5577
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,390
just trying to make money so they can
keep their thing going right

5578
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:24,400
keep their thing going right
 

5579
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,229
keep their thing going right
and the way the

5580
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:26,239
and the way the
 

5581
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,790
and the way the
the best emotion for getting attention

5582
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:28,800
the best emotion for getting attention
 

5583
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:29,910
the best emotion for getting attention
in well because it's not just about

5584
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:29,920
in well because it's not just about
 

5585
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:30,950
in well because it's not just about
attention on the internet it's

5586
01:30:30,950 --> 01:30:30,960

01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,669
like talking about my essay there are
studies here that looked into this um

5634
01:31:19,669 --> 01:31:19,679
studies here that looked into this um
 

5635
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:20,790
studies here that looked into this um
where it's like if someone's like

5636

to then be like i don't want to deal
 

5641
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,510
to then be like i don't want to deal
with this so they're less likely to

5642
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:25,520
with this so they're less likely to
 

5643
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,430
with this so they're less likely to
actually engage and share it and so on

5644
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:27,440
actually engage and share it and so on
 

5645
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:28,629
actually engage and share it and so on
they're just gonna be like whereas if

5646
01:31:28,629 --> 01:31:28,639
they're just gonna be like whereas if
 

5647
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:31,430
they're just gonna be like whereas if
they're enraged by a thing well now that

5648
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:31,440
they're enraged by a thing well now that
 

5649
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,590
they're enraged by a thing well now that
like that triggers all the like the the

5650
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:33,600
like that triggers all the like the the
 

5651
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:36,629
like that triggers all the like the the
old tribalism emotions um and so that's

5652
01:31:36,629 --> 01:31:36,639
old tribalism emotions um and so that's
 

5653
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:38,390
old tribalism emotions um and so that's
how then things get sort of spread you

5654
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:38,400
how then things get sort of spread you
 

5655
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,870
how then things get sort of spread you
know much more easily they out compete

5656
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:40,880
know much more easily they out compete
 

5657
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,510
know much more easily they out compete
all the other memes in the ecosystem um

5658
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:43,520
all the other memes in the ecosystem um
 

5659
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,390
all the other memes in the ecosystem um
and so this like

5660
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:46,400
and so this like
 

5661
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,990
and so this like
the attention economy the the wheels

5662
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:48,000
the attention economy the the wheels
 

5663
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,430
the attention economy the the wheels
that make it go around are is rage um i

5664
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,440
that make it go around are is rage um i
 

5665
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,669
that make it go around are is rage um i
did a you know tweet the the the the

5666
01:31:53,669 --> 01:31:53,679
did a you know tweet the the the the
 

5667
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:54,870
did a you know tweet the the the the
problem with raising against the machine

5668
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:54,880
problem with raising against the machine
 

5669
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:56,149
problem with raising against the machine
is that the machine has learned to feed

5670
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:56,159
is that the machine has learned to feed
 

5671
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:58,709
is that the machine has learned to feed
off rage because it is feeding off our

5672
01:31:58,709 --> 01:31:58,719
off rage because it is feeding off our
 

5673
01:31:58,719 --> 01:31:59,910
off rage because it is feeding off our
age that's the thing that's now keeping

5674
01:31:59,910 --> 01:31:59,920
age that's the thing that's now keeping
 

5675
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,590
age that's the thing that's now keeping
it going so the more we get angry the

5676
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:01,600
it going so the more we get angry the
 

5677
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:02,790
it going so the more we get angry the
worse it gets

5678
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:02,800
worse it gets
 

5679
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,910
worse it gets
um so the malloc and this attention

5680
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:05,920
um so the malloc and this attention
 

5681
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,709
um so the malloc and this attention
in in the war of attention is

5682
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:08,719
in in the war of attention is
 

5683
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:12,149
in in the war of attention is

01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,709
happens to be the engagement um
is

5690
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:18,719

absolutely but but also there's certain
 

5883
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,510
absolutely but but also there's certain
aspects of a system as we've learned

5884
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:31,520
aspects of a system as we've learned
 

5885
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:32,870
aspects of a system as we've learned
through history that

5886
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:32,880
through history that
 

5887
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,030
through history that
do better than others like for example

5888
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:35,040
do better than others like for example
 

5889

don't have a dictator so
um like if i were to create this bot

5892
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:38,800
um like if i were to create this bot
 

5893
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:41,510
um like if i were to create this bot
army it's not good for me to have full

5894
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:41,520
army it's not good for me to have full
 

5895
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,830
army it's not good for me to have full
control over it because in the beginning

5896
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
control over it because in the beginning
 

5897
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,350
control over it because in the beginning
i might have a good understanding of

5898
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:45,360
i might have a good understanding of
 

5899
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,669
i might have a good understanding of
what's good and not but over time that

5900
01:35:47,669 --> 01:35:47,679
what's good and not but over time that
 

5901
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:49,510
what's good and not but over time that
starts to get deviated because i'll get

5902
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:49,520
starts to get deviated because i'll get
 

5903
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,430
starts to get deviated because i'll get
annoyed at some and i'll think

5904
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:51,440
annoyed at some and i'll think
 

5905
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,870
annoyed at some and i'll think
okay wouldn't it be nice to get rid of

okay wouldn't it be nice to get rid of
 

5907
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,629
okay wouldn't it be nice to get rid of
those but then that power

5908
01:35:54,629 --> 01:35:54,639
those but then that power
 

5909
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:55,910
those but then that power
starts getting to your head you become

5910
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:55,920
starts getting to your head you become
 

5911
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:58,310
starts getting to your head you become
corrupted that's basic human nature so

5912
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:58,320
corrupted that's basic human nature so
 

5913
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,950
corrupted that's basic human nature so
distribute the powers we need we need a

5914
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:00,960
distribute the powers we need we need a
 

5915
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,229
distribute the powers we need we need a
a love

5916
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:02,239
a love

on a dao

5920
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:05,679
on a dao
 

5921
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,750
on a dao
a dow love botnet

a dow love botnet
 

5923
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,070
a dow love botnet
yeah but and without a leader like

5924
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:10,080
yeah but and without a leader like
 

5925
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,470
yeah but and without a leader like
without exactly distributed right yeah

5926
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:12,480
without exactly distributed right yeah
 

5927
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:14,470
without exactly distributed right yeah
without any kind of centralized yeah

5928
01:36:14,470 --> 01:36:14,480
without any kind of centralized yeah
 

5929
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,709
without any kind of centralized yeah
without even you know basically is the

5930
01:36:16,709 --> 01:36:16,719
without even you know basically is the
 

5931
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,070
without even you know basically is the
more control the more you can

5932
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,080
more control the more you can
 

5933
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,950
more control the more you can
decentralize the control of a thing

5934
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:20,960
decentralize the control of a thing
 

5935
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:23,350
decentralize the control of a thing
uh to people

5936
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:23,360
uh to people
 

5937
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,350
uh to people
you know but the the they don't need the

5938
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:25,360
you know but the the they don't need the
 

5939
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:27,590
you know but the the they don't need the
ability to coordinate because that's the

5940
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:27,600
ability to coordinate because that's the
 

5941
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,430
ability to coordinate because that's the
issue when you if something is too you

5942
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:29,440
issue when you if something is too you
 

5943
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,110
issue when you if something is too you
know that's really to me like the

5944
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:31,120
know that's really to me like the
 

5945
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,310
know that's really to me like the
culture wars is

5946
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:32,320
culture wars is
 

5947
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,750
culture wars is
the bigger war we're dealing with is

5948
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:33,760
the bigger war we're dealing with is
 

5949
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,510
the bigger war we're dealing with is
actually between

5950
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
actually between
 

5951
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:38,470
actually between
the like the sort of i don't know what

5952
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:38,480
the like the sort of i don't know what
 

5953
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,750
the like the sort of i don't know what
even the term is for it but like

5954
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:39,760
even the term is for it but like
 

5955
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,910
even the term is for it but like
centralization versus decentralization

5956
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:41,920
centralization versus decentralization
 

5957
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,990
centralization versus decentralization
that's the tension we're seeing

5958
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:44,000
that's the tension we're seeing
 

5959
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,550
that's the tension we're seeing
power in control by a few versus

5960
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:46,560
power in control by a few versus
 

5961
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,270
power in control by a few versus
completely distributed and the trouble

5962
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:49,280
completely distributed and the trouble
 

5963
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,629
completely distributed and the trouble
is if you have a fully centralized thing

5964
01:36:50,629 --> 01:36:50,639
is if you have a fully centralized thing
 

5965
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,550
is if you have a fully centralized thing
then you're at risk of tyranny you know

5966
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:52,560
then you're at risk of tyranny you know
 

5967
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,109
then you're at risk of tyranny you know
stalin type things can happen uh or

5968
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:55,119
stalin type things can happen uh or
 

5969
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:57,030
stalin type things can happen uh or
completely distributed uh now you're at

5970
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:57,040
completely distributed uh now you're at
 

5971
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,470
completely distributed uh now you're at
risk of complete anarchy and chaos where

5972
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:58,480
risk of complete anarchy and chaos where
 

5973
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:00,709
risk of complete anarchy and chaos where
you can't even coordinate to like on you

5974
01:37:00,709 --> 01:37:00,719
you can't even coordinate to like on you
 

5975
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:02,470
you can't even coordinate to like on you
know when there's like a pandemic or

5976
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:02,480
know when there's like a pandemic or
 

5977
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:04,229
know when there's like a pandemic or
anything like that so it's like what is

5978
01:37:04,229 --> 01:37:04,239
anything like that so it's like what is
 

5979
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,070
anything like that so it's like what is
the right balance to strike between

5980
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:06,080
the right balance to strike between
 

5981
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,109
the right balance to strike between
these two

5982
01:37:07,109 --> 01:37:07,119
these two
 

5983
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:09,270
these two
well structures can't molec really take

5984
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:09,280
well structures can't molec really take
 

5985
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,870
well structures can't molec really take
hold in a fully decentralized system

5986
01:37:10,870 --> 01:37:10,880
hold in a fully decentralized system
 

5987
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,870
hold in a fully decentralized system
that's the one of the dangers too yes

5988
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:12,880
that's the one of the dangers too yes
 

5989
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:15,750
that's the one of the dangers too yes
the the very vulnerable so the dictator

5990
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:15,760
the the very vulnerable so the dictator
 

5991
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,070
the the very vulnerable so the dictator
can commit huge atrocities but they can

5992
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:18,080
can commit huge atrocities but they can
 

5993
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,470
can commit huge atrocities but they can
also make sure the the infrastructure

5994
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:20,480
also make sure the the infrastructure
 

5995
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,510
also make sure the the infrastructure
works and

5996
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:21,520
works and
 

5997
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,030
works and
uh

5998
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:23,040
uh
 

5999
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,709
uh
they have that god's eye view at least

6000
01:37:24,709 --> 01:37:24,719
they have that god's eye view at least
 

6001
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:26,310
they have that god's eye view at least
they have the ability to create like

6002
01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:26,320
they have the ability to create like
 

6003
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,470
they have the ability to create like
laws and rules that like force

6004
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:28,480
laws and rules that like force
 

6005
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:31,590
laws and rules that like force
coordination which stops moloch but then

6006
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:31,600
coordination which stops moloch but then
 

6007
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,109
coordination which stops moloch but then
you're vulnerable to that dictator

6008
01:37:33,109 --> 01:37:33,119
you're vulnerable to that dictator
 

6009
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:34,870
you're vulnerable to that dictator
getting infected with like this with

6010
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:34,880
getting infected with like this with
 

6011
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,790
getting infected with like this with
some kind of psychopathy type thing

6012
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:36,800
some kind of psychopathy type thing

what's uh what's your verse malloc

6014
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:39,440
what's uh what's your verse malloc
 

6015
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,550
what's uh what's your verse malloc
sorry great question so

6016
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:42,560
sorry great question so
 

6017
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,950
sorry great question so
that's where

6018
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:44,960
that's where
 

6019
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,229
that's where
i've been working on this series it's

6020
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:46,239
i've been working on this series it's
 

6021
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:47,430
i've been working on this series it's
been driving me insane for the last year

6022
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:47,440
been driving me insane for the last year
 

6023
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,590
been driving me insane for the last year
and a half uh i did the first one a year

6024
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:49,600
and a half uh i did the first one a year
 

6025
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,790
and a half uh i did the first one a year
ago i can't believe it's nearly been a

6026
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,800
ago i can't believe it's nearly been a
 

6027
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,030
ago i can't believe it's nearly been a
year uh the second one hopefully will be

6028
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:53,040
year uh the second one hopefully will be
 

6029
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:55,990
year uh the second one hopefully will be
coming out in like a month um

6030
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:56,000
coming out in like a month um
 

6031
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,750
coming out in like a month um
and my goal at the end of the series is

6032
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:57,760
and my goal at the end of the series is
 

6033
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,189
and my goal at the end of the series is
to like present because basically i'm

6034
01:37:59,189 --> 01:37:59,199
to like present because basically i'm
 

6035
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:00,550
to like present because basically i'm
painting the picture of like what molok

6036
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
painting the picture of like what molok
 

6037
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,550
painting the picture of like what molok
is and how it's affecting almost all

6038
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:02,560
is and how it's affecting almost all
 

6039
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,310
is and how it's affecting almost all
these issues in our in our society and

6040
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:04,320
these issues in our in our society and
 

6041
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,709
these issues in our in our society and
how it's you know driving it's like kind

6042
01:38:06,709 --> 01:38:06,719
how it's you know driving it's like kind
 

6043
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:08,149
how it's you know driving it's like kind
of the generator function as people

6044
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:08,159
of the generator function as people
 

6045
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,870
of the generator function as people
describe it of existential risk

6046
01:38:10,870 --> 01:38:10,880
describe it of existential risk
 

6047
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,390
describe it of existential risk
and then at the end wait wait the

6048
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:12,400
and then at the end wait wait the
 

6049
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,070
and then at the end wait wait the
generator function of existential risk

6050
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:14,080
generator function of existential risk
 

6051
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:15,990
generator function of existential risk
so you're saying molok is sort of the

6052
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
so you're saying molok is sort of the
 

6053
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,750
so you're saying molok is sort of the
engine that creates

6054
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:17,760
engine that creates
 

6055
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,149
engine that creates
a bunch a bunch of x-risks yes not all

6056
01:38:20,149 --> 01:38:20,159
a bunch a bunch of x-risks yes not all
 

6057
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:22,790
a bunch a bunch of x-risks yes not all
of them like like a uh you know a um

6058
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:22,800
of them like like a uh you know a um
 

6059
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,390
of them like like a uh you know a um
it's a cool phrase generator function

6060
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:24,400
it's a cool phrase generator function
 

6061
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:25,590
it's a cool phrase generator function
it's not my phrase it's daniel

6062
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:25,600
it's not my phrase it's daniel
 

6063
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:27,990
it's not my phrase it's daniel
schmacktenberger oh i got that from him

01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:10,480
but
 

6109
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,510
but
yeah so

yeah so
 

6111
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,870
yeah so
if molok is this like generator function

6112
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:14,880
if molok is this like generator function
 

6113
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,790
if molok is this like generator function
that's driving all of these issues over

6114
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:16,800
that's driving all of these issues over
 

6115
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,149
that's driving all of these issues over
the coming century that might wipe us

6116
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:18,159
the coming century that might wipe us
 

6117
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:18,870
the coming century that might wipe us
out

6118
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:18,880
out
 

6119
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,510
out
what's the inverse and so far what i've

6120
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:21,520
what's the inverse and so far what i've
 

6121
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,189
what's the inverse and so far what i've
gotten to is

6122
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:23,199
gotten to is
 

6123
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:24,629
gotten to is
this character that i want to put out

6124
01:39:24,629 --> 01:39:24,639
this character that i want to put out
 

6125
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:26,470
this character that i want to put out
there called win-win

6126
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,480
there called win-win
 

6127
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,070
there called win-win
because monica's the god of lose-lose

6128
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,080
because monica's the god of lose-lose
 

6129
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,669
because monica's the god of lose-lose
ultimately it masquerades as the god of

6130
01:39:29,669 --> 01:39:29,679
ultimately it masquerades as the god of
 

6131
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:31,669
ultimately it masquerades as the god of
win-lose but in reality it's lose-lose

6132
01:39:31,669 --> 01:39:31,679
win-lose but in reality it's lose-lose
 

6133
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,229
win-lose but in reality it's lose-lose
everyone ends up worse off

6134
01:39:34,229 --> 01:39:34,239
everyone ends up worse off
 

6135
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:35,270
everyone ends up worse off
so i was like well what's the opposite

6136
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:35,280
so i was like well what's the opposite
 

6137
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,030
so i was like well what's the opposite
of that it's win-win and i was thinking

6138
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:37,040
of that it's win-win and i was thinking
 

6139
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,310
of that it's win-win and i was thinking
for ages like what's a good name for

6140
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,320
for ages like what's a good name for
 

6141
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,590
for ages like what's a good name for
this character

6142
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:39,600
this character
 

6143
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,149
this character
and then the more i was like okay well

6144
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:42,159
and then the more i was like okay well
 

6145
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:44,149
and then the more i was like okay well
don't try and you know think through it

6146
01:39:44,149 --> 01:39:44,159
don't try and you know think through it
 

6147
01:39:44,159 --> 01:39:46,550
don't try and you know think through it
logically what's the vibe of win-win and

6148
01:39:46,550 --> 01:39:46,560
logically what's the vibe of win-win and
 

6149
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,030
logically what's the vibe of win-win and
to me like in my mind molok is like

6150
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,040
to me like in my mind molok is like
 

6151
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:51,109
to me like in my mind molok is like
and i dress as it in the video like it's

6152

these negative externalities and we've
 

6289
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,430
these negative externalities and we've
completely lost control of it um you

6290
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:13,440
completely lost control of it um you
 

6291

we would be we'll be in a more
interesting universe if we have one that

6306
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:27,360
interesting universe if we have one that
 

6307
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,790
interesting universe if we have one that
has both

6308

01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
it would be nice to just try to discuss
 

6381
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,109
it would be nice to just try to discuss
what kind of thing we would like to

6382
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:47,119
what kind of thing we would like to
 

6383
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,189
what kind of thing we would like to
converge towards

6384
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:49,199
converge towards
 

6385
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:50,390
converge towards
in our

6386
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
in our
 

6387
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:55,830
in our
understanding of what is beautiful

6388
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:55,840

 

6389
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:59,189

so to me i think something is beautiful

6390
01:43:59,189 --> 01:43:59,199
so to me i think something is beautiful
 

6391
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:00,950
so to me i think something is beautiful
when

6392
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:00,960
when
 

6393
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:05,510
when
it can't be reduced down to

6394
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:05,520
it can't be reduced down to
 

6395
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:09,350
it can't be reduced down to
easy metrics like if you think of a tree

6396
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:09,360
easy metrics like if you think of a tree
 

6397
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:10,950
easy metrics like if you think of a tree
what is it about a tree like a big

6398
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:10,960
what is it about a tree like a big
 

6399
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,550
what is it about a tree like a big
ancient beautiful tree right what is it

6400
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:12,560
ancient beautiful tree right what is it
 

6401
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,790
ancient beautiful tree right what is it
about it that we find so beautiful it's

6402
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:14,800
about it that we find so beautiful it's
 

6403
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,109
about it that we find so beautiful it's
not you know the

6404
01:44:17,109 --> 01:44:17,119
not you know the
 

6405
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:19,189
not you know the
the you know what the sweetness of its

6406
01:44:19,189 --> 01:44:19,199
the you know what the sweetness of its
 

6407
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:20,470
the you know what the sweetness of its
fruit

6408
01:44:20,470 --> 01:44:20,480
fruit
 

6409
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:23,350
fruit
or the value of its lumber

6410
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:23,360
or the value of its lumber
 

6411
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,109
or the value of its lumber
it's

6412
01:44:25,109 --> 01:44:25,119
it's
 

6413
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:27,669
it's
it's this entirety of it

6414
01:44:27,669 --> 01:44:27,679
it's this entirety of it
 

6415
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:30,070
it's this entirety of it
that is that there's these immeasurable

6416
01:44:30,070 --> 01:44:30,080
that is that there's these immeasurable
 

6417
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,149
that is that there's these immeasurable
qualities it's like almost like a qualia

6418
01:44:32,149 --> 01:44:32,159
qualities it's like almost like a qualia
 

6419
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:33,189
qualities it's like almost like a qualia
of it

6420
01:44:33,189 --> 01:44:33,199
of it
 

6421
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:36,070
of it
um that's both like it walks this fine

6422
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:36,080
um that's both like it walks this fine
 

6423
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,910
um that's both like it walks this fine
line between pattern well it's got lots

6424
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:37,920
line between pattern well it's got lots
 

6425
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,430
line between pattern well it's got lots
of patronicity but it's not overly

6426
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:39,440
of patronicity but it's not overly
 

6427
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:40,550
of patronicity but it's not overly
predictable

6428
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:40,560
predictable
 

6429
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,830
predictable
um you know again it walks this fine

6430
01:44:41,830 --> 01:44:41,840
um you know again it walks this fine
 

6431
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:43,510
um you know again it walks this fine
line between order and chaos it's a very

6432
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:43,520
line between order and chaos it's a very
 

6433
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,830
line between order and chaos it's a very
highly complex system

6434
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:45,840
highly complex system
 

6435
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:46,790
highly complex system
um

6436
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
um
 

6437
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,629
um
in the

6438
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:48,639
in the
 

6439
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,629
in the

you know you can't it's evolving over
 

6441
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:52,390
you know you can't it's evolving over
time you know that the definition of a

6442
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,400
time you know that the definition of a
 

6443
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,669
time you know that the definition of a
complex versus and this is another

smackdom burger thing you know a complex

6446
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:55,360
smackdom burger thing you know a complex
 

6447
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,590
smackdom burger thing you know a complex
versus a complicated system a

6448
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:57,600
versus a complicated system a
 

6449
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,430
versus a complicated system a
complicated system can be sort of broken

6450
01:44:59,430 --> 01:44:59,440
complicated system can be sort of broken
 

6451
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,270
complicated system can be sort of broken
down into bits understood and then put

6452
01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:01,280
down into bits understood and then put
 

6453
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,590
down into bits understood and then put
back together a complex system it's kind

6454
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:03,600
back together a complex system it's kind
 

6455
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,510
back together a complex system it's kind
of like a black box it does all this

6456
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:05,520
of like a black box it does all this
 

6457
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:06,790
of like a black box it does all this
crazy stuff

6458
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:06,800
crazy stuff
 

6459
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,390
crazy stuff
but if you take it apart you can't put

6460
01:45:08,390 --> 01:45:08,400
but if you take it apart you can't put
 

6461
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:09,590
but if you take it apart you can't put
it back together again because it's

6462
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:09,600
it back together again because it's
 

6463
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,669
it back together again because it's
there's there's all these intricacies

6464
01:45:11,669 --> 01:45:11,679
there's there's all these intricacies
 

6465
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,669
there's there's all these intricacies
and also very importantly like there's

6466
01:45:13,669 --> 01:45:13,679
and also very importantly like there's
 

6467
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:15,510
and also very importantly like there's
some of the parts sorry the sum of the

6468
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:15,520
some of the parts sorry the sum of the
 

6469
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,870
some of the parts sorry the sum of the
whole is much greater than the sum of

6470
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:16,880
whole is much greater than the sum of
 

6471
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:17,830
whole is much greater than the sum of
the parts

6472
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:17,840
the parts
 

6473
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:21,189
the parts
and that's where the beauty lies i think

6474
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:21,199
and that's where the beauty lies i think
 

6475
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:22,629
and that's where the beauty lies i think
and i think that extends to things like

6476
01:45:22,629 --> 01:45:22,639
and i think that extends to things like
 

6477
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:24,870
and i think that extends to things like
art as well like

6478
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:24,880
art as well like
 

6479
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,070
art as well like
there's something there's something

6480
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:26,080
there's something there's something
 

6481
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,910
there's something there's something
immeasurable about it there's something

6482
01:45:27,910 --> 01:45:27,920
immeasurable about it there's something
 

6483
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,830
immeasurable about it there's something
we can't break down to a narrow metric

6484
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:29,840
we can't break down to a narrow metric
 

6485
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:31,750
we can't break down to a narrow metric
does that extend to humans you think

6486
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:31,760
does that extend to humans you think
 

6487
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:32,629
does that extend to humans you think
yeah

6488
01:45:32,629 --> 01:45:32,639
yeah

so how can instagram reveal that kind of
 

6493
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:39,189
so how can instagram reveal that kind of
beauty the complexity of a human being

6494

6540
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:23,600
need to like figure out what your thing
 

6541
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,830
need to like figure out what your thing
is you know you need to narrow down what

6542
01:46:25,830 --> 01:46:25,840
is you know you need to narrow down what
 

6543
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:27,910
is you know you need to narrow down what
your thing is and then just follow that

6544
01:46:27,910 --> 01:46:27,920
your thing is and then just follow that
 

6545
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,870
your thing is and then just follow that
have like a sort of a formula

6546
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:30,880
have like a sort of a formula
 

6547
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,149
have like a sort of a formula
because that's what people want they

6548
01:46:32,149 --> 01:46:32,159
because that's what people want they
 

6549
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,189
because that's what people want they
want to know that they're coming back to

6550
01:46:33,189 --> 01:46:33,199
want to know that they're coming back to
 

6551
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:35,350
want to know that they're coming back to
the same thing and that's the advice on

6552
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:35,360
the same thing and that's the advice on
 

6553
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:38,470
the same thing and that's the advice on
youtube twitter you name it and that's

6554
01:46:38,470 --> 01:46:38,480
youtube twitter you name it and that's
 

6555
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,149
youtube twitter you name it and that's
why and and the trouble with that is

6556
01:46:40,149 --> 01:46:40,159
why and and the trouble with that is
 

6557
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:42,229
why and and the trouble with that is
that it's it's a complexity reduction

6558
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:42,239
that it's it's a complexity reduction
 

6559
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:43,910
that it's it's a complexity reduction
and generally speaking complex you know

6560
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:43,920
and generally speaking complex you know
 

6561
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,590
and generally speaking complex you know
complexity reduction is bad it's making

6562
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:45,600
complexity reduction is bad it's making
 

6563
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,830
complexity reduction is bad it's making
things more it's an oversimplification

6564
01:46:47,830 --> 01:46:47,840
things more it's an oversimplification
 

6565
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:49,590
things more it's an oversimplification
not that simplification is always a bad

6566
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:49,600
not that simplification is always a bad
 

6567
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:51,189
not that simplification is always a bad
thing um

6568
01:46:51,189 --> 01:46:51,199
thing um
 

6569
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:54,790
thing um
but when you're trying to

6570
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:54,800
but when you're trying to
 

6571
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,390
but when you're trying to
take you know what is social media doing

6572
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:56,400
take you know what is social media doing
 

6573
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,470
take you know what is social media doing
is trying to like encapsulate the the

6574
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:58,480
is trying to like encapsulate the the
 

6575
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,030
is trying to like encapsulate the the
human experience and put it into digital

6576
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:01,040
human experience and put it into digital
 

6577
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,709
human experience and put it into digital
form and and commodify it to an extent

6578
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:04,719
form and and commodify it to an extent
 

6579
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:06,870
form and and commodify it to an extent
that you so you do that you compress

6580
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:06,880
that you so you do that you compress
 

6581
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,390
that you so you do that you compress
people down into these like narrow

6582
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:08,400
people down into these like narrow
 

6583
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:09,350
people down into these like narrow
things

6584
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:09,360
things
 

6585
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,669
things
and i that's why i think it's it's kind

6586
01:47:11,669 --> 01:47:11,679
and i that's why i think it's it's kind
 

6587
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:13,750
and i that's why i think it's it's kind
of ultimately fundamentally incompatible

6588
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:13,760
of ultimately fundamentally incompatible
 

6589
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,430
of ultimately fundamentally incompatible
with at least my definition of beauty

6590
01:47:15,430 --> 01:47:15,440
with at least my definition of beauty
 

6591
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,950
with at least my definition of beauty
it's interesting because

6592
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:16,960
it's interesting because
 

6593
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,870
it's interesting because
there is some sense in which

6594
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:20,880

 

6595
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:23,030

a simplification sort of in the in the

6596
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:23,040
a simplification sort of in the in the
 

6597
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,109
a simplification sort of in the in the
einstein kind of sense

6598
01:47:25,109 --> 01:47:25,119
einstein kind of sense
 

6599
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:27,910
einstein kind of sense
of a really complex idea

6600
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:27,920
of a really complex idea
 

6601
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,669
of a really complex idea
a simplification in a way that still

6602
01:47:29,669 --> 01:47:29,679
a simplification in a way that still
 

6603
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:31,430
a simplification in a way that still
captures some core

6604
01:47:31,430 --> 01:47:31,440
captures some core
 

6605
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,830
captures some core
power of an idea of a person

6606
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:33,840
power of an idea of a person
 

6607
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:34,830
power of an idea of a person
is also

6608
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:34,840
is also
 

6609
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,669
is also
beautiful and so maybe it's possible for

6610
01:47:37,669 --> 01:47:37,679
beautiful and so maybe it's possible for
 

6611
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,709
beautiful and so maybe it's possible for
social media to do that a presentation

6612
01:47:40,709 --> 01:47:40,719
social media to do that a presentation
 

6613
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:44,950
social media to do that a presentation
a sort of a slither a sl a slice a look

6614
01:47:44,950 --> 01:47:44,960
a sort of a slither a sl a slice a look
 

6615
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,350
a sort of a slither a sl a slice a look
into a person's life

6616
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:47,360
into a person's life
 

6617
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:50,390
into a person's life
that reveals something real about them

6618
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:50,400
that reveals something real about them
 

6619
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,629
that reveals something real about them
but in a simple way in a way that can be

6620
01:47:52,629 --> 01:47:52,639
but in a simple way in a way that can be
 

6621
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:55,510
but in a simple way in a way that can be
displayed graphically or through words

6622

displayed graphically or through words
 

6623
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,030
displayed graphically or through words
some way i mean

6624
01:47:57,030 --> 01:47:57,040
some way i mean
 

6625
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,430
some way i mean
in some way twitter can do that kind of

6626
01:47:59,430 --> 01:47:59,440
in some way twitter can do that kind of
 

6627
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:02,950
in some way twitter can do that kind of
thing a very few set of words can reveal

6628
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:02,960
thing a very few set of words can reveal
 

6629
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:04,870
thing a very few set of words can reveal
the intricacies of a person

the intricacies of a person
of course

of course

people often don't read tweets in the
 

6645
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,070
people often don't read tweets in the
context of the human being that wrote

with
 

6657
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,990
with
all that context is forgotten and people

all that context is forgotten and people
 

6659
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,709
all that context is forgotten and people
just see the different words so that can

6660
01:48:34,709 --> 01:48:34,719
just see the different words so that can
 

6661
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:36,950
just see the different words so that can
lead to trouble but in in a certain

6662
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:36,960
lead to trouble but in in a certain
 

6663
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:39,750
lead to trouble but in in a certain
sense if you do take it in context

6664
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:39,760
sense if you do take it in context
 

6665
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,310
sense if you do take it in context
it reveals some kind of quirky little

6666
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:42,320
it reveals some kind of quirky little
 

6667
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:45,590
it reveals some kind of quirky little
beautiful idea or a profound little idea

6668

beautiful idea or a profound little idea
 

6669
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:47,430
beautiful idea or a profound little idea
from that particular person that shows

01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:47,440
from that particular person that shows
 

6671
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,030
from that particular person that shows
something about that person so in that

6672

something about that person so in that
 

6673
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:51,510
something about that person so in that
sense twitter can be more successful if

6674
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,520
sense twitter can be more successful if
 

6675
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,709
sense twitter can be more successful if
we talk about molex is driving a better

6676
01:48:54,709 --> 01:48:54,719
we talk about molex is driving a better
 

6677
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:56,870
we talk about molex is driving a better
kind of incentive

6678
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:56,880
kind of incentive
 

6679
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:59,430
kind of incentive
yeah i mean how they can

6680
01:48:59,430 --> 01:48:59,440
yeah i mean how they can
 

6681
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,390
yeah i mean how they can
like if if we were to rewrite it is

6682
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:02,400
like if if we were to rewrite it is
 

6683
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,390
like if if we were to rewrite it is
there a way to rewrite the twitter

6684
01:49:04,390 --> 01:49:04,400
there a way to rewrite the twitter
 

6685
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:07,990
there a way to rewrite the twitter
algorithm so that it stops being

6686
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,000
algorithm so that it stops being
 

6687
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,149
algorithm so that it stops being
the like

6688
01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:10,159
the like
 

6689
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:11,669
the like
the fertile breeding ground of the

6690
01:49:11,669 --> 01:49:11,679
the fertile breeding ground of the
 

6691
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:13,189
the fertile breeding ground of the
culture wars because that's really what

6692
01:49:13,189 --> 01:49:13,199
culture wars because that's really what
 

6693
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:14,470
culture wars because that's really what
it is it's

6694
01:49:14,470 --> 01:49:14,480
it is it's
 

6695
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,990
it is it's
um i mean

6696
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:16,000
um i mean
 

6697
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:17,830
um i mean
maybe i'm giving it you know twitter too

6698
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:17,840
maybe i'm giving it you know twitter too
 

6699
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,149
maybe i'm giving it you know twitter too
much power you know power but

twitter is where you have this amalgam

6710
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:32,159
twitter is where you have this amalgam
 

6711
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:33,990
twitter is where you have this amalgam

6712
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:34,000
of human culture
 

6713
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,590
of human culture
and then this terribly designed

6714
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:35,600
and then this terribly designed
 

6715
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,830
and then this terribly designed
algorithm that amplifies the craziest

6716
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:37,840
algorithm that amplifies the craziest
 

6717
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,750
algorithm that amplifies the craziest
people um

6718
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:39,760
people um
 

6719
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:43,270
people um
and the the angriest the angriest most

6720
01:49:43,270 --> 01:49:43,280
and the the angriest the angriest most
 

6721
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:45,510
and the the angriest the angriest most
divisive takes and amplifies them and

6722
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:45,520
divisive takes and amplifies them and
 

6723
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,669
divisive takes and amplifies them and
then the media the mainstream media

6724
01:49:47,669 --> 01:49:47,679
then the media the mainstream media
 

6725
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:48,950
then the media the mainstream media
because all the journalists are also on

6726
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:48,960
because all the journalists are also on
 

6727
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,870
because all the journalists are also on
twitter they then

6728
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:50,880
twitter they then
 

6729
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,830
twitter they then
are informed by that and so they draw

6730
01:49:53,830 --> 01:49:53,840
are informed by that and so they draw
 

6731
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,430
are informed by that and so they draw
out the stories they can from this

6732
01:49:55,430 --> 01:49:55,440
out the stories they can from this
 

6733
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:56,629
out the stories they can from this
already like

6734
01:49:56,629 --> 01:49:56,639

very boiling lava of of of
 

6737
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,990
very boiling lava of of of

6738
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:02,000
rage and then spread that
 

6739
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,669

you know to their millions and millions

6740
01:50:03,669 --> 01:50:03,679
you know to their millions and millions
 

6741
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:06,950
you know to their millions and millions
of people who aren't even on twitter um

6742
01:50:06,950 --> 01:50:06,960
of people who aren't even on twitter um
 

6743
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,470
of people who aren't even on twitter um
and so

6744
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:08,480
and so
 

6745
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,390
and so
i honestly i think if i could press a

6746
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:10,400
i honestly i think if i could press a
 

6747
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,790
i honestly i think if i could press a
button and turn them off i probably

6748
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:12,800
button and turn them off i probably
 

6749
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,149
button and turn them off i probably
would at this point because i just don't

6750
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:14,159
would at this point because i just don't
 

6751
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:16,709
would at this point because i just don't
see a way of being compatible with

01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:16,719
see a way of being compatible with
 

6753
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:18,709
see a way of being compatible with
healthiness but that's not gonna happen

6754
01:50:18,709 --> 01:50:18,719
healthiness but that's not gonna happen
 

6755
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:19,590
healthiness but that's not gonna happen
um

6756
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:19,600
um
 

6757
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:20,709
um
and

6758
01:50:20,709 --> 01:50:20,719
and
 

6759
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:22,790
and
so at least one way to like stem the

6760
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:22,800
so at least one way to like stem the
 

6761
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,030
so at least one way to like stem the
tide and make it less molecule would be

6762
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:25,040
tide and make it less molecule would be
 

6763
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,070
tide and make it less molecule would be
to

01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:27,750

at least if like it was on a

01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,629
at least if like it was on a
subscription model then it's now not

6772
01:50:32,629 --> 01:50:32,639

6773
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:34,790

6778
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:37,600
impressions because basically what it
 

6779
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:39,030

as often as possible that's how they get
paid right um every time an ad gets

6784
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:42,960
paid right um every time an ad gets
 

6785
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,310
paid right um every time an ad gets
shown to someone and the way is to get

6786
01:50:44,310 --> 01:50:44,320
shown to someone and the way is to get
 

6787
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,310

people constantly refreshing their feed

6788

people constantly refreshing their feed
 

6789
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,229
people constantly refreshing their feed
so you're trying to encourage addictive

6790
01:50:48,229 --> 01:50:48,239
so you're trying to encourage addictive
 

6791
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:51,510
so you're trying to encourage addictive
behaviors whereas if someone um

6792
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:51,520
behaviors whereas if someone um
 

6793
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:52,790
behaviors whereas if someone um
if they moved on to at least a

6794
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:52,800
if they moved on to at least a
 

6795
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,590
if they moved on to at least a
subscription model then

6796
01:50:55,590 --> 01:50:55,600
subscription model then
 

6797
01:50:55,600 --> 01:50:56,790
subscription model then
they're getting the money either way

6798
01:50:56,790 --> 01:50:56,800
they're getting the money either way
 

6799
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:58,310
they're getting the money either way
whether someone comes back to the site

6800
01:50:58,310 --> 01:50:58,320
whether someone comes back to the site
 

6801
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,950
whether someone comes back to the site
once a month or 500 times a month they

6802
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:00,960
once a month or 500 times a month they
 

6803
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:02,790
once a month or 500 times a month they
get the same amount of money so now that

6804
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:02,800
get the same amount of money so now that
 

6805
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,950
get the same amount of money so now that
takes away that incentive you know to

6806
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:04,960
takes away that incentive you know to
 

6807
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,629
takes away that incentive you know to
use technology you know

6808
01:51:06,629 --> 01:51:06,639
use technology you know
 

6809
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:08,310
use technology you know
to build to design an algorithm that is

6810
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:08,320
to build to design an algorithm that is
 

6811
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:09,910
to build to design an algorithm that is
maximally addictive

6812
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:09,920
maximally addictive
 

6813
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:12,310
maximally addictive
um that would be one way for example

6814
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:12,320
um that would be one way for example
 

6815
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,950
um that would be one way for example
yeah but you still want people to

6816
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:14,960
yeah but you still want people to
 

6817
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,870
yeah but you still want people to
yeah i just feel like that just slows

6818
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:16,880
yeah i just feel like that just slows
 

6819
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:18,870
yeah i just feel like that just slows
down creates friction

6820
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:18,880
down creates friction
 

6821
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,189
down creates friction
in the virality of things but that's

6822
01:51:21,189 --> 01:51:21,199
in the virality of things but that's
 

6823
01:51:21,199 --> 01:51:22,070
in the virality of things but that's
good

6824
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,080
good
 

6825
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,310
good
we need to slow down

6826
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:24,320
we need to slow down
 

6827
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,470
we need to slow down
good it's one way

6828
01:51:26,470 --> 01:51:26,480
good it's one way
 

6829
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,070
good it's one way
variety is monarch

6830
01:51:28,070 --> 01:51:28,080
variety is monarch
 

6831
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:30,229

to be clear

6832
01:51:30,229 --> 01:51:30,239
to be clear
 

6833
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,550
to be clear
so molec

6834
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:32,560
so molec
 

6835
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,350
so molec
is always negative then yes

6836
01:51:35,350 --> 01:51:35,360
is always negative then yes
 

6837
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:37,430
is always negative then yes
by definition yes

6838
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:37,440
by definition yes
 

6839
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:38,709
by definition yes
but then i disagree with you it's not

6840
01:51:38,709 --> 01:51:38,719
but then i disagree with you it's not
 

6841
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:40,550
but then i disagree with you it's not
always negative competition is neutral i

6842
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:40,560
always negative competition is neutral i
 

6843
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,470
always negative competition is neutral i
disagree with you that all virality is

6844
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:42,480
disagree with you that all virality is
 

6845
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:45,830
disagree with you that all virality is
negative then uh as molok then

6846
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:45,840
negative then uh as molok then
 

6847
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,109
negative then uh as molok then
because

6848
01:51:47,109 --> 01:51:47,119
because
 

6849
01:51:47,119 --> 01:51:49,589
because
i i it's a good intuition because we

6850
01:51:49,589 --> 01:51:49,599
i i it's a good intuition because we
 

6851
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:51,350
i i it's a good intuition because we
have a lot of data on virality being

6852
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:51,360
have a lot of data on virality being
 

6853
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:52,870
have a lot of data on virality being
negative

6854
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:52,880
negative
 

6855
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,229
negative
but i happen to believe that the core of

6856
01:51:56,229 --> 01:51:56,239
but i happen to believe that the core of
 

6857
01:51:56,239 --> 01:51:58,629
but i happen to believe that the core of
human beings so most human beings want

6858
01:51:58,629 --> 01:51:58,639
human beings so most human beings want
 

6859
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:00,390
human beings so most human beings want
to be good

6860
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:00,400
to be good
 

6861
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,629
to be good
more than they want to be bad to each

6862
01:52:02,629 --> 01:52:02,639
more than they want to be bad to each
 

6863
01:52:02,639 --> 01:52:04,390
more than they want to be bad to each
other and so

6864
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:04,400
other and so
 

6865
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,149
other and so
i think it's possible it might be just

6866
01:52:06,149 --> 01:52:06,159
i think it's possible it might be just
 

6867
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:08,470
i think it's possible it might be just
harder to engineer

6868
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:08,480
harder to engineer
 

6869
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:10,709
harder to engineer
systems that enable virality but it's

6870
01:52:10,709 --> 01:52:10,719
systems that enable virality but it's
 

6871
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:12,470
systems that enable virality but it's
possible to engineer systems that are

6872
01:52:12,470 --> 01:52:12,480
possible to engineer systems that are
 

6873
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:13,830
possible to engineer systems that are
viral

6874
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:13,840
viral
 

6875
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:16,629
viral
that enable virality and

6876
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:16,639
that enable virality and
 

6877
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:19,109
that enable virality and
the kind of stuff that rises to the top

6878
01:52:19,109 --> 01:52:19,119
the kind of stuff that rises to the top
 

6879
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:21,910
the kind of stuff that rises to the top
is things that are positive and positive

6880
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:21,920
is things that are positive and positive
 

6881
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,030
is things that are positive and positive
not like

6882
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040
not like
 

6883
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,669
not like
lala positive it's more like win-win

6884
01:52:25,669 --> 01:52:25,679
lala positive it's more like win-win
 

6885
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,510
lala positive it's more like win-win
meaning a lot of people need to be

6886
01:52:27,510 --> 01:52:27,520
meaning a lot of people need to be
 

6887
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:30,149
meaning a lot of people need to be
challenged wise things yeah you grow

6888
01:52:30,149 --> 01:52:30,159
challenged wise things yeah you grow
 

6889
01:52:30,159 --> 01:52:31,589
challenged wise things yeah you grow
from it it might challenge you you might

6890
01:52:31,589 --> 01:52:31,599
from it it might challenge you you might
 

6891
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,430
from it it might challenge you you might
not like it but you ultimately grow from

6892
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:33,440
not like it but you ultimately grow from
 

6893
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,629
not like it but you ultimately grow from
it

6894
01:52:34,629 --> 01:52:34,639
it
 

6895
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:35,830
it
and ultimately

6896
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:35,840
and ultimately
 

6897
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,109
and ultimately
bring people together as opposed to tear

6898
01:52:37,109 --> 01:52:37,119
bring people together as opposed to tear
 

6899
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:39,189
bring people together as opposed to tear
them apart yeah i

6900
01:52:39,189 --> 01:52:39,199
them apart yeah i
 

6901
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:41,350
them apart yeah i
deeply want that to be true and i very

6902
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,360
deeply want that to be true and i very
 

6903
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:43,109
deeply want that to be true and i very
much agree with you that people at their

6904
01:52:43,109 --> 01:52:43,119
much agree with you that people at their
 

6905
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:44,950
much agree with you that people at their
core are on average good as opposed to

6906
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:44,960
core are on average good as opposed to
 

6907
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,390

01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:46,400
you know care for each other as opposed
 

6909
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,550
you know care for each other as opposed
to not like a you know i think it's

6910
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:48,560
to not like a you know i think it's
 

6911
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,550
to not like a you know i think it's
actually a very small percentage of

6912
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:50,560
actually a very small percentage of
 

6913
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,950
actually a very small percentage of
people are truly like wanting to do just

6914
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:52,960
people are truly like wanting to do just
 

6915
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,470
people are truly like wanting to do just
like destructive malicious things most

6916
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:54,480
like destructive malicious things most
 

6917
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:55,589

6921
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:58,629
little game and they don't mean to be
you know they're just stuck in this

6922
01:52:58,629 --> 01:52:58,639
you know they're just stuck in this
 

6923
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:00,310
you know they're just stuck in this

um

6926
01:53:01,990 --> 01:53:02,000
um
 

6927
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,669
um
that said the current structure yes is

01:53:05,669 --> 01:53:05,679
that said the current structure yes is

the current structure
 

6931
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,990
the current structure
means that virality is optimized towards

stories do go viral and i think we

6938
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:14,400
stories do go viral and i think we
 

6939
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,430
stories do go viral and i think we
should study them i think there should

should study them i think there should
 

6941
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:17,270
should study them i think there should

you know
 

6947
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:21,109
you know
identifying memes that

you know
 

6951
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,430
you know
above a certain threshold of the

6952
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:23,440
above a certain threshold of the
 

6953
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:25,830
above a certain threshold of the
population agree is a positive happy

6954
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:25,840
population agree is a positive happy
 

6955
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,430

bringing people together meme the kind

6956
01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:27,440
bringing people together meme the kind
 

6957
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,109
bringing people together meme the kind
of thing that you know brings families

6958
01:53:29,109 --> 01:53:29,119
of thing that you know brings families
 

6959
01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:30,870
of thing that you know brings families
together that would normally argue about

6960
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:30,880
together that would normally argue about

cultural stuff at the table
 

6963
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:35,510
cultural stuff at the table
at the dinner table um identify those

6964
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:35,520
at the dinner table um identify those
 

6965
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:37,430
at the dinner table um identify those
memes and figure out what it was what

6966
01:53:37,430 --> 01:53:37,440
memes and figure out what it was what
 

6967
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:39,589
memes and figure out what it was what
was the ingredient that made them spread

was the ingredient that made them spread
 

6969
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:41,430
was the ingredient that made them spread
that day um

6970
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:41,440
that day um
 

6971
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:44,629
that day um
and also like uh not just like happiness

connection between humans and other ways
 

6979
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,109
connection between humans and other ways
that enables like productivity like

6980
01:53:51,109 --> 01:53:51,119
that enables like productivity like
 

6981
01:53:51,119 --> 01:53:52,950
that enables like productivity like
cooperation

6982
01:53:52,950 --> 01:53:52,960
cooperation

kinds of stuff um you know this so it's

6986
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:56,320
kinds of stuff um you know this so it's
 

6987
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:59,430
kinds of stuff um you know this so it's
not just about let's let's be happy and

6988
01:53:59,430 --> 01:53:59,440
not just about let's let's be happy and

which is the spirit of collaboration
 

6995
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:07,510
which is the spirit of collaboration

6996
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:07,520
which is deeply anti-moloch right that's
 

6997
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:09,189
which is deeply anti-moloch right that's
that's uh it's not using competition

6998
01:54:09,189 --> 01:54:09,199
that's uh it's not using competition
 

6999
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:10,229
that's uh it's not using competition
it's like

7000
01:54:10,229 --> 01:54:10,239
it's like
 

7001
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:12,390
it's like
you know molech hates collaboration and

7002
01:54:12,390 --> 01:54:12,400
you know molech hates collaboration and
 

7003
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,470
you know molech hates collaboration and
coordination and people working together

7004
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:14,480
coordination and people working together
 

7005
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:15,990
coordination and people working together
and that's you know again like the

7006
01:54:15,990 --> 01:54:16,000
and that's you know again like the
 

7007
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,950
and that's you know again like the
internet started out as that and it and

7008
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:18,960
internet started out as that and it and
 

7009
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,950
internet started out as that and it and
um it could have been that but because

7010
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,960
um it could have been that but because
 

7011
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,270
um it could have been that but because
of the way it was sort of structured um

7012
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:23,280
of the way it was sort of structured um
 

7013
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,629
of the way it was sort of structured um
in terms of

7014
01:54:24,629 --> 01:54:24,639
in terms of
 

7015
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:25,830
in terms of
uh you know

7016
01:54:25,830 --> 01:54:25,840
uh you know
 

7017
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,430
uh you know
very lofty ideal they wanted everything

7018
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:27,440
very lofty ideal they wanted everything
 

7019
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,350
very lofty ideal they wanted everything
to be open source so open source and

7020
01:54:29,350 --> 01:54:29,360
to be open source so open source and
 

7021
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:30,550
to be open source so open source and
also free

7022
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,560
also free
 

7023
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,070
also free
and but they needed to find a way to pay

7024
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:32,080
and but they needed to find a way to pay
 

7025
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,270
and but they needed to find a way to pay
the bills anyway because they were still

7026
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:33,280
the bills anyway because they were still
 

7027
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:35,270
the bills anyway because they were still
building this on top of our old economic

7028
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:35,280
building this on top of our old economic
 

7029
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,430
building this on top of our old economic
system um and so the way they did that

7030
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:37,440
system um and so the way they did that
 

7031
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,870
system um and so the way they did that
was through a third-party ad

7032
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:38,880
was through a third-party ad
 

7033
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,589
was through a third-party ad
advertisement but that meant that things

7034
01:54:41,589 --> 01:54:41,599
advertisement but that meant that things
 

7035
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:43,270
advertisement but that meant that things
were very decoupled you know you've got

7036
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:43,280
were very decoupled you know you've got
 

7037
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:46,310
were very decoupled you know you've got
this third-party interest um which means

7038
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:46,320
this third-party interest um which means
 

7039
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,830
this third-party interest um which means
that you're then like people having to

7040
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:47,840
that you're then like people having to
 

7041
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,830
that you're then like people having to
optimize for that and that is the you

7042
01:54:49,830 --> 01:54:49,840
optimize for that and that is the you
 

7043
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,669
optimize for that and that is the you
know the actual consumer is actually the

7044
01:54:51,669 --> 01:54:51,679
know the actual consumer is actually the
 

7045
01:54:51,679 --> 01:54:52,870
know the actual consumer is actually the
product

7046
01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:52,880
product
 

7047
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,790
product
not the not the

7048
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:54,800
not the not the
 

7049
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,229
not the not the
the the person you're making the thing

7050
01:54:56,229 --> 01:54:56,239
the the person you're making the thing
 

7051
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:57,589
the the person you're making the thing
for you're in in the end you start

7052
01:54:57,589 --> 01:54:57,599
for you're in in the end you start
 

7053
01:54:57,599 --> 01:54:59,750
for you're in in the end you start
making the thing for the advertiser and

7054
01:54:59,750 --> 01:54:59,760
making the thing for the advertiser and
 

7055
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:01,750
making the thing for the advertiser and
so that's why it then like breaks down

7056
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:01,760
so that's why it then like breaks down
 

7057
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,589
so that's why it then like breaks down
um

7058
01:55:03,589 --> 01:55:03,599
um
 

7059
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:05,109
um
yeah like it's

7060
01:55:05,109 --> 01:55:05,119
yeah like it's
 

7061
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:08,390
yeah like it's
there's no clean solution to this um and

7062
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:08,400
there's no clean solution to this um and
 

7063
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:09,270
there's no clean solution to this um and
i

7064
01:55:09,270 --> 01:55:09,280
i
 

7065
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,790
i
i it's a really good suggestion by you

7066
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
i it's a really good suggestion by you
 

7067
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,390
i it's a really good suggestion by you
actually to like

7068
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:12,400
actually to like
 

7069
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,750
actually to like
um

7070
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:13,760
um
 

7071
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:15,990
um
figure out how we can optimize virality

7072
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:16,000
figure out how we can optimize virality
 

7073
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,030
figure out how we can optimize virality
for

7074
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:17,040
for
 

7075
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:18,629
for
positive some

7076
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:18,639

the power just even insane that the palm

7088
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:30,400
the power just even insane that the palm
 

7089
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:33,430
the power just even insane that the palm
already went to my head no okay you've

7090
01:55:33,430 --> 01:55:33,440
already went to my head no okay you've
 

7091
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:35,750
already went to my head no okay you've
talked about quantifying your thinking

7092
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:35,760
talked about quantifying your thinking
 

7093
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:37,109
talked about quantifying your thinking
we've been talking about this sort of

7094
01:55:37,109 --> 01:55:37,119
we've been talking about this sort of
 

7095
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:39,669
we've been talking about this sort of
game theoretic view on life

7096
01:55:39,669 --> 01:55:39,679
game theoretic view on life
 

7097
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:41,270
game theoretic view on life
and putting probabilities behind

7098
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:41,280
and putting probabilities behind
 

7099
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,030
and putting probabilities behind
estimates like if you think about

7100
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:43,040
estimates like if you think about
 

7101
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,550
estimates like if you think about
different trajectories you can take

7102
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:44,560
different trajectories you can take
 

7103
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,629
different trajectories you can take
through life just actually analyzing

7104
01:55:46,629 --> 01:55:46,639
through life just actually analyzing
 

7105
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,550
through life just actually analyzing
life in a game theoretic way like your

7106
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:48,560
life in a game theoretic way like your
 

7107
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:51,030
life in a game theoretic way like your
own life like personal life you i think

7108
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:51,040
own life like personal life you i think
 

7109
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:52,629
own life like personal life you i think
you've given an example

7110
01:55:52,629 --> 01:55:52,639
you've given an example
 

7111
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:54,229
you've given an example
that you had an honest conversation with

7112
01:55:54,229 --> 01:55:54,239
that you had an honest conversation with
 

7113
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:55,750
that you had an honest conversation with
igor about like how long is this

7114
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:55,760
igor about like how long is this
 

7115
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:57,669
igor about like how long is this
relationship gonna last

7116
01:55:57,669 --> 01:55:57,679
relationship gonna last
 

7117
01:55:57,679 --> 01:55:59,589
relationship gonna last
so similar to our sort of marriage

7118
01:55:59,589 --> 01:55:59,599
so similar to our sort of marriage
 

7119
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:01,430
so similar to our sort of marriage
problem kind of discussion

7120
01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:01,440
problem kind of discussion
 

7121
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:03,350
problem kind of discussion
having an honest conversation about the

7122
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:03,360
having an honest conversation about the
 

7123
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,950
having an honest conversation about the
probability

7124
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:04,960
probability
 

7125
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:06,709
probability
of things that we sometimes are a little

7126
01:56:06,709 --> 01:56:06,719
of things that we sometimes are a little
 

7127
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:09,910
of things that we sometimes are a little
bit too shy or scared to think of in

7128
01:56:09,910 --> 01:56:09,920
bit too shy or scared to think of in
 

7129
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:11,669
bit too shy or scared to think of in
probabilistic terms

7130
01:56:11,669 --> 01:56:11,679
probabilistic terms
 

7131
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:13,350
probabilistic terms
can you speak to that kind of way of

7132
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:13,360
can you speak to that kind of way of
 

7133
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:14,629
can you speak to that kind of way of
reasoning

7134
01:56:14,629 --> 01:56:14,639
reasoning
 

7135
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,870
reasoning
uh the good and the bad of that

7136
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:16,880
uh the good and the bad of that
 

7137
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,950
uh the good and the bad of that
can you do this kind of thing with human

7138
01:56:18,950 --> 01:56:18,960
can you do this kind of thing with human
 

7139
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:20,870
can you do this kind of thing with human
relations

7140
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:20,880
relations
 

7141
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,629
relations
yeah so the

the scenario you're talking about it was
 

7145
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:27,510
the scenario you're talking about it was
like yeah tell me about that yeah uh

7146
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:27,520
like yeah tell me about that yeah uh
 

7147
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,030
like yeah tell me about that yeah uh
i think he was about a year into our

7188
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:01,360
so you know our relationship was very
 

7189
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:03,189
so you know our relationship was very
well first of all we were good friends

7190
01:57:03,189 --> 01:57:03,199
well first of all we were good friends
 

7191
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:04,709
well first of all we were good friends
for a couple of years before we even you

7192
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:04,719
for a couple of years before we even you
 

7193
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:07,030
for a couple of years before we even you
know got you know romantic

7194
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:07,040
know got you know romantic
 

7195
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,310
know got you know romantic
um

7196
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:08,320
um
 

7197
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,629
um
and

7198
01:57:10,629 --> 01:57:10,639
and
 

7199
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:13,910
and
when we did get romantic it was very

7200
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
when we did get romantic it was very
 

7201
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,070
when we did get romantic it was very
clear that this was a big deal it wasn't

7202
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:16,080
clear that this was a big deal it wasn't
 

7203
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,510
clear that this was a big deal it wasn't
just like another like you know it

7204
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:17,520
just like another like you know it
 

7205
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,109
just like another like you know it
wasn't a random thing

7206
01:57:19,109 --> 01:57:19,119
wasn't a random thing
 

7207
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:21,750
wasn't a random thing
um and so the probability of it being a

7208
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:21,760
um and so the probability of it being a
 

7209
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,070
um and so the probability of it being a
big deal was high was already very high

7210
01:57:24,070 --> 01:57:24,080
big deal was high was already very high
 

7211
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:26,070
big deal was high was already very high
and then we'd been together for a year

7212
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:26,080
and then we'd been together for a year
 

7213
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:28,070
and then we'd been together for a year
and it had been pretty golden and

7214
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:28,080
and it had been pretty golden and
 

7215
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,470
and it had been pretty golden and
wonderful so you know

7216
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:30,480
wonderful so you know
 

7217
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:32,550
wonderful so you know
there was a lot of foundation already

7218
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:32,560
there was a lot of foundation already
 

7219
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:33,990
there was a lot of foundation already
where we felt very comfortable having a

7220
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:34,000
where we felt very comfortable having a
 

7221
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,709
where we felt very comfortable having a
lot of frank conversations but igor's

7222
01:57:36,709 --> 01:57:36,719
lot of frank conversations but igor's
 

7223
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:38,550
lot of frank conversations but igor's
mo has always been much more than mine

7224
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:38,560
mo has always been much more than mine
 

7225
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,030
mo has always been much more than mine
he was always from the outset like just

7226
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:41,040
he was always from the outset like just
 

7227
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:42,550
he was always from the outset like just
in a relationship

7228
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:42,560
in a relationship
 

7229
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,790
in a relationship
radical transparency and honesty is the

7230
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:44,800
radical transparency and honesty is the
 

7231
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,950
radical transparency and honesty is the
way because the truth is the truth

7232
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:46,960
way because the truth is the truth
 

7233
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:48,149
way because the truth is the truth
whether you want to hide it or not you

7234
01:57:48,149 --> 01:57:48,159
whether you want to hide it or not you
 

7235
01:57:48,159 --> 01:57:50,310
whether you want to hide it or not you
know but it will come out eventually

7236
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:50,320
know but it will come out eventually
 

7237
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:51,350
know but it will come out eventually
and

7238
01:57:51,350 --> 01:57:51,360
and
 

7239
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,109
and
um

7240
01:57:53,109 --> 01:57:53,119
um
 

7241
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,669
um
if you aren't able to accept difficult

7242
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:55,679
if you aren't able to accept difficult
 

7243
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:56,870
if you aren't able to accept difficult
things yourself then how could you

7244
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:56,880
things yourself then how could you
 

7245
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,709
things yourself then how could you
possibly expect to be like the most

7246
01:57:58,709 --> 01:57:58,719
possibly expect to be like the most
 

7247
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:01,030
possibly expect to be like the most
integral version that you know you can't

7248
01:58:01,030 --> 01:58:01,040
integral version that you know you can't
 

7249
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,030
integral version that you know you can't
the relationship needs this bedrock of

7250
01:58:03,030 --> 01:58:03,040
the relationship needs this bedrock of
 

7251
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:05,830
the relationship needs this bedrock of
like honesty as a foundation more than

7252
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:05,840
like honesty as a foundation more than
 

7253
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,589
like honesty as a foundation more than
anything yeah that's really interesting

7254
01:58:07,589 --> 01:58:07,599
anything yeah that's really interesting
 

7255
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:09,270
anything yeah that's really interesting
but i would like to push against some of

7256
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:09,280
but i would like to push against some of
 

7257
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,030
but i would like to push against some of
those ideas but okay all right but

7258
01:58:11,030 --> 01:58:11,040
those ideas but okay all right but
 

7259
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,870
those ideas but okay all right but
that's the down the line just throw them

7260
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:12,880
that's the down the line just throw them
 

7261
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:16,149
that's the down the line just throw them
up uh i just rudely interrupt

7262
01:58:16,149 --> 01:58:16,159
up uh i just rudely interrupt
 

7263
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:18,870
up uh i just rudely interrupt
um and so you know we we've been about

7264
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:18,880
um and so you know we we've been about
 

7265
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,550
um and so you know we we've been about
together for a year and things were good

7266
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:20,560
together for a year and things were good
 

7267
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,750
together for a year and things were good
and we were having this hard

7268
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:21,760
and we were having this hard
 

7269
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:23,350
and we were having this hard
conversation

7270
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:23,360
conversation
 

7271
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:25,270
conversation
and and then he was like well okay

7272
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:25,280
and and then he was like well okay
 

7273
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,629
and and then he was like well okay
what's the likelihood that we're going

7274
01:58:26,629 --> 01:58:26,639
what's the likelihood that we're going
 

7275
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:28,070
what's the likelihood that we're going
to be together in three years then

7276
01:58:28,070 --> 01:58:28,080
to be together in three years then
 

7277
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,109
to be together in three years then
because i think it was roughly a

7278
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:29,119
because i think it was roughly a
 

7279
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:30,950
because i think it was roughly a
three-year time horizon

7280
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:30,960
three-year time horizon
 

7281
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:32,950
three-year time horizon
and i was like oh interesting and

7282
01:58:32,950 --> 01:58:32,960
and i was like oh interesting and
 

7283
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,390
and i was like oh interesting and
everybody actually wait don't before you

7284
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:34,400
everybody actually wait don't before you
 

7285
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:35,669
everybody actually wait don't before you
said out loud let's both write down our

7286
01:58:35,669 --> 01:58:35,679
said out loud let's both write down our
 

7287
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:37,270
said out loud let's both write down our
predictions formally

7288
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:37,280
predictions formally
 

7289
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:38,629
predictions formally
um because we'd been like we were just

7290
01:58:38,629 --> 01:58:38,639
um because we'd been like we were just
 

7291
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:40,470
um because we'd been like we were just
getting into like effective altruism and

7292
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:40,480
getting into like effective altruism and
 

7293
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,070
getting into like effective altruism and
rationality at the time which is all

7294
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:42,080
rationality at the time which is all
 

7295
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:43,669
rationality at the time which is all
about making you know formal predictions

7296
01:58:43,669 --> 01:58:43,679
about making you know formal predictions
 

7297
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:45,990
about making you know formal predictions
as a means of uh

7298
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:46,000
as a means of uh
 

7299
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,790
as a means of uh
measuring your own um

7300
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:48,800
measuring your own um
 

7301
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:51,589
measuring your own um
well your your own foresight essentially

7302
01:58:51,589 --> 01:58:51,599
well your your own foresight essentially
 

7303
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,510
well your your own foresight essentially
in a quantified way

7304
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:53,520
in a quantified way
 

7305
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:54,790
in a quantified way
so we like both wrote down our

7306
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:54,800
so we like both wrote down our
 

7307
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:57,990
so we like both wrote down our
percentages and we also did a one-year

7308
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:58,000
percentages and we also did a one-year
 

7309
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,589
percentages and we also did a one-year
prediction and a 10-year one as well so

7310
01:58:59,589 --> 01:58:59,599
prediction and a 10-year one as well so
 

7311
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:01,750
prediction and a 10-year one as well so
we got percentages for all three

7312
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:01,760
we got percentages for all three
 

7313
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:03,990
we got percentages for all three
and then we showed each other um and i

7314
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:04,000
and then we showed each other um and i
 

7315
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,270
and then we showed each other um and i
remember like having this moment of like

7316
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:05,280
remember like having this moment of like
 

7317
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,030
remember like having this moment of like
oh because after the ten year and i was

7318
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:07,040
oh because after the ten year and i was
 

7319
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,550
oh because after the ten year and i was
like oh well i mean

7320
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:08,560
like oh well i mean
 

7321
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:10,229
like oh well i mean
i love them a lot but like a lot can

7322
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:10,239
i love them a lot but like a lot can
 

7323
01:59:10,239 --> 01:59:12,629
i love them a lot but like a lot can
happen in ten years you know and

7324
01:59:12,629 --> 01:59:12,639
happen in ten years you know and
 

7325
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:14,149
happen in ten years you know and
um we've only been together for you know

7326
01:59:14,149 --> 01:59:14,159
um we've only been together for you know
 

7327
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:16,390
um we've only been together for you know
so i was like i think it's over 50 but

7328
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:16,400
so i was like i think it's over 50 but
 

7329
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,070
so i was like i think it's over 50 but
it's definitely not 90 percent and i

7330
01:59:18,070 --> 01:59:18,080
it's definitely not 90 percent and i
 

7331
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:19,109
it's definitely not 90 percent and i
remember like wrestling i was like oh

7332
01:59:19,109 --> 01:59:19,119
remember like wrestling i was like oh
 

7333
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:20,229
remember like wrestling i was like oh
but i don't want him to be hurt i don't

7334
01:59:20,229 --> 01:59:20,239
but i don't want him to be hurt i don't
 

7335
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:21,589
but i don't want him to be hurt i don't
want him to you know i don't want to

7336
01:59:21,589 --> 01:59:21,599
want him to you know i don't want to
 

7337
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:22,629
want him to you know i don't want to
give a number lower than his and i

7338
01:59:22,629 --> 01:59:22,639
give a number lower than his and i
 

7339
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:25,030
give a number lower than his and i
remember thinking ah don't game it

7340
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:25,040
remember thinking ah don't game it
 

7341
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:27,990
remember thinking ah don't game it
this is a exercise in radical honesty

7342
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:28,000
this is a exercise in radical honesty
 

7343
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,510
this is a exercise in radical honesty
so just give you a real percentage and i

7344
01:59:29,510 --> 01:59:29,520
so just give you a real percentage and i
 

7345
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,189
so just give you a real percentage and i
think mine was like 75

7346
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:31,199
think mine was like 75
 

7347
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:32,870
think mine was like 75
and then we showed each other and

7348
01:59:32,870 --> 01:59:32,880
and then we showed each other and
 

7349
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:35,990
and then we showed each other and
luckily we were fairly well aligned um

7350
01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:36,000
luckily we were fairly well aligned um
 

7351
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,030
luckily we were fairly well aligned um
and

7352
01:59:37,030 --> 01:59:37,040
and
 

7353
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:40,470
and
but honestly even if we weren't 20

7354
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:40,480
but honestly even if we weren't 20
 

7355
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:43,030
but honestly even if we weren't 20
it definitely it definitely would have i

7356
01:59:43,030 --> 01:59:43,040
it definitely it definitely would have i
 

7357
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:45,109
it definitely it definitely would have i
if his had been consistently lower than

7358
01:59:45,109 --> 01:59:45,119
if his had been consistently lower than
 

7359
01:59:45,119 --> 01:59:46,470
if his had been consistently lower than
mine that would have

7360
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:46,480
mine that would have
 

7361
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:48,629
mine that would have
rattled me for sure whereas if it had

7362
01:59:48,629 --> 01:59:48,639
rattled me for sure whereas if it had
 

7363
01:59:48,639 --> 01:59:50,149
rattled me for sure whereas if it had
been the other way around i think he

7364
01:59:50,149 --> 01:59:50,159
been the other way around i think he
 

7365
01:59:50,159 --> 01:59:51,589
been the other way around i think he
would he's just kind of like a water off

7366
01:59:51,589 --> 01:59:51,599
would he's just kind of like a water off
 

7367
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:53,189
would he's just kind of like a water off
the duck's back type of guy he'd be like

7368
01:59:53,189 --> 01:59:53,199
the duck's back type of guy he'd be like
 

7369
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:54,709
the duck's back type of guy he'd be like
okay well all right we'll figure this

7370
01:59:54,709 --> 01:59:54,719
okay well all right we'll figure this
 

7371
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:57,030
okay well all right we'll figure this
out well did you guys provide error bars

7372
01:59:57,030 --> 01:59:57,040
out well did you guys provide error bars
 

7373
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:58,790
out well did you guys provide error bars
on the estimate like the level one they

7374
01:59:58,790 --> 01:59:58,800
on the estimate like the level one they
 

7375
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,870
on the estimate like the level one they
became built in we didn't give formal

7376
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:00,880
became built in we didn't give formal
 

7377
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:02,550
became built in we didn't give formal
plus or minus error bars i didn't draw

7378
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:02,560
plus or minus error bars i didn't draw
 

7379
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,470
plus or minus error bars i didn't draw
any or anything like that i guess that's

7380
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:04,480
any or anything like that i guess that's
 

7381
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:08,229
any or anything like that i guess that's
the question i have is did you feel

7382
02:00:08,229 --> 02:00:08,239
the question i have is did you feel
 

7383
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:10,310
the question i have is did you feel
informed enough

7384
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:10,320
informed enough
 

7385
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,950
informed enough
to make such decisions because like i

7386
02:00:12,950 --> 02:00:12,960
to make such decisions because like i
 

7387
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,550
to make such decisions because like i
feel like if you were if i were to do

7388
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:14,560
feel like if you were if i were to do
 

7389
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:17,270
feel like if you were if i were to do
this kind of thing rigorously

7390
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:17,280
this kind of thing rigorously
 

7391
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,990
this kind of thing rigorously
i would want some data

7392
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:20,000
i would want some data
 

7393
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,990
i would want some data
uh i would want to say one of the

7394
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:22,000
uh i would want to say one of the
 

7395
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,750
uh i would want to say one of the
assumptions you have is you're not that

7396
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:23,760
assumptions you have is you're not that
 

7397
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,070
assumptions you have is you're not that
different from other relationships right

7398
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:26,080
different from other relationships right
 

7399
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:27,030
different from other relationships right
and so

7400
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:27,040
and so
 

7401
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:29,430
and so
i want to i want to have some data about

7402
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:29,440
i want to i want to have some data about
 

7403
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,709
i want to i want to have some data about
the base rates

7404
02:00:30,709 --> 02:00:30,719
the base rates
 

7405
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:33,589
the base rates
yeah and and also actual trajectories of

7406
02:00:33,589 --> 02:00:33,599
yeah and and also actual trajectories of
 

7407
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:35,750
yeah and and also actual trajectories of
relationships i would love to have

7408
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:35,760
relationships i would love to have
 

7409
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:39,030
relationships i would love to have
um like time series data

7410
02:00:39,030 --> 02:00:39,040
um like time series data
 

7411
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:41,189
um like time series data
about the ways that relationships fall

7412
02:00:41,189 --> 02:00:41,199
about the ways that relationships fall
 

7413
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:43,669
about the ways that relationships fall
apart or prosper

7414
02:00:43,669 --> 02:00:43,679
apart or prosper
 

7415
02:00:43,679 --> 02:00:45,589
apart or prosper

i want that kind of data and how often

7426
02:00:56,870 --> 02:00:56,880
i want that kind of data and how often

i want that kind of data and how often
the different trajectories change in

7428
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,320
the different trajectories change in
 

7429
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,750
the different trajectories change in
life like

7430
02:00:59,750 --> 02:00:59,760
life like
 

7431
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:00,709
life like
how

7432
02:01:00,709 --> 02:01:00,719
how

rep how informative is your past to your
 

7435
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:05,750
rep how informative is your past to your
future that's the whole thing like i can

7436
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:05,760
future that's the whole thing like i can
 

7437
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:07,270
future that's the whole thing like i can
you look at my

7438
02:01:07,270 --> 02:01:07,280
you look at my
 

7439
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:10,550
you look at my
life and have a good prediction about in

7440
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:10,560
life and have a good prediction about in
 

7441
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,790
life and have a good prediction about in
terms of my characteristics of my

7442
02:01:12,790 --> 02:01:12,800
terms of my characteristics of my
 

7443
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:14,149
terms of my characteristics of my
relationships what that's going to look

7444
02:01:14,149 --> 02:01:14,159
relationships what that's going to look
 

7445
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:16,149
relationships what that's going to look
like in the future or not i don't even

7446
02:01:16,149 --> 02:01:16,159
like in the future or not i don't even
 

7447
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:17,430
like in the future or not i don't even
know the answer that question i'll be

7448
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:17,440
know the answer that question i'll be
 

7449
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,910
know the answer that question i'll be
very ill informed in terms of making the

7450
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:19,920
very ill informed in terms of making the
 

7451
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:23,189
very ill informed in terms of making the
probability i would be far

7452
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:23,199
probability i would be far
 

7453
02:01:23,199 --> 02:01:25,589
probability i would be far
yeah i i just would be under-informed i

7454
02:01:25,589 --> 02:01:25,599
yeah i i just would be under-informed i
 

7455
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:27,550
yeah i i just would be under-informed i
would be under-informed i'll be

7456
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:27,560
would be under-informed i'll be
 

7457
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,229
would be under-informed i'll be
over-biasing to my prior experiences i

7458
02:01:30,229 --> 02:01:30,239
over-biasing to my prior experiences i
 

7459
02:01:30,239 --> 02:01:31,189
over-biasing to my prior experiences i
think

7460
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:31,199
think
 

7461
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:32,790
think
right but as long as you're aware of

7462
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:32,800
right but as long as you're aware of
 

7463
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:33,990
right but as long as you're aware of
that and you're honest with yourself i

7464
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:34,000
that and you're honest with yourself i
 

7465
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:35,189
that and you're honest with yourself i
still and you're honest with the other

7466
02:01:35,189 --> 02:01:35,199
still and you're honest with the other
 

7467
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:36,950
still and you're honest with the other
person say look i have really wide error

7468
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:36,960

that's okay i still think it's better
 

7473
02:01:41,119 --> 02:01:43,189
that's okay i still think it's better
than not trying to quantify it at all if

7474
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
than not trying to quantify it at all if
 

7475
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,109
than not trying to quantify it at all if
you're trying to make really major

you would rather give a falsely high
 

7509
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:18,950
you would rather give a falsely high
percentage

7510
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:18,960

7521
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:36,870

well so that and this comes back to this

7522
02:02:36,870 --> 02:02:36,880
well so that and this comes back to this
 

7523
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:41,030
well so that and this comes back to this
idea of useful fictions yeah right and i

7524
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:41,040
idea of useful fictions yeah right and i
 

7525
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:42,310
idea of useful fictions yeah right and i
i agree i don't think there's a clear

7526
02:02:42,310 --> 02:02:42,320
i agree i don't think there's a clear
 

7527
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,430
i agree i don't think there's a clear
answer to this and i think it's actually

7528
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:43,440
answer to this and i think it's actually
 

7529
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,270
answer to this and i think it's actually
quite subjective some people this works

7530
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:45,280
quite subjective some people this works
 

7531
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:46,870
quite subjective some people this works
better for than others

7532
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:46,880
better for than others
 

7533
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:48,229
better for than others
um

7534
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:48,239
um
 

7535
02:02:48,239 --> 02:02:49,750
um
you know to be clear igor and i weren't

7536
02:02:49,750 --> 02:02:49,760
you know to be clear igor and i weren't
 

7537
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:50,870
you know to be clear igor and i weren't
doing this

7538
02:02:50,870 --> 02:02:50,880
doing this
 

7539
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,790
doing this
formal prediction in it like we we did

7540
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:52,800
formal prediction in it like we we did
 

7541
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,350
formal prediction in it like we we did
it with very much tongue-in-cheek

7542
02:02:55,350 --> 02:02:55,360
it with very much tongue-in-cheek
 

7543
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,270
it with very much tongue-in-cheek
it wasn't like we were going to make i

7544
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:57,280
it wasn't like we were going to make i
 

7545
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,709
it wasn't like we were going to make i
don't think it even would have me

7546
02:02:58,709 --> 02:02:58,719
don't think it even would have me
 

7547
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:00,950
don't think it even would have me
drastically changed what we decided to

7548
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:00,960
drastically changed what we decided to
 

7549
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:03,270
drastically changed what we decided to
do even we kind of just did it more as a

7550
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:03,280
do even we kind of just did it more as a
 

7551
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:05,910
do even we kind of just did it more as a
fun exercise um but the consequence of

7552
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:05,920
fun exercise um but the consequence of
 

7553
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,510
fun exercise um but the consequence of
that fun exercise you really actually

7554
02:03:07,510 --> 02:03:07,520
that fun exercise you really actually
 

7555
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,589
that fun exercise you really actually
kind of there was a deep honesty to it

7556
02:03:09,589 --> 02:03:09,599
kind of there was a deep honesty to it
 

7557
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:11,510
kind of there was a deep honesty to it
too exactly it was a deep and it was it

7558
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:11,520
too exactly it was a deep and it was it
 

7559
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:13,109
too exactly it was a deep and it was it
was just like this moment of reflection

7560
02:03:13,109 --> 02:03:13,119
was just like this moment of reflection
 

7561
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:14,550
was just like this moment of reflection
i'm like oh wow i actually have to think

7562
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:14,560
i'm like oh wow i actually have to think
 

7563
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,790
i'm like oh wow i actually have to think
like through this quite critically and

7564
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:16,800
like through this quite critically and
 

7565
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:17,750
like through this quite critically and
so on

7566
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:17,760
so on
 

7567
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:19,750
so on
and

7568
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:19,760
and
 

7569
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,589
and
and it's also what was interesting was

7570
02:03:21,589 --> 02:03:21,599
and it's also what was interesting was
 

7571
02:03:21,599 --> 02:03:22,790
and it's also what was interesting was
like you know i got to like check in

7572
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:22,800
like you know i got to like check in
 

7573
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:25,750
like you know i got to like check in
with what what my what my desires were

7574
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:25,760
with what what my what my desires were
 

7575
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,430
with what what my what my desires were
so there was one thing of like what my

7576
02:03:27,430 --> 02:03:27,440
so there was one thing of like what my
 

7577
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:28,950
so there was one thing of like what my
actual prediction is but what are my

7578
02:03:28,950 --> 02:03:28,960
actual prediction is but what are my
 

7579
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:30,390
actual prediction is but what are my
desires and could these desires be

7580
02:03:30,390 --> 02:03:30,400
desires and could these desires be
 

7581
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:32,629
desires and could these desires be
affecting my predictions and so on and

7582
02:03:32,629 --> 02:03:32,639
affecting my predictions and so on and
 

7583
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:34,229
affecting my predictions and so on and
you know that's a that's a method of

7584
02:03:34,229 --> 02:03:34,239
you know that's a that's a method of
 

7585
02:03:34,239 --> 02:03:35,750
you know that's a that's a method of
rationality and i personally don't think

7586
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:35,760
rationality and i personally don't think
 

7587
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:37,350
rationality and i personally don't think
it loses anything in terms of i didn't

7588
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:37,360
it loses anything in terms of i didn't
 

7589
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:38,629
it loses anything in terms of i didn't
take any of the magic away from our

7590
02:03:38,629 --> 02:03:38,639
take any of the magic away from our
 

7591
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:40,550
take any of the magic away from our
relationship quite the opposite like it

7592
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:40,560
relationship quite the opposite like it
 

7593
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,070
relationship quite the opposite like it
brought us closer together because it

7594
02:03:42,070 --> 02:03:42,080
brought us closer together because it
 

7595
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:44,550
brought us closer together because it
was like we did this weird fun thing um

7596
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:44,560
was like we did this weird fun thing um
 

7597
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:45,910
was like we did this weird fun thing um
that i appreciate a lot of people find

7598
02:03:45,910 --> 02:03:45,920
that i appreciate a lot of people find
 

7599
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:47,189
that i appreciate a lot of people find
quite strange

7600
02:03:47,189 --> 02:03:47,199
quite strange
 

7601
02:03:47,199 --> 02:03:50,390
quite strange
um and i think it was somewhat you know

7602
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:50,400
um and i think it was somewhat you know
 

7603
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,229
um and i think it was somewhat you know
unique in our relationship that both of

7604
02:03:52,229 --> 02:03:52,239
unique in our relationship that both of
 

7605
02:03:52,239 --> 02:03:53,589
unique in our relationship that both of
us are very

7606
02:03:53,589 --> 02:03:53,599
us are very
 

7607
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:54,950
us are very
you know we both love numbers we both

7608
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:54,960
you know we both love numbers we both
 

7609

um
so this this was kind of like our safe

7614
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:00,000
so this this was kind of like our safe
 

7615
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,189
so this this was kind of like our safe
space anyway

7616
02:04:01,189 --> 02:04:01,199
space anyway
 

7617
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:03,430
space anyway
for others you know one part one partner

7618
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:03,440
for others you know one part one partner
 

7619
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:04,550
for others you know one part one partner
like really

7620
02:04:04,550 --> 02:04:04,560
like really
 

7621
02:04:04,560 --> 02:04:05,750
like really
might not like that kind of stuff at all

7622
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:05,760
might not like that kind of stuff at all
 

7623
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:07,270
might not like that kind of stuff at all
in which cases it's not a good exercise

7624
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:07,280
in which cases it's not a good exercise
 

7625
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,709
in which cases it's not a good exercise
to do you know i don't recommend it to

everybody um
 

7629
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,790
everybody um
but i do think there's

7630
02:04:12,790 --> 02:04:12,800
but i do think there's
 

7631
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:14,310
but i do think there's
you know it's interesting sometimes to

7632
02:04:14,310 --> 02:04:14,320
you know it's interesting sometimes to
 

7633
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:16,709
you know it's interesting sometimes to
poke holes in the or you know

7634
02:04:16,709 --> 02:04:16,719
poke holes in the or you know
 

7635
02:04:16,719 --> 02:04:18,390
poke holes in the or you know
probe at these

7636
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:18,400
probe at these
 

7637
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:20,550
probe at these
things that we consider so sacred that

7638
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:20,560
things that we consider so sacred that
 

7639
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:23,350
things that we consider so sacred that
we can't try to quantify them

7640
02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:23,360
we can't try to quantify them
 

7641
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:24,950
we can't try to quantify them
but which is interesting because that's

7642
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:24,960
but which is interesting because that's
 

7643
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,229
but which is interesting because that's
intention with like the idea of what we

7644
02:04:26,229 --> 02:04:26,239
intention with like the idea of what we
 

7645
02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:27,589
intention with like the idea of what we
just talked about with beauty and like

7646
02:04:27,589 --> 02:04:27,599
just talked about with beauty and like
 

7647
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:28,870
just talked about with beauty and like
what makes something beautiful the fact

7648
02:04:28,870 --> 02:04:28,880
what makes something beautiful the fact
 

7649
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:30,310
what makes something beautiful the fact
that you can't measure everything about

7650
02:04:30,310 --> 02:04:30,320
that you can't measure everything about
 

7651
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,149
that you can't measure everything about
it um and perhaps something shouldn't be

7652
02:04:32,149 --> 02:04:32,159
it um and perhaps something shouldn't be
 

7653
02:04:32,159 --> 02:04:33,430
it um and perhaps something shouldn't be
tried to make you know maybe it's wrong

7654
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:33,440
tried to make you know maybe it's wrong
 

7655
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,550
tried to make you know maybe it's wrong
to

7656
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:34,560
to
 

7657
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,950
to
completely try and value the utilitarian

7658
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
completely try and value the utilitarian
 

7659
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,270
completely try and value the utilitarian
you know put a utilitarian frame of

7660
02:04:39,270 --> 02:04:39,280
you know put a utilitarian frame of
 

7661
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:40,550
you know put a utilitarian frame of
measuring the

7662
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:40,560

99 of what i think about is just

8146
02:13:10,310 --> 02:13:10,320
99 of what i think about is just
 

8147
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:12,149
99 of what i think about is just
individual human beings and human lives

8148
02:13:12,149 --> 02:13:12,159
individual human beings and human lives
 

8149
02:13:12,159 --> 02:13:14,390
individual human beings and human lives
and just that war is horrible

8150
02:13:14,390 --> 02:13:14,400
and just that war is horrible
 

8151
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:16,149
and just that war is horrible
but when you zoom out and think from a

8152
02:13:16,149 --> 02:13:16,159
but when you zoom out and think from a
 

8153
02:13:16,159 --> 02:13:19,109
but when you zoom out and think from a
geopolitics perspective we should

8154
02:13:19,109 --> 02:13:19,119
geopolitics perspective we should
 

8155
02:13:19,119 --> 02:13:20,550
geopolitics perspective we should
realize that

8156
02:13:20,550 --> 02:13:20,560
realize that
 

8157
02:13:20,560 --> 02:13:22,709
realize that
it's entirely possible that we will see

8158
02:13:22,709 --> 02:13:22,719
it's entirely possible that we will see
 

8159
02:13:22,719 --> 02:13:26,310
it's entirely possible that we will see
a world war iii in the 21st century

8160
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:26,320
a world war iii in the 21st century
 

8161
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:29,189
a world war iii in the 21st century
and this is like a dress rehearsal for

8162
02:13:29,189 --> 02:13:29,199
and this is like a dress rehearsal for
 

8163
02:13:29,199 --> 02:13:31,109
and this is like a dress rehearsal for
that and so the way

8164
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:31,119
that and so the way
 

8165
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:33,189
that and so the way
we play this

8166
02:13:33,189 --> 02:13:33,199
we play this
 

8167
02:13:33,199 --> 02:13:36,149
we play this
as a as a human civilization will will

8168
02:13:36,149 --> 02:13:36,159
as a as a human civilization will will
 

8169
02:13:36,159 --> 02:13:38,709
as a as a human civilization will will
define whether we do or don't have a

8170
02:13:38,709 --> 02:13:38,719
define whether we do or don't have a
 

8171
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:40,470
define whether we do or don't have a
world war three

8172
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:40,480
world war three
 

8173
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:42,870
world war three

somehow get the meme into everyone's
 

8237
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:54,550
somehow get the meme into everyone's
heads that the real enemy is war itself

heads that the real enemy is war itself
 

8239
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:56,950
heads that the real enemy is war itself
that's the enemy we need to defeat

small local
 

8249
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:05,589
small local
scenarios you know adversarial

02:15:05,589 --> 02:15:05,599
scenarios you know adversarial
 

8251
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:07,510
scenarios you know adversarial
adversarial conflicts you know if you

8252
02:15:07,510 --> 02:15:07,520
adversarial conflicts you know if you
 

8253
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:10,709
adversarial conflicts you know if you
have a a leader who is starting wars

8254
02:15:10,709 --> 02:15:10,719
have a a leader who is starting wars
 

8255

you know they're on the side of team war

8256
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:12,560
you know they're on the side of team war
 

8257
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:14,149
you know they're on the side of team war
basically it's not that they're on the

8258
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:14,159
basically it's not that they're on the
 

8259
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:15,669
basically it's not that they're on the

02:15:15,669 --> 02:15:15,679
side of team country whatever that
 

8261
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:16,790
side of team country whatever that
country is it's they're on the side of

8262
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:16,800
country is it's they're on the side of
 

8263
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:19,109
country is it's they're on the side of
team war so that needs to be stopped and

8264
02:15:19,109 --> 02:15:19,119
team war so that needs to be stopped and
 

8265
02:15:19,119 --> 02:15:21,109
team war so that needs to be stopped and
put down but you also have to find a

8266
02:15:21,109 --> 02:15:21,119
put down but you also have to find a
 

8267
02:15:21,119 --> 02:15:23,270
put down but you also have to find a
ways that your

8268
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:23,280
ways that your
 

8269
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:25,350
ways that your
corrective measure doesn't actually then

8270
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:25,360
corrective measure doesn't actually then
 

8271
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:27,270
corrective measure doesn't actually then
end up being co-opted by the war machine

8272
02:15:27,270 --> 02:15:27,280
end up being co-opted by the war machine
 

8273
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:29,109
end up being co-opted by the war machine
and creating greater war again the

8274
02:15:29,109 --> 02:15:29,119
and creating greater war again the
 

8275
02:15:29,119 --> 02:15:33,109
and creating greater war again the

you know the weapons that can be used
 

8281
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:39,350
you know the weapons that can be used
are so mass destructive

8282
02:15:39,350 --> 02:15:39,360
are so mass destructive
 

8283

um
uh what what worries you the most well

8310
02:16:07,990 --> 02:16:08,000
uh what what worries you the most well
 

8311
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,830
uh what what worries you the most well
mentioned uh asteroids will mention agi

8312
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:11,840
mentioned uh asteroids will mention agi
 

8313
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:14,069
mentioned uh asteroids will mention agi
uh nuclear weapons

8314
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:14,079
uh nuclear weapons
 

8315
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:15,510
uh nuclear weapons
the one that's on

8316
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:15,520
the one that's on
 

8317
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,270
the one that's on
my mind the most

8318
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:17,280
my mind the most
 

8319
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:18,390
my mind the most
mostly because i think it's the one

8320
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:18,400
mostly because i think it's the one
 

8321
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,629
mostly because i think it's the one
where we have actually a real chance to

8322
02:16:20,629 --> 02:16:20,639
where we have actually a real chance to
 

8323
02:16:20,639 --> 02:16:22,629
where we have actually a real chance to
move the needle on in a positive

8324
02:16:22,629 --> 02:16:22,639
move the needle on in a positive
 

8325
02:16:22,639 --> 02:16:25,270
move the needle on in a positive
direction or more specifically stop some

8326
02:16:25,270 --> 02:16:25,280
direction or more specifically stop some
 

8327
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:27,030
direction or more specifically stop some
really bad things from happening really

8328
02:16:27,030 --> 02:16:27,040
really bad things from happening really
 

8329
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:30,709
really bad things from happening really
dumb avoidable things is uh

8330
02:16:30,709 --> 02:16:30,719
dumb avoidable things is uh
 

8331
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:33,190

um
 

8335
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:37,270
um
so what in what what kind of violence

8336
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:37,280
so what in what what kind of violence
 

8337
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:39,270
so what in what what kind of violence
and so many fun options

8338
02:16:39,270 --> 02:16:39,280
and so many fun options
 

8339
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:40,950
and so many fun options
so many so of course like we have

8340
02:16:40,950 --> 02:16:40,960
so many so of course like we have
 

8341
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:43,349
so many so of course like we have
natural risks from natural pandemics you

8342
02:16:43,349 --> 02:16:43,359
natural risks from natural pandemics you
 

8343
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:45,030
natural risks from natural pandemics you
know naturally occurring viruses or

8344
02:16:45,030 --> 02:16:45,040
know naturally occurring viruses or
 

8345
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:47,110

pathogens
 

8347
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:49,110
pathogens
and then also as time and technology

8348
02:16:49,110 --> 02:16:49,120
and then also as time and technology
 

8349
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:50,469
and then also as time and technology
goes on and technology becomes more and

8350
02:16:50,469 --> 02:16:50,479
goes on and technology becomes more and
 

8351
02:16:50,479 --> 02:16:52,150
goes on and technology becomes more and
more democratized and you know into the

8352
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:52,160
more democratized and you know into the
 

8353
02:16:52,160 --> 02:16:53,830
more democratized and you know into the
hands of more people

hands of more people
 

8355
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:56,870
hands of more people
the risk of synthetic pathogens um

8356
02:16:56,870 --> 02:16:56,880
the risk of synthetic pathogens um
 

8357
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:58,469
the risk of synthetic pathogens um
you know and whether or not you fall

8358
02:16:58,469 --> 02:16:58,479
you know and whether or not you fall
 

8359
02:16:58,479 --> 02:17:01,910
you know and whether or not you fall
into the camp of covid was you know gain

8360
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:01,920
into the camp of covid was you know gain
 

8361
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:03,669
into the camp of covid was you know gain
a function accidental lab leak or

8362
02:17:03,669 --> 02:17:03,679
a function accidental lab leak or
 

8363
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:05,190
a function accidental lab leak or
whether it was purely naturally

8364
02:17:05,190 --> 02:17:05,200
whether it was purely naturally
 

8365
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:07,110
whether it was purely naturally
occurring

8366
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:07,120
occurring
 

8367
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:09,509
occurring
either way

8368
02:17:09,509 --> 02:17:09,519
either way
 

8369
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:13,270
either way
we are facing a future where

8370
02:17:13,270 --> 02:17:13,280

 

8371
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:15,990

synthetic pathogens or like art human

8372
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,000
synthetic pathogens or like art human
 

8373
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,950
synthetic pathogens or like art human
human meddled with pathogens um either

8374
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:18,960
human meddled with pathogens um either
 

8375
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:20,870
human meddled with pathogens um either
accidentally get out or

8376
02:17:20,870 --> 02:17:20,880
accidentally get out or
 

8377
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:23,750
accidentally get out or
get into the hands of bad actors who you

8378
02:17:23,750 --> 02:17:23,760
get into the hands of bad actors who you
 

8379
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:25,669
get into the hands of bad actors who you
know whether they're omnicidal maniacs

8380
02:17:25,669 --> 02:17:25,679
know whether they're omnicidal maniacs
 

8381
02:17:25,679 --> 02:17:28,469
know whether they're omnicidal maniacs
you know um either way

8382
02:17:28,469 --> 02:17:28,479
you know um either way
 

8383
02:17:28,479 --> 02:17:29,669
you know um either way
and so that means we need more

8384
02:17:29,669 --> 02:17:29,679
and so that means we need more
 

8385
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:31,830
and so that means we need more
robustness for that and you would think

8386
02:17:31,830 --> 02:17:31,840
robustness for that and you would think
 

8387
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:33,750
robustness for that and you would think
that us having this nice little dry run

8388
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:33,760
that us having this nice little dry run
 

8389
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:36,629
that us having this nice little dry run
which is what as awful as covid was

8390
02:17:36,629 --> 02:17:36,639
which is what as awful as covid was
 

8391
02:17:36,639 --> 02:17:38,389
which is what as awful as covid was
um you know and all those poor people

8392
02:17:38,389 --> 02:17:38,399
um you know and all those poor people
 

8393
02:17:38,399 --> 02:17:41,110
um you know and all those poor people
that died it was still like

8394
02:17:41,110 --> 02:17:41,120
that died it was still like
 

8395
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,030
that died it was still like
like child's play compared to what a

8396
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:43,040
like child's play compared to what a
 

8397
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:45,270
like child's play compared to what a
future one could be in terms of fatality

8398
02:17:45,270 --> 02:17:45,280
future one could be in terms of fatality
 

8399
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:46,230
future one could be in terms of fatality
rate

8400
02:17:46,230 --> 02:17:46,240
rate
 

8401
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:47,349
rate
um

8402
02:17:47,349 --> 02:17:47,359
um
 

8403
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:49,270
um
and so you'd think that we would then

8404
02:17:49,270 --> 02:17:49,280
and so you'd think that we would then
 

8405
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:51,030
and so you'd think that we would then
becoming we'd be much more robust in our

8406
02:17:51,030 --> 02:17:51,040
becoming we'd be much more robust in our
 

8407
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:52,709
becoming we'd be much more robust in our
pandemic preparedness

8408
02:17:52,709 --> 02:17:52,719
pandemic preparedness
 

8409
02:17:52,719 --> 02:17:53,509
pandemic preparedness
um

8410
02:17:53,509 --> 02:17:53,519
um
 

8411
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:54,389
um
and

8412
02:17:54,389 --> 02:17:54,399
and
 

8413
02:17:54,399 --> 02:17:57,509
and
meanwhile the budget uh

8414
02:17:57,509 --> 02:17:57,519
meanwhile the budget uh
 

8415
02:17:57,519 --> 02:17:59,830
meanwhile the budget uh
in the last two years for the u.s

8416
02:17:59,830 --> 02:17:59,840
in the last two years for the u.s
 

8417
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,790
in the last two years for the u.s
um sorry they just did this uh

8418
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:02,800
um sorry they just did this uh
 

8419
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:03,990
um sorry they just did this uh
i can't remember the name of what the

8420
02:18:03,990 --> 02:18:04,000
i can't remember the name of what the
 

8421
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,429
i can't remember the name of what the
actual budget was but it was like a

8422
02:18:05,429 --> 02:18:05,439
actual budget was but it was like a
 

8423
02:18:05,439 --> 02:18:07,349
actual budget was but it was like a
multi-trillion dollar budget that the us

8424
02:18:07,349 --> 02:18:07,359
multi-trillion dollar budget that the us
 

8425
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:08,790
multi-trillion dollar budget that the us
just set aside

8426
02:18:08,790 --> 02:18:08,800
just set aside
 

8427
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,389
just set aside
and originally in that you know

8428
02:18:10,389 --> 02:18:10,399
and originally in that you know
 

8429
02:18:10,399 --> 02:18:11,990
and originally in that you know
considering that covert cost multiple

02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:12,000
considering that covert cost multiple
 

8431
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,950
considering that covert cost multiple
trillions to the economy right

budget for future pandemic preparedness
 

8437
02:18:18,559 --> 02:18:22,549
budget for future pandemic preparedness
was 60 billion so tiny proportion of it

8438
02:18:22,549 --> 02:18:22,559
was 60 billion so tiny proportion of it
 

8439
02:18:22,559 --> 02:18:24,870
was 60 billion so tiny proportion of it
that proceeded to get whittled down to

8440
02:18:24,870 --> 02:18:24,880
that proceeded to get whittled down to
 

8441
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:25,750
that proceeded to get whittled down to
like

8442
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:25,760
like
 

8443
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,110
like
30 billion

8444
02:18:27,110 --> 02:18:27,120
30 billion
 

8445
02:18:27,120 --> 02:18:29,910
30 billion
to 15 billion all the way down to 2

8446
02:18:29,910 --> 02:18:29,920
to 15 billion all the way down to 2
 

8447
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,589
to 15 billion all the way down to 2
billion out of multiple trillions for a

billion out of multiple trillions for a
 

8449
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:33,429
billion out of multiple trillions for a
thing that has just cost us multiple

8450
02:18:33,429 --> 02:18:33,439
thing that has just cost us multiple
 

8451
02:18:33,439 --> 02:18:35,349
thing that has just cost us multiple
trillions we've just finished we barely

8452
02:18:35,349 --> 02:18:35,359
trillions we've just finished we barely
 

8453
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:37,349
trillions we've just finished we barely
even we're not even really out of it

8454
02:18:37,349 --> 02:18:37,359
even we're not even really out of it
 

8455
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:38,870
even we're not even really out of it
it basically got whittled down to

8456
02:18:38,870 --> 02:18:38,880
it basically got whittled down to
 

8457
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:40,230
it basically got whittled down to
nothing because for some reason people

8458
02:18:40,230 --> 02:18:40,240
nothing because for some reason people
 

8459
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:41,349
nothing because for some reason people
think that

8460
02:18:41,349 --> 02:18:41,359
think that
 

8461
02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:42,709
think that
all right we've got the pandemic out the

8462
02:18:42,709 --> 02:18:42,719
all right we've got the pandemic out the
 

8463
02:18:42,719 --> 02:18:44,469
all right we've got the pandemic out the
way that was that one

8464
02:18:44,469 --> 02:18:44,479
way that was that one
 

8465
02:18:44,479 --> 02:18:46,389
way that was that one
and the reason for that is that people

8466
02:18:46,389 --> 02:18:46,399
and the reason for that is that people
 

8467
02:18:46,399 --> 02:18:49,190
and the reason for that is that people
are and and i say this with all due

8468
02:18:49,190 --> 02:18:49,200
are and and i say this with all due
 

8469
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:50,150
are and and i say this with all due
respect to a lot of the science

8470
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:50,160
respect to a lot of the science
 

8471
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:51,830
respect to a lot of the science
community but they are there's an

8472
02:18:51,830 --> 02:18:51,840
community but they are there's an
 

8473
02:18:51,840 --> 02:18:54,950
community but they are there's an
immense amount of naivety about

8474
02:18:54,950 --> 02:18:54,960
immense amount of naivety about
 

8475
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:57,030
immense amount of naivety about
they they they think that nature is the

8476

they they they think that nature is the
 

8477
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:59,750
they they they think that nature is the
main risk moving forward and it really

8478
02:18:59,750 --> 02:18:59,760
main risk moving forward and it really
 

8479
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:00,709
main risk moving forward and it really
isn't

8480
02:19:00,709 --> 02:19:00,719
isn't
 

8481
02:19:00,719 --> 02:19:02,629
isn't
um and i think nothing demonstrates this

8482
02:19:02,629 --> 02:19:02,639
um and i think nothing demonstrates this
 

8483
02:19:02,639 --> 02:19:04,549
um and i think nothing demonstrates this
more than this uh this project that i

8484
02:19:04,549 --> 02:19:04,559
more than this uh this project that i
 

8485
02:19:04,559 --> 02:19:05,990
more than this uh this project that i
was just reading about that's sort of

8486
02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:06,000
was just reading about that's sort of
 

8487
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,389
was just reading about that's sort of
being proposed right now called um

8488
02:19:08,389 --> 02:19:08,399
being proposed right now called um
 

8489
02:19:08,399 --> 02:19:09,990

deep vision

8490
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:10,000
deep vision
 

8491
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,230
deep vision
and the idea is to go out into the wilds

8492
02:19:12,230 --> 02:19:12,240
and the idea is to go out into the wilds
 

8493
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:13,589
and the idea is to go out into the wilds
and we're not talking about it's like

8494
02:19:13,589 --> 02:19:13,599
and we're not talking about it's like
 

8495
02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:15,910
and we're not talking about it's like
you know within cities like deep into

8496
02:19:15,910 --> 02:19:15,920
you know within cities like deep into
 

8497
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:17,830
you know within cities like deep into
like caves that people don't go to deep

8498
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:17,840
like caves that people don't go to deep
 

8499
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:20,870
like caves that people don't go to deep
into the arctic wherever scour the earth

8500
02:19:20,870 --> 02:19:20,880
into the arctic wherever scour the earth
 

8501
02:19:20,880 --> 02:19:23,110
into the arctic wherever scour the earth
for whatever the most dangerous possible

8502
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:23,120
for whatever the most dangerous possible
 

8503
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:26,389
for whatever the most dangerous possible
pathogens could be that they can find

8504
02:19:26,389 --> 02:19:26,399
pathogens could be that they can find
 

8505
02:19:26,399 --> 02:19:27,669
pathogens could be that they can find
and then

8506
02:19:27,669 --> 02:19:27,679
and then
 

8507
02:19:27,679 --> 02:19:29,830
and then
not only do you know try and find these

8508
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:29,840
not only do you know try and find these
 

8509
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,349
not only do you know try and find these
bring samples of them back to

8510
02:19:31,349 --> 02:19:31,359
bring samples of them back to
 

8511
02:19:31,359 --> 02:19:32,950
bring samples of them back to
laboratories

8512
02:19:32,950 --> 02:19:32,960
laboratories
 

8513
02:19:32,960 --> 02:19:34,469
laboratories
and again whether you think covered with

8514
02:19:34,469 --> 02:19:34,479
and again whether you think covered with
 

8515
02:19:34,479 --> 02:19:36,070
and again whether you think covered with
a lab leak or not

8516
02:19:36,070 --> 02:19:36,080
a lab leak or not
 

8517
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,669
a lab leak or not
i'm not going to get into that but we

8518
02:19:37,669 --> 02:19:37,679
i'm not going to get into that but we
 

8519
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:39,669
i'm not going to get into that but we
have historically had so many as a

8520
02:19:39,669 --> 02:19:39,679
have historically had so many as a
 

8521
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:42,469
have historically had so many as a
civilization we've had so many lab leaks

8522
02:19:42,469 --> 02:19:42,479
civilization we've had so many lab leaks
 

8523
02:19:42,479 --> 02:19:43,750
civilization we've had so many lab leaks
from even like the highest level

8524
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:43,760
from even like the highest level
 

8525
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:46,549
from even like the highest level
security things like it it just it

8526
02:19:46,549 --> 02:19:46,559
security things like it it just it
 

8527
02:19:46,559 --> 02:19:47,589
security things like it it just it
people should go and just read it it's

8528
02:19:47,589 --> 02:19:47,599
people should go and just read it it's
 

8529
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:49,910
people should go and just read it it's
like it's like a comedy show of just how

8530
02:19:49,910 --> 02:19:49,920
like it's like a comedy show of just how
 

8531
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:51,910
like it's like a comedy show of just how
many they are how leaky these these labs

8532
02:19:51,910 --> 02:19:51,920
many they are how leaky these these labs
 

8533
02:19:51,920 --> 02:19:53,830
many they are how leaky these these labs
are even when they do their best efforts

8534
02:19:53,830 --> 02:19:53,840
are even when they do their best efforts
 

8535
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,990
are even when they do their best efforts
um so bring these things then back to

8536
02:19:55,990 --> 02:19:56,000
um so bring these things then back to
 

8537
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,349
um so bring these things then back to
civilization

8538
02:19:57,349 --> 02:19:57,359
civilization
 

8539
02:19:57,359 --> 02:19:59,750
civilization
that's step one of the badness the the

8540
02:19:59,750 --> 02:19:59,760
that's step one of the badness the the
 

8541
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:01,670
that's step one of the badness the the
next plan the next step would be to then

8542
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:01,680
next plan the next step would be to then
 

8543
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:03,670
next plan the next step would be to then
categorize them do experiments on them

8544
02:20:03,670 --> 02:20:03,680
categorize them do experiments on them
 

8545
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:05,270
categorize them do experiments on them
and categorize them by their level of

8546
02:20:05,270 --> 02:20:05,280
and categorize them by their level of
 

8547
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:07,750
and categorize them by their level of
potential pandemic lethality

8548
02:20:07,750 --> 02:20:07,760
potential pandemic lethality
 

8549
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:09,910
potential pandemic lethality
and then the piece of resistance on this

8550
02:20:09,910 --> 02:20:09,920
and then the piece of resistance on this
 

8551
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:13,349
and then the piece of resistance on this
plan is to then publish that information

8552
02:20:13,349 --> 02:20:13,359
plan is to then publish that information
 

8553
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:15,190
plan is to then publish that information
freely on the internet about all these

8554
02:20:15,190 --> 02:20:15,200
freely on the internet about all these
 

8555
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:16,870
freely on the internet about all these
pathogens including their genome which

8556
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:16,880
pathogens including their genome which
 

8557
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,230
pathogens including their genome which
is literally like the building

8558
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:18,240
is literally like the building
 

8559
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:19,990
is literally like the building
instructions of how to do them

8560
02:20:19,990 --> 02:20:20,000
instructions of how to do them
 

8561
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,750
instructions of how to do them
on the internet and this is something

8562
02:20:21,750 --> 02:20:21,760
on the internet and this is something
 

8563
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:23,830
on the internet and this is something
that genuinely

8564
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:23,840
that genuinely
 

8565
02:20:23,840 --> 02:20:26,550
that genuinely
a pocket of the like bio

8566
02:20:26,550 --> 02:20:26,560
a pocket of the like bio
 

8567
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:28,469
a pocket of the like bio
of the scientific community thinks is a

8568
02:20:28,469 --> 02:20:28,479
of the scientific community thinks is a
 

8569
02:20:28,479 --> 02:20:29,670
of the scientific community thinks is a
good idea

8570
02:20:29,670 --> 02:20:29,680
good idea
 

8571
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:32,070
good idea
and i think on expectation like the and

8572
02:20:32,070 --> 02:20:32,080
and i think on expectation like the and
 

8573
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:33,990
and i think on expectation like the and
their argument is is that oh this is

8574
02:20:33,990 --> 02:20:34,000
their argument is is that oh this is
 

8575
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,670
their argument is is that oh this is
good because you know it might buy us

8576
02:20:35,670 --> 02:20:35,680
good because you know it might buy us
 

8577
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:36,870
good because you know it might buy us
some time to buy

8578
02:20:36,870 --> 02:20:36,880
some time to buy
 

8579
02:20:36,880 --> 02:20:39,429
some time to buy
to development vaccines which okay sure

8580
02:20:39,429 --> 02:20:39,439
to development vaccines which okay sure
 

8581
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:41,030
to development vaccines which okay sure
maybe would have made sense prior to

8582
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:41,040
maybe would have made sense prior to
 

8583
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:43,270
maybe would have made sense prior to
mrna technology but you know like they

8584
02:20:43,270 --> 02:20:43,280
mrna technology but you know like they
 

8585
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:45,590
mrna technology but you know like they
mrna we can bank we can develop a

8586
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:45,600
mrna we can bank we can develop a
 

8587
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:48,150
mrna we can bank we can develop a
vaccine now when we find a new uh

8588
02:20:48,150 --> 02:20:48,160
vaccine now when we find a new uh
 

8589
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:49,990
vaccine now when we find a new uh
pathogen within a couple of days now

8590
02:20:49,990 --> 02:20:50,000
pathogen within a couple of days now
 

8591
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,030
pathogen within a couple of days now
then there's all the trials and so on

8592
02:20:51,030 --> 02:20:51,040
then there's all the trials and so on
 

8593
02:20:51,040 --> 02:20:52,389
then there's all the trials and so on
but those trials would have to happen

8594
02:20:52,389 --> 02:20:52,399
but those trials would have to happen
 

8595
02:20:52,399 --> 02:20:54,309
but those trials would have to happen
anyway in the case of a brand new thing

8596
02:20:54,309 --> 02:20:54,319
anyway in the case of a brand new thing
 

8597
02:20:54,319 --> 02:20:56,230
anyway in the case of a brand new thing
so you're saving maybe a couple of days

8598
02:20:56,230 --> 02:20:56,240
so you're saving maybe a couple of days
 

8599
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:57,990
so you're saving maybe a couple of days
so that's the upside meanwhile the

8600
02:20:57,990 --> 02:20:58,000
so that's the upside meanwhile the
 

8601
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,190
so that's the upside meanwhile the
downside is you're not only giving

8602
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:01,200
downside is you're not only giving
 

8603
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:02,630
downside is you're not only giving
you're bringing the risk of these

8604
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:02,640
you're bringing the risk of these
 

8605
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:03,990
you're bringing the risk of these
pathogens of like getting leaked but

8606
02:21:03,990 --> 02:21:04,000
pathogens of like getting leaked but
 

8607
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,309
pathogens of like getting leaked but
you're literally handing it out

8608
02:21:06,309 --> 02:21:06,319
you're literally handing it out
 

8609
02:21:06,319 --> 02:21:07,110
you're literally handing it out
to

8610
02:21:07,110 --> 02:21:07,120
to
 

8611
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:09,110
to
every bad actor on earth who would be

8612
02:21:09,110 --> 02:21:09,120
every bad actor on earth who would be
 

8613
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:10,790
every bad actor on earth who would be
doing cartwheels and i'm talking about

8614
02:21:10,790 --> 02:21:10,800
doing cartwheels and i'm talking about
 

8615
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:12,389
doing cartwheels and i'm talking about
like kim jong-un

8616
02:21:12,389 --> 02:21:12,399
like kim jong-un
 

8617
02:21:12,399 --> 02:21:15,429
like kim jong-un
isis people who like want they think the

8618
02:21:15,429 --> 02:21:15,439
isis people who like want they think the
 

8619
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:17,429
isis people who like want they think the
rest of the world is their enemy um and

02:21:17,429 --> 02:21:17,439
rest of the world is their enemy um and
 

8621
02:21:17,439 --> 02:21:19,030
rest of the world is their enemy um and
in some cases they think that killing it

8622
02:21:19,030 --> 02:21:19,040
in some cases they think that killing it
 

8623
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:22,469
in some cases they think that killing it
themselves is is is like a noble cause

8624
02:21:22,469 --> 02:21:22,479
themselves is is is like a noble cause
 

8625
02:21:22,479 --> 02:21:23,670
themselves is is is like a noble cause
and you're literally giving them the

8626
02:21:23,670 --> 02:21:23,680
and you're literally giving them the
 

8627
02:21:23,680 --> 02:21:24,950
and you're literally giving them the
building blocks of how to do this it's

8628
02:21:24,950 --> 02:21:24,960
building blocks of how to do this it's
 

8629
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:27,110
building blocks of how to do this it's
the most batshit i'd ever heard like on

8630
02:21:27,110 --> 02:21:27,120
the most batshit i'd ever heard like on
 

8631
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:29,429
the most batshit i'd ever heard like on
expectation it's probably like minus ev

8632
02:21:29,429 --> 02:21:29,439
expectation it's probably like minus ev
 

8633
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:31,590
expectation it's probably like minus ev
of like multiple billions of lives if

8634
02:21:31,590 --> 02:21:31,600
of like multiple billions of lives if
 

8635
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,270
of like multiple billions of lives if
they actually succeeded in doing this

8636
02:21:33,270 --> 02:21:33,280
they actually succeeded in doing this
 

8637
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:34,550
they actually succeeded in doing this
certainly certainly in the tens or

8638
02:21:34,550 --> 02:21:34,560
certainly certainly in the tens or
 

8639
02:21:34,560 --> 02:21:36,630
certainly certainly in the tens or
hundreds of millions so the cost benefit

8640
02:21:36,630 --> 02:21:36,640
hundreds of millions so the cost benefit
 

8641
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:39,510
hundreds of millions so the cost benefit
is so unbelievably it makes no sense and

8642
02:21:39,510 --> 02:21:39,520
is so unbelievably it makes no sense and
 

8643
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:41,030
is so unbelievably it makes no sense and
i was like trying to wrap my head around

8644
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:41,040
i was like trying to wrap my head around
 

8645
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,110
i was like trying to wrap my head around

what's going wrong in people's minds to

you know the proponents they don't
 

8661
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:58,790
you know the proponents they don't
it they're actually overly naive about

like that that there are bad actors who

8666
02:22:02,870 --> 02:22:02,880
like that that there are bad actors who
 

8667
02:22:02,880 --> 02:22:05,110
like that that there are bad actors who
will use this for bad things because not

8668
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,120
will use this for bad things because not
 

8669
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:07,270
will use this for bad things because not
only will it um

8670
02:22:07,270 --> 02:22:07,280
only will it um
 

8671
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:09,349
only will it um
if you publish this information even if

if you publish this information even if
 

8673
02:22:09,359 --> 02:22:11,190
if you publish this information even if
a bad actor couldn't physically make it

8674
02:22:11,190 --> 02:22:11,200
a bad actor couldn't physically make it
 

8675
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:13,429
a bad actor couldn't physically make it
themselves which given you know in 10

8676
02:22:13,429 --> 02:22:13,439
themselves which given you know in 10
 

8677
02:22:13,439 --> 02:22:14,790
themselves which given you know in 10
years time like

8678
02:22:14,790 --> 02:22:14,800
years time like
 

8679
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:16,070
years time like
the technologies are getting cheaper and

8680
02:22:16,070 --> 02:22:16,080
the technologies are getting cheaper and
 

8681
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:18,309
the technologies are getting cheaper and
easier uh to use but even if they

8682
02:22:18,309 --> 02:22:18,319
easier uh to use but even if they
 

8683
02:22:18,319 --> 02:22:20,150
easier uh to use but even if they
couldn't make it they could now bluff it

8684
02:22:20,150 --> 02:22:20,160
couldn't make it they could now bluff it
 

8685
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:21,429
couldn't make it they could now bluff it
like what would you do if there's like

8686
02:22:21,429 --> 02:22:21,439
like what would you do if there's like
 

8687
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:24,389
like what would you do if there's like
some deadly new virus that um

8688
02:22:24,389 --> 02:22:24,399
some deadly new virus that um
 

8689
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:26,070
some deadly new virus that um
we were published on the internet in

8690
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:26,080
we were published on the internet in
 

8691
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:27,990
we were published on the internet in
terms of its building blocks kim jong-un

8692
02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:28,000
terms of its building blocks kim jong-un
 

8693
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,070
terms of its building blocks kim jong-un
could be like hey if you don't you know

8694
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:30,080
could be like hey if you don't you know
 

8695
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:31,590
could be like hey if you don't you know
let me build my nuclear weapons i'm

8696
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:31,600
let me build my nuclear weapons i'm
 

8697
02:22:31,600 --> 02:22:32,710
let me build my nuclear weapons i'm
going to release this i've managed to

8698
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:32,720
going to release this i've managed to
 

8699
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:34,550
going to release this i've managed to
build it well now he's actually got

8700
02:22:34,550 --> 02:22:34,560
build it well now he's actually got
 

8701
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:36,309
build it well now he's actually got
incredible bluff we don't know you know

8702
02:22:36,309 --> 02:22:36,319
incredible bluff we don't know you know
 

8703
02:22:36,319 --> 02:22:38,550
incredible bluff we don't know you know
and so that's it's just like handing the

8704
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:38,560
and so that's it's just like handing the
 

8705
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:40,710
and so that's it's just like handing the
keys sending weapons of mass destruction

8706
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:40,720
keys sending weapons of mass destruction
 

8707
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:41,830
keys sending weapons of mass destruction
to people

8708
02:22:41,830 --> 02:22:41,840
to people
 

8709
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:43,750
to people
though makes no sense the possible i

8710
02:22:43,750 --> 02:22:43,760
though makes no sense the possible i
 

8711
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:46,070
though makes no sense the possible i
agree with you but the possible

8712
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:46,080
agree with you but the possible
 

8713
02:22:46,080 --> 02:22:48,230
agree with you but the possible
world in which you might make sense

8714
02:22:48,230 --> 02:22:48,240
world in which you might make sense
 

8715
02:22:48,240 --> 02:22:51,190
world in which you might make sense
is if the um

8716
02:22:51,190 --> 02:22:51,200
is if the um
 

8717
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:52,950
is if the um
the good guys which is a whole another

8718
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:52,960
the good guys which is a whole another
 

8719
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:55,349
the good guys which is a whole another
problem defining who the good guys are

8720
02:22:55,349 --> 02:22:55,359
problem defining who the good guys are
 

8721
02:22:55,359 --> 02:22:58,150
problem defining who the good guys are
but the good guys are like

8722
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:58,160
but the good guys are like
 

8723
02:22:58,160 --> 02:23:01,670
but the good guys are like
an order of magnitude higher competence

8724
02:23:01,670 --> 02:23:01,680
an order of magnitude higher competence
 

8725
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:03,830
an order of magnitude higher competence
and so they can stay

8726
02:23:03,830 --> 02:23:03,840
and so they can stay
 

8727
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:04,870
and so they can stay
ahead

8728
02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:04,880
ahead
 

8729
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,630
ahead
of the bad actors

8730
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:06,640
of the bad actors
 

8731
02:23:06,640 --> 02:23:10,150
of the bad actors
by just being very good at the defense

8732
02:23:10,150 --> 02:23:10,160
by just being very good at the defense
 

8733
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:13,030
by just being very good at the defense
by very good not meaning like a little

8734
02:23:13,030 --> 02:23:13,040
by very good not meaning like a little
 

8735
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,870
by very good not meaning like a little
bit better but an order of magnitude

8736
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:14,880
bit better but an order of magnitude
 

8737
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:15,830
bit better but an order of magnitude
better

8738
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:15,840
better
 

8739
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:17,590
better
but of course the question is in each of

8740
02:23:17,590 --> 02:23:17,600
but of course the question is in each of
 

8741
02:23:17,600 --> 02:23:20,150
but of course the question is in each of
those individual disciplines

8742
02:23:20,150 --> 02:23:20,160
those individual disciplines
 

8743
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:22,950
those individual disciplines
is that feasible can you can the bad

8744
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:22,960
is that feasible can you can the bad
 

8745
02:23:22,960 --> 02:23:24,230
is that feasible can you can the bad
actors even if they don't have the

8746
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:24,240
actors even if they don't have the
 

8747
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:27,670
actors even if they don't have the
competence leap frog to the place where

8748
02:23:27,670 --> 02:23:27,680
competence leap frog to the place where
 

8749
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:29,590
competence leap frog to the place where
uh the good guys are

8750
02:23:29,590 --> 02:23:29,600
uh the good guys are
 

8751
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:31,510
uh the good guys are
yeah i mean i would agree in principle

8752
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:31,520
yeah i mean i would agree in principle
 

8753
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:32,710
yeah i mean i would agree in principle
um

8754
02:23:32,710 --> 02:23:32,720
um
 

8755
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:34,630
um
with pertaining to this like particular

8756
02:23:34,630 --> 02:23:34,640
with pertaining to this like particular
 

8757
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:37,110
with pertaining to this like particular
plan of like

8758
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:37,120
plan of like
 

8759
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:38,389
plan of like
that you know with the thing i described

8760
02:23:38,389 --> 02:23:38,399
that you know with the thing i described
 

8761
02:23:38,399 --> 02:23:39,510
that you know with the thing i described
this deep vision thing where at least

8762
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:39,520
this deep vision thing where at least
 

8763
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:41,190
this deep vision thing where at least
then that would maybe make sense for

8764
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:41,200
then that would maybe make sense for
 

8765
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:42,710
then that would maybe make sense for
steps one and step two of like getting

8766
02:23:42,710 --> 02:23:42,720
steps one and step two of like getting
 

8767
02:23:42,720 --> 02:23:44,150
steps one and step two of like getting
the information but then

8768
02:23:44,150 --> 02:23:44,160
the information but then
 

8769
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:46,070
the information but then
why would you release it the information

8770
02:23:46,070 --> 02:23:46,080
why would you release it the information
 

8771
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:47,910
why would you release it the information
to your literal enemies you know that's

8772
02:23:47,910 --> 02:23:47,920
to your literal enemies you know that's
 

8773
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:48,950
to your literal enemies you know that's
that makes

8774
02:23:48,950 --> 02:23:48,960
that makes
 

8775
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:49,830
that makes
that

8776
02:23:49,830 --> 02:23:49,840
that
 

8777
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:51,910
that
that doesn't fit at all in that

8778
02:23:51,910 --> 02:23:51,920
that doesn't fit at all in that
 

8779
02:23:51,920 --> 02:23:53,270
that doesn't fit at all in that
perspective of like trying to be ahead

8780
02:23:53,270 --> 02:23:53,280
perspective of like trying to be ahead
 

8781
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:54,309
perspective of like trying to be ahead
of them you're literally handing them

8782
02:23:54,309 --> 02:23:54,319
of them you're literally handing them
 

8783
02:23:54,319 --> 02:23:55,750
of them you're literally handing them
the weapon but there's different levels

8784
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:55,760
the weapon but there's different levels
 

8785
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:57,590
the weapon but there's different levels
of release right so

8786
02:23:57,590 --> 02:23:57,600
of release right so
 

8787
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:00,710
of release right so
uh there's the kind of secrecy where you

8788
02:24:00,710 --> 02:24:00,720
uh there's the kind of secrecy where you
 

8789
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:02,790
uh there's the kind of secrecy where you
don't give it to anybody but there's a

8790
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:02,800
don't give it to anybody but there's a
 

8791
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:05,349
don't give it to anybody but there's a
release where you incrementally give it

8792
02:24:05,349 --> 02:24:05,359
release where you incrementally give it
 

8793
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:06,070
release where you incrementally give it
to

8794
02:24:06,070 --> 02:24:06,080
to
 

8795
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:08,389
to
like major labs so it's not public

8796
02:24:08,389 --> 02:24:08,399
like major labs so it's not public
 

8797
02:24:08,399 --> 02:24:09,750
like major labs so it's not public
release but it's like you're giving it

8798
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:09,760
release but it's like you're giving it
 

8799
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:11,670
release but it's like you're giving it
to yeah there's different layers of

8800
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:11,680
to yeah there's different layers of
 

8801
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:13,510
to yeah there's different layers of
reasonability but but the problem there

8802
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:13,520
reasonability but but the problem there
 

8803
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:16,309
reasonability but but the problem there
is it's going to if if you go anywhere

8804
02:24:16,309 --> 02:24:16,319
is it's going to if if you go anywhere
 

8805
02:24:16,319 --> 02:24:18,230
is it's going to if if you go anywhere
beyond like complete secrecy it's going

8806
02:24:18,230 --> 02:24:18,240
beyond like complete secrecy it's going
 

8807
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:19,590
beyond like complete secrecy it's going
to leak

8808
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:19,600
to leak
 

8809
02:24:19,600 --> 02:24:20,870
to leak
that's the thing it's very hard to keep

8810
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:20,880
that's the thing it's very hard to keep
 

8811
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:23,349
that's the thing it's very hard to keep
secrets and so that's the information is

8812
02:24:23,349 --> 02:24:23,359
secrets and so that's the information is
 

8813
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:25,030
secrets and so that's the information is
so you might as well release it to the

8814
02:24:25,030 --> 02:24:25,040
so you might as well release it to the
 

8815
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:27,349
so you might as well release it to the
public it's that argument so you either

8816
02:24:27,349 --> 02:24:27,359
public it's that argument so you either
 

8817
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:29,510
public it's that argument so you either
go complete secrecy

8818
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:29,520
go complete secrecy
 

8819
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:31,670
go complete secrecy
or you release it to the public

8820
02:24:31,670 --> 02:24:31,680
or you release it to the public
 

8821
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:33,830
or you release it to the public
so which is essentially the same thing

8822
02:24:33,830 --> 02:24:33,840
so which is essentially the same thing
 

8823
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:35,990
so which is essentially the same thing
it's going to leak anyway

8824
02:24:35,990 --> 02:24:36,000
it's going to leak anyway
 

8825
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,309
it's going to leak anyway
if you don't do complete secrecy right

8826
02:24:38,309 --> 02:24:38,319
if you don't do complete secrecy right
 

8827
02:24:38,319 --> 02:24:39,270
if you don't do complete secrecy right
which is why you shouldn't get the

8828
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:39,280
which is why you shouldn't get the
 

8829
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:40,950
which is why you shouldn't get the
information in the first place yeah i

8830
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:40,960
information in the first place yeah i
 

8831
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:42,389
information in the first place yeah i
mean what in that

8832
02:24:42,389 --> 02:24:42,399
mean what in that
 

8833
02:24:42,399 --> 02:24:43,590
mean what in that
i think

8834
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:43,600
i think
 

8835
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:45,429
i think
well that's a solution yeah the solution

8836
02:24:45,429 --> 02:24:45,439
well that's a solution yeah the solution
 

8837
02:24:45,439 --> 02:24:46,469
well that's a solution yeah the solution
is either don't get the information in

8838
02:24:46,469 --> 02:24:46,479
is either don't get the information in
 

8839
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:48,230
is either don't get the information in
the first place or be

8840
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:48,240
the first place or be
 

8841
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:50,790
the first place or be
keep keep it incredibly

8842
02:24:50,790 --> 02:24:50,800
keep keep it incredibly
 

8843
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:53,510
keep keep it incredibly
incredibly contained see i think

8844
02:24:53,510 --> 02:24:53,520
incredibly contained see i think
 

8845
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:54,630
incredibly contained see i think
i think it really matters which

8846
02:24:54,630 --> 02:24:54,640
i think it really matters which
 

8847
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:56,070
i think it really matters which
discipline we're talking about so in the

8848
02:24:56,070 --> 02:24:56,080
discipline we're talking about so in the
 

8849
02:24:56,080 --> 02:24:58,950
discipline we're talking about so in the
case of biology i do think you're a very

8850
02:24:58,950 --> 02:24:58,960
case of biology i do think you're a very
 

8851
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:01,190
case of biology i do think you're a very
right we shouldn't even be

8852
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:01,200
right we shouldn't even be
 

8853
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:04,550
right we shouldn't even be
it should be forbidden to even like

8854
02:25:04,550 --> 02:25:04,560
it should be forbidden to even like
 

8855
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:06,070
it should be forbidden to even like
think about

8856
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,080
think about
 

8857
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:08,070
think about
that meaning don't coll don't just even

8858
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:08,080
that meaning don't coll don't just even
 

8859
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:11,030
that meaning don't coll don't just even
collect information but like don't do i

8860
02:25:11,030 --> 02:25:11,040
collect information but like don't do i
 

8861
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:12,710
collect information but like don't do i
mean gain a functional research is a

8862
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:12,720
mean gain a functional research is a
 

8863
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:14,710
mean gain a functional research is a
really iffy area

8864
02:25:14,710 --> 02:25:14,720
really iffy area
 

8865
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:16,309
really iffy area
like you start i mean it's all about

8866
02:25:16,309 --> 02:25:16,319
like you start i mean it's all about
 

8867
02:25:16,319 --> 02:25:18,070
like you start i mean it's all about
cost benefits right there are some

8868
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:18,080
cost benefits right there are some
 

8869
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,429
cost benefits right there are some
scenarios where i could imagine the cost

8870
02:25:19,429 --> 02:25:19,439
scenarios where i could imagine the cost
 

8871
02:25:19,439 --> 02:25:21,190
scenarios where i could imagine the cost
benefit of a gain of function research

8872
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:21,200
benefit of a gain of function research
 

8873
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:23,270
benefit of a gain of function research
is very very clear

8874
02:25:23,270 --> 02:25:23,280
is very very clear
 

8875
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,870
is very very clear
where you've evaluated all the potential

8876
02:25:24,870 --> 02:25:24,880
where you've evaluated all the potential
 

8877
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:26,790
where you've evaluated all the potential
risks factored in the probability that

8878
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:26,800
risks factored in the probability that
 

8879
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:28,389
risks factored in the probability that
things can go wrong and like you know

8880
02:25:28,389 --> 02:25:28,399
things can go wrong and like you know
 

8881
02:25:28,399 --> 02:25:30,070
things can go wrong and like you know
not only known unknowns but unknown

8882
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:30,080
not only known unknowns but unknown
 

8883
02:25:30,080 --> 02:25:32,230
not only known unknowns but unknown
unknowns as well tried to quantify that

8884
02:25:32,230 --> 02:25:32,240
unknowns as well tried to quantify that
 

8885
02:25:32,240 --> 02:25:33,830
unknowns as well tried to quantify that
and then even then it's like orders of

8886
02:25:33,830 --> 02:25:33,840
and then even then it's like orders of
 

8887
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:36,070
and then even then it's like orders of
magnitude better to do that i'm behind

8888
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:36,080
magnitude better to do that i'm behind
 

8889
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:37,750
magnitude better to do that i'm behind
that argument but the point is is that

8890
02:25:37,750 --> 02:25:37,760
that argument but the point is is that
 

8891
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:39,750
that argument but the point is is that
there's this like naivety that's

8892
02:25:39,750 --> 02:25:39,760
there's this like naivety that's
 

8893
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:40,950
there's this like naivety that's
preventing people from even doing the

8894
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:40,960
preventing people from even doing the
 

8895
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:42,790
preventing people from even doing the
cost benefit properly on a lot of the

8896
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:42,800
cost benefit properly on a lot of the
 

8897
02:25:42,800 --> 02:25:44,230
cost benefit properly on a lot of the
things because

8898
02:25:44,230 --> 02:25:44,240
things because
 

8899
02:25:44,240 --> 02:25:45,830
things because
you know the site this i i get it the

8900
02:25:45,830 --> 02:25:45,840
you know the site this i i get it the
 

8901
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:47,270
you know the site this i i get it the
science community there

8902
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:47,280
science community there
 

8903
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:48,870
science community there
again i don't want to bucket the science

8904
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:48,880
again i don't want to bucket the science
 

8905
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,630
again i don't want to bucket the science
community but like some people within

8906
02:25:50,630 --> 02:25:50,640
community but like some people within
 

8907
02:25:50,640 --> 02:25:52,630
community but like some people within
the science community just think that

8908
02:25:52,630 --> 02:25:52,640
the science community just think that
 

8909
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:54,309
the science community just think that
everyone's everyone's good and everyone

8910
02:25:54,309 --> 02:25:54,319
everyone's everyone's good and everyone
 

8911
02:25:54,319 --> 02:25:55,590
everyone's everyone's good and everyone
just cares about getting knowledge and

8912
02:25:55,590 --> 02:25:55,600
just cares about getting knowledge and
 

8913
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:56,870
just cares about getting knowledge and
doing the best for the world and

8914
02:25:56,870 --> 02:25:56,880
doing the best for the world and
 

8915
02:25:56,880 --> 02:25:58,150
doing the best for the world and
unfortunately that's not the case i wish

8916
02:25:58,150 --> 02:25:58,160
unfortunately that's not the case i wish
 

8917
02:25:58,160 --> 02:26:00,790
unfortunately that's not the case i wish
we lived in that world but we don't

8918
02:26:00,790 --> 02:26:00,800
we lived in that world but we don't
 

8919
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:02,790
we lived in that world but we don't
yeah i mean there's a lie listen i've

8920
02:26:02,790 --> 02:26:02,800
yeah i mean there's a lie listen i've
 

8921
02:26:02,800 --> 02:26:05,510
yeah i mean there's a lie listen i've
been criticizing the science community

8922
02:26:05,510 --> 02:26:05,520
been criticizing the science community
 

8923
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:07,910
been criticizing the science community
broadly quite a bit there's so many

8924
02:26:07,910 --> 02:26:07,920
broadly quite a bit there's so many
 

8925
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:09,830
broadly quite a bit there's so many
brilliant people that brilliance is

8926
02:26:09,830 --> 02:26:09,840
brilliant people that brilliance is
 

8927
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,510
brilliant people that brilliance is
somehow hindering sometimes because it

8928
02:26:11,510 --> 02:26:11,520
somehow hindering sometimes because it
 

8929
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:13,429
somehow hindering sometimes because it
has a bunch of blind spots and then you

8930
02:26:13,429 --> 02:26:13,439
has a bunch of blind spots and then you
 

8931
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:16,309
has a bunch of blind spots and then you
start to look at a history of science

8932
02:26:16,309 --> 02:26:16,319
start to look at a history of science
 

8933
02:26:16,319 --> 02:26:19,110
start to look at a history of science
how easily has been used by dictators to

8934
02:26:19,110 --> 02:26:19,120
how easily has been used by dictators to
 

8935
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:21,670
how easily has been used by dictators to
any conclusion they want and it's

8936
02:26:21,670 --> 02:26:21,680
any conclusion they want and it's
 

8937
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:24,230
any conclusion they want and it's
it's it's dark how you can use brilliant

8938
02:26:24,230 --> 02:26:24,240
it's it's dark how you can use brilliant
 

8939
02:26:24,240 --> 02:26:26,150
it's it's dark how you can use brilliant
people that like playing the little game

8940
02:26:26,150 --> 02:26:26,160
people that like playing the little game
 

8941
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:28,790
people that like playing the little game
of science because it is a fun game

8942
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:28,800
of science because it is a fun game
 

8943
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:29,990
of science because it is a fun game
you know you're building you're going to

8944
02:26:29,990 --> 02:26:30,000
you know you're building you're going to
 

8945
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,349
you know you're building you're going to
conferences you're building on top of

8946
02:26:31,349 --> 02:26:31,359
conferences you're building on top of
 

8947
02:26:31,359 --> 02:26:34,070
conferences you're building on top of
each other's ideas as breakthroughs hi i

8948
02:26:34,070 --> 02:26:34,080
each other's ideas as breakthroughs hi i
 

8949
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:36,070
each other's ideas as breakthroughs hi i
think i've realized how this particular

8950
02:26:36,070 --> 02:26:36,080
think i've realized how this particular
 

8951
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:37,750
think i've realized how this particular
molecule works and i could do this kind

8952
02:26:37,750 --> 02:26:37,760
molecule works and i could do this kind
 

8953
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:39,270
molecule works and i could do this kind
of experiment and everyone else is

8954
02:26:39,270 --> 02:26:39,280
of experiment and everyone else is
 

8955
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:41,030
of experiment and everyone else is
impressed ooh cool no i think you're

8956
02:26:41,030 --> 02:26:41,040
impressed ooh cool no i think you're
 

8957
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:42,389
impressed ooh cool no i think you're
wrong let me show you why you're wrong

8958
02:26:42,389 --> 02:26:42,399
wrong let me show you why you're wrong
 

8959
02:26:42,399 --> 02:26:44,070
wrong let me show you why you're wrong
and that little game everyone gets

8960
02:26:44,070 --> 02:26:44,080
and that little game everyone gets
 

8961
02:26:44,080 --> 02:26:46,150
and that little game everyone gets
really excited and they get excited or i

8962
02:26:46,150 --> 02:26:46,160
really excited and they get excited or i
 

8963
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:47,670
really excited and they get excited or i
came up with a pill that solves this

8964
02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:47,680
came up with a pill that solves this
 

8965
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,870
came up with a pill that solves this
problem and it's going to help a bunch

8966
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:48,880
problem and it's going to help a bunch
 

8967
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:50,550
problem and it's going to help a bunch
of people and i came up with a giant

8968
02:26:50,550 --> 02:26:50,560
of people and i came up with a giant
 

8969
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:53,510
of people and i came up with a giant
study that shows the exact probability

8970
02:26:53,510 --> 02:26:53,520
study that shows the exact probability
 

8971
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:54,870
study that shows the exact probability
it's going to help or not and you get

8972
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:54,880
it's going to help or not and you get
 

8973
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:56,950
it's going to help or not and you get
lost in this game and you forget to

8974
02:26:56,950 --> 02:26:56,960
lost in this game and you forget to
 

8975
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:58,070
lost in this game and you forget to
realize

8976
02:26:58,070 --> 02:26:58,080
realize
 

8977
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:00,870
realize
this game just like malik

8978
02:27:00,870 --> 02:27:00,880
this game just like malik
 

8979
02:27:00,880 --> 02:27:03,030
this game just like malik
it can have like

8980
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:03,040
it can have like
 

8981
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:04,630
it can have like
unintended yeah

unintended consequences that might
 

8985
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:11,030
unintended consequences that might
destroy human civilization right uh or

8986
02:27:11,030 --> 02:27:11,040
destroy human civilization right uh or
 

8987
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:14,389
destroy human civilization right uh or
or divide human civilization or have

a
 

8991
02:27:15,600 --> 02:27:18,150
a
geopolitical consequences i mean the the

8992
02:27:18,150 --> 02:27:18,160
geopolitical consequences i mean the the
 

8993
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:20,469
geopolitical consequences i mean the the
effects of i mean it's just so

02:27:20,469 --> 02:27:20,479
effects of i mean it's just so
 

8995

02:27:22,790 --> 02:27:22,800
the most destructive effects of covid
 

8997
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:24,469
the most destructive effects of covid
have nothing to do with the with the

02:27:24,469 --> 02:27:24,479
have nothing to do with the with the
 

8999

have nothing to do with the with the
biology of the virus it seems like uh

9000
02:27:27,110 --> 02:27:27,120
biology of the virus it seems like uh
 

9001
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:28,630
biology of the virus it seems like uh
it's i mean i could just list them

9002
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:28,640
it's i mean i could just list them
 

9003
02:27:28,640 --> 02:27:31,190
it's i mean i could just list them
forever but like one of them is the

9004
02:27:31,190 --> 02:27:31,200
forever but like one of them is the
 

9005
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,750
forever but like one of them is the
complete distrust of public institutions

9006
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:33,760
complete distrust of public institutions
 

9007
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,429
complete distrust of public institutions
uh the other one is because of that

9008
02:27:35,429 --> 02:27:35,439
uh the other one is because of that
 

9009
02:27:35,439 --> 02:27:37,110
uh the other one is because of that
public distrust i feel like if a much

9010
02:27:37,110 --> 02:27:37,120
public distrust i feel like if a much
 

9011
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:39,830
public distrust i feel like if a much
worse pandemic came along

9012
02:27:39,830 --> 02:27:39,840
worse pandemic came along
 

9013
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:42,389
worse pandemic came along
we as a world have not cried wolf

9014

vaccines it yeah everything
 

9021
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:51,590
vaccines it yeah everything
and they they won't be

9022
02:27:51,590 --> 02:27:51,600
and they they won't be
 

9023
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:53,670
and they they won't be
they'll distrust every single thing that

9024
02:27:53,670 --> 02:27:53,680
they'll distrust every single thing that
 

9025
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:55,349
they'll distrust every single thing that
any major institution is going to tell

9026
02:27:55,349 --> 02:27:55,359
any major institution is going to tell
 

9027
02:27:55,359 --> 02:27:56,790
any major institution is going to tell
them and

9028
02:27:56,790 --> 02:27:56,800
them and
 

9029
02:27:56,800 --> 02:27:59,349
them and
because that's the thing like that

9030
02:27:59,349 --> 02:27:59,359
because that's the thing like that
 

9031
02:27:59,359 --> 02:28:01,830
because that's the thing like that
there were certain actions

9032
02:28:01,830 --> 02:28:01,840
there were certain actions
 

9033
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:03,670
there were certain actions
made by

9034
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:03,680
made by
 

9035
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:06,070
made by
certain you know health public figures

9036
02:28:06,070 --> 02:28:06,080
certain you know health public figures
 

9037
02:28:06,080 --> 02:28:09,750
certain you know health public figures
where they told they very knowingly told

9038
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:09,760
where they told they very knowingly told
 

9039
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:11,510
where they told they very knowingly told
it was a white lie it was intended in

9040
02:28:11,510 --> 02:28:11,520
it was a white lie it was intended in
 

9041
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:13,670
it was a white lie it was intended in
the best possible ways such as

9042
02:28:13,670 --> 02:28:13,680
the best possible ways such as
 

9043
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:14,790
the best possible ways such as
you know

9044
02:28:14,790 --> 02:28:14,800
you know
 

9045
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:15,910
you know
early on

9046
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:15,920
early on
 

9047
02:28:15,920 --> 02:28:17,590
early on
when

9048
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:17,600
when
 

9049
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:18,950
when
there were there was clearly a shortage

9050
02:28:18,950 --> 02:28:18,960
there were there was clearly a shortage
 

9051
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:20,309
there were there was clearly a shortage
of masks

9052
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:20,319
of masks
 

9053
02:28:20,319 --> 02:28:21,750
of masks
and so they said to the public oh don't

9054
02:28:21,750 --> 02:28:21,760
and so they said to the public oh don't
 

9055
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:24,070
and so they said to the public oh don't
get masks they don't there's no evidence

9056
02:28:24,070 --> 02:28:24,080
get masks they don't there's no evidence
 

9057
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:25,990
get masks they don't there's no evidence
that they work there or the you know

9058
02:28:25,990 --> 02:28:26,000
that they work there or the you know
 

9059
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,510
that they work there or the you know
don't get them they don't work in fact

9060
02:28:27,510 --> 02:28:27,520
don't get them they don't work in fact
 

9061
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:29,270
don't get them they don't work in fact
it might even make it worse you might

9062
02:28:29,270 --> 02:28:29,280
it might even make it worse you might
 

9063
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:30,950
it might even make it worse you might
even spread it more like that that was a

9064
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:30,960
even spread it more like that that was a
 

9065
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:33,830
even spread it more like that that was a
real like stinker uh yeah no no there's

9066
02:28:33,830 --> 02:28:33,840
real like stinker uh yeah no no there's
 

9067
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:35,030
real like stinker uh yeah no no there's
a unless you know how to do it properly

9068
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:35,040
a unless you know how to do it properly
 

9069
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:35,990
a unless you know how to do it properly
you're gonna make that you're gonna get

9070
02:28:35,990 --> 02:28:36,000
you're gonna make that you're gonna get
 

9071
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,750
you're gonna make that you're gonna get
sicker or you're more likely to get the

9072
02:28:37,750 --> 02:28:37,760
sicker or you're more likely to get the
 

9073
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,349
sicker or you're more likely to get the
to catch the virus which is just

9074
02:28:39,349 --> 02:28:39,359
to catch the virus which is just
 

9075
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:41,270
to catch the virus which is just
absolute crap

9076
02:28:41,270 --> 02:28:41,280
absolute crap
 

9077
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:42,150
absolute crap
and

9078
02:28:42,150 --> 02:28:42,160
and
 

9079
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:43,750
and
they put that out there and it's pretty

9080
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:43,760
they put that out there and it's pretty
 

9081
02:28:43,760 --> 02:28:45,429
they put that out there and it's pretty
clear the reason why they did that was

9082
02:28:45,429 --> 02:28:45,439
clear the reason why they did that was
 

9083
02:28:45,439 --> 02:28:47,110
clear the reason why they did that was
because there was actually a shortage of

9084
02:28:47,110 --> 02:28:47,120
because there was actually a shortage of
 

9085
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:49,510
because there was actually a shortage of
masks and they really needed it for

9086
02:28:49,510 --> 02:28:49,520
masks and they really needed it for
 

9087
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:51,830
masks and they really needed it for
health workers which makes sense like i

9088
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:51,840
health workers which makes sense like i
 

9089
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:53,349
health workers which makes sense like i
agree like it you know but

9090
02:28:53,349 --> 02:28:53,359
agree like it you know but
 

9091
02:28:53,359 --> 02:28:54,469
agree like it you know but
the cost

9092
02:28:54,469 --> 02:28:54,479
the cost
 

9093
02:28:54,479 --> 02:28:57,270
the cost
of lying to the popul to the to the

9094
02:28:57,270 --> 02:28:57,280
of lying to the popul to the to the
 

9095
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:59,670
of lying to the popul to the to the
public when that then comes out

9096
02:28:59,670 --> 02:28:59,680
public when that then comes out
 

9097
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:00,950
public when that then comes out
people aren't as stupid as they think

9098
02:29:00,950 --> 02:29:00,960
people aren't as stupid as they think
 

9099
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:03,429
people aren't as stupid as they think
they are as a you know and that's that's

9100
02:29:03,429 --> 02:29:03,439
they are as a you know and that's that's
 

9101
02:29:03,439 --> 02:29:05,349
they are as a you know and that's that's
i think where this distrust of ex

9102
02:29:05,349 --> 02:29:05,359

02:34:03,670 --> 02:34:03,680
need to there's some freudian thing you
 

9419
02:34:03,680 --> 02:34:05,349
need to there's some freudian thing you
would need to deeply investigate with a

9420
02:34:05,349 --> 02:34:05,359
would need to deeply investigate with a
 

9421
02:34:05,359 --> 02:34:06,550
would need to deeply investigate with a
therapist

9422
02:34:06,550 --> 02:34:06,560
therapist
 

9423
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:10,630
therapist
okay what about ai are you worried about

9424
02:34:10,630 --> 02:34:10,640
okay what about ai are you worried about
 

9425
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:13,030
okay what about ai are you worried about
agi superintelligence systems or

9426
02:34:13,030 --> 02:34:13,040
agi superintelligence systems or
 

9427

yes i'm definitely worried about it

9432
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:19,760
yes i'm definitely worried about it
 

9433
02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:21,590
yes i'm definitely worried about it
but i feel kind of

9434
02:34:21,590 --> 02:34:21,600
but i feel kind of
 

9435
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:24,309
but i feel kind of
bipolar in the some days i wake up and

9436

bipolar in the some days i wake up and
 

9437
02:34:24,319 --> 02:34:25,990
bipolar in the some days i wake up and
i'm like you're excited about the future

9438
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:26,000
i'm like you're excited about the future
 

9439

well exactly i'm like wow we can unlock

9440
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:27,920
well exactly i'm like wow we can unlock
 

9441
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:29,429
well exactly i'm like wow we can unlock
the mysteries of the universe you know

9442
02:34:29,429 --> 02:34:29,439
the mysteries of the universe you know
 

9443
02:34:29,439 --> 02:34:32,710
the mysteries of the universe you know
escape the game um and

9444
02:34:32,710 --> 02:34:32,720
escape the game um and
 

9445
02:34:32,720 --> 02:34:34,630
escape the game um and
this this you know if because i spend

9446
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:34,640
this this you know if because i spend
 

9447
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:35,910
this this you know if because i spend
all my time thinking about these

9448
02:34:35,910 --> 02:34:35,920
all my time thinking about these
 

9449
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:37,429
all my time thinking about these
molecule problems that you know what

9450
02:34:37,429 --> 02:34:37,439
molecule problems that you know what
 

9451
02:34:37,439 --> 02:34:39,190
molecule problems that you know what
what is the solution to them

9452
02:34:39,190 --> 02:34:39,200
what is the solution to them
 

9453
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:40,870
what is the solution to them
well you know in some ways you need this

9454
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:40,880
well you know in some ways you need this
 

9455
02:34:40,880 --> 02:34:41,670
well you know in some ways you need this
like

9456
02:34:41,670 --> 02:34:41,680
like
 

9457
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:47,590
like
omni-benevolent omniscient omni-wise

9458
02:34:47,590 --> 02:34:47,600

 

9459
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:49,429

coordination mechanism that can like

9460
02:34:49,429 --> 02:34:49,439
coordination mechanism that can like
 

9461
02:34:49,439 --> 02:34:52,150
coordination mechanism that can like
make us all not do the the molecule

9462
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:52,160
make us all not do the the molecule
 

9463
02:34:52,160 --> 02:34:54,870
make us all not do the the molecule
thing uh or like provide the

9464
02:34:54,870 --> 02:34:54,880
thing uh or like provide the
 

9465
02:34:54,880 --> 02:34:56,309
thing uh or like provide the
infrastructure would redesign the system

9466
02:34:56,309 --> 02:34:56,319
infrastructure would redesign the system
 

9467
02:34:56,319 --> 02:34:57,670
infrastructure would redesign the system
so that it's not vulnerable to this

9468
02:34:57,670 --> 02:34:57,680
so that it's not vulnerable to this
 

9469
02:34:57,680 --> 02:35:00,950
so that it's not vulnerable to this
molecule process um and in some ways you

9470
02:35:00,950 --> 02:35:00,960
molecule process um and in some ways you
 

9471
02:35:00,960 --> 02:35:01,910
molecule process um and in some ways you
know that's that's the strongest

9472
02:35:01,910 --> 02:35:01,920
know that's that's the strongest
 

9473
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:03,910
know that's that's the strongest
argument to me for like the race to

9474
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:03,920
argument to me for like the race to
 

9475
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:05,990
argument to me for like the race to
build agi is that maybe you know we

9476
02:35:05,990 --> 02:35:06,000
build agi is that maybe you know we
 

9477
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:07,830
build agi is that maybe you know we
can't survive without it

9478
02:35:07,830 --> 02:35:07,840
can't survive without it
 

9479
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:09,910
can't survive without it
but the flip side to that

9480
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:09,920
but the flip side to that
 

9481
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:11,270
but the flip side to that
is

9482
02:35:11,270 --> 02:35:11,280
is
 

9483
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:12,389
is
the

9484
02:35:12,389 --> 02:35:12,399
the
 

9485
02:35:12,399 --> 02:35:13,830
the
the the the unfortunately now that

9486
02:35:13,830 --> 02:35:13,840
the the the unfortunately now that
 

9487
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:15,190
the the the unfortunately now that
there's multiple actors trying to build

9488
02:35:15,190 --> 02:35:15,200
there's multiple actors trying to build
 

9489
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:18,309
there's multiple actors trying to build
ai agi you know this is this was fine

9490
02:35:18,309 --> 02:35:18,319
ai agi you know this is this was fine
 

9491
02:35:18,319 --> 02:35:19,750
ai agi you know this is this was fine
ten years ago when it was just deep mind

9492
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:19,760
ten years ago when it was just deep mind
 

9493
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,030
ten years ago when it was just deep mind
but then other

9494
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:21,040
but then other
 

9495
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:22,469
but then other
companies started up and now it created

9496
02:35:22,469 --> 02:35:22,479
companies started up and now it created
 

9497
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:25,110
companies started up and now it created
a race dynamic now it's like that's the

9498
02:35:25,110 --> 02:35:25,120
a race dynamic now it's like that's the
 

9499
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:26,870
a race dynamic now it's like that's the
whole thing is it the same

9500
02:35:26,870 --> 02:35:26,880
whole thing is it the same
 

9501
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:28,710
whole thing is it the same
it's got the same problem it's like

9502
02:35:28,710 --> 02:35:28,720
it's got the same problem it's like
 

9503
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:30,710
it's got the same problem it's like
whichever company is the one that like

9504
02:35:30,710 --> 02:35:30,720
whichever company is the one that like
 

9505
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:32,870
whichever company is the one that like
optimizes for speed at the cost of

9506
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:32,880
optimizes for speed at the cost of
 

9507
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:34,230
optimizes for speed at the cost of
safety will get the competitive

9508
02:35:34,230 --> 02:35:34,240
safety will get the competitive
 

9509
02:35:34,240 --> 02:35:35,910
safety will get the competitive
advantage and so it will be the more

9510
02:35:35,910 --> 02:35:35,920
advantage and so it will be the more
 

9511
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,349
advantage and so it will be the more
likely the ones to build the adi you

9512
02:35:37,349 --> 02:35:37,359
likely the ones to build the adi you
 

9513
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:39,750
likely the ones to build the adi you
know and and that's the same cycle that

9514
02:35:39,750 --> 02:35:39,760
know and and that's the same cycle that
 

9515
02:35:39,760 --> 02:35:41,110
know and and that's the same cycle that
you're in and there's no clear solution

9516
02:35:41,110 --> 02:35:41,120
you're in and there's no clear solution
 

9517
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:43,110
you're in and there's no clear solution
to that because you can't just go like

9518
02:35:43,110 --> 02:35:43,120
to that because you can't just go like
 

9519
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:44,070
to that because you can't just go like
um

9520
02:35:44,070 --> 02:35:44,080
um
 

9521
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:45,190
um
slapping

9522
02:35:45,190 --> 02:35:45,200
slapping
 

9523
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:47,110
slapping
you know

9524
02:35:47,110 --> 02:35:47,120
you know
 

9525
02:35:47,120 --> 02:35:48,550
you know
if you go and try and like

9526
02:35:48,550 --> 02:35:48,560
if you go and try and like
 

9527
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:51,030
if you go and try and like
stop all the different companies

9528
02:35:51,030 --> 02:35:51,040
stop all the different companies
 

9529
02:35:51,040 --> 02:35:51,830
stop all the different companies
then

9530
02:35:51,830 --> 02:35:51,840
then
 

9531
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:54,469
then
it will you know the good ones will stop

9532
02:35:54,469 --> 02:35:54,479
it will you know the good ones will stop
 

9533
02:35:54,479 --> 02:35:56,070
it will you know the good ones will stop
because they're the ones you know within

9534
02:35:56,070 --> 02:35:56,080
because they're the ones you know within
 

9535
02:35:56,080 --> 02:35:57,670
because they're the ones you know within
you know within the west's reach but

9536
02:35:57,670 --> 02:35:57,680
you know within the west's reach but
 

9537
02:35:57,680 --> 02:35:59,429
you know within the west's reach but
then that leaves all the other ones to

9538
02:35:59,429 --> 02:35:59,439
then that leaves all the other ones to
 

9539
02:35:59,439 --> 02:36:00,550
then that leaves all the other ones to
continue and then they're even more

9540
02:36:00,550 --> 02:36:00,560
continue and then they're even more
 

9541
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:02,309
continue and then they're even more
likely so it's like it's a very

9542
02:36:02,309 --> 02:36:02,319
likely so it's like it's a very
 

9543
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:04,389
likely so it's like it's a very
difficult problem with no clean solution

9544
02:36:04,389 --> 02:36:04,399
difficult problem with no clean solution
 

9545
02:36:04,399 --> 02:36:05,349
difficult problem with no clean solution
um

9546
02:36:05,349 --> 02:36:05,359
um
 

9547
02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:06,309
um
and

9548
02:36:06,309 --> 02:36:06,319
and
 

9549
02:36:06,319 --> 02:36:09,750
and
you know at the same time you know i i

9550
02:36:09,750 --> 02:36:09,760
you know at the same time you know i i
 

9551
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:10,630
you know at the same time you know i i
know the

9552
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:10,640
know the
 

9553
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:11,990
know the
at least some of the folks at deepmind

9554
02:36:11,990 --> 02:36:12,000
at least some of the folks at deepmind
 

9555
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:12,950
at least some of the folks at deepmind
and they're incredible and they're

9556
02:36:12,950 --> 02:36:12,960
and they're incredible and they're
 

9557
02:36:12,960 --> 02:36:14,309
and they're incredible and they're
thinking about this they're very aware

9558
02:36:14,309 --> 02:36:14,319
thinking about this they're very aware
 

9559
02:36:14,319 --> 02:36:15,830
thinking about this they're very aware
of this problem and they're like you

9560
02:36:15,830 --> 02:36:15,840
of this problem and they're like you
 

9561
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:16,870
of this problem and they're like you
know

9562
02:36:16,870 --> 02:36:16,880
know
 

9563
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:18,150
know
i think some of the smartest people on

9564
02:36:18,150 --> 02:36:18,160
i think some of the smartest people on
 

9565
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:20,230
i think some of the smartest people on
earth yeah the the culture is important

9566
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:20,240
earth yeah the the culture is important
 

9567
02:36:20,240 --> 02:36:21,590
earth yeah the the culture is important
there because they are thinking about

9568
02:36:21,590 --> 02:36:21,600
there because they are thinking about
 

9569
02:36:21,600 --> 02:36:22,870
there because they are thinking about
that and they're

9570
02:36:22,870 --> 02:36:22,880
that and they're
 

9571
02:36:22,880 --> 02:36:24,870
that and they're
some of the best machine learning

9572
02:36:24,870 --> 02:36:24,880
some of the best machine learning
 

9573
02:36:24,880 --> 02:36:26,150
some of the best machine learning
engineers

9574
02:36:26,150 --> 02:36:26,160
engineers
 

9575
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:28,070
engineers
so it's possible to have a

9576
02:36:28,070 --> 02:36:28,080
so it's possible to have a
 

9577
02:36:28,080 --> 02:36:30,070
so it's possible to have a
a company or a community of people that

9578
02:36:30,070 --> 02:36:30,080
a company or a community of people that
 

9579
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:31,990
a company or a community of people that
are both great engineers and are

9580
02:36:31,990 --> 02:36:32,000
are both great engineers and are
 

9581
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,670
are both great engineers and are
thinking about the philosophical topics

9582
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:33,680
thinking about the philosophical topics
 

9583
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:34,950
thinking about the philosophical topics
exactly and importantly they're also

9584
02:36:34,950 --> 02:36:34,960
exactly and importantly they're also
 

9585
02:36:34,960 --> 02:36:36,550
exactly and importantly they're also
game theorists

9586
02:36:36,550 --> 02:36:36,560
game theorists
 

9587
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:38,150
game theorists
you know and because this is ultimately

9588
02:36:38,150 --> 02:36:38,160
you know and because this is ultimately
 

9589
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:40,070
you know and because this is ultimately
a game theory problem the thing this

9590
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:40,080
a game theory problem the thing this
 

9591
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:42,150
a game theory problem the thing this
this monologue mechanism and like you

9592
02:36:42,150 --> 02:36:42,160
this monologue mechanism and like you
 

9593
02:36:42,160 --> 02:36:45,190
this monologue mechanism and like you
know what this ra how do we voice

9594
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:45,200
know what this ra how do we voice
 

9595
02:36:45,200 --> 02:36:47,830
know what this ra how do we voice
arms race scenarios um you need people

9596
02:36:47,830 --> 02:36:47,840
arms race scenarios um you need people
 

9597
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:49,670
arms race scenarios um you need people
who aren't naive to be thinking about

9598
02:36:49,670 --> 02:36:49,680
who aren't naive to be thinking about
 

9599
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:51,030
who aren't naive to be thinking about
this and again like luckily there's a

9600
02:36:51,030 --> 02:36:51,040
this and again like luckily there's a
 

9601
02:36:51,040 --> 02:36:53,110
this and again like luckily there's a
lot of smart non-naive game theorists

9602
02:36:53,110 --> 02:36:53,120
lot of smart non-naive game theorists
 

9603
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:55,110
lot of smart non-naive game theorists
within within that group yes i'm

9604
02:36:55,110 --> 02:36:55,120
within within that group yes i'm
 

9605
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:57,190
within within that group yes i'm
concerned about it and i i think it's

9606
02:36:57,190 --> 02:36:57,200
concerned about it and i i think it's
 

9607
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:59,190
concerned about it and i i think it's
again a thing that we need

9608
02:36:59,190 --> 02:36:59,200
again a thing that we need
 

9609
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:01,590
again a thing that we need
people to be thinking about um in terms

9610
02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:01,600
people to be thinking about um in terms
 

9611
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:03,590
people to be thinking about um in terms
of like how do we create

9612
02:37:03,590 --> 02:37:03,600
of like how do we create
 

9613
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:05,270
of like how do we create
how do we mitigate the arms race

9614
02:37:05,270 --> 02:37:05,280
how do we mitigate the arms race
 

9615
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:07,270
how do we mitigate the arms race
dynamics and how do we

9616
02:37:07,270 --> 02:37:07,280
dynamics and how do we
 

9617
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:08,790
dynamics and how do we
solve

9618
02:37:08,790 --> 02:37:08,800
solve
 

9619
02:37:08,800 --> 02:37:10,710
solve
the thing of it's got boston calls it

9620
02:37:10,710 --> 02:37:10,720
the thing of it's got boston calls it
 

9621
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:14,309
the thing of it's got boston calls it
the orthogonality problem whereby

9622
02:37:14,309 --> 02:37:14,319
the orthogonality problem whereby
 

9623
02:37:14,319 --> 02:37:15,830
the orthogonality problem whereby
because obviously there's a chance you

9624
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:15,840
because obviously there's a chance you
 

9625
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:17,510
because obviously there's a chance you
know that the belief the hope is is that

9626
02:37:17,510 --> 02:37:17,520
know that the belief the hope is is that
 

9627
02:37:17,520 --> 02:37:18,469
know that the belief the hope is is that
you build something that's super

9628
02:37:18,469 --> 02:37:18,479
you build something that's super
 

9629
02:37:18,479 --> 02:37:19,670
you build something that's super
intelligent

9630
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:19,680
intelligent
 

9631
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:20,790
intelligent
and

9632
02:37:20,790 --> 02:37:20,800
and
 

9633
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:22,870
and
by definition of being super intelligent

9634
02:37:22,870 --> 02:37:22,880
by definition of being super intelligent
 

9635
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:25,349
by definition of being super intelligent
it will also become super wise and have

9636
02:37:25,349 --> 02:37:25,359
it will also become super wise and have
 

9637
02:37:25,359 --> 02:37:27,190
it will also become super wise and have
the wisdom to know what the right goals

9638
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:27,200
the wisdom to know what the right goals
 

9639
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:29,429
the wisdom to know what the right goals
are and hopefully those goals include

9640
02:37:29,429 --> 02:37:29,439
are and hopefully those goals include
 

9641
02:37:29,439 --> 02:37:32,630
are and hopefully those goals include
keeping humanity alive right um but

9642
02:37:32,630 --> 02:37:32,640
keeping humanity alive right um but
 

9643
02:37:32,640 --> 02:37:34,790
keeping humanity alive right um but
bostrom says that actually those two

9644
02:37:34,790 --> 02:37:34,800
bostrom says that actually those two
 

9645
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:37,190
bostrom says that actually those two
things you know um super intelligence

9646
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:37,200
things you know um super intelligence
 

9647
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:39,110
things you know um super intelligence
and super wisdom

9648
02:37:39,110 --> 02:37:39,120
and super wisdom
 

9649
02:37:39,120 --> 02:37:40,469
and super wisdom
aren't necessarily correlated they're

9650
02:37:40,469 --> 02:37:40,479
aren't necessarily correlated they're
 

9651
02:37:40,479 --> 02:37:42,870
aren't necessarily correlated they're
actually kind of orthogonal things and

9652
02:37:42,870 --> 02:37:42,880
actually kind of orthogonal things and
 

9653
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:44,150
actually kind of orthogonal things and
how do we make it so that they are

9654
02:37:44,150 --> 02:37:44,160
how do we make it so that they are
 

9655
02:37:44,160 --> 02:37:45,429
how do we make it so that they are
correlated how do we guarantee it

9656
02:37:45,429 --> 02:37:45,439
correlated how do we guarantee it
 

9657
02:37:45,439 --> 02:37:46,630
correlated how do we guarantee it
because we need it to be guaranteed

9658
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:46,640
because we need it to be guaranteed
 

9659
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:47,750
because we need it to be guaranteed
really to know that we're doing the

9660
02:37:47,750 --> 02:37:47,760
really to know that we're doing the
 

9661
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:50,790
really to know that we're doing the
thing safely but i think that like

9662
02:37:50,790 --> 02:37:50,800
thing safely but i think that like
 

9663
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:54,309
thing safely but i think that like
um merging of intelligence and wisdom

9664
02:37:54,309 --> 02:37:54,319
um merging of intelligence and wisdom
 

9665
02:37:54,319 --> 02:37:55,750
um merging of intelligence and wisdom
at least my hope is that this whole

9666
02:37:55,750 --> 02:37:55,760
at least my hope is that this whole
 

9667
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:56,870
at least my hope is that this whole
process

9668
02:37:56,870 --> 02:37:56,880
process
 

9669
02:37:56,880 --> 02:37:59,110
process
happens sufficiently slowly that we're

9670
02:37:59,110 --> 02:37:59,120
happens sufficiently slowly that we're
 

9671
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:01,990
happens sufficiently slowly that we're
constantly having these kinds of debates

9672
02:38:01,990 --> 02:38:02,000
constantly having these kinds of debates
 

9673
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,510
constantly having these kinds of debates
that we have enough time to um

9674
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:05,520
that we have enough time to um
 

9675
02:38:05,520 --> 02:38:07,190
that we have enough time to um
to figure out how to modify each version

9676
02:38:07,190 --> 02:38:07,200
to figure out how to modify each version
 

9677
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:08,469
to figure out how to modify each version
of the system as it becomes more and

9678
02:38:08,469 --> 02:38:08,479
of the system as it becomes more and
 

9679
02:38:08,479 --> 02:38:11,030
of the system as it becomes more and
more intelligent yes buying time is is a

9680
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,040
more intelligent yes buying time is is a
 

9681
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:12,389
more intelligent yes buying time is is a
good thing definitely anything that

9682
02:38:12,389 --> 02:38:12,399
good thing definitely anything that
 

9683
02:38:12,399 --> 02:38:15,349
good thing definitely anything that
slows everything down we just everyone

9684
02:38:15,349 --> 02:38:15,359
slows everything down we just everyone
 

9685
02:38:15,359 --> 02:38:17,270
slows everything down we just everyone
needs to chill out we've got

9686
02:38:17,270 --> 02:38:17,280
needs to chill out we've got
 

9687
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:21,429
needs to chill out we've got
millennia to figure this out yeah um

9688
02:38:21,429 --> 02:38:21,439
millennia to figure this out yeah um
 

9689
02:38:21,439 --> 02:38:23,190
millennia to figure this out yeah um
or at least

9690
02:38:23,190 --> 02:38:23,200
or at least
 

9691
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:24,070
or at least
at least

9692
02:38:24,070 --> 02:38:24,080
at least
 

9693
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:26,710
at least
um well it depends again it's some

9694
02:38:26,710 --> 02:38:26,720
um well it depends again it's some
 

9695
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:28,389
um well it depends again it's some
people think that you know we can't even

9696
02:38:28,389 --> 02:38:28,399
people think that you know we can't even
 

9697
02:38:28,399 --> 02:38:29,670
people think that you know we can't even
make it through the next few decades

9698
02:38:29,670 --> 02:38:29,680
make it through the next few decades
 

9699
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:33,030
make it through the next few decades
without having some kind of

9700
02:38:33,030 --> 02:38:33,040
without having some kind of
 

9701
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:34,550
without having some kind of
omni-wise

9702
02:38:34,550 --> 02:38:34,560
omni-wise
 

9703
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:36,630
omni-wise
coordination mechanism um and there's

9704
02:38:36,630 --> 02:38:36,640
coordination mechanism um and there's
 

9705
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:38,389
coordination mechanism um and there's
also an argument to that yeah i don't

9706
02:38:38,389 --> 02:38:38,399
also an argument to that yeah i don't
 

9707
02:38:38,399 --> 02:38:39,190
also an argument to that yeah i don't
know

9708
02:38:39,190 --> 02:38:39,200
know
 

9709
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:41,429
know
well there is uh i'm suspicious of that

9710
02:38:41,429 --> 02:38:41,439
well there is uh i'm suspicious of that
 

9711
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:43,590
well there is uh i'm suspicious of that
kind of thinking because it seems like

9712
02:38:43,590 --> 02:38:43,600
kind of thinking because it seems like
 

9713
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:46,070
kind of thinking because it seems like
the entirety of human history is

9714
02:38:46,070 --> 02:38:46,080
the entirety of human history is
 

9715
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:47,429
the entirety of human history is
has people in it that are like

9716
02:38:47,429 --> 02:38:47,439
has people in it that are like
 

9717
02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:49,190
has people in it that are like
predicting doom

9718
02:38:49,190 --> 02:38:49,200
predicting doom
 

9719
02:38:49,200 --> 02:38:50,870
predicting doom
uh or just around the corner there's

9720
02:38:50,870 --> 02:38:50,880
uh or just around the corner there's
 

9721
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:52,550
uh or just around the corner there's
something about us

9722
02:38:52,550 --> 02:38:52,560
something about us
 

9723
02:38:52,560 --> 02:38:53,590
something about us
that

9724
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:53,600
that
 

9725
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:57,190
that
is strangely attracted to that thought

9726
02:38:57,190 --> 02:38:57,200
is strangely attracted to that thought
 

9727
02:38:57,200 --> 02:38:59,670
is strangely attracted to that thought
it's almost like fun to think about the

9728
02:38:59,670 --> 02:38:59,680
it's almost like fun to think about the
 

9729
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:02,389
it's almost like fun to think about the
destruction of everything

9730
02:39:02,389 --> 02:39:02,399
destruction of everything
 

9731
02:39:02,399 --> 02:39:05,110
destruction of everything
just objectively speaking

9732
02:39:05,110 --> 02:39:05,120
just objectively speaking
 

9733
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:05,990
just objectively speaking
i've

9734
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:06,000
i've
 

9735
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,070
i've
talked and listened to a bunch of people

9736
02:39:08,070 --> 02:39:08,080
talked and listened to a bunch of people
 

9737
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:09,349
talked and listened to a bunch of people
and they are

9738
02:39:09,349 --> 02:39:09,359
and they are
 

9739
02:39:09,359 --> 02:39:12,070
and they are
gravitating towards that it's almost

9740
02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:12,080
gravitating towards that it's almost
 

9741
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:13,510
gravitating towards that it's almost
i think it's the same thing that people

9742
02:39:13,510 --> 02:39:13,520
i think it's the same thing that people
 

9743
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:15,590
i think it's the same thing that people
love about conspiracy theories

love about conspiracy theories
 

9745
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:17,590
love about conspiracy theories
is they love to be the person that kind

is they love to be the person that kind
 

9747

02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:20,469
of figured out
some deep

human civilization because then
i will be important right when in

i will be important right when in
 

9761
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:33,670
i will be important right when in

goes on
even after a nuclear war that will wipe

people for
years to come because of the sort of i

years to come because of the sort of i
 

9791
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:05,349
years to come because of the sort of i
mean the effects of a nuclear winter

9792
02:40:05,349 --> 02:40:05,359
mean the effects of a nuclear winter
 

9793
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:07,190
mean the effects of a nuclear winter
people will still survive

9794
02:40:07,190 --> 02:40:07,200
people will still survive
 

9795
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:09,429
people will still survive
life will still go on i mean it depends

9796
02:40:09,429 --> 02:40:09,439
life will still go on i mean it depends
 

9797
02:40:09,439 --> 02:40:11,429
life will still go on i mean it depends
on the kind of nuclear war but in in

9798
02:40:11,429 --> 02:40:11,439
on the kind of nuclear war but in in
 

9799
02:40:11,439 --> 02:40:13,349
on the kind of nuclear war but in in
case in yoko world it will still go on

9800
02:40:13,349 --> 02:40:13,359
case in yoko world it will still go on
 

9801
02:40:13,359 --> 02:40:15,429
case in yoko world it will still go on
that's one of the amazing things about

9802
02:40:15,429 --> 02:40:15,439
that's one of the amazing things about
 

9803

well what we don't yeah we don't want a
self-fulfilling prophecy yes that's

9814
02:40:26,870 --> 02:40:26,880
self-fulfilling prophecy yes that's
 

9815
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:29,349
self-fulfilling prophecy yes that's
exactly yes and i very much agree with

9816
02:40:29,349 --> 02:40:29,359
exactly yes and i very much agree with
 

9817
02:40:29,359 --> 02:40:31,990
exactly yes and i very much agree with
that and i you know even i have a slight

9818

that and i you know even i have a slight
 

9819
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,710
that and i you know even i have a slight
like feeling from the amount of time we

9820
02:40:34,710 --> 02:40:34,720
like feeling from the amount of time we
 

9821
02:40:34,720 --> 02:40:36,230
like feeling from the amount of time we
spent in this conversation talking about

9822
02:40:36,230 --> 02:40:36,240
spent in this conversation talking about
 

9823
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:37,750
spent in this conversation talking about
this because it's like

9824
02:40:37,750 --> 02:40:37,760
this because it's like
 

9825
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:38,550
this because it's like
you know

9826
02:40:38,550 --> 02:40:38,560
you know
 

9827
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:40,469
you know
is this even a net positive if it's like

9828
02:40:40,469 --> 02:40:40,479
is this even a net positive if it's like
 

9829
02:40:40,479 --> 02:40:43,270
is this even a net positive if it's like
making everyone feel oh

9830
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:43,280
making everyone feel oh
 

9831
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:44,870
making everyone feel oh
in some ways like making people imagine

9832
02:40:44,870 --> 02:40:44,880
in some ways like making people imagine
 

9833
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:46,389
in some ways like making people imagine
these bad scenarios can be a

9834
02:40:46,389 --> 02:40:46,399
these bad scenarios can be a
 

9835
02:40:46,399 --> 02:40:47,750
these bad scenarios can be a
self-fulfilling prophecy but at the same

9836
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:47,760
self-fulfilling prophecy but at the same
 

9837
02:40:47,760 --> 02:40:49,030
self-fulfilling prophecy but at the same
time

9838
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:49,040
time
 

9839
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:50,389
time
that's how

9840
02:40:50,389 --> 02:40:50,399
that's how
 

9841
02:40:50,399 --> 02:40:52,150
that's how
that's weighed off with at least

9842
02:40:52,150 --> 02:40:52,160
that's weighed off with at least
 

9843
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:54,150
that's weighed off with at least
making people aware of the problem

9844
02:40:54,150 --> 02:40:54,160
making people aware of the problem
 

9845
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:55,510
making people aware of the problem
and gets them thinking and i think

9846
02:40:55,510 --> 02:40:55,520
and gets them thinking and i think
 

9847
02:40:55,520 --> 02:40:56,710
and gets them thinking and i think
particularly you know the reason why i

9848
02:40:56,710 --> 02:40:56,720
particularly you know the reason why i
 

9849
02:40:56,720 --> 02:40:58,230
particularly you know the reason why i
want to talk about this to your audience

9850
02:40:58,230 --> 02:40:58,240
want to talk about this to your audience
 

9851
02:40:58,240 --> 02:40:59,349
want to talk about this to your audience
is that

9852
02:40:59,349 --> 02:40:59,359
is that
 

9853
02:40:59,359 --> 02:41:00,550
is that
on average they're the type of people

9854
02:41:00,550 --> 02:41:00,560
on average they're the type of people
 

9855
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:02,309
on average they're the type of people
who gravitate towards these kind of

9856
02:41:02,309 --> 02:41:02,319
who gravitate towards these kind of
 

9857
02:41:02,319 --> 02:41:03,190
who gravitate towards these kind of
topics because they they're

9858
02:41:03,190 --> 02:41:03,200
topics because they they're
 

9859
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:04,790
topics because they they're
intellectually curious and

9860
02:41:04,790 --> 02:41:04,800
intellectually curious and
 

9861
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:06,230
intellectually curious and
and they can sort of sense that there's

9862
02:41:06,230 --> 02:41:06,240
and they can sort of sense that there's
 

9863
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:08,389
and they can sort of sense that there's
trouble brewing yeah they can smell that

9864
02:41:08,389 --> 02:41:08,399
trouble brewing yeah they can smell that
 

9865
02:41:08,399 --> 02:41:09,590
trouble brewing yeah they can smell that
there's you know i think there's a

9866
02:41:09,590 --> 02:41:09,600
there's you know i think there's a
 

9867
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:10,950
there's you know i think there's a
reason people are thinking about this

9868
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:10,960
reason people are thinking about this
 

9869
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:12,309
reason people are thinking about this
stuff a lot is because

9870
02:41:12,309 --> 02:41:12,319
stuff a lot is because
 

9871
02:41:12,319 --> 02:41:14,070
stuff a lot is because
the probability

9872
02:41:14,070 --> 02:41:14,080
the probability
 

9873
02:41:14,080 --> 02:41:15,750
the probability
the probability you know it's increased

9874
02:41:15,750 --> 02:41:15,760
the probability you know it's increased
 

9875
02:41:15,760 --> 02:41:17,590
the probability you know it's increased
in probability over certainly over the

9876
02:41:17,590 --> 02:41:17,600
in probability over certainly over the
 

9877
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:18,790
in probability over certainly over the
last few years

9878
02:41:18,790 --> 02:41:18,800
last few years
 

9879
02:41:18,800 --> 02:41:21,510
last few years
um trajectories have not gone favorably

9880
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:21,520
um trajectories have not gone favorably
 

9881
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:24,950
um trajectories have not gone favorably
let's put it in you know since 2010. so

9882
02:41:24,950 --> 02:41:24,960
let's put it in you know since 2010. so
 

9883
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:27,510
let's put it in you know since 2010. so
um it's right i think for people to be

9884
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,520
um it's right i think for people to be
 

9885
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:29,190
um it's right i think for people to be
thinking about it but that's where

9886
02:41:29,190 --> 02:41:29,200
thinking about it but that's where
 

9887
02:41:29,200 --> 02:41:30,950
thinking about it but that's where
they're like i think whether it's a

9888
02:41:30,950 --> 02:41:30,960
they're like i think whether it's a
 

9889
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:32,550
they're like i think whether it's a
useful fiction or whether it's actually

9890
02:41:32,550 --> 02:41:32,560
useful fiction or whether it's actually
 

9891
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:34,389
useful fiction or whether it's actually
true or whatever you want to call it i

9892
02:41:34,389 --> 02:41:34,399
true or whatever you want to call it i
 

9893
02:41:34,399 --> 02:41:36,230
true or whatever you want to call it i
think having this faith this is where

9894
02:41:36,230 --> 02:41:36,240
think having this faith this is where
 

9895
02:41:36,240 --> 02:41:37,910
think having this faith this is where
faith is valuable

9896
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:37,920
faith is valuable
 

9897
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:39,510
faith is valuable
because it gives you at least this like

9898
02:41:39,510 --> 02:41:39,520
because it gives you at least this like
 

9899
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:41,030
because it gives you at least this like
anchor of hope

9900
02:41:41,030 --> 02:41:41,040
anchor of hope
 

9901
02:41:41,040 --> 02:41:42,870
anchor of hope

the sort of breathing room with which to
 

9925
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:07,990
the sort of breathing room with which to
marinate on the solutions we are the

9926
02:42:07,990 --> 02:42:08,000
marinate on the solutions we are the
 

9927
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,230
marinate on the solutions we are the
ones who have to come up with solutions

9928
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:10,240
ones who have to come up with solutions
 

9929
02:42:10,240 --> 02:42:12,950
ones who have to come up with solutions
but

9930
02:42:12,950 --> 02:42:12,960
but
 

9931
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:13,990
but
we

9932
02:42:13,990 --> 02:42:14,000
we
 

9933
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,389
we
can use that there's like this

9934
02:42:16,389 --> 02:42:16,399
can use that there's like this
 

9935
02:42:16,399 --> 02:42:19,190
can use that there's like this
hashtag positivity there's value in that

9936
02:42:19,190 --> 02:42:19,200
hashtag positivity there's value in that
 

9937
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:21,830
hashtag positivity there's value in that
yeah you have to kind of imagine all the

9938
02:42:21,830 --> 02:42:21,840
yeah you have to kind of imagine all the
 

9939
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:23,990
yeah you have to kind of imagine all the
destructive trajectories that lay in our

9940
02:42:23,990 --> 02:42:24,000
destructive trajectories that lay in our
 

9941
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,630
destructive trajectories that lay in our
future and then believe

9942
02:42:26,630 --> 02:42:26,640
future and then believe
 

9943
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:28,389
future and then believe
in the possibility of avoiding those

9944
02:42:28,389 --> 02:42:28,399
in the possibility of avoiding those
 

9945
02:42:28,399 --> 02:42:31,429
in the possibility of avoiding those
trajectories all while he's an

9946
02:42:31,429 --> 02:42:31,439
trajectories all while he's an
 

9947
02:42:31,439 --> 02:42:34,469
trajectories all while he's an
audience all while sitting back which is

9948
02:42:34,469 --> 02:42:34,479
audience all while sitting back which is
 

9949
02:42:34,479 --> 02:42:36,309
audience all while sitting back which is
majori the the two people that listen to

9950
02:42:36,309 --> 02:42:36,319
majori the the two people that listen to
 

9951
02:42:36,319 --> 02:42:38,630
majori the the two people that listen to
this are probably sitting in a beach

9952
02:42:38,630 --> 02:42:38,640
this are probably sitting in a beach
 

9953
02:42:38,640 --> 02:42:41,110
this are probably sitting in a beach
smoking some weed

9954
02:42:41,110 --> 02:42:41,120
smoking some weed
 

9955
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:43,030
smoking some weed
um

9956
02:42:43,030 --> 02:42:43,040
um
 

9957
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:45,030
um
that's a beautiful sunset or they're

9958
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:45,040
that's a beautiful sunset or they're
 

9959
02:42:45,040 --> 02:42:47,030
that's a beautiful sunset or they're
looking at just the waves going in and

9960
02:42:47,030 --> 02:42:47,040
looking at just the waves going in and
 

9961
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:47,750
looking at just the waves going in and
out

9962
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:47,760
out
 

9963
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:49,590
out
and ultimately there's a kind of deep

9964
02:42:49,590 --> 02:42:49,600
and ultimately there's a kind of deep
 

9965
02:42:49,600 --> 02:42:51,830
and ultimately there's a kind of deep
belief there and um

9966
02:42:51,830 --> 02:42:51,840
belief there and um
 

9967
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:54,070
belief there and um
the the momentum of humanity to figure

9968
02:42:54,070 --> 02:42:54,080
the the momentum of humanity to figure
 

9969
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:56,469
the the momentum of humanity to figure
it all out i think we'll make it

9970
02:42:56,469 --> 02:42:56,479
it all out i think we'll make it
 

9971
02:42:56,479 --> 02:42:58,469
it all out i think we'll make it
but we've got a lot of work to do which

9972
02:42:58,469 --> 02:42:58,479
but we've got a lot of work to do which
 

9973
02:42:58,479 --> 02:43:00,230
but we've got a lot of work to do which
is which what makes this whole

9974
02:43:00,230 --> 02:43:00,240
is which what makes this whole
 

9975
02:43:00,240 --> 02:43:03,270
is which what makes this whole

and that that one for people who don't
 

9985
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:13,270
and that that one for people who don't
know but uh battle polytopia is a it's a

9986
02:43:13,270 --> 02:43:13,280
know but uh battle polytopia is a it's a
 

9987
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:15,270
know but uh battle polytopia is a it's a
big it's like a

big it's like a
 

9989
02:43:15,280 --> 02:43:18,469
big it's like a

9994
02:43:24,230 --> 02:43:24,240
lot of the skill tree development a lot
 

9995
02:43:24,240 --> 02:43:26,070
lot of the skill tree development a lot
of the strategy

9996
02:43:26,070 --> 02:43:26,080
of the strategy
 

9997
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:27,110
of the strategy
um

9998
02:43:27,110 --> 02:43:27,120
um
 

9999
02:43:27,120 --> 02:43:29,830
um
but it's easy enough to play in a phone

10000
02:43:29,830 --> 02:43:29,840
but it's easy enough to play in a phone
 

10001

yeah it's kind of interesting they've

10002
02:43:31,190 --> 02:43:31,200
yeah it's kind of interesting they've
 

10003
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:33,110
yeah it's kind of interesting they've
really they've really figured it out

10004
02:43:33,110 --> 02:43:33,120
really they've really figured it out
 

10005
02:43:33,120 --> 02:43:34,309
really they've really figured it out
it's it's one of the most elegantly

10006
02:43:34,309 --> 02:43:34,319
it's it's one of the most elegantly
 

10007
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:36,150
it's it's one of the most elegantly
designed games i've ever seen it's

10008
02:43:36,150 --> 02:43:36,160
designed games i've ever seen it's
 

10009
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:37,830
designed games i've ever seen it's
incredibly complex

10010
02:43:37,830 --> 02:43:37,840
incredibly complex
 

10011
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:39,429
incredibly complex
and yet being again it walks that line

10012
02:43:39,429 --> 02:43:39,439
and yet being again it walks that line
 

10013
02:43:39,439 --> 02:43:40,950
and yet being again it walks that line
between complexity and simplicity in

10014
02:43:40,950 --> 02:43:40,960
between complexity and simplicity in
 

10015
02:43:40,960 --> 02:43:43,990
between complexity and simplicity in
this really really great way um

10016
02:43:43,990 --> 02:43:44,000
this really really great way um
 

10017
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,830
this really really great way um
and they use pretty colors that

10018
02:43:45,830 --> 02:43:45,840
and they use pretty colors that
 

10019
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:48,389
and they use pretty colors that
hack the dopamine reward circuits in our

10020
02:43:48,389 --> 02:43:48,399
hack the dopamine reward circuits in our
 

10021
02:43:48,399 --> 02:43:50,710
hack the dopamine reward circuits in our
brains very well yeah it's fun

10022
02:43:50,710 --> 02:43:50,720
brains very well yeah it's fun

02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:27,670
yeah um so it
like just

10266
02:47:27,670 --> 02:47:27,680
like just
 

10267

frankly it took me like a few months to
 

10271
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:33,110
frankly it took me like a few months to
sort of

10272

02:47:38,230 --> 02:47:38,240
um but my ear problem went away about a
 

10277
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:40,710
um but my ear problem went away about a
couple of weeks later and touchwood i've

10278
02:47:40,710 --> 02:47:40,720
couple of weeks later and touchwood i've
 

10279
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,950
couple of weeks later and touchwood i've
not had any issues since

10280

02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:44,800
so
 

10283
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:47,190
so
that gives you uh

10284
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:47,200
that gives you uh
 

10285
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:49,190
that gives you uh
like hints that maybe there's something

10286
02:47:49,190 --> 02:47:49,200
like hints that maybe there's something
 

10287
02:47:49,200 --> 02:47:50,870
like hints that maybe there's something
out there

10288
02:47:50,870 --> 02:47:50,880
out there
 

10289
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:51,750
out there
i mean

10290
02:47:51,750 --> 02:47:51,760
i mean
 

10291
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:53,670
i mean
i i don't i i again i don't have an

10292
02:47:53,670 --> 02:47:53,680
i i don't i i again i don't have an
 

10293
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:55,030
i i don't i i again i don't have an
explanation for this

10294
02:47:55,030 --> 02:47:55,040
explanation for this
 

10295
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:57,510
explanation for this
the most probable explanation was uh you

10296
02:47:57,510 --> 02:47:57,520
the most probable explanation was uh you
 

10297
02:47:57,520 --> 02:47:58,710
the most probable explanation was uh you
know i was a burning man i was in a very

10298
02:47:58,710 --> 02:47:58,720
know i was a burning man i was in a very
 

10299
02:47:58,720 --> 02:48:00,830
know i was a burning man i was in a very
open state let's just leave it at that

10300
02:48:00,830 --> 02:48:00,840
open state let's just leave it at that
 

10301
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:03,830
open state let's just leave it at that
um and

10302
02:48:03,830 --> 02:48:03,840
um and
 

10303
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:05,910
um and
you know

10304
02:48:05,910 --> 02:48:05,920
you know
 

10305
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:07,830
you know
placebo is an incredibly powerful thing

10306
02:48:07,830 --> 02:48:07,840
placebo is an incredibly powerful thing
 

10307
02:48:07,840 --> 02:48:10,710
placebo is an incredibly powerful thing
in a very not understood thing so almost

10308
02:48:10,710 --> 02:48:10,720
in a very not understood thing so almost
 

10309
02:48:10,720 --> 02:48:13,110
in a very not understood thing so almost
assigning the word placebo to it reduces

10310
02:48:13,110 --> 02:48:13,120
assigning the word placebo to it reduces
 

10311
02:48:13,120 --> 02:48:15,349
assigning the word placebo to it reduces
it down to a way that it doesn't deserve

10312
02:48:15,349 --> 02:48:15,359
it down to a way that it doesn't deserve
 

10313
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,110
it down to a way that it doesn't deserve
to be reduced down maybe there's a whole

10314
02:48:17,110 --> 02:48:17,120
to be reduced down maybe there's a whole
 

10315
02:48:17,120 --> 02:48:19,349
to be reduced down maybe there's a whole
science of what we call placebo maybe

10316
02:48:19,349 --> 02:48:19,359
science of what we call placebo maybe
 

10317
02:48:19,359 --> 02:48:20,230
science of what we call placebo maybe
there's a

10318
02:48:20,230 --> 02:48:20,240
there's a
 

10319
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:22,710
there's a
placebo is a door self-healing yeah you

10320
02:48:22,710 --> 02:48:22,720
placebo is a door self-healing yeah you
 

10321
02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:23,750
placebo is a door self-healing yeah you
know

10322
02:48:23,750 --> 02:48:23,760
know
 

10323
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:25,830
know
and i mean i don't know what the problem

10324
02:48:25,830 --> 02:48:25,840
and i mean i don't know what the problem
 

10325
02:48:25,840 --> 02:48:27,510
and i mean i don't know what the problem
was like i was told it was many years i

10326
02:48:27,510 --> 02:48:27,520
was like i was told it was many years i
 

10327
02:48:27,520 --> 02:48:29,190
was like i was told it was many years i
don't want to say i definitely had that

10328
02:48:29,190 --> 02:48:29,200
don't want to say i definitely had that
 

10329
02:48:29,200 --> 02:48:30,230
don't want to say i definitely had that
because i don't want people to think

10330
02:48:30,230 --> 02:48:30,240
because i don't want people to think
 

10331
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:31,590
because i don't want people to think
that oh that's how you know if they do

10332
02:48:31,590 --> 02:48:31,600
that oh that's how you know if they do
 

10333
02:48:31,600 --> 02:48:32,870
that oh that's how you know if they do
have that because it's terrible disease

10334
02:48:32,870 --> 02:48:32,880
have that because it's terrible disease
 

10335
02:48:32,880 --> 02:48:33,910
have that because it's terrible disease
and if they have that that this is going

10336
02:48:33,910 --> 02:48:33,920
and if they have that that this is going
 

10337
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:35,190
and if they have that that this is going
to be a guaranteed way for it to fix it

10338
02:48:35,190 --> 02:48:35,200
to be a guaranteed way for it to fix it
 

10339
02:48:35,200 --> 02:48:36,630
to be a guaranteed way for it to fix it
for them i don't know

10340
02:48:36,630 --> 02:48:36,640
for them i don't know
 

10341
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:37,510
for them i don't know
um

10342
02:48:37,510 --> 02:48:37,520
um
 

10343
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:39,830
um
and i also don't i don't

and i also don't i don't
 

10345
02:48:39,840 --> 02:48:41,190
and i also don't i don't
you're absolutely right to say like

10346
02:48:41,190 --> 02:48:41,200
you're absolutely right to say like
 

10347
02:48:41,200 --> 02:48:43,269
you're absolutely right to say like
using even the word placebo is like it

10348
02:48:43,269 --> 02:48:43,279
using even the word placebo is like it
 

10349
02:48:43,279 --> 02:48:46,230
using even the word placebo is like it
comes with this like baggage of

10350
02:48:46,230 --> 02:48:46,240
comes with this like baggage of
 

10351
02:48:46,240 --> 02:48:47,750
comes with this like baggage of
of like frame

10352
02:48:47,750 --> 02:48:47,760
of like frame
 

10353
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:49,910
of like frame
and i don't want to reduce it down all i

10354
02:48:49,910 --> 02:48:49,920
and i don't want to reduce it down all i
 

10355
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:51,670
and i don't want to reduce it down all i
can do is describe the experience and

10356
02:48:51,670 --> 02:48:51,680
can do is describe the experience and
 

10357
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:54,630
can do is describe the experience and
what happened i cannot put

10358
02:48:54,630 --> 02:48:54,640
what happened i cannot put
 

10359
02:48:54,640 --> 02:48:56,469
what happened i cannot put
an ontological framework around it i

10360
02:48:56,469 --> 02:48:56,479
an ontological framework around it i
 

10361
02:48:56,479 --> 02:48:58,790
an ontological framework around it i
can't say why it happened what the

10362
02:48:58,790 --> 02:48:58,800
can't say why it happened what the
 

10363
02:48:58,800 --> 02:49:01,030
can't say why it happened what the
mechanism was what the problem even was

10364
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:01,040
mechanism was what the problem even was
 

10365
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:02,389
mechanism was what the problem even was
in the first place

10366
02:49:02,389 --> 02:49:02,399
in the first place
 

10367
02:49:02,399 --> 02:49:04,230
in the first place
um i just know that something crazy

10368

happened and it was while i was in an
 

10371
02:49:06,240 --> 02:49:08,469
happened and it was while i was in an
open state and fortunately for me it

10372
02:49:08,469 --> 02:49:08,479
open state and fortunately for me it
 

10373
02:49:08,479 --> 02:49:10,230
open state and fortunately for me it
made the problem go away but what i took

10374
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:10,240
made the problem go away but what i took
 

10375
02:49:10,240 --> 02:49:13,110
made the problem go away but what i took
away from it again it was part of this

10376
02:49:13,110 --> 02:49:13,120
away from it again it was part of this
 

10377
02:49:13,120 --> 02:49:14,469
away from it again it was part of this
you know this took me on this journey of

10378
02:49:14,469 --> 02:49:14,479
you know this took me on this journey of
 

10379
02:49:14,479 --> 02:49:16,469
you know this took me on this journey of
becoming more humble about what i think

10380
02:49:16,469 --> 02:49:16,479
becoming more humble about what i think
 

10381
02:49:16,479 --> 02:49:18,309
becoming more humble about what i think
i know because as i said before i was

10382
02:49:18,309 --> 02:49:18,319
i know because as i said before i was
 

10383
02:49:18,319 --> 02:49:20,550
i know because as i said before i was
like i was in the like richard dawkins

10384
02:49:20,550 --> 02:49:20,560
like i was in the like richard dawkins
 

10385
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:22,710
like i was in the like richard dawkins
train of atheism in terms of there is no

10386
02:49:22,710 --> 02:49:22,720
train of atheism in terms of there is no
 

10387
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:24,309
train of atheism in terms of there is no
god there's and everything like that is

10388
02:49:24,309 --> 02:49:24,319
god there's and everything like that is
 

10389
02:49:24,319 --> 02:49:26,389
god there's and everything like that is
 we know everything we know you

10390
02:49:26,389 --> 02:49:26,399
we know everything we know you
 

10391
02:49:26,399 --> 02:49:28,469
we know everything we know you
know the only way we can get through

10392
02:49:28,469 --> 02:49:28,479
know the only way we can get through
 

10393
02:49:28,479 --> 02:49:30,150
know the only way we can get through
uh we know how medicine works and it's

10394
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:30,160
uh we know how medicine works and it's
 

10395
02:49:30,160 --> 02:49:31,990
uh we know how medicine works and it's
molecules and and chemical interactions

10396
02:49:31,990 --> 02:49:32,000
molecules and and chemical interactions
 

10397
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:33,910
molecules and and chemical interactions
and that kind of stuff

10398
02:49:33,910 --> 02:49:33,920
and that kind of stuff
 

10399
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:35,510
and that kind of stuff
and now it's like

10400
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:35,520
and now it's like
 

10401
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:37,990
and now it's like
okay well there's there's clearly more

10402
02:49:37,990 --> 02:49:38,000
okay well there's there's clearly more
 

10403
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:41,110
okay well there's there's clearly more
for us to understand um and that doesn't

10404
02:49:41,110 --> 02:49:41,120
for us to understand um and that doesn't
 

10405
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:43,429
for us to understand um and that doesn't
mean that it's a scientific as well

10406
02:49:43,429 --> 02:49:43,439
mean that it's a scientific as well
 

10407
02:49:43,439 --> 02:49:44,150
mean that it's a scientific as well
because

10408
02:49:44,150 --> 02:49:44,160
because
 

10409
02:49:44,160 --> 02:49:45,429
because
you know

10410
02:49:45,429 --> 02:49:45,439
you know
 

10411
02:49:45,439 --> 02:49:47,269
you know
the beauty of the scientific method is

10412
02:49:47,269 --> 02:49:47,279
the beauty of the scientific method is
 

10413
02:49:47,279 --> 02:49:49,190
the beauty of the scientific method is
that it still it still can apply to this

10414
02:49:49,190 --> 02:49:49,200
that it still it still can apply to this
 

10415
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:51,190
that it still it still can apply to this
situation like i don't see why you know

10416
02:49:51,190 --> 02:49:51,200
situation like i don't see why you know
 

10417
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:52,830
situation like i don't see why you know
i would like to try and test this

10418
02:49:52,830 --> 02:49:52,840
i would like to try and test this
 

10419
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:55,269
i would like to try and test this
experimentally um i haven't really you

10420
02:49:55,269 --> 02:49:55,279
experimentally um i haven't really you
 

10421
02:49:55,279 --> 02:49:56,469
experimentally um i haven't really you
know i don't know how we would go about

10422
02:49:56,469 --> 02:49:56,479
know i don't know how we would go about
 

10423
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:57,670
know i don't know how we would go about
doing that we'd have to find other

10424
02:49:57,670 --> 02:49:57,680
doing that we'd have to find other
 

10425
02:49:57,680 --> 02:49:59,190
doing that we'd have to find other
people with the same condition i guess

10426
02:49:59,190 --> 02:49:59,200
people with the same condition i guess
 

10427
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:00,389
people with the same condition i guess
and like

10428
02:50:00,389 --> 02:50:00,399
and like
 

10429
02:50:00,399 --> 02:50:04,070
and like
try and repeat repeat the experiment um

10430
02:50:04,070 --> 02:50:04,080
try and repeat repeat the experiment um
 

10431
02:50:04,080 --> 02:50:05,670
try and repeat repeat the experiment um
but it doesn't just because something

10432
02:50:05,670 --> 02:50:05,680
but it doesn't just because something
 

10433
02:50:05,680 --> 02:50:06,870
but it doesn't just because something
happens

10434
02:50:06,870 --> 02:50:06,880
happens
 

10435
02:50:06,880 --> 02:50:09,190
happens
that's sort of out of the realms of our

10436
02:50:09,190 --> 02:50:09,200
that's sort of out of the realms of our
 

10437
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:10,550
that's sort of out of the realms of our
current understanding it doesn't mean

10438
02:50:10,550 --> 02:50:10,560
current understanding it doesn't mean
 

10439
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:11,750
current understanding it doesn't mean
that it's

10440
02:50:11,750 --> 02:50:11,760
that it's
 

10441
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:13,429
that it's
the scientific method can't be used for

10442
02:50:13,429 --> 02:50:13,439
the scientific method can't be used for
 

10443
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:15,510
the scientific method can't be used for
it yeah i think the scientific method

10444
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:15,520
it yeah i think the scientific method
 

10445
02:50:15,520 --> 02:50:17,830
it yeah i think the scientific method
sits on a foundation

10446
02:50:17,830 --> 02:50:17,840
sits on a foundation
 

10447
02:50:17,840 --> 02:50:21,110
sits on a foundation
of those kinds of experiences as a

10448
02:50:21,110 --> 02:50:21,120
of those kinds of experiences as a
 

10449
02:50:21,120 --> 02:50:24,630
of those kinds of experiences as a
scientific method is a process

10450
02:50:24,630 --> 02:50:24,640
scientific method is a process
 

10451
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:25,349
scientific method is a process
to

10452
02:50:25,349 --> 02:50:25,359
to
 

10453
02:50:25,359 --> 02:50:26,790
to
um

10454
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:26,800
um
 

10455
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:29,510
um
carve away at the mystery

10456
02:50:29,510 --> 02:50:29,520
carve away at the mystery
 

10457
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:30,870
carve away at the mystery
all around us

10458
02:50:30,870 --> 02:50:30,880
all around us
 

10459
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:32,950
all around us
and experiences like this is just a

10460
02:50:32,950 --> 02:50:32,960
and experiences like this is just a
 

10461
02:50:32,960 --> 02:50:35,190
and experiences like this is just a
reminder that uh we're mostly shrouded

10462
02:50:35,190 --> 02:50:35,200
reminder that uh we're mostly shrouded
 

10463
02:50:35,200 --> 02:50:37,510
reminder that uh we're mostly shrouded
mysteries though that's it it's just

10464
02:50:37,510 --> 02:50:37,520
mysteries though that's it it's just
 

10465
02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:39,590
mysteries though that's it it's just
like a humility like we haven't really

10466
02:50:39,590 --> 02:50:39,600
like a humility like we haven't really
 

10467
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:41,429
like a humility like we haven't really
figured this whole thing out

10468
02:50:41,429 --> 02:50:41,439
figured this whole thing out
 

10469
02:50:41,439 --> 02:50:43,830
figured this whole thing out
but at the same time we have

10470
02:50:43,830 --> 02:50:43,840
but at the same time we have
 

10471
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:46,389
but at the same time we have
found ways to act you know we're clearly

10472
02:50:46,389 --> 02:50:46,399
found ways to act you know we're clearly
 

10473
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:47,990
found ways to act you know we're clearly
doing something right because think of

10474
02:50:47,990 --> 02:50:48,000
doing something right because think of
 

10475
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,269
doing something right because think of
the technological scientific

10476
02:50:49,269 --> 02:50:49,279
the technological scientific
 

10477
02:50:49,279 --> 02:50:51,349
the technological scientific
advancements the knowledge that we have

10478
02:50:51,349 --> 02:50:51,359
advancements the knowledge that we have
 

10479
02:50:51,359 --> 02:50:54,070
advancements the knowledge that we have
that was would blow people's minds even

10480
02:50:54,070 --> 02:50:54,080
that was would blow people's minds even
 

10481
02:50:54,080 --> 02:50:56,389
that was would blow people's minds even
from 100 years ago yeah and you know

10482
02:50:56,389 --> 02:50:56,399
from 100 years ago yeah and you know
 

10483
02:50:56,399 --> 02:50:58,469
from 100 years ago yeah and you know
we've even allegedly gone out to space

10484
02:50:58,469 --> 02:50:58,479
we've even allegedly gone out to space
 

10485
02:50:58,479 --> 02:51:00,710
we've even allegedly gone out to space
and landed on the moon although i still

10486
02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:00,720
and landed on the moon although i still
 

10487
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:02,950
and landed on the moon although i still
haven't i have not seen evidence of of

10488
02:51:02,950 --> 02:51:02,960
haven't i have not seen evidence of of
 

10489
02:51:02,960 --> 02:51:05,190
haven't i have not seen evidence of of
the earth being round but i'm still i'm

10490
02:51:05,190 --> 02:51:05,200
the earth being round but i'm still i'm
 

10491
02:51:05,200 --> 02:51:07,670
the earth being round but i'm still i'm
keeping an open mind

02:51:07,670 --> 02:51:07,680
keeping an open mind
 

10493
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:09,750
keeping an open mind
uh speaking of which uh you studied

10494
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:09,760
uh speaking of which uh you studied
 

10495
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:13,429
uh speaking of which uh you studied
physics and astrophysics

10496

how did that come to be like when did
 

10507
02:51:24,160 --> 02:51:26,230
how did that come to be like when did
you fall in love with astronomy and

10508
02:51:26,230 --> 02:51:26,240
you fall in love with astronomy and
 

10509
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:27,269
you fall in love with astronomy and
space

10510

when you know we would sleep out under

10552
02:52:10,630 --> 02:52:10,640
when you know we would sleep out under
 

10553
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:12,389
when you know we would sleep out under
the stars whenever it was you know the

10554

the stars whenever it was you know the
 

10555

02:52:13,510 --> 02:52:13,520
two nights a year when it was warm
 

10557
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:16,230
two nights a year when it was warm
enough in the uk to do that um and we'll

10558
02:52:16,230 --> 02:52:16,240
enough in the uk to do that um and we'll
 

10559
02:52:16,240 --> 02:52:18,150
enough in the uk to do that um and we'll
just lie out there until until we fell

10560
02:52:18,150 --> 02:52:18,160
just lie out there until until we fell
 

10561
02:52:18,160 --> 02:52:19,830
just lie out there until until we fell
asleep looking at

10562
02:52:19,830 --> 02:52:19,840
asleep looking at
 

10563
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:21,110
asleep looking at
looking for satellites looking for

10564
02:52:21,110 --> 02:52:21,120
looking for satellites looking for
 

10565
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:23,670
looking for satellites looking for
shooting stars and and i was just

10566
02:52:23,670 --> 02:52:23,680
shooting stars and and i was just
 

10567
02:52:23,680 --> 02:52:25,030
shooting stars and and i was just
always i don't know whether it was from

10568
02:52:25,030 --> 02:52:25,040
always i don't know whether it was from
 

10569
02:52:25,040 --> 02:52:26,469
always i don't know whether it was from
that but i've always naturally

10570
02:52:26,469 --> 02:52:26,479
that but i've always naturally
 

10571
02:52:26,479 --> 02:52:28,469
that but i've always naturally
gravitated to like

10572
02:52:28,469 --> 02:52:28,479
gravitated to like
 

10573
02:52:28,479 --> 02:52:30,309
gravitated to like
the biggest

10574
02:52:30,309 --> 02:52:30,319
the biggest
 

10575
02:52:30,319 --> 02:52:32,710
the biggest
the biggest questions and also the like

10576
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:32,720
the biggest questions and also the like
 

10577
02:52:32,720 --> 02:52:34,950
the biggest questions and also the like
the most layers of abstraction

10578
02:52:34,950 --> 02:52:34,960
the most layers of abstraction
 

10579
02:52:34,960 --> 02:52:36,309
the most layers of abstraction
i love just like what's the meta

10580
02:52:36,309 --> 02:52:36,319
i love just like what's the meta
 

10581
02:52:36,319 --> 02:52:37,750
i love just like what's the meta
question what's the meta question and so

10582
02:52:37,750 --> 02:52:37,760
question what's the meta question and so
 

10583
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:39,830
question what's the meta question and so
on um so i think it just came from that

10584
02:52:39,830 --> 02:52:39,840
on um so i think it just came from that
 

10585
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:41,910
on um so i think it just came from that
really and it and and then on top of

10586
02:52:41,910 --> 02:52:41,920
really and it and and then on top of
 

10587
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:43,670
really and it and and then on top of
that like physics

10588
02:52:43,670 --> 02:52:43,680
that like physics
 

10589
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:45,910
that like physics
you know it also made logical sense and

10590
02:52:45,910 --> 02:52:45,920
you know it also made logical sense and
 

10591
02:52:45,920 --> 02:52:48,469
you know it also made logical sense and
that it was a

10592
02:52:48,469 --> 02:52:48,479
that it was a
 

10593
02:52:48,479 --> 02:52:50,550
that it was a
it was it was the degree it was a degree

10594
02:52:50,550 --> 02:52:50,560
it was it was the degree it was a degree
 

10595
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:52,710
it was it was the degree it was a degree
that was a subject that ticked the box

10596
02:52:52,710 --> 02:52:52,720
that was a subject that ticked the box
 

10597
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:54,550
that was a subject that ticked the box
of being you know answering these really

10598
02:52:54,550 --> 02:52:54,560
of being you know answering these really
 

10599
02:52:54,560 --> 02:52:55,990
of being you know answering these really
big picture questions but it's also

10600
02:52:55,990 --> 02:52:56,000
big picture questions but it's also
 

10601
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,870
big picture questions but it's also
extremely useful it like has a very high

10602
02:52:58,870 --> 02:52:58,880
extremely useful it like has a very high
 

10603
02:52:58,880 --> 02:53:01,349
extremely useful it like has a very high
utility um in terms of i didn't know

10604
02:53:01,349 --> 02:53:01,359
utility um in terms of i didn't know
 

10605
02:53:01,359 --> 02:53:02,550
utility um in terms of i didn't know
necessarily i thought i was going to

10606
02:53:02,550 --> 02:53:02,560
necessarily i thought i was going to
 

10607
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:04,389
necessarily i thought i was going to
become like a research scientist i my

10608
02:53:04,389 --> 02:53:04,399
become like a research scientist i my
 

10609
02:53:04,399 --> 02:53:05,590
become like a research scientist i my
original plan was i want to be a

10610
02:53:05,590 --> 02:53:05,600
original plan was i want to be a
 

10611
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:07,429
original plan was i want to be a
professional astronomer so it's not just

10612
02:53:07,429 --> 02:53:07,439
professional astronomer so it's not just
 

10613
02:53:07,439 --> 02:53:08,950
professional astronomer so it's not just
like a philosophy degree that asks the

10614
02:53:08,950 --> 02:53:08,960
like a philosophy degree that asks the
 

10615
02:53:08,960 --> 02:53:12,630
like a philosophy degree that asks the
big questions and it's not uh

10616
02:53:12,630 --> 02:53:12,640
big questions and it's not uh
 

10617
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:13,429
big questions and it's not uh
like

10618
02:53:13,429 --> 02:53:13,439
like
 

10619
02:53:13,439 --> 02:53:14,790
like
biology in the path to be going to

10620
02:53:14,790 --> 02:53:14,800
biology in the path to be going to
 

10621
02:53:14,800 --> 02:53:16,070
biology in the path to be going to
medical school or something like that

10622
02:53:16,070 --> 02:53:16,080
medical school or something like that
 

10623
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:19,110
medical school or something like that
which is all overly pragmatic not overly

10624
02:53:19,110 --> 02:53:19,120
which is all overly pragmatic not overly
 

10625
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:20,790
which is all overly pragmatic not overly
is um

10626
02:53:20,790 --> 02:53:20,800
is um
 

10627
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:22,309
is um
this is very

10628
02:53:22,309 --> 02:53:22,319
this is very
 

10629
02:53:22,319 --> 02:53:23,429
this is very
pragmatic

10630
02:53:23,429 --> 02:53:23,439
pragmatic
 

10631
02:53:23,439 --> 02:53:25,590
pragmatic
yeah physics is a good combination of

10632
02:53:25,590 --> 02:53:25,600
yeah physics is a good combination of
 

10633
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:27,429
yeah physics is a good combination of
the two yeah at least for me it made

10634
02:53:27,429 --> 02:53:27,439
the two yeah at least for me it made
 

10635
02:53:27,439 --> 02:53:30,070
the two yeah at least for me it made
sense and i was good at it i liked it um

10636
02:53:30,070 --> 02:53:30,080
sense and i was good at it i liked it um
 

10637
02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:31,750
sense and i was good at it i liked it um
yeah i mean i it wasn't like i did an

10638
02:53:31,750 --> 02:53:31,760
yeah i mean i it wasn't like i did an
 

10639
02:53:31,760 --> 02:53:33,269
yeah i mean i it wasn't like i did an
immense amount of soul-searching to

10640
02:53:33,269 --> 02:53:33,279
immense amount of soul-searching to
 

10641
02:53:33,279 --> 02:53:34,870
immense amount of soul-searching to
choose it or anything it just was like

10642
02:53:34,870 --> 02:53:34,880
choose it or anything it just was like
 

10643
02:53:34,880 --> 02:53:36,389
choose it or anything it just was like
this

10644
02:53:36,389 --> 02:53:36,399
this
 

10645
02:53:36,399 --> 02:53:38,870
this
it made the most sense i mean you have

10646
02:53:38,870 --> 02:53:38,880
it made the most sense i mean you have
 

10647
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:41,030
it made the most sense i mean you have
to make this decision in the uk age 17

10648
02:53:41,030 --> 02:53:41,040
to make this decision in the uk age 17
 

10649
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:43,510
to make this decision in the uk age 17
which is crazy um because you know in us

10650
02:53:43,510 --> 02:53:43,520
which is crazy um because you know in us
 

10651
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:45,830
which is crazy um because you know in us
you go the first year you do a bunch of

10652
02:53:45,830 --> 02:53:45,840
you go the first year you do a bunch of
 

10653
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:46,790
you go the first year you do a bunch of
stuff right and then you choose your

10654
02:53:46,790 --> 02:53:46,800
stuff right and then you choose your
 

10655
02:53:46,800 --> 02:53:47,670
stuff right and then you choose your
major

10656
02:53:47,670 --> 02:53:47,680
major
 

10657
02:53:47,680 --> 02:53:49,590
major
um yeah i think the first few years of

10658
02:53:49,590 --> 02:53:49,600
um yeah i think the first few years of
 

10659
02:53:49,600 --> 02:53:52,070
um yeah i think the first few years of
college you focus on the drugs and only

10660
02:53:52,070 --> 02:53:52,080
college you focus on the drugs and only
 

10661
02:53:52,080 --> 02:53:54,710
college you focus on the drugs and only
as you get closer to the end

10662
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:54,720
as you get closer to the end
 

10663
02:53:54,720 --> 02:53:56,389
as you get closer to the end
do you start to think oh this

10664
02:53:56,389 --> 02:53:56,399
do you start to think oh this
 

10665
02:53:56,399 --> 02:53:58,469
do you start to think oh this
wasn't about that and i'm

10666
02:53:58,469 --> 02:53:58,479
wasn't about that and i'm
 

10667
02:53:58,479 --> 02:54:02,230
wasn't about that and i'm
uh i owe the government a lot of money

10668
02:54:02,230 --> 02:54:02,240
uh i owe the government a lot of money
 

10669
02:54:02,240 --> 02:54:03,190
uh i owe the government a lot of money
um

10670
02:54:03,190 --> 02:54:03,200
um
 

10671
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:04,790
um
how many alien civilizations are out

10672
02:54:04,790 --> 02:54:04,800
how many alien civilizations are out
 

10673
02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:06,469
how many alien civilizations are out
there when you when you looked up at the

10674
02:54:06,469 --> 02:54:06,479
there when you when you looked up at the
 

10675
02:54:06,479 --> 02:54:07,390

what's your mom think about a number of

10682
02:54:12,870 --> 02:54:12,880
what's your mom think about a number of
 

10683
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:14,790
what's your mom think about a number of
alien civilizations i actually don't

10684
02:54:14,790 --> 02:54:14,800
alien civilizations i actually don't
 

10685
02:54:14,800 --> 02:54:15,670
alien civilizations i actually don't
know

10686
02:54:15,670 --> 02:54:15,680
know
 

10687
02:54:15,680 --> 02:54:17,269
know
i would imagine she would take the

10688
02:54:17,269 --> 02:54:17,279
i would imagine she would take the
 

10689
02:54:17,279 --> 02:54:18,950
i would imagine she would take the
viewpoint of you know she's pretty

10690
02:54:18,950 --> 02:54:18,960
viewpoint of you know she's pretty
 

10691
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:21,349
viewpoint of you know she's pretty
humble and she knows how many you know

10692
02:54:21,349 --> 02:54:21,359
humble and she knows how many you know
 

10693
02:54:21,359 --> 02:54:22,870
humble and she knows how many you know
there's a huge number of

10694
02:54:22,870 --> 02:54:22,880
there's a huge number of
 

10695
02:54:22,880 --> 02:54:24,630
there's a huge number of
potential spawn sites out there so she

10696
02:54:24,630 --> 02:54:24,640
potential spawn sites out there so she
 

10697
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:27,429
potential spawn sites out there so she
would sponsor spawn sites yeah

10698
02:54:27,429 --> 02:54:27,439
would sponsor spawn sites yeah
 

10699
02:54:27,439 --> 02:54:29,269
would sponsor spawn sites yeah
you know this is our sport

10700
02:54:29,269 --> 02:54:29,279
you know this is our sport
 

10701
02:54:29,279 --> 02:54:30,790
you know this is our sport
we have spawn sites in polytopia we

10702
02:54:30,790 --> 02:54:30,800
we have spawn sites in polytopia we
 

10703
02:54:30,800 --> 02:54:32,790
we have spawn sites in polytopia we
spawned on earth you know it's

10704
02:54:32,790 --> 02:54:32,800
spawned on earth you know it's
 

10705
02:54:32,800 --> 02:54:35,750
spawned on earth you know it's
hmm yeah spawn sights

10706
02:54:35,750 --> 02:54:35,760
hmm yeah spawn sights
 

10707
02:54:35,760 --> 02:54:37,990
hmm yeah spawn sights
why does that feel weird to say

10708
02:54:37,990 --> 02:54:38,000
why does that feel weird to say
 

10709
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:41,590
why does that feel weird to say
spawn because it makes me feel like it's

10710
02:54:41,590 --> 02:54:41,600
spawn because it makes me feel like it's
 

10711
02:54:41,600 --> 02:54:43,349
spawn because it makes me feel like it's
um

10712
02:54:43,349 --> 02:54:43,359
um
 

10713
02:54:43,359 --> 02:54:45,510
um
there's only one source of life and it's

10714
02:54:45,510 --> 02:54:45,520
there's only one source of life and it's
 

10715
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:47,429
there's only one source of life and it's
spawning in different locations that's

10716
02:54:47,429 --> 02:54:47,439
spawning in different locations that's
 

10717
02:54:47,439 --> 02:54:49,030
spawning in different locations that's
why the word spawn

10718
02:54:49,030 --> 02:54:49,040
why the word spawn
 

10719
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:50,710
why the word spawn
because like it feels like life that

10720
02:54:50,710 --> 02:54:50,720
because like it feels like life that
 

10721
02:54:50,720 --> 02:54:52,630
because like it feels like life that
originated on earth

10722
02:54:52,630 --> 02:54:52,640
originated on earth
 

10723
02:54:52,640 --> 02:54:55,590
originated on earth
really originated here right it is it is

10724
02:54:55,590 --> 02:54:55,600
really originated here right it is it is
 

10725
02:54:55,600 --> 02:54:58,630
really originated here right it is it is
a unique to this particular

10726
02:54:58,630 --> 02:54:58,640
a unique to this particular
 

10727
02:54:58,640 --> 02:55:00,950
a unique to this particular
yeah i mean but i don't in my mind it

10728
02:55:00,950 --> 02:55:00,960
yeah i mean but i don't in my mind it
 

10729
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:02,469
yeah i mean but i don't in my mind it
doesn't exclude

10730
02:55:02,469 --> 02:55:02,479
doesn't exclude
 

10731
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:03,750
doesn't exclude
you know the completely different forms

10732
02:55:03,750 --> 02:55:03,760
you know the completely different forms
 

10733
02:55:03,760 --> 02:55:06,550
you know the completely different forms
of life and different biochemical

10734
02:55:06,550 --> 02:55:06,560
of life and different biochemical
 

10735
02:55:06,560 --> 02:55:07,590
of life and different biochemical
soups

10736
02:55:07,590 --> 02:55:07,600
soups
 

10737
02:55:07,600 --> 02:55:09,830
soups
can't also spawn but

10738
02:55:09,830 --> 02:55:09,840
can't also spawn but
 

10739
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:11,590
can't also spawn but
i guess it implies that there's some

10740
02:55:11,590 --> 02:55:11,600
i guess it implies that there's some
 

10741
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:14,630
i guess it implies that there's some
spark that is yeah which i kind of like

10742
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:14,640
spark that is yeah which i kind of like
 

10743
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:17,110
spark that is yeah which i kind of like
the idea of it yeah and then i i get to

10744
02:55:17,110 --> 02:55:17,120
the idea of it yeah and then i i get to
 

10745
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:19,030
the idea of it yeah and then i i get to
think about respawning

10746
02:55:19,030 --> 02:55:19,040
think about respawning
 

10747
02:55:19,040 --> 02:55:21,830
think about respawning
like after it dies like what happens if

10748
02:55:21,830 --> 02:55:21,840
like after it dies like what happens if
 

10749
02:55:21,840 --> 02:55:24,309
like after it dies like what happens if
life on earth ends is it

10750
02:55:24,309 --> 02:55:24,319
life on earth ends is it
 

10751
02:55:24,319 --> 02:55:26,389
life on earth ends is it
is it going to restart again probably

10752
02:55:26,389 --> 02:55:26,399
is it going to restart again probably
 

10753
02:55:26,399 --> 02:55:27,269
is it going to restart again probably
not

10754
02:55:27,269 --> 02:55:27,279
not
 

10755
02:55:27,279 --> 02:55:29,349
not
it depends maybe earth is depends on the

10756
02:55:29,349 --> 02:55:29,359
it depends maybe earth is depends on the
 

10757
02:55:29,359 --> 02:55:31,030
it depends maybe earth is depends on the
type of you know what what's the thing

10758
02:55:31,030 --> 02:55:31,040
type of you know what what's the thing
 

10759
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:32,950
type of you know what what's the thing
that kills it kills it off right if it's

10760
02:55:32,950 --> 02:55:32,960
that kills it kills it off right if it's
 

10761
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:34,870
that kills it kills it off right if it's
a paper clip maximizer not that you know

10762
02:55:34,870 --> 02:55:34,880
a paper clip maximizer not that you know
 

10763
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:36,550
a paper clip maximizer not that you know
for the for the example but you know

10764
02:55:36,550 --> 02:55:36,560
for the for the example but you know
 

10765
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:38,070
for the for the example but you know
some kind of very

10766
02:55:38,070 --> 02:55:38,080
some kind of very
 

10767
02:55:38,080 --> 02:55:40,389
some kind of very
self-replicating

10768
02:55:40,389 --> 02:55:40,399
self-replicating
 

10769
02:55:40,399 --> 02:55:42,309
self-replicating
you know high on the capabilities very

10770
02:55:42,309 --> 02:55:42,319
you know high on the capabilities very
 

10771
02:55:42,319 --> 02:55:44,630
you know high on the capabilities very
low on the wisdom type thing so whether

10772
02:55:44,630 --> 02:55:44,640
low on the wisdom type thing so whether
 

10773
02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:47,190
low on the wisdom type thing so whether
that's you know grey goo green goo

10774
02:55:47,190 --> 02:55:47,200
that's you know grey goo green goo
 

10775
02:55:47,200 --> 02:55:49,590
that's you know grey goo green goo
you know like nano bots or

10776
02:55:49,590 --> 02:55:49,600
you know like nano bots or
 

10777
02:55:49,600 --> 02:55:52,070
you know like nano bots or
just a shitty misaligned ai that thinks

10778
02:55:52,070 --> 02:55:52,080
just a shitty misaligned ai that thinks
 

10779
02:55:52,080 --> 02:55:53,670
just a shitty misaligned ai that thinks
it needs to turn everything into paper

10780
02:55:53,670 --> 02:55:53,680
it needs to turn everything into paper
 

10781
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:56,469
it needs to turn everything into paper
clips um

10782
02:55:56,469 --> 02:55:56,479
clips um
 

10783
02:55:56,479 --> 02:55:57,510
clips um
you know if it's something like that

10784
02:55:57,510 --> 02:55:57,520
you know if it's something like that
 

10785
02:55:57,520 --> 02:55:59,030
you know if it's something like that
then it's going to be very hard for life

10786
02:55:59,030 --> 02:55:59,040
then it's going to be very hard for life
 

10787
02:55:59,040 --> 02:56:01,030
then it's going to be very hard for life
you know complex life because by

10788
02:56:01,030 --> 02:56:01,040
you know complex life because by
 

10789
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:02,550
you know complex life because by
definition you know a paperclip

10790
02:56:02,550 --> 02:56:02,560
definition you know a paperclip
 

10791
02:56:02,560 --> 02:56:04,630
definition you know a paperclip
maximizer is the ultimate instantiation

10792
02:56:04,630 --> 02:56:04,640
maximizer is the ultimate instantiation
 

10793
02:56:04,640 --> 02:56:07,349
maximizer is the ultimate instantiation
of molecule deeply low complexity over

10794
02:56:07,349 --> 02:56:07,359
of molecule deeply low complexity over
 

10795
02:56:07,359 --> 02:56:08,469
of molecule deeply low complexity over
optimization on a single thing

10796
02:56:08,469 --> 02:56:08,479
optimization on a single thing
 

10797
02:56:08,479 --> 02:56:09,990
optimization on a single thing
sacrificing everything else turning the

10798
02:56:09,990 --> 02:56:10,000
sacrificing everything else turning the
 

10799
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:11,590
sacrificing everything else turning the
whole world into i although something

10800
02:56:11,590 --> 02:56:11,600
whole world into i although something
 

10801
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:13,269
whole world into i although something
tells me like if we actually take a

10802
02:56:13,269 --> 02:56:13,279
tells me like if we actually take a
 

10803
02:56:13,279 --> 02:56:15,190
tells me like if we actually take a
paper clip maximizer it destroys

10804
02:56:15,190 --> 02:56:15,200
paper clip maximizer it destroys
 

10805
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:17,670
paper clip maximizer it destroys
everything it's a really dumb system

10806
02:56:17,670 --> 02:56:17,680
everything it's a really dumb system
 

10807
02:56:17,680 --> 02:56:19,590
everything it's a really dumb system
that just and envelops the whole of

10808
02:56:19,590 --> 02:56:19,600
that just and envelops the whole of
 

10809
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:20,550
that just and envelops the whole of
earth

10810
02:56:20,550 --> 02:56:20,560
earth
 

10811
02:56:20,560 --> 02:56:24,309
earth
and that diverse beyond yeah

10812
02:56:24,309 --> 02:56:24,319

 

10813
02:56:24,319 --> 02:56:25,590

i didn't i didn't know that part but

10814
02:56:25,590 --> 02:56:25,600
i didn't i didn't know that part but
 

10815
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:27,510
i didn't i didn't know that part but
okay great that's what it takes it

10816
02:56:27,510 --> 02:56:27,520
okay great that's what it takes it
 

10817
02:56:27,520 --> 02:56:29,349
okay great that's what it takes it
becomes a multi-planetary paperclip

10818
02:56:29,349 --> 02:56:29,359
becomes a multi-planetary paperclip
 

10819
02:56:29,359 --> 02:56:30,870
becomes a multi-planetary paperclip
maximizer well it just it just

10820
02:56:30,870 --> 02:56:30,880
maximizer well it just it just
 

10821
02:56:30,880 --> 02:56:33,030
maximizer well it just it just
propagates i mean it it depends whether

10822
02:56:33,030 --> 02:56:33,040
propagates i mean it it depends whether
 

10823
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:34,469
propagates i mean it it depends whether
it figures out how to jump the vacuum

10824
02:56:34,469 --> 02:56:34,479
it figures out how to jump the vacuum
 

10825
02:56:34,479 --> 02:56:35,429
it figures out how to jump the vacuum
gap

10826
02:56:35,429 --> 02:56:35,439
gap
 

10827
02:56:35,439 --> 02:56:36,630
gap
um

10828
02:56:36,630 --> 02:56:36,640
um
 

10829
02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:37,349
um
but

10830
02:56:37,349 --> 02:56:37,359
but
 

10831
02:56:37,359 --> 02:56:38,630
but
again i mean this is all silly because

10832
02:56:38,630 --> 02:56:38,640
again i mean this is all silly because
 

10833
02:56:38,640 --> 02:56:40,150
again i mean this is all silly because
it's a hypothetical thought experiment

10834
02:56:40,150 --> 02:56:40,160
it's a hypothetical thought experiment
 

10835
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:41,269
it's a hypothetical thought experiment
which i think doesn't actually have much

10836
02:56:41,269 --> 02:56:41,279
which i think doesn't actually have much
 

10837
02:56:41,279 --> 02:56:42,870
which i think doesn't actually have much
practical application to the ai safety

10838
02:56:42,870 --> 02:56:42,880
practical application to the ai safety
 

10839
02:56:42,880 --> 02:56:44,630
practical application to the ai safety
problem but it's just a fun thing to

10840
02:56:44,630 --> 02:56:44,640
problem but it's just a fun thing to
 

10841
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:45,910
problem but it's just a fun thing to
play around with but yeah if by

10842
02:56:45,910 --> 02:56:45,920
play around with but yeah if by
 

10843
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:47,670
play around with but yeah if by
definition it is maximally intelligent

10844
02:56:47,670 --> 02:56:47,680
definition it is maximally intelligent
 

10845
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:51,429
definition it is maximally intelligent
which means it is maximally good at

10846
02:56:51,429 --> 02:56:51,439
which means it is maximally good at
 

10847
02:56:51,439 --> 02:56:53,030
which means it is maximally good at
navigating the environment around it in

10848
02:56:53,030 --> 02:56:53,040
navigating the environment around it in
 

10849
02:56:53,040 --> 02:56:54,630
navigating the environment around it in
order to achieve its goal

10850
02:56:54,630 --> 02:56:54,640
order to achieve its goal
 

10851
02:56:54,640 --> 02:56:55,349
order to achieve its goal
but

10852
02:56:55,349 --> 02:56:55,359
but
 

10853
02:56:55,359 --> 02:56:57,269
but
extremely bad at choosing goals in the

10854
02:56:57,269 --> 02:56:57,279
extremely bad at choosing goals in the
 

10855
02:56:57,279 --> 02:56:58,630
extremely bad at choosing goals in the
first place so again we're talking about

10856
02:56:58,630 --> 02:56:58,640
first place so again we're talking about
 

10857
02:56:58,640 --> 02:57:00,710
first place so again we're talking about
this orthogonality thing right it's very

10858
02:57:00,710 --> 02:57:00,720
this orthogonality thing right it's very
 

10859
02:57:00,720 --> 02:57:01,990
this orthogonality thing right it's very
low on wisdom but very high on

10860
02:57:01,990 --> 02:57:02,000
low on wisdom but very high on
 

10861
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,389
low on wisdom but very high on
capability um then it will figure out

10862
02:57:04,389 --> 02:57:04,399
capability um then it will figure out
 

10863
02:57:04,399 --> 02:57:05,910
capability um then it will figure out
how to jump the vacuum gap between

10864
02:57:05,910 --> 02:57:05,920
how to jump the vacuum gap between
 

10865
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:07,590
how to jump the vacuum gap between
planets and stars and so on and thus

10866
02:57:07,590 --> 02:57:07,600
planets and stars and so on and thus
 

10867
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:09,590
planets and stars and so on and thus
just turn every atom it gets its hands

10868
02:57:09,590 --> 02:57:09,600
just turn every atom it gets its hands
 

10869
02:57:09,600 --> 02:57:11,590
just turn every atom it gets its hands
on into paper clips yeah uh by the way

10870
02:57:11,590 --> 02:57:11,600
on into paper clips yeah uh by the way
 

10871
02:57:11,600 --> 02:57:13,190
on into paper clips yeah uh by the way
for for people who which is maximum

10872
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:13,200
for for people who which is maximum

02:57:54,630 --> 02:57:54,640
idea now i'm scared that's better that's

were to say
so it's still a bad thing because it's

of a
 

10967
02:58:44,880 --> 02:58:46,550
of a
paper clip well then we're not with them

10968
02:58:46,550 --> 02:58:46,560
paper clip well then we're not with them
 

10969
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:47,750
paper clip well then we're not with them
we're not describing a paper clip

10970
02:58:47,750 --> 02:58:47,760
we're not describing a paper clip
 

10971
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:50,230
we're not describing a paper clip
maximizer anymore because by the like if

10972
02:58:50,230 --> 02:58:50,240
maximizer anymore because by the like if
 

10973
02:58:50,240 --> 02:58:51,750
maximizer anymore because by the like if
you think of what a paper clip is it is

10974
02:58:51,750 --> 02:58:51,760
you think of what a paper clip is it is
 

10975
02:58:51,760 --> 02:58:54,230
you think of what a paper clip is it is
literally just a piece of bent iron yes

10976
02:58:54,230 --> 02:58:54,240
literally just a piece of bent iron yes
 

10977
02:58:54,240 --> 02:58:55,510
literally just a piece of bent iron yes
right

10978
02:58:55,510 --> 02:58:55,520
right
 

10979
02:58:55,520 --> 02:58:57,429
right
so if it's

10980
02:58:57,429 --> 02:58:57,439
so if it's
 

10981
02:58:57,439 --> 02:58:58,790
so if it's
maximizing that throughout the universe

10982
02:58:58,790 --> 02:58:58,800
maximizing that throughout the universe
 

10983
02:58:58,800 --> 02:59:00,630
maximizing that throughout the universe
it's taking every atom it gets its hand

10984
02:59:00,630 --> 02:59:00,640
it's taking every atom it gets its hand
 

10985
02:59:00,640 --> 02:59:02,870
it's taking every atom it gets its hand
on into somehow turning it into iron or

10986
02:59:02,870 --> 02:59:02,880
on into somehow turning it into iron or
 

10987
02:59:02,880 --> 02:59:04,070
on into somehow turning it into iron or
steel

10988
02:59:04,070 --> 02:59:04,080
steel
 

10989
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:05,349
steel
and then bending it into that shape and

10990
02:59:05,349 --> 02:59:05,359
and then bending it into that shape and
 

10991
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:06,790
and then bending it into that shape and
then done and on

10992
02:59:06,790 --> 02:59:06,800
then done and on
 

10993
02:59:06,800 --> 02:59:09,030
then done and on
by definition like paper clips there is

10994
02:59:09,030 --> 02:59:09,040
by definition like paper clips there is
 

10995
02:59:09,040 --> 02:59:11,910
by definition like paper clips there is
no there is no way for well okay so

10996
02:59:11,910 --> 02:59:11,920
no there is no way for well okay so
 

10997
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:13,750
no there is no way for well okay so
you're saying that paper clips somehow

10998
02:59:13,750 --> 02:59:13,760
you're saying that paper clips somehow
 

10999
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:16,389
you're saying that paper clips somehow
will just emerge and create

11000
02:59:16,389 --> 02:59:16,399
will just emerge and create
 

11001
02:59:16,399 --> 02:59:18,710
will just emerge and create
through gravity or something no no no no

11002
02:59:18,710 --> 02:59:18,720
through gravity or something no no no no
 

11003
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:20,469
through gravity or something no no no no
because there's there's a dynamic

11004
02:59:20,469 --> 02:59:20,479
because there's there's a dynamic
 

11005
02:59:20,479 --> 02:59:21,750
because there's there's a dynamic
element to the whole system it's not

11006
02:59:21,750 --> 02:59:21,760
element to the whole system it's not
 

11007
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:22,469
element to the whole system it's not
just

11008
02:59:22,469 --> 02:59:22,479
just
 

11009
02:59:22,479 --> 02:59:25,030
just
it's creating those paper clips and the

11010
02:59:25,030 --> 02:59:25,040
it's creating those paper clips and the
 

11011
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:27,190
it's creating those paper clips and the
act of creating there's going to be a

11012
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:27,200
act of creating there's going to be a
 

11013
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:29,750
act of creating there's going to be a
process and that process will have a

11014
02:59:29,750 --> 02:59:29,760
process and that process will have a
 

11015
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:31,590
process and that process will have a
dance to it because it's not like

11016
02:59:31,590 --> 02:59:31,600
dance to it because it's not like
 

11017
02:59:31,600 --> 02:59:33,990
dance to it because it's not like
sequential thing there's a whole complex

11018
02:59:33,990 --> 02:59:34,000
sequential thing there's a whole complex
 

11019
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,389
sequential thing there's a whole complex
three-dimensional system of paper clips

11020
02:59:36,389 --> 02:59:36,399
three-dimensional system of paper clips
 

11021
02:59:36,399 --> 02:59:38,230
three-dimensional system of paper clips
uh you know like you know people like

11022
02:59:38,230 --> 02:59:38,240
uh you know like you know people like
 

11023
02:59:38,240 --> 02:59:39,750
uh you know like you know people like
string theory right it's supposed to be

11024
02:59:39,750 --> 02:59:39,760
string theory right it's supposed to be
 

11025
02:59:39,760 --> 02:59:40,870
string theory right it's supposed to be
strings that are interacting in

11026
02:59:40,870 --> 02:59:40,880
strings that are interacting in
 

11027
02:59:40,880 --> 02:59:43,269
strings that are interacting in
fascinating ways i'm sure paper clips

11028
02:59:43,269 --> 02:59:43,279
fascinating ways i'm sure paper clips
 

11029
02:59:43,279 --> 02:59:44,710
fascinating ways i'm sure paper clips
are very string like they can be

11030
02:59:44,710 --> 02:59:44,720
are very string like they can be
 

11031
02:59:44,720 --> 02:59:46,790
are very string like they can be
interacting very interesting ways as you

11032
02:59:46,790 --> 02:59:46,800
interacting very interesting ways as you
 

11033
02:59:46,800 --> 02:59:48,710
interacting very interesting ways as you
scale exponentially through

11034
02:59:48,710 --> 02:59:48,720
scale exponentially through
 

11035
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:49,990
scale exponentially through

three-dimensional
 

11037
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:51,910
three-dimensional
i mean i'm sure

11038
02:59:51,910 --> 02:59:51,920
i mean i'm sure
 

11039
02:59:51,920 --> 02:59:54,389
i mean i'm sure
the paperclip maximizer has to come up

11040
02:59:54,389 --> 02:59:54,399
the paperclip maximizer has to come up
 

11041
02:59:54,399 --> 02:59:56,150
the paperclip maximizer has to come up
with the theory of everything it has to

11042
02:59:56,150 --> 02:59:56,160
with the theory of everything it has to
 

11043
02:59:56,160 --> 02:59:59,269
with the theory of everything it has to
create like wormholes right it has to

11044
02:59:59,269 --> 02:59:59,279
create like wormholes right it has to
 

11045
02:59:59,279 --> 03:00:01,750
create like wormholes right it has to
break uh like it has to understand

11046
03:00:01,750 --> 03:00:01,760
break uh like it has to understand
 

11047
03:00:01,760 --> 03:00:03,750
break uh like it has to understand
quantum mechanics i i love you i love

your optimism this is where i'd say this

11050
03:00:06,070 --> 03:00:06,080
your optimism this is where i'd say this
 

11051
03:00:06,080 --> 03:00:07,190
your optimism this is where i'd say this
we're going into the realm of

11052
03:00:07,190 --> 03:00:07,200
we're going into the realm of
 

11053
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:10,389
we're going into the realm of
pathological optimism whereby it's um

11054
03:00:10,389 --> 03:00:10,399
pathological optimism whereby it's um
 

11055
03:00:10,399 --> 03:00:12,070
pathological optimism whereby it's um
i'm sure there will be a

11056
03:00:12,070 --> 03:00:12,080
i'm sure there will be a
 

11057
03:00:12,080 --> 03:00:14,870
i'm sure there will be a
i i think there's an intelligence that

11058
03:00:14,870 --> 03:00:14,880
i i think there's an intelligence that
 

11059
03:00:14,880 --> 03:00:16,790
i i think there's an intelligence that
emerges from that system so you're

11060
03:00:16,790 --> 03:00:16,800
emerges from that system so you're
 

11061
03:00:16,800 --> 03:00:18,550
emerges from that system so you're
saying that basically intelligence is

11062
03:00:18,550 --> 03:00:18,560
saying that basically intelligence is
 

11063
03:00:18,560 --> 03:00:20,550
saying that basically intelligence is
inherent in the fabric of reality and

11064
03:00:20,550 --> 03:00:20,560
inherent in the fabric of reality and
 

11065
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:22,710
inherent in the fabric of reality and
will find a way kind of like goldblum

11066
03:00:22,710 --> 03:00:22,720
will find a way kind of like goldblum

11069
03:00:24,399 --> 03:00:26,550
says life will find a way you think life
will find a way even out of this

11070
03:00:26,550 --> 03:00:26,560
will find a way even out of this

don't know why people keep thinking it's
harmonic it's it maximizes the number of

11080
03:00:38,870 --> 03:00:38,880

true it's true maximize paper clips so

11086
03:00:44,790 --> 03:00:44,800
true it's true maximize paper clips so
 

11087
03:00:44,800 --> 03:00:47,349
true it's true maximize paper clips so
you're saying you're saying that because

11088
03:00:47,349 --> 03:00:47,359
you're saying you're saying that because
 

11089
03:00:47,359 --> 03:00:49,429
you're saying you're saying that because
it because you know kind of like in the

03:00:49,429 --> 03:00:49,439
it because you know kind of like in the
 

11091
03:00:49,439 --> 03:00:51,030
it because you know kind of like in the
big bang or you know it seems like you

enough of the pathonicity that
 

11099
03:00:56,640 --> 03:00:58,389
enough of the pathonicity that
kick-started the evolutionary process

11100

03:01:02,960 --> 03:01:04,950
even out of yeah so yeah emerges
interesting okay well so how does that

11106
03:01:04,950 --> 03:01:04,960
interesting okay well so how does that
 

11107
03:01:04,960 --> 03:01:06,950
interesting okay well so how does that
line up then with the the whole heat

11108
03:01:06,950 --> 03:01:06,960
line up then with the the whole heat

other worlds to break
the what we consider the limitations of

03:01:49,910 --> 03:01:49,920
the what we consider the limitations of
 

11153
03:01:49,920 --> 03:01:52,550
the what we consider the limitations of

11155
03:01:52,560 --> 03:01:55,030

the paperclip maximizer will find a way

11156
03:01:55,030 --> 03:01:55,040
the paperclip maximizer will find a way
 

11157
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:57,429
the paperclip maximizer will find a way
if a way exists and we're we should be

11158
03:01:57,429 --> 03:01:57,439
if a way exists and we're we should be
 

11159
03:01:57,439 --> 03:01:59,190
if a way exists and we're we should be
humble to realize that we've been yet

11160
03:01:59,190 --> 03:01:59,200
humble to realize that we've been yet
 

11161
03:01:59,200 --> 03:02:00,630
humble to realize that we've been yet
but because it just wants to make more

11162
03:02:00,630 --> 03:02:00,640
but because it just wants to make more
 

11163
03:02:00,640 --> 03:02:01,750
but because it just wants to make more
paper clips yeah so it's going to go

11164
03:02:01,750 --> 03:02:01,760
paper clips yeah so it's going to go
 

11165
03:02:01,760 --> 03:02:03,110
paper clips yeah so it's going to go
into those universes and turn them into

11166
03:02:03,110 --> 03:02:03,120
into those universes and turn them into
 

11167
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:05,750
into those universes and turn them into
paper clips yeah but we

11168
03:02:05,750 --> 03:02:05,760
paper clips yeah but we
 

11169
03:02:05,760 --> 03:02:08,710
paper clips yeah but we
humans not humans but complex systems

11170
03:02:08,710 --> 03:02:08,720
humans not humans but complex systems
 

11171
03:02:08,720 --> 03:02:10,630
humans not humans but complex systems
exist on top of that we're not

exist on top of that we're not
 

11173
03:02:10,640 --> 03:02:12,870
exist on top of that we're not
interfering with it

11174
03:02:12,870 --> 03:02:12,880
interfering with it
 

11175
03:02:12,880 --> 03:02:15,429

03:02:15,429 --> 03:02:15,439
this complexity emerges
 

11177
03:02:15,439 --> 03:02:17,750
this complexity emerges
from this simple base state the simple

from this simple base state the simple
 

11179
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:19,750
from this simple base state the simple

11181
03:02:19,760 --> 03:02:21,670

you know plank lengths or paper clips is

11182
03:02:21,670 --> 03:02:21,680
you know plank lengths or paper clips is
 

11183
03:02:21,680 --> 03:02:23,349
you know plank lengths or paper clips is
the base unit yeah

11184
03:02:23,349 --> 03:02:23,359
the base unit yeah
 

11185
03:02:23,359 --> 03:02:25,750
the base unit yeah
you can think of like the universe as a

11186
03:02:25,750 --> 03:02:25,760
you can think of like the universe as a
 

11187
03:02:25,760 --> 03:02:27,910
you can think of like the universe as a
paper clip maximizer because it's doing

11188
03:02:27,910 --> 03:02:27,920
paper clip maximizer because it's doing
 

11189
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:29,750
paper clip maximizer because it's doing
some dumb stuff like physics seems to be

11190
03:02:29,750 --> 03:02:29,760
some dumb stuff like physics seems to be
 

11191
03:02:29,760 --> 03:02:31,190
some dumb stuff like physics seems to be
pretty dumb

11192
03:02:31,190 --> 03:02:31,200
pretty dumb
 

11193
03:02:31,200 --> 03:02:32,070
pretty dumb
it has

11194
03:02:32,070 --> 03:02:32,080
it has
 

11195
03:02:32,080 --> 03:02:33,830
it has
like i don't know if you can summarize

11196
03:02:33,830 --> 03:02:33,840
like i don't know if you can summarize
 

11197
03:02:33,840 --> 03:02:36,309
like i don't know if you can summarize
it yeah yeah the the laws are fairly

11198
03:02:36,309 --> 03:02:36,319
it yeah yeah the the laws are fairly
 

11199
03:02:36,319 --> 03:02:37,269
it yeah yeah the the laws are fairly
basic

11200
03:02:37,269 --> 03:02:37,279
basic
 

11201
03:02:37,279 --> 03:02:39,030

and yet out of them amazing complexity

11202
03:02:39,030 --> 03:02:39,040
and yet out of them amazing complexity
 

11203
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:41,590
and yet out of them amazing complexity
emerges and its goals seem to be pretty

11204
03:02:41,590 --> 03:02:41,600
emerges and its goals seem to be pretty
 

11205
03:02:41,600 --> 03:02:43,269

basic and dumb

11206
03:02:43,269 --> 03:02:43,279
basic and dumb
 

11207
03:02:43,279 --> 03:02:45,429
basic and dumb
if you can summarize as goals i mean i

11208
03:02:45,429 --> 03:02:45,439
if you can summarize as goals i mean i
 

11209
03:02:45,439 --> 03:02:46,870
if you can summarize as goals i mean i
don't i don't know what's a nice way

11210
03:02:46,870 --> 03:02:46,880
don't i don't know what's a nice way
 

11211
03:02:46,880 --> 03:02:47,830
don't i don't know what's a nice way
maybe

11212
03:02:47,830 --> 03:02:47,840
maybe
 

11213
03:02:47,840 --> 03:02:49,830
maybe
um

11214
03:02:49,830 --> 03:02:49,840
um
 

11215
03:02:49,840 --> 03:02:52,389
um
maybe laws of thermodynamics could be i

11216
03:02:52,389 --> 03:02:52,399
maybe laws of thermodynamics could be i
 

11217
03:02:52,399 --> 03:02:54,230
maybe laws of thermodynamics could be i
don't know if you can assign goals to

11218
03:02:54,230 --> 03:02:54,240
don't know if you can assign goals to
 

11219
03:02:54,240 --> 03:02:56,150
don't know if you can assign goals to
physics but if you formulate in the

11220
03:02:56,150 --> 03:02:56,160
physics but if you formulate in the
 

11221
03:02:56,160 --> 03:02:58,230
physics but if you formulate in the
science in the sense of goals it's very

11222
03:02:58,230 --> 03:02:58,240
science in the sense of goals it's very
 

11223
03:02:58,240 --> 03:02:59,349
science in the sense of goals it's very
similar to

11224
03:02:59,349 --> 03:02:59,359
similar to
 

11225
03:02:59,359 --> 03:03:01,750
similar to
paper clip maximizing in in the dumbness

11226
03:03:01,750 --> 03:03:01,760
paper clip maximizing in in the dumbness
 

11227
03:03:01,760 --> 03:03:03,830
paper clip maximizing in in the dumbness
of the goals but the

11228
03:03:03,830 --> 03:03:03,840

the pockets of complexity has emerged is

11230
03:03:06,710 --> 03:03:06,720
the pockets of complexity has emerged is
 

11231
03:03:06,720 --> 03:03:08,550
the pockets of complexity has emerged is
where beauty emerges that's where life

11232
03:03:08,550 --> 03:03:08,560
where beauty emerges that's where life
 

11233
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:10,710
where beauty emerges that's where life
emerges that's where intelligence that's

11234
03:03:10,710 --> 03:03:10,720
emerges that's where intelligence that's
 

11235
03:03:10,720 --> 03:03:13,030
emerges that's where intelligence that's
where humans emerge and i i think we're

11236
03:03:13,030 --> 03:03:13,040
where humans emerge and i i think we're
 

11237
03:03:13,040 --> 03:03:14,790
where humans emerge and i i think we're
being very down on this whole paperclip

11238
03:03:14,790 --> 03:03:14,800
being very down on this whole paperclip
 

11239
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:17,349
being very down on this whole paperclip
maximizer thing now the reason we hate

11240
03:03:17,349 --> 03:03:17,359
maximizer thing now the reason we hate
 

11241
03:03:17,359 --> 03:03:18,469
maximizer thing now the reason we hate
it i think yeah because what you're

11242
03:03:18,469 --> 03:03:18,479
it i think yeah because what you're
 

11243
03:03:18,479 --> 03:03:20,389
it i think yeah because what you're
saying is that you

11244
03:03:20,389 --> 03:03:20,399
saying is that you
 

11245
03:03:20,399 --> 03:03:24,070
saying is that you
think that the force of emergence itself

11246
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:24,080
think that the force of emergence itself
 

11247
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:26,950
think that the force of emergence itself
is another like unwritten

11248
03:03:26,950 --> 03:03:26,960
is another like unwritten
 

11249
03:03:26,960 --> 03:03:29,110
is another like unwritten
unwritten but like another fake to in

11250
03:03:29,110 --> 03:03:29,120
unwritten but like another fake to in
 

11251
03:03:29,120 --> 03:03:32,070
unwritten but like another fake to in
law of the of of reality yeah and and

11252
03:03:32,070 --> 03:03:32,080
law of the of of reality yeah and and
 

11253
03:03:32,080 --> 03:03:34,070
law of the of of reality yeah and and
you you're trusting that emergence will

11254
03:03:34,070 --> 03:03:34,080
you you're trusting that emergence will
 

11255
03:03:34,080 --> 03:03:37,269
you you're trusting that emergence will
find a way to even out of seemingly the

11256
03:03:37,269 --> 03:03:37,279
find a way to even out of seemingly the
 

11257
03:03:37,279 --> 03:03:40,389
find a way to even out of seemingly the
most molechy awful out you know plain

11258
03:03:40,389 --> 03:03:40,399
most molechy awful out you know plain
 

11259
03:03:40,399 --> 03:03:42,150
most molechy awful out you know plain
outcome emergence will still find a way

11260
03:03:42,150 --> 03:03:42,160
outcome emergence will still find a way
 

11261
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:43,510
outcome emergence will still find a way
i love that as a philosophy i think it's

11262
03:03:43,510 --> 03:03:43,520
i love that as a philosophy i think it's
 

11263
03:03:43,520 --> 03:03:46,070
i love that as a philosophy i think it's
very nice i would

11264
03:03:46,070 --> 03:03:46,080
very nice i would
 

11265
03:03:46,080 --> 03:03:48,070
very nice i would
wield it carefully because

11266
03:03:48,070 --> 03:03:48,080
wield it carefully because
 

11267
03:03:48,080 --> 03:03:48,790
wield it carefully because
there's

11268
03:03:48,790 --> 03:03:48,800
there's
 

11269
03:03:48,800 --> 03:03:50,870
there's
large error bars on on that and the

11270
03:03:50,870 --> 03:03:50,880
large error bars on on that and the
 

11271
03:03:50,880 --> 03:03:53,269
large error bars on on that and the
certainty of that yeah um and while we

11272
03:03:53,269 --> 03:03:53,279
certainty of that yeah um and while we
 

11273
03:03:53,279 --> 03:03:55,349
certainty of that yeah um and while we
build the paper clip maximizer and find

11274
03:03:55,349 --> 03:03:55,359
build the paper clip maximizer and find
 

11275
03:03:55,359 --> 03:03:57,670
build the paper clip maximizer and find
out classic yeah molok is doing

11276
03:03:57,670 --> 03:03:57,680
out classic yeah molok is doing
 

11277
03:03:57,680 --> 03:04:00,710
out classic yeah molok is doing
cartwheels man yeah but the thing is it

11278
03:04:00,710 --> 03:04:00,720
cartwheels man yeah but the thing is it
 

11279
03:04:00,720 --> 03:04:02,550
cartwheels man yeah but the thing is it
will destroy humans in the process which

11280
03:04:02,550 --> 03:04:02,560
will destroy humans in the process which
 

11281
03:04:02,560 --> 03:04:03,990
will destroy humans in the process which
is the thing which is the reason we

11282
03:04:03,990 --> 03:04:04,000
is the thing which is the reason we
 

11283
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,150
is the thing which is the reason we
really don't like it we we seem to be

11284
03:04:06,150 --> 03:04:06,160
really don't like it we we seem to be
 

11285
03:04:06,160 --> 03:04:08,309
really don't like it we we seem to be
really holding on to this whole human

11286
03:04:08,309 --> 03:04:08,319
really holding on to this whole human
 

11287
03:04:08,319 --> 03:04:09,750
really holding on to this whole human
civilization thing

11288
03:04:09,750 --> 03:04:09,760
civilization thing
 

11289
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:11,910
civilization thing
would you would that make you said if

11290
03:04:11,910 --> 03:04:11,920
would you would that make you said if
 

11291
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:14,150
would you would that make you said if
ai systems that are beautiful that are

11292
03:04:14,150 --> 03:04:14,160
ai systems that are beautiful that are
 

11293
03:04:14,160 --> 03:04:15,670
ai systems that are beautiful that are
conscious that are interesting and

11294
03:04:15,670 --> 03:04:15,680
conscious that are interesting and
 

11295
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:18,070

complex and intelligent

11296
03:04:18,070 --> 03:04:18,080
complex and intelligent
 

11297
03:04:18,080 --> 03:04:19,910
complex and intelligent
ultimately lead to the death of humans

11298
03:04:19,910 --> 03:04:19,920
ultimately lead to the death of humans
 

11299
03:04:19,920 --> 03:04:21,670
ultimately lead to the death of humans
that make you sad if humans led to the

11300
03:04:21,670 --> 03:04:21,680
that make you sad if humans led to the
 

11301
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:23,670
that make you sad if humans led to the
death of humans sorry

11302
03:04:23,670 --> 03:04:23,680
death of humans sorry
 

11303
03:04:23,680 --> 03:04:25,590
death of humans sorry
like if they would supersede humans oh

11304
03:04:25,590 --> 03:04:25,600
like if they would supersede humans oh
 

11305
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:29,110
like if they would supersede humans oh
if some ai yeah ai would uh

11306
03:04:29,110 --> 03:04:29,120
if some ai yeah ai would uh
 

11307
03:04:29,120 --> 03:04:31,190
if some ai yeah ai would uh
would end humans i mean that's that's

11308
03:04:31,190 --> 03:04:31,200
would end humans i mean that's that's
 

11309
03:04:31,200 --> 03:04:32,790
would end humans i mean that's that's
that's the reason why i'm like in some

11310
03:04:32,790 --> 03:04:32,800
that's the reason why i'm like in some
 

11311
03:04:32,800 --> 03:04:35,349
that's the reason why i'm like in some
ways in less emotionally concerned about

11312
03:04:35,349 --> 03:04:35,359
ways in less emotionally concerned about
 

11313
03:04:35,359 --> 03:04:38,630
ways in less emotionally concerned about
ai risk as then say bio you know bio

11314
03:04:38,630 --> 03:04:38,640
ai risk as then say bio you know bio
 

11315
03:04:38,640 --> 03:04:41,750
ai risk as then say bio you know bio
risk because at least with ai there's a

11316
03:04:41,750 --> 03:04:41,760
risk because at least with ai there's a
 

11317
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:43,269
risk because at least with ai there's a
chance you know if if we're in this

11318
03:04:43,269 --> 03:04:43,279
chance you know if if we're in this
 

11319
03:04:43,279 --> 03:04:45,510
chance you know if if we're in this
hypothetical where it wipes out humans

11320
03:04:45,510 --> 03:04:45,520
hypothetical where it wipes out humans
 

11321
03:04:45,520 --> 03:04:47,429
hypothetical where it wipes out humans
but it does it for some like

11322
03:04:47,429 --> 03:04:47,439
but it does it for some like
 

11323
03:04:47,439 --> 03:04:49,590
but it does it for some like
higher purpose it needs our atoms to an

11324
03:04:49,590 --> 03:04:49,600
higher purpose it needs our atoms to an
 

11325
03:04:49,600 --> 03:04:51,830
higher purpose it needs our atoms to an
energy to do something at least now

11326
03:04:51,830 --> 03:04:51,840
energy to do something at least now
 

11327
03:04:51,840 --> 03:04:53,190
energy to do something at least now
there's the universe is going on to do

11328
03:04:53,190 --> 03:04:53,200
there's the universe is going on to do
 

11329
03:04:53,200 --> 03:04:54,550
there's the universe is going on to do
something interesting

11330
03:04:54,550 --> 03:04:54,560
something interesting
 

11331
03:04:54,560 --> 03:04:56,550
something interesting
um whereas if it wipes everything you

11332
03:04:56,550 --> 03:04:56,560
um whereas if it wipes everything you
 

11333
03:04:56,560 --> 03:04:58,389
um whereas if it wipes everything you
know bio like just kills everything on

11334
03:04:58,389 --> 03:04:58,399
know bio like just kills everything on
 

11335
03:04:58,399 --> 03:05:00,950
know bio like just kills everything on
earth and that's it and there's no more

11336
03:05:00,950 --> 03:05:00,960
earth and that's it and there's no more
 

11337
03:05:00,960 --> 03:05:02,469
earth and that's it and there's no more
you know earth cannot spawn anything

11338
03:05:02,469 --> 03:05:02,479
you know earth cannot spawn anything
 

11339
03:05:02,479 --> 03:05:04,070
you know earth cannot spawn anything
more meaningful in the in the few

11340
03:05:04,070 --> 03:05:04,080
more meaningful in the in the few
 

11341
03:05:04,080 --> 03:05:05,750
more meaningful in the in the few
hundred million years it has less left

11342
03:05:05,750 --> 03:05:05,760
hundred million years it has less left
 

11343
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:07,429
hundred million years it has less left
because it doesn't have much time left

11344
03:05:07,429 --> 03:05:07,439
because it doesn't have much time left
 

11345
03:05:07,439 --> 03:05:08,950
because it doesn't have much time left
um

11346
03:05:08,950 --> 03:05:08,960
um
 

11347
03:05:08,960 --> 03:05:10,469
um
then

11348
03:05:10,469 --> 03:05:10,479
then
 

11349
03:05:10,479 --> 03:05:11,429
then
uh

11350
03:05:11,429 --> 03:05:11,439
uh
 

11351
03:05:11,439 --> 03:05:13,269
uh
yeah i i don't know

11352
03:05:13,269 --> 03:05:13,279
yeah i i don't know
 

11353
03:05:13,279 --> 03:05:15,349
yeah i i don't know
so one of my favorite books i've ever

11354
03:05:15,349 --> 03:05:15,359
so one of my favorite books i've ever

so one of my favorite books i've ever
read is uh nova scene

11356
03:05:17,110 --> 03:05:17,120
read is uh nova scene
 

11357
03:05:17,120 --> 03:05:19,750
read is uh nova scene
by james lovelock who sadly just died um

11358
03:05:19,750 --> 03:05:19,760
by james lovelock who sadly just died um
 

11359
03:05:19,760 --> 03:05:21,910
by james lovelock who sadly just died um
he wrote it when he was like 99.

11360
03:05:21,910 --> 03:05:21,920
he wrote it when he was like 99.
 

11361
03:05:21,920 --> 03:05:23,670
he wrote it when he was like 99.
he died aged 102 so it's a fairly new

11362
03:05:23,670 --> 03:05:23,680
he died aged 102 so it's a fairly new
 

11363
03:05:23,680 --> 03:05:24,710
he died aged 102 so it's a fairly new
book

11364
03:05:24,710 --> 03:05:24,720
book
 

11365
03:05:24,720 --> 03:05:27,110
book
um and he sort of talks about that that

11366
03:05:27,110 --> 03:05:27,120
um and he sort of talks about that that
 

11367
03:05:27,120 --> 03:05:29,110
um and he sort of talks about that that
he thinks it's you know

11368
03:05:29,110 --> 03:05:29,120
he thinks it's you know
 

11369
03:05:29,120 --> 03:05:31,030
he thinks it's you know
so building off this gaia theory where

11370
03:05:31,030 --> 03:05:31,040
so building off this gaia theory where
 

11371
03:05:31,040 --> 03:05:34,230
so building off this gaia theory where
like earth is like living

11372
03:05:34,230 --> 03:05:34,240
like earth is like living
 

11373
03:05:34,240 --> 03:05:36,150
like earth is like living
some form of intelligence itself and

11374
03:05:36,150 --> 03:05:36,160
some form of intelligence itself and
 

11375
03:05:36,160 --> 03:05:38,550
some form of intelligence itself and
that this is the next like step right is

11376
03:05:38,550 --> 03:05:38,560
that this is the next like step right is
 

11377
03:05:38,560 --> 03:05:41,590
that this is the next like step right is
this this whatever this new intelligence

11378
03:05:41,590 --> 03:05:41,600
this this whatever this new intelligence
 

11379
03:05:41,600 --> 03:05:43,510
this this whatever this new intelligence
that is maybe silicon based as opposed

11380
03:05:43,510 --> 03:05:43,520
that is maybe silicon based as opposed
 

11381
03:05:43,520 --> 03:05:46,150
that is maybe silicon based as opposed
to carbon-based goes on to do um and

11382
03:05:46,150 --> 03:05:46,160
to carbon-based goes on to do um and
 

11383
03:05:46,160 --> 03:05:47,670
to carbon-based goes on to do um and
it's really sort of in some ways an

11384
03:05:47,670 --> 03:05:47,680
it's really sort of in some ways an
 

11385
03:05:47,680 --> 03:05:50,710
it's really sort of in some ways an
optimistic but rudely fatalistic book um

11386
03:05:50,710 --> 03:05:50,720
optimistic but rudely fatalistic book um
 

11387
03:05:50,720 --> 03:05:52,150
optimistic but rudely fatalistic book um
and i don't know if i fully subscribe to

11388
03:05:52,150 --> 03:05:52,160
and i don't know if i fully subscribe to
 

11389
03:05:52,160 --> 03:05:53,429
and i don't know if i fully subscribe to
it but it's a beautiful piece to read

11390
03:05:53,429 --> 03:05:53,439
it but it's a beautiful piece to read
 

11391
03:05:53,439 --> 03:05:54,389
it but it's a beautiful piece to read
anyway

11392
03:05:54,389 --> 03:05:54,399
anyway
 

11393
03:05:54,399 --> 03:05:57,910
anyway
so am i sad by that idea i think so yes

11394
03:05:57,910 --> 03:05:57,920
so am i sad by that idea i think so yes
 

11395
03:05:57,920 --> 03:05:59,190
so am i sad by that idea i think so yes
and actually yeah this is the reason why

11396
03:05:59,190 --> 03:05:59,200
and actually yeah this is the reason why
 

11397
03:05:59,200 --> 03:06:01,269
and actually yeah this is the reason why
i'm sad by the idea because if something

11398
03:06:01,269 --> 03:06:01,279
i'm sad by the idea because if something
 

11399
03:06:01,279 --> 03:06:03,750
i'm sad by the idea because if something
is truly brilliant and wise and smart

11400
03:06:03,750 --> 03:06:03,760
is truly brilliant and wise and smart
 

11401
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:06,309
is truly brilliant and wise and smart
and truly super intelligent

11402
03:06:06,309 --> 03:06:06,319
and truly super intelligent
 

11403
03:06:06,319 --> 03:06:07,910
and truly super intelligent
it should be able to figure out

11404
03:06:07,910 --> 03:06:07,920
it should be able to figure out
 

11405
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:09,190
it should be able to figure out
abundance

11406
03:06:09,190 --> 03:06:09,200
abundance
 

11407
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:10,469
abundance
so

11408
03:06:10,469 --> 03:06:10,479
so
 

11409
03:06:10,479 --> 03:06:11,910
so
if it figures out abundance it shouldn't

11410
03:06:11,910 --> 03:06:11,920
if it figures out abundance it shouldn't
 

11411
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:13,190
if it figures out abundance it shouldn't
need to kill us off it should be able to

11412
03:06:13,190 --> 03:06:13,200
need to kill us off it should be able to
 

11413
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:15,110
need to kill us off it should be able to
find a way for us it should be there's

11414
03:06:15,110 --> 03:06:15,120
find a way for us it should be there's
 

11415
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:17,269
find a way for us it should be there's
plenty the universe is huge

11416
03:06:17,269 --> 03:06:17,279
plenty the universe is huge
 

11417
03:06:17,279 --> 03:06:18,710
plenty the universe is huge
there should be plenty of space for it

11418
03:06:18,710 --> 03:06:18,720
there should be plenty of space for it
 

11419
03:06:18,720 --> 03:06:19,750
there should be plenty of space for it
to go out

11420
03:06:19,750 --> 03:06:19,760
to go out
 

11421
03:06:19,760 --> 03:06:21,750
to go out
and do all the things it wants to do and

11422
03:06:21,750 --> 03:06:21,760
and do all the things it wants to do and
 

11423
03:06:21,760 --> 03:06:23,590
and do all the things it wants to do and
like give us a little pocket where we

11424
03:06:23,590 --> 03:06:23,600
like give us a little pocket where we
 

11425
03:06:23,600 --> 03:06:25,030
like give us a little pocket where we
can continue doing our things and we can

11426
03:06:25,030 --> 03:06:25,040
can continue doing our things and we can
 

11427
03:06:25,040 --> 03:06:27,510
can continue doing our things and we can
continue to do things and so on um and

11428
03:06:27,510 --> 03:06:27,520
continue to do things and so on um and
 

11429
03:06:27,520 --> 03:06:28,790
continue to do things and so on um and
again if it's so supremely wise it

11430
03:06:28,790 --> 03:06:28,800
again if it's so supremely wise it
 

11431
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:30,309
again if it's so supremely wise it
shouldn't even be worried about the game

11432
03:06:30,309 --> 03:06:30,319
shouldn't even be worried about the game
 

11433
03:06:30,319 --> 03:06:32,389
shouldn't even be worried about the game
theoretic considerations that by leaving

11434
03:06:32,389 --> 03:06:32,399
theoretic considerations that by leaving
 

11435
03:06:32,399 --> 03:06:33,590
theoretic considerations that by leaving
us alive we'll then go and create

11436
03:06:33,590 --> 03:06:33,600
us alive we'll then go and create
 

11437
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:34,950
us alive we'll then go and create
another like super intelligent agent

11438
03:06:34,950 --> 03:06:34,960
another like super intelligent agent
 

11439
03:06:34,960 --> 03:06:36,469
another like super intelligent agent
that it then has to compete against

11440
03:06:36,469 --> 03:06:36,479
that it then has to compete against
 

11441
03:06:36,479 --> 03:06:37,990
that it then has to compete against
because it should be omni-wise and smart

11442
03:06:37,990 --> 03:06:38,000
because it should be omni-wise and smart
 

11443
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:39,429
because it should be omni-wise and smart
enough to not have to concern itself

11444
03:06:39,429 --> 03:06:39,439
enough to not have to concern itself
 

11445
03:06:39,439 --> 03:06:40,550
enough to not have to concern itself
with that

11446
03:06:40,550 --> 03:06:40,560
with that
 

11447
03:06:40,560 --> 03:06:42,950
with that
unless unless it deems humans to be kind

11448
03:06:42,950 --> 03:06:42,960
unless unless it deems humans to be kind
 

11449
03:06:42,960 --> 03:06:44,550
unless unless it deems humans to be kind
of

11450
03:06:44,550 --> 03:06:44,560
of
 

11451
03:06:44,560 --> 03:06:46,309
of
like uh like

03:06:46,309 --> 03:06:46,319
like uh like
 

11453
03:06:46,319 --> 03:06:48,790
like uh like
the humans are a source of none of a

11454

the humans are a source of none of a

lose-lose kind of dynamics

11456
03:06:51,990 --> 03:06:52,000
lose-lose kind of dynamics
 

11457
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:52,950
lose-lose kind of dynamics
well

11458
03:06:52,950 --> 03:06:52,960
well
 

11459
03:06:52,960 --> 03:06:54,710
well
yes and no

11460
03:06:54,710 --> 03:06:54,720
yes and no
 

11461
03:06:54,720 --> 03:06:56,710
yes and no
we're not molecules that's why i think

11462
03:06:56,710 --> 03:06:56,720
we're not molecules that's why i think
 

11463
03:06:56,720 --> 03:06:58,309
we're not molecules that's why i think
it's important to say well maybe humans

11464
03:06:58,309 --> 03:06:58,319
it's important to say well maybe humans
 

11465
03:06:58,319 --> 03:06:59,990
it's important to say well maybe humans
are the source of molecule

11466
03:06:59,990 --> 03:07:00,000
are the source of molecule
 

11467
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:01,910
are the source of molecule
no i mean i think

11468
03:07:01,910 --> 03:07:01,920
no i mean i think
 

11469
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:04,230
no i mean i think
game theory is the source of moloch and

11470
03:07:04,230 --> 03:07:04,240
game theory is the source of moloch and
 

11471
03:07:04,240 --> 03:07:06,469
game theory is the source of moloch and
you know because molecule exists in in

11472
03:07:06,469 --> 03:07:06,479
you know because molecule exists in in
 

11473
03:07:06,479 --> 03:07:08,389
you know because molecule exists in in
non-human systems as well it happens

11474
03:07:08,389 --> 03:07:08,399
non-human systems as well it happens
 

11475
03:07:08,399 --> 03:07:10,550
non-human systems as well it happens
within like agents within a game in

11476
03:07:10,550 --> 03:07:10,560
within like agents within a game in
 

11477
03:07:10,560 --> 03:07:11,910
within like agents within a game in
terms of like you know

11478
03:07:11,910 --> 03:07:11,920
terms of like you know
 

11479
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:14,230
terms of like you know
uh it applies to agents but it like it

11480
03:07:14,230 --> 03:07:14,240
uh it applies to agents but it like it
 

11481
03:07:14,240 --> 03:07:16,790
uh it applies to agents but it like it
can apply to you know

11482
03:07:16,790 --> 03:07:16,800
can apply to you know
 

11483
03:07:16,800 --> 03:07:19,910
can apply to you know
uh a species that's on an island

11484
03:07:19,910 --> 03:07:19,920
uh a species that's on an island
 

11485
03:07:19,920 --> 03:07:22,469
uh a species that's on an island
of animals you know rats out competing

11486
03:07:22,469 --> 03:07:22,479
of animals you know rats out competing
 

11487
03:07:22,479 --> 03:07:24,870
of animals you know rats out competing
the ones that like massively consume all

11488
03:07:24,870 --> 03:07:24,880
the ones that like massively consume all
 

11489
03:07:24,880 --> 03:07:25,830
the ones that like massively consume all
the resources are the ones that are

11490
03:07:25,830 --> 03:07:25,840
the resources are the ones that are
 

11491
03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:27,429
the resources are the ones that are
going to win out over the more like

11492
03:07:27,429 --> 03:07:27,439
going to win out over the more like
 

11493
03:07:27,439 --> 03:07:28,389
going to win out over the more like
chill

11494
03:07:28,389 --> 03:07:28,399
chill
 

11495
03:07:28,399 --> 03:07:30,469
chill
socialized ones and so you know creates

11496
03:07:30,469 --> 03:07:30,479
socialized ones and so you know creates
 

11497
03:07:30,479 --> 03:07:32,550
socialized ones and so you know creates
this malthusian trap like moloch exists

11498
03:07:32,550 --> 03:07:32,560
this malthusian trap like moloch exists
 

11499
03:07:32,560 --> 03:07:34,550
this malthusian trap like moloch exists
in little pockets in nature as well well

11500
03:07:34,550 --> 03:07:34,560
in little pockets in nature as well well
 

11501
03:07:34,560 --> 03:07:36,309
in little pockets in nature as well well
so it's not a strictly human i wonder if

11502
03:07:36,309 --> 03:07:36,319
so it's not a strictly human i wonder if
 

11503
03:07:36,319 --> 03:07:38,230
so it's not a strictly human i wonder if
it's actually a result the consequences

11504
03:07:38,230 --> 03:07:38,240
it's actually a result the consequences
 

11505
03:07:38,240 --> 03:07:40,070
it's actually a result the consequences
of the invention of predator and prey

11506
03:07:40,070 --> 03:07:40,080
of the invention of predator and prey
 

11507
03:07:40,080 --> 03:07:41,510
of the invention of predator and prey
dynamics

11508
03:07:41,510 --> 03:07:41,520
dynamics
 

11509
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:44,150
dynamics
maybe it needs to ai will have to kill

11510
03:07:44,150 --> 03:07:44,160
maybe it needs to ai will have to kill
 

11511
03:07:44,160 --> 03:07:45,190
maybe it needs to ai will have to kill
off

11512
03:07:45,190 --> 03:07:45,200
off
 

11513
03:07:45,200 --> 03:07:47,190
off
every organism

11514
03:07:47,190 --> 03:07:47,200
every organism
 

11515
03:07:47,200 --> 03:07:48,389
every organism
that you're talking about killing of

11516
03:07:48,389 --> 03:07:48,399
that you're talking about killing of
 

11517
03:07:48,399 --> 03:07:50,150
that you're talking about killing of
competition

11518
03:07:50,150 --> 03:07:50,160
competition
 

11519
03:07:50,160 --> 03:07:54,230
competition
not competition but just um

11520
03:07:54,230 --> 03:07:54,240
not competition but just um
 

11521
03:07:54,240 --> 03:07:55,830
not competition but just um
like the way

11522
03:07:55,830 --> 03:07:55,840
like the way
 

11523
03:07:55,840 --> 03:07:58,070
like the way
it's like uh

11524
03:07:58,070 --> 03:07:58,080
it's like uh
 

11525
03:07:58,080 --> 03:08:00,389
it's like uh
like the weeds or whatever in in a

11526
03:08:00,389 --> 03:08:00,399
like the weeds or whatever in in a
 

11527
03:08:00,399 --> 03:08:02,070
like the weeds or whatever in in a
beautiful flower garden

11528
03:08:02,070 --> 03:08:02,080
beautiful flower garden
 

11529
03:08:02,080 --> 03:08:04,070
beautiful flower garden
the parasites yeah

11530
03:08:04,070 --> 03:08:04,080
the parasites yeah
 

11531
03:08:04,080 --> 03:08:05,910
the parasites yeah
on on the whole system now of course it

11532
03:08:05,910 --> 03:08:05,920
on on the whole system now of course it
 

11533
03:08:05,920 --> 03:08:08,309
on on the whole system now of course it
will it will it won't do that completely

11534
03:08:08,309 --> 03:08:08,319
will it will it won't do that completely
 

11535
03:08:08,319 --> 03:08:09,910
will it will it won't do that completely
it'll put them in a zoo like we do with

11536
03:08:09,910 --> 03:08:09,920
it'll put them in a zoo like we do with
 

11537
03:08:09,920 --> 03:08:11,429
it'll put them in a zoo like we do with
parasites it'll ring fence yeah and

11538
03:08:11,429 --> 03:08:11,439
parasites it'll ring fence yeah and
 

11539
03:08:11,439 --> 03:08:13,910
parasites it'll ring fence yeah and
there'll be somebody doing a phd on like

11540
03:08:13,910 --> 03:08:13,920
there'll be somebody doing a phd on like
 

11541
03:08:13,920 --> 03:08:15,990
there'll be somebody doing a phd on like
they'll prod humans with a stick and see

11542
03:08:15,990 --> 03:08:16,000
they'll prod humans with a stick and see
 

11543
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:16,610
they'll prod humans with a stick and see
what they do

11544
03:08:16,610 --> 03:08:16,620
what they do
 

11545
03:08:16,620 --> 03:08:18,790
what they do
[Laughter]

11546
03:08:18,790 --> 03:08:18,800
[Laughter]
 

11547
03:08:18,800 --> 03:08:21,269
[Laughter]
but uh i mean in terms of letting us run

11548
03:08:21,269 --> 03:08:21,279
but uh i mean in terms of letting us run
 

11549
03:08:21,279 --> 03:08:22,309
but uh i mean in terms of letting us run
wild

11550
03:08:22,309 --> 03:08:22,319
wild
 

11551
03:08:22,319 --> 03:08:24,389
wild
outside of the uh uh you know a

11552
03:08:24,389 --> 03:08:24,399
outside of the uh uh you know a
 

11553
03:08:24,399 --> 03:08:26,070
outside of the uh uh you know a
geographically constrained region that

11554
03:08:26,070 --> 03:08:26,080
geographically constrained region that
 

11555
03:08:26,080 --> 03:08:27,349
geographically constrained region that
might be

11556
03:08:27,349 --> 03:08:27,359
might be
 

11557
03:08:27,359 --> 03:08:30,070
might be
uh that you might have uh decided

11558
03:08:30,070 --> 03:08:30,080
uh that you might have uh decided
 

11559
03:08:30,080 --> 03:08:31,990
uh that you might have uh decided
against that no i think there's

11560
03:08:31,990 --> 03:08:32,000
against that no i think there's
 

11561
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:33,910
against that no i think there's
obviously the capacity for beauty and

11562
03:08:33,910 --> 03:08:33,920
obviously the capacity for beauty and
 

11563
03:08:33,920 --> 03:08:35,230
obviously the capacity for beauty and
kindness and

11564
03:08:35,230 --> 03:08:35,240
kindness and
 

11565
03:08:35,240 --> 03:08:37,030
kindness and
non-uh

11566
03:08:37,030 --> 03:08:37,040
non-uh
 

11567
03:08:37,040 --> 03:08:39,670
non-uh
non-malic behavior amidst humans so i'm

11568
03:08:39,670 --> 03:08:39,680
non-malic behavior amidst humans so i'm
 

11569
03:08:39,680 --> 03:08:41,830
non-malic behavior amidst humans so i'm
pretty sure ai will preserve us

11570
03:08:41,830 --> 03:08:41,840
pretty sure ai will preserve us
 

11571
03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:43,510
pretty sure ai will preserve us
uh let me

11572
03:08:43,510 --> 03:08:43,520
uh let me
 

11573
03:08:43,520 --> 03:08:45,269
uh let me
you i don't know if you answered the the

11574
03:08:45,269 --> 03:08:45,279
you i don't know if you answered the the
 

11575
03:08:45,279 --> 03:08:47,190
you i don't know if you answered the the
aliens question you no i didn't you had

11576
03:08:47,190 --> 03:08:47,200
aliens question you no i didn't you had
 

11577
03:08:47,200 --> 03:08:49,510
aliens question you no i didn't you had
a good conversation with toby uh toby

11578
03:08:49,510 --> 03:08:49,520
a good conversation with toby uh toby
 

11579
03:08:49,520 --> 03:08:52,070
a good conversation with toby uh toby
yes about various sides of the universe

11580
03:08:52,070 --> 03:08:52,080
yes about various sides of the universe
 

11581
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:54,469
yes about various sides of the universe
i think did did he say no i'm forgetting

11582
03:08:54,469 --> 03:08:54,479
i think did did he say no i'm forgetting
 

11583
03:08:54,479 --> 03:08:56,550
i think did did he say no i'm forgetting
but i think he said it's a good chance

11584
03:08:56,550 --> 03:08:56,560
but i think he said it's a good chance
 

11585
03:08:56,560 --> 03:08:58,070
but i think he said it's a good chance
we're alone

11586
03:08:58,070 --> 03:08:58,080
we're alone
 

11587
03:08:58,080 --> 03:09:00,550
we're alone
so the the the classic you know fermi

11588
03:09:00,550 --> 03:09:00,560
so the the the classic you know fermi
 

11589
03:09:00,560 --> 03:09:02,550
so the the the classic you know fermi
paradox question is

11590
03:09:02,550 --> 03:09:02,560
paradox question is
 

11591
03:09:02,560 --> 03:09:03,750
paradox question is
um

11592
03:09:03,750 --> 03:09:03,760
um
 

11593
03:09:03,760 --> 03:09:07,349
um
there are so many spawn points and

11594
03:09:07,349 --> 03:09:07,359
there are so many spawn points and
 

11595
03:09:07,359 --> 03:09:08,710
there are so many spawn points and
yet

11596
03:09:08,710 --> 03:09:08,720
yet
 

11597
03:09:08,720 --> 03:09:10,630
yet
you know it didn't take us that long to

11598
03:09:10,630 --> 03:09:10,640
you know it didn't take us that long to
 

11599
03:09:10,640 --> 03:09:12,790
you know it didn't take us that long to
go from harnessing fire to

11600
03:09:12,790 --> 03:09:12,800
go from harnessing fire to
 

11601
03:09:12,800 --> 03:09:15,030
go from harnessing fire to
sending out radio signals into space

11602
03:09:15,030 --> 03:09:15,040
sending out radio signals into space
 

11603
03:09:15,040 --> 03:09:16,870
sending out radio signals into space
so surely

11604
03:09:16,870 --> 03:09:16,880
so surely
 

11605
03:09:16,880 --> 03:09:18,550
so surely
given the vastness of space we should be

11606
03:09:18,550 --> 03:09:18,560
given the vastness of space we should be
 

11607
03:09:18,560 --> 03:09:19,990
given the vastness of space we should be
and you know even if only a tiny

11608
03:09:19,990 --> 03:09:20,000
and you know even if only a tiny
 

11609
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:21,670
and you know even if only a tiny
fraction of those create

11610
03:09:21,670 --> 03:09:21,680
fraction of those create
 

11611
03:09:21,680 --> 03:09:23,110
fraction of those create
life and other civilizations too we

11612
03:09:23,110 --> 03:09:23,120
life and other civilizations too we
 

11613
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:24,389
life and other civilizations too we
should be the universe should be very

11614
03:09:24,389 --> 03:09:24,399
should be the universe should be very
 

11615
03:09:24,399 --> 03:09:26,469
should be the universe should be very
noisy there should be evidence of

11616
03:09:26,469 --> 03:09:26,479
noisy there should be evidence of
 

11617
03:09:26,479 --> 03:09:28,230
noisy there should be evidence of
dyson spheres or whatever you know like

11618
03:09:28,230 --> 03:09:28,240
dyson spheres or whatever you know like
 

11619
03:09:28,240 --> 03:09:29,830
dyson spheres or whatever you know like
at least radio signals and so on but

11620
03:09:29,830 --> 03:09:29,840
at least radio signals and so on but
 

11621
03:09:29,840 --> 03:09:31,429
at least radio signals and so on but
seemingly things are very silent out

11622
03:09:31,429 --> 03:09:31,439
seemingly things are very silent out
 

11623
03:09:31,439 --> 03:09:33,349
seemingly things are very silent out
there um now of course it depends on who

11624
03:09:33,349 --> 03:09:33,359
there um now of course it depends on who
 

11625
03:09:33,359 --> 03:09:34,469
there um now of course it depends on who
you speak to some people say that

11626
03:09:34,469 --> 03:09:34,479
you speak to some people say that
 

11627
03:09:34,479 --> 03:09:35,830
you speak to some people say that
they're getting signals all the time and

11628
03:09:35,830 --> 03:09:35,840
they're getting signals all the time and
 

11629
03:09:35,840 --> 03:09:37,510
they're getting signals all the time and
so on and like i don't want to make an

11630
03:09:37,510 --> 03:09:37,520
so on and like i don't want to make an
 

11631
03:09:37,520 --> 03:09:41,190
so on and like i don't want to make an
epistemic statement on that but um

11632
03:09:41,190 --> 03:09:41,200
epistemic statement on that but um
 

11633
03:09:41,200 --> 03:09:43,030
epistemic statement on that but um
it seems like there's a lot of silence

11634
03:09:43,030 --> 03:09:43,040
it seems like there's a lot of silence
 

11635
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:45,590
it seems like there's a lot of silence
and so that raises this paradox

11636
03:09:45,590 --> 03:09:45,600
and so that raises this paradox
 

11637
03:09:45,600 --> 03:09:47,269
and so that raises this paradox
and then

11638
03:09:47,269 --> 03:09:47,279
and then
 

11639
03:09:47,279 --> 03:09:48,469
and then
they

11640
03:09:48,469 --> 03:09:48,479
they
 

11641
03:09:48,479 --> 03:09:50,870
they
the the you know the drake equation

11642
03:09:50,870 --> 03:09:50,880
the the you know the drake equation
 

11643
03:09:50,880 --> 03:09:53,269
the the you know the drake equation
so the drake equation is like uh

11644
03:09:53,269 --> 03:09:53,279
so the drake equation is like uh
 

11645
03:09:53,279 --> 03:09:54,230
so the drake equation is like uh
basically

11646
03:09:54,230 --> 03:09:54,240
basically
 

11647
03:09:54,240 --> 03:09:55,590
basically
just a simple thing of like trying to

11648
03:09:55,590 --> 03:09:55,600
just a simple thing of like trying to
 

11649
03:09:55,600 --> 03:09:57,590
just a simple thing of like trying to
estimate the number of possible uh

11650
03:09:57,590 --> 03:09:57,600
estimate the number of possible uh
 

11651
03:09:57,600 --> 03:09:58,950
estimate the number of possible uh
civilizations within the galaxy by

11652
03:09:58,950 --> 03:09:58,960
civilizations within the galaxy by
 

11653
03:09:58,960 --> 03:10:01,110
civilizations within the galaxy by
multiplying the number of uh stars

11654
03:10:01,110 --> 03:10:01,120
multiplying the number of uh stars
 

11655
03:10:01,120 --> 03:10:02,790
multiplying the number of uh stars
created per year by the number of stars

11656
03:10:02,790 --> 03:10:02,800
created per year by the number of stars
 

11657
03:10:02,800 --> 03:10:03,830
created per year by the number of stars
that have planets planets that are

11658
03:10:03,830 --> 03:10:03,840
that have planets planets that are
 

11659
03:10:03,840 --> 03:10:05,110
that have planets planets that are
habitable blah blah blah so all these

11660
03:10:05,110 --> 03:10:05,120
habitable blah blah blah so all these
 

11661
03:10:05,120 --> 03:10:07,349
habitable blah blah blah so all these
like different factors um and then you

11662
03:10:07,349 --> 03:10:07,359
like different factors um and then you
 

11663
03:10:07,359 --> 03:10:08,950
like different factors um and then you
plug in numbers into that and you you

11664
03:10:08,950 --> 03:10:08,960
plug in numbers into that and you you
 

11665
03:10:08,960 --> 03:10:10,790
plug in numbers into that and you you
know depending on like the range of you

11666
03:10:10,790 --> 03:10:10,800
know depending on like the range of you
 

11667
03:10:10,800 --> 03:10:12,389
know depending on like the range of you
know your lower bound and your upper

11668
03:10:12,389 --> 03:10:12,399
know your lower bound and your upper
 

11669
03:10:12,399 --> 03:10:13,429
know your lower bound and your upper
bound

11670
03:10:13,429 --> 03:10:13,439
bound
 

11671
03:10:13,439 --> 03:10:15,030
bound
point point estimates that you put in

11672
03:10:15,030 --> 03:10:15,040
point point estimates that you put in
 

11673
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:16,870
point point estimates that you put in
you get out a number at the end for the

11674
03:10:16,870 --> 03:10:16,880
you get out a number at the end for the
 

11675
03:10:16,880 --> 03:10:18,389
you get out a number at the end for the
number of civilizations

11676
03:10:18,389 --> 03:10:18,399
number of civilizations
 

11677
03:10:18,399 --> 03:10:21,510
number of civilizations
but what toby and his crew did um

11678
03:10:21,510 --> 03:10:21,520
but what toby and his crew did um
 

11679
03:10:21,520 --> 03:10:23,590
but what toby and his crew did um
differently was toby this is a

11680
03:10:23,590 --> 03:10:23,600
differently was toby this is a
 

11681
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:24,950
differently was toby this is a
researcher at the future humanity

11682
03:10:24,950 --> 03:10:24,960
researcher at the future humanity
 

11683
03:10:24,960 --> 03:10:26,790
researcher at the future humanity
institute uh

11684
03:10:26,790 --> 03:10:26,800
institute uh
 

11685
03:10:26,800 --> 03:10:29,670
institute uh
they instead of

11686
03:10:29,670 --> 03:10:29,680
they instead of
 

11687
03:10:29,680 --> 03:10:31,190
they instead of
they realize that it's like basically a

11688
03:10:31,190 --> 03:10:31,200
they realize that it's like basically a
 

11689
03:10:31,200 --> 03:10:32,950
they realize that it's like basically a
statistical quirk that if you put in

11690
03:10:32,950 --> 03:10:32,960
statistical quirk that if you put in
 

11691
03:10:32,960 --> 03:10:34,389
statistical quirk that if you put in
point sources even if you think you're

11692
03:10:34,389 --> 03:10:34,399
point sources even if you think you're
 

11693
03:10:34,399 --> 03:10:35,910
point sources even if you think you're
putting in conservative point sources

11694
03:10:35,910 --> 03:10:35,920
putting in conservative point sources
 

11695
03:10:35,920 --> 03:10:38,630
putting in conservative point sources
because on some of these variables the

11696
03:10:38,630 --> 03:10:38,640
because on some of these variables the
 

11697
03:10:38,640 --> 03:10:41,590
because on some of these variables the
the uncertainty is so large it spans

11698
03:10:41,590 --> 03:10:41,600
the uncertainty is so large it spans
 

11699
03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:43,750
the uncertainty is so large it spans
like maybe even like a couple of hundred

11700
03:10:43,750 --> 03:10:43,760
like maybe even like a couple of hundred
 

11701
03:10:43,760 --> 03:10:45,429
like maybe even like a couple of hundred
orders of magnitude

11702
03:10:45,429 --> 03:10:45,439
orders of magnitude
 

11703
03:10:45,439 --> 03:10:46,309
orders of magnitude
um

11704
03:10:46,309 --> 03:10:46,319
um
 

11705
03:10:46,319 --> 03:10:47,990
um
by putting in point sources it's always

11706
03:10:47,990 --> 03:10:48,000
by putting in point sources it's always
 

11707
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:50,790
by putting in point sources it's always
going to lead to um overestimates

11708
03:10:50,790 --> 03:10:50,800
going to lead to um overestimates
 

11709
03:10:50,800 --> 03:10:52,630
going to lead to um overestimates
um and so they

11710
03:10:52,630 --> 03:10:52,640
um and so they
 

11711
03:10:52,640 --> 03:10:54,469
um and so they
by putting stuff on a log scale

11712
03:10:54,469 --> 03:10:54,479
by putting stuff on a log scale
 

11713
03:10:54,479 --> 03:10:55,670
by putting stuff on a log scale
actually they did it on like a log log

11714
03:10:55,670 --> 03:10:55,680
actually they did it on like a log log
 

11715
03:10:55,680 --> 03:10:57,910
actually they did it on like a log log
scale on some of them um and then like

11716
03:10:57,910 --> 03:10:57,920
scale on some of them um and then like
 

11717
03:10:57,920 --> 03:11:00,389
scale on some of them um and then like
ran the simulation across the whole

11718
03:11:00,389 --> 03:11:00,399
ran the simulation across the whole
 

11719
03:11:00,399 --> 03:11:02,950
ran the simulation across the whole
um bucket of uncertainty across all

11720
03:11:02,950 --> 03:11:02,960
um bucket of uncertainty across all
 

11721
03:11:02,960 --> 03:11:04,710
um bucket of uncertainty across all
those orders of magnitude when you do

11722
03:11:04,710 --> 03:11:04,720
those orders of magnitude when you do
 

11723
03:11:04,720 --> 03:11:05,750
those orders of magnitude when you do
that

11724
03:11:05,750 --> 03:11:05,760
that
 

11725
03:11:05,760 --> 03:11:07,510
that
then actually the number comes out much

11726
03:11:07,510 --> 03:11:07,520
then actually the number comes out much
 

11727
03:11:07,520 --> 03:11:09,190
then actually the number comes out much
much smaller and that's the more

11728
03:11:09,190 --> 03:11:09,200
much smaller and that's the more
 

11729
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:10,550
much smaller and that's the more
statistically rigorous you know

11730
03:11:10,550 --> 03:11:10,560
statistically rigorous you know
 

11731
03:11:10,560 --> 03:11:12,309
statistically rigorous you know
mathematically correct way of doing the

11732
03:11:12,309 --> 03:11:12,319
mathematically correct way of doing the
 

11733
03:11:12,319 --> 03:11:14,230
mathematically correct way of doing the
calculation it's still a lot of hand

11734
03:11:14,230 --> 03:11:14,240
calculation it's still a lot of hand
 

11735
03:11:14,240 --> 03:11:16,150
calculation it's still a lot of hand
waving as science goes it's it's like

11736
03:11:16,150 --> 03:11:16,160
waving as science goes it's it's like
 

11737
03:11:16,160 --> 03:11:17,190
waving as science goes it's it's like
definitely

11738
03:11:17,190 --> 03:11:17,200
definitely
 

11739
03:11:17,200 --> 03:11:18,950
definitely
you know just waving i don't know what

11740
03:11:18,950 --> 03:11:18,960
you know just waving i don't know what
 

11741
03:11:18,960 --> 03:11:22,950
you know just waving i don't know what
an analogy is but it's hand wavy um and

11742
03:11:22,950 --> 03:11:22,960
an analogy is but it's hand wavy um and
 

11743
03:11:22,960 --> 03:11:24,950
an analogy is but it's hand wavy um and
uh anyway when they did this and then

11744
03:11:24,950 --> 03:11:24,960
uh anyway when they did this and then
 

11745
03:11:24,960 --> 03:11:26,870
uh anyway when they did this and then
they did a bayesian update on it as well

11746
03:11:26,870 --> 03:11:26,880
they did a bayesian update on it as well
 

11747
03:11:26,880 --> 03:11:28,950
they did a bayesian update on it as well
to like factor in the fact that there is

11748
03:11:28,950 --> 03:11:28,960
to like factor in the fact that there is
 

11749
03:11:28,960 --> 03:11:30,550
to like factor in the fact that there is
no evidence that we're picking up

11750
03:11:30,550 --> 03:11:30,560
no evidence that we're picking up
 

11751
03:11:30,560 --> 03:11:32,070
no evidence that we're picking up
because you know no evidence is actually

11752
03:11:32,070 --> 03:11:32,080
because you know no evidence is actually
 

11753
03:11:32,080 --> 03:11:35,110
because you know no evidence is actually
a form of evidence right um and

11754
03:11:35,110 --> 03:11:35,120
a form of evidence right um and
 

11755
03:11:35,120 --> 03:11:36,630
a form of evidence right um and
the long and short of it comes out that

11756
03:11:36,630 --> 03:11:36,640
the long and short of it comes out that
 

11757
03:11:36,640 --> 03:11:37,590
the long and short of it comes out that
the

11758
03:11:37,590 --> 03:11:37,600
the
 

11759
03:11:37,600 --> 03:11:41,510
the
we're roughly around 70 to be the only

11760
03:11:41,510 --> 03:11:41,520
we're roughly around 70 to be the only
 

11761
03:11:41,520 --> 03:11:42,389
we're roughly around 70 to be the only

11762
03:11:42,389 --> 03:11:42,399

crazily counterintuitive but their math

11770
03:11:51,269 --> 03:11:51,279
crazily counterintuitive but their math
 

11771
03:11:51,279 --> 03:11:52,230
crazily counterintuitive but their math
is

11772
03:11:52,230 --> 03:11:52,240
is
 

11773
03:11:52,240 --> 03:11:53,269
is
legit

11774
03:11:53,269 --> 03:11:53,279
legit
 

11775
03:11:53,279 --> 03:11:54,790
legit
well yeah the math around this

11776
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:54,800
well yeah the math around this
 

11777
03:11:54,800 --> 03:11:56,389
well yeah the math around this
particular equation which equation is

11778
03:11:56,389 --> 03:11:56,399
particular equation which equation is
 

11779
03:11:56,399 --> 03:12:00,230
particular equation which equation is
ridiculous on many levels but uh the

11780
03:12:00,230 --> 03:12:00,240
ridiculous on many levels but uh the
 

11781
03:12:00,240 --> 03:12:02,070
ridiculous on many levels but uh the
the the the powerful thing about the

11782
03:12:02,070 --> 03:12:02,080
the the the powerful thing about the
 

11783
03:12:02,080 --> 03:12:05,429
the the the powerful thing about the
equation is there's the different things

11784
03:12:05,429 --> 03:12:05,439
equation is there's the different things
 

11785
03:12:05,439 --> 03:12:07,750
equation is there's the different things
different components that can be

11786
03:12:07,750 --> 03:12:07,760
different components that can be
 

11787
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:09,349
different components that can be
estimated

11788
03:12:09,349 --> 03:12:09,359
estimated
 

11789
03:12:09,359 --> 03:12:11,110
estimated
and the error bars on which can be

11790
03:12:11,110 --> 03:12:11,120
and the error bars on which can be
 

11791
03:12:11,120 --> 03:12:13,750
and the error bars on which can be
reduced with science

11792
03:12:13,750 --> 03:12:13,760
reduced with science
 

11793
03:12:13,760 --> 03:12:16,230
reduced with science
and enhanced throughout since the

11794
03:12:16,230 --> 03:12:16,240
and enhanced throughout since the
 

11795
03:12:16,240 --> 03:12:18,150
and enhanced throughout since the
equation came out the error box have

11796
03:12:18,150 --> 03:12:18,160
equation came out the error box have
 

11797
03:12:18,160 --> 03:12:19,670
equation came out the error box have
been coming out on different atoms yeah

11798
03:12:19,670 --> 03:12:19,680
been coming out on different atoms yeah
 

11799
03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:21,830
been coming out on different atoms yeah
that's right aspects and so that it

11800
03:12:21,830 --> 03:12:21,840
that's right aspects and so that it
 

11801
03:12:21,840 --> 03:12:23,429
that's right aspects and so that it
almost kind of says

11802
03:12:23,429 --> 03:12:23,439
almost kind of says
 

11803
03:12:23,439 --> 03:12:25,750
almost kind of says
uh what like this gives you a mission to

11804
03:12:25,750 --> 03:12:25,760
uh what like this gives you a mission to
 

11805
03:12:25,760 --> 03:12:28,710
uh what like this gives you a mission to
reduce the error bars on these estimates

11806
03:12:28,710 --> 03:12:28,720
reduce the error bars on these estimates
 

11807
03:12:28,720 --> 03:12:30,389
reduce the error bars on these estimates
now over a period of time and once you

11808
03:12:30,389 --> 03:12:30,399
now over a period of time and once you
 

11809
03:12:30,399 --> 03:12:32,630
now over a period of time and once you
do you can better and better understand

11810
03:12:32,630 --> 03:12:32,640
do you can better and better understand
 

11811
03:12:32,640 --> 03:12:34,230
do you can better and better understand
like in the process of redoing the error

11812
03:12:34,230 --> 03:12:34,240
like in the process of redoing the error
 

11813
03:12:34,240 --> 03:12:37,190
like in the process of redoing the error
bars you'll get to understand actually

11814
03:12:37,190 --> 03:12:37,200
bars you'll get to understand actually
 

11815
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:39,190
bars you'll get to understand actually
what is the right way to

11816
03:12:39,190 --> 03:12:39,200
what is the right way to
 

11817
03:12:39,200 --> 03:12:41,830
what is the right way to
find out where the aliens are how many

11818
03:12:41,830 --> 03:12:41,840
find out where the aliens are how many
 

11819
03:12:41,840 --> 03:12:43,590
find out where the aliens are how many
of them there are and all those kinds of

11820
03:12:43,590 --> 03:12:43,600
of them there are and all those kinds of
 

11821
03:12:43,600 --> 03:12:45,429
of them there are and all those kinds of
things so i don't

11822
03:12:45,429 --> 03:12:45,439
things so i don't
 

11823
03:12:45,439 --> 03:12:47,030
things so i don't
think it's good to use that for an

11824
03:12:47,030 --> 03:12:47,040
think it's good to use that for an
 

11825
03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:48,870
think it's good to use that for an
estimation i think you do have to think

11826
03:12:48,870 --> 03:12:48,880
estimation i think you do have to think
 

11827
03:12:48,880 --> 03:12:50,070
estimation i think you do have to think
from like

11828
03:12:50,070 --> 03:12:50,080
from like
 

11829
03:12:50,080 --> 03:12:51,990
from like
more like from first principles just

11830
03:12:51,990 --> 03:12:52,000
more like from first principles just
 

11831
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:54,950
more like from first principles just
looking at what life is on earth

11832
03:12:54,950 --> 03:12:54,960
looking at what life is on earth
 

11833
03:12:54,960 --> 03:12:58,389
looking at what life is on earth
like and trying to understand the very

11834
03:12:58,389 --> 03:12:58,399
like and trying to understand the very
 

11835
03:12:58,399 --> 03:13:00,309
like and trying to understand the very
physics-based biologic

11836
03:13:00,309 --> 03:13:00,319
physics-based biologic
 

11837
03:13:00,319 --> 03:13:02,710
physics-based biologic
chemistry biology-based question of what

11838
03:13:02,710 --> 03:13:02,720
chemistry biology-based question of what
 

11839
03:13:02,720 --> 03:13:04,070
chemistry biology-based question of what
is life

11840
03:13:04,070 --> 03:13:04,080
is life
 

11841
03:13:04,080 --> 03:13:06,550
is life
maybe computation based what the is

11842
03:13:06,550 --> 03:13:06,560
maybe computation based what the is
 

11843
03:13:06,560 --> 03:13:09,429
maybe computation based what the is
this thing right and that like how

11844
03:13:09,429 --> 03:13:09,439
this thing right and that like how
 

11845
03:13:09,439 --> 03:13:11,510
this thing right and that like how
difficult is it to create this thing

11846
03:13:11,510 --> 03:13:11,520
difficult is it to create this thing
 

11847
03:13:11,520 --> 03:13:13,590
difficult is it to create this thing
right it's one way to say like how many

11848
03:13:13,590 --> 03:13:13,600
right it's one way to say like how many
 

11849
03:13:13,600 --> 03:13:15,590
right it's one way to say like how many
plants like this are out there all that

11850
03:13:15,590 --> 03:13:15,600
plants like this are out there all that
 

11851
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:17,510
plants like this are out there all that
kind of stuff but

11852
03:13:17,510 --> 03:13:17,520
kind of stuff but
 

11853
03:13:17,520 --> 03:13:20,070
kind of stuff but
it feels like from our very limited

11854
03:13:20,070 --> 03:13:20,080
it feels like from our very limited
 

11855
03:13:20,080 --> 03:13:22,870
it feels like from our very limited
knowledge perspective the right ways

11856
03:13:22,870 --> 03:13:22,880
knowledge perspective the right ways
 

11857
03:13:22,880 --> 03:13:24,550
knowledge perspective the right ways
to think

11858
03:13:24,550 --> 03:13:24,560
to think
 

11859
03:13:24,560 --> 03:13:26,790
to think
how how does what is this thing and how

11860
03:13:26,790 --> 03:13:26,800
how how does what is this thing and how
 

11861
03:13:26,800 --> 03:13:29,110
how how does what is this thing and how
does it originate from

11862
03:13:29,110 --> 03:13:29,120
does it originate from
 

11863
03:13:29,120 --> 03:13:31,910
does it originate from
from very simple non-life things

11864
03:13:31,910 --> 03:13:31,920
from very simple non-life things
 

11865
03:13:31,920 --> 03:13:33,990
from very simple non-life things
how does complex

11866
03:13:33,990 --> 03:13:34,000
how does complex
 

11867
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:37,030
how does complex
life like things emerge

11868
03:13:37,030 --> 03:13:37,040
life like things emerge
 

11869
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:39,510
life like things emerge
from from a rock

11870
03:13:39,510 --> 03:13:39,520
from from a rock
 

11871
03:13:39,520 --> 03:13:41,510
from from a rock
to a bacteria

11872
03:13:41,510 --> 03:13:41,520
to a bacteria
 

11873
03:13:41,520 --> 03:13:42,550
to a bacteria
protein

11874
03:13:42,550 --> 03:13:42,560
protein
 

11875
03:13:42,560 --> 03:13:45,030
protein
and these like weird systems that

11876
03:13:45,030 --> 03:13:45,040
and these like weird systems that
 

11877
03:13:45,040 --> 03:13:47,670
and these like weird systems that
encode information and pass information

11878
03:13:47,670 --> 03:13:47,680
encode information and pass information
 

11879
03:13:47,680 --> 03:13:50,550
encode information and pass information
from self-replicate and then also select

11880
03:13:50,550 --> 03:13:50,560
from self-replicate and then also select
 

11881
03:13:50,560 --> 03:13:51,910
from self-replicate and then also select
each other and mutate in interesting

11882
03:13:51,910 --> 03:13:51,920
each other and mutate in interesting
 

11883
03:13:51,920 --> 03:13:54,150
each other and mutate in interesting
ways such that they can adapt and evolve

11884
03:13:54,150 --> 03:13:54,160
ways such that they can adapt and evolve
 

11885
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:55,990
ways such that they can adapt and evolve
and build increasingly more complex

11886
03:13:55,990 --> 03:13:56,000
and build increasingly more complex
 

11887
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:57,510
and build increasingly more complex
systems right well it's a form of

11888
03:13:57,510 --> 03:13:57,520
systems right well it's a form of
 

11889
03:13:57,520 --> 03:13:59,590
systems right well it's a form of
information processing yeah right

11890
03:13:59,590 --> 03:13:59,600
information processing yeah right
 

11891
03:13:59,600 --> 03:14:00,389
information processing yeah right
right

11892
03:14:00,389 --> 03:14:00,399
right
 

11893
03:14:00,399 --> 03:14:02,790
right
whereas information transfer

11894
03:14:02,790 --> 03:14:02,800
whereas information transfer
 

11895
03:14:02,800 --> 03:14:05,670
whereas information transfer
but then also an energy processing which

11896
03:14:05,670 --> 03:14:05,680
but then also an energy processing which
 

11897
03:14:05,680 --> 03:14:07,269
but then also an energy processing which
then results in

11898
03:14:07,269 --> 03:14:07,279
then results in
 

11899
03:14:07,279 --> 03:14:09,110
then results in
if i guess information processing maybe

11900
03:14:09,110 --> 03:14:09,120
if i guess information processing maybe
 

11901
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:10,469
if i guess information processing maybe
i'm getting buggered well

11902
03:14:10,469 --> 03:14:10,479
i'm getting buggered well
 

11903
03:14:10,479 --> 03:14:12,469
i'm getting buggered well
it's doing some modification and yeah

11904
03:14:12,469 --> 03:14:12,479
it's doing some modification and yeah
 

11905
03:14:12,479 --> 03:14:15,349
it's doing some modification and yeah
the input is some energy right it's able

11906
03:14:15,349 --> 03:14:15,359
the input is some energy right it's able
 

11907
03:14:15,359 --> 03:14:17,510
the input is some energy right it's able
to extract yeah

11908
03:14:17,510 --> 03:14:17,520
to extract yeah
 

11909
03:14:17,520 --> 03:14:20,070
to extract yeah
extract resources uh from its

11910
03:14:20,070 --> 03:14:20,080
extract resources uh from its
 

11911
03:14:20,080 --> 03:14:22,469
extract resources uh from its
environment in order to achieve a goal

11912
03:14:22,469 --> 03:14:22,479
environment in order to achieve a goal
 

11913
03:14:22,479 --> 03:14:24,870
environment in order to achieve a goal
but the goal doesn't seem to be clear

11914
03:14:24,870 --> 03:14:24,880
but the goal doesn't seem to be clear
 

11915
03:14:24,880 --> 03:14:26,389
but the goal doesn't seem to be clear
right the

11916
03:14:26,389 --> 03:14:26,399
right the
 

11917
03:14:26,399 --> 03:14:28,229
right the
goal is well the goal is to make more of

11918
03:14:28,229 --> 03:14:28,239
goal is well the goal is to make more of
 

11919
03:14:28,239 --> 03:14:29,429
goal is well the goal is to make more of
itself

11920
03:14:29,429 --> 03:14:29,439
itself
 

11921
03:14:29,439 --> 03:14:32,710
itself
yeah but in a way that uh

11922
03:14:32,710 --> 03:14:32,720
yeah but in a way that uh
 

11923
03:14:32,720 --> 03:14:34,550
yeah but in a way that uh
increases i mean i don't know if

11924
03:14:34,550 --> 03:14:34,560
increases i mean i don't know if
 

11925
03:14:34,560 --> 03:14:36,309
increases i mean i don't know if
evolution

11926
03:14:36,309 --> 03:14:36,319
evolution
 

11927
03:14:36,319 --> 03:14:38,389
evolution
is a fundamental

11928
03:14:38,389 --> 03:14:38,399
is a fundamental
 

11929
03:14:38,399 --> 03:14:40,710
is a fundamental
law of the universe but it seems to want

11930
03:14:40,710 --> 03:14:40,720
law of the universe but it seems to want
 

11931
03:14:40,720 --> 03:14:42,550
law of the universe but it seems to want
to

11932
03:14:42,550 --> 03:14:42,560
to
 

11933
03:14:42,560 --> 03:14:45,349
to
replicate itself in a way that maximizes

11934
03:14:45,349 --> 03:14:45,359
replicate itself in a way that maximizes
 

11935
03:14:45,359 --> 03:14:47,590
replicate itself in a way that maximizes
the chance of its survival

11936
03:14:47,590 --> 03:14:47,600
the chance of its survival
 

11937

don't care it's just like
 

11945
03:14:57,279 --> 03:14:59,110
don't care it's just like
oh you optimize it well at least it's

11946
03:14:59,110 --> 03:14:59,120
oh you optimize it well at least it's
 

11947
03:14:59,120 --> 03:15:01,190
oh you optimize it well at least it's
certainly um

yeah it doesn't care about the the

yeah it doesn't care about the the
 

11951
03:15:02,800 --> 03:15:04,870
yeah it doesn't care about the the
welfare of the individual agents within

welfare of the individual agents within

it but it does seem to i don't know i i

11954
03:15:06,630 --> 03:15:06,640
it but it does seem to i don't know i i
 

11955
03:15:06,640 --> 03:15:08,229
it but it does seem to i don't know i i
think it's i think the mistake is that

11956
03:15:08,229 --> 03:15:08,239
think it's i think the mistake is that
 

11957
03:15:08,239 --> 03:15:10,070
think it's i think the mistake is that
we're anthropomorphizing and to even try

we're anthropomorphizing and to even try
 

11959

we're anthropomorphizing and to even try

to you know give
 

11961
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:14,070
to you know give
evolution a mindset

11962

an alien god
 

11971
03:15:25,200 --> 03:15:27,190
an alien god
and he talks about like the mistake we

and he talks about like the mistake we

think through things from an
 

11977
03:15:31,200 --> 03:15:32,630
think through things from an
evolutionary perspective as though like

11978
03:15:32,630 --> 03:15:32,640
evolutionary perspective as though like
 

11979
03:15:32,640 --> 03:15:34,469
evolutionary perspective as though like
giving evolution like some kind of

03:15:34,469 --> 03:15:34,479
giving evolution like some kind of
 

11981
03:15:34,479 --> 03:15:36,389
giving evolution like some kind of

um yeah worth reading but

11984
03:15:38,950 --> 03:15:38,960
um yeah worth reading but
 

11985
03:15:38,960 --> 03:15:41,269
um yeah worth reading but
yeah i i would like to say

11986
03:15:41,269 --> 03:15:41,279
yeah i i would like to say
 

11987
03:15:41,279 --> 03:15:42,870
yeah i i would like to say
that having interacted with a lot of

11988
03:15:42,870 --> 03:15:42,880
that having interacted with a lot of
 

11989
03:15:42,880 --> 03:15:44,750
that having interacted with a lot of
really smart people that say that

11990
03:15:44,750 --> 03:15:44,760
really smart people that say that
 

11991
03:15:44,760 --> 03:15:46,870
really smart people that say that
anthropomorphization is a mistake i

11992
03:15:46,870 --> 03:15:46,880
anthropomorphization is a mistake i
 

11993
03:15:46,880 --> 03:15:48,750
anthropomorphization is a mistake i
would like to say that saying that

11994
03:15:48,750 --> 03:15:48,760
would like to say that saying that
 

11995
03:15:48,760 --> 03:15:50,550
would like to say that saying that
anthropomorphization is a mistake is a

11996
03:15:50,550 --> 03:15:50,560
anthropomorphization is a mistake is a
 

11997
03:15:50,560 --> 03:15:53,030
anthropomorphization is a mistake is a
mistake i think there's a lot of power

11998
03:15:53,030 --> 03:15:53,040
mistake i think there's a lot of power
 

11999
03:15:53,040 --> 03:15:55,030
mistake i think there's a lot of power
in anthropomorphization

12000
03:15:55,030 --> 03:15:55,040
in anthropomorphization
 

12001
03:15:55,040 --> 03:15:56,630
in anthropomorphization
if i can only say that word correctly

12002
03:15:56,630 --> 03:15:56,640
if i can only say that word correctly
 

12003
03:15:56,640 --> 03:15:59,830
if i can only say that word correctly
one time i i i think that's actually a

12004
03:15:59,830 --> 03:15:59,840
one time i i i think that's actually a
 

12005
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:01,349
one time i i i think that's actually a
really powerful way to reason through

12006
03:16:01,349 --> 03:16:01,359
really powerful way to reason through
 

12007
03:16:01,359 --> 03:16:03,349
really powerful way to reason through
things and i think people especially

12008
03:16:03,349 --> 03:16:03,359
things and i think people especially
 

12009
03:16:03,359 --> 03:16:05,190
things and i think people especially
people on robotics seem to run away from

12010
03:16:05,190 --> 03:16:05,200
people on robotics seem to run away from
 

12011
03:16:05,200 --> 03:16:07,030
people on robotics seem to run away from
it as fast as possible

12012
03:16:07,030 --> 03:16:07,040
it as fast as possible
 

12013
03:16:07,040 --> 03:16:10,229
it as fast as possible
and uh i i just can you give an example

12014
03:16:10,229 --> 03:16:10,239
and uh i i just can you give an example
 

12015
03:16:10,239 --> 03:16:13,030
and uh i i just can you give an example
of like how it helps in robotics

12016
03:16:13,030 --> 03:16:13,040
of like how it helps in robotics
 

12017
03:16:13,040 --> 03:16:14,630
of like how it helps in robotics
oh in uh

12018
03:16:14,630 --> 03:16:14,640
oh in uh
 

12019
03:16:14,640 --> 03:16:15,590
oh in uh
that

12020
03:16:15,590 --> 03:16:15,600
that
 

12021
03:16:15,600 --> 03:16:18,950
that
our world is a world of humans

12022
03:16:18,950 --> 03:16:18,960
our world is a world of humans
 

12023

runs away from the fact that

that a robot that ever has to interact
 

12037
03:16:36,560 --> 03:16:38,710
that a robot that ever has to interact
with humans and i don't mean like

03:16:38,710 --> 03:16:38,720
with humans and i don't mean like
 

12039
03:16:38,720 --> 03:16:41,030
with humans and i don't mean like
intimate friendship interaction i mean

intimate friendship interaction i mean

in a factory setting where it has to

12042
03:16:42,950 --> 03:16:42,960
in a factory setting where it has to
 

12043
03:16:42,960 --> 03:16:44,389
in a factory setting where it has to
deal with the uncertainty of humans all

12044

deal with the uncertainty of humans all
 

12045
03:16:44,399 --> 03:16:46,790
deal with the uncertainty of humans all
that kind of stuff you have to

12046
03:16:46,790 --> 03:16:46,800
that kind of stuff you have to
 

12047
03:16:46,800 --> 03:16:49,670
that kind of stuff you have to
acknowledge that the robot's behavior

12048
03:16:49,670 --> 03:16:49,680
acknowledge that the robot's behavior
 

12049

has an effect on the human
 

12051
03:16:51,920 --> 03:16:53,830
has an effect on the human
just as much as the human has an effect

03:16:53,830 --> 03:16:53,840
just as much as the human has an effect
 

12053

just as much as the human has an effect
on the robot and there's a dance there

12054
03:16:55,990 --> 03:16:56,000
on the robot and there's a dance there
 

12055
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:58,389
on the robot and there's a dance there
and you have to realize that this entity

12056
03:16:58,389 --> 03:16:58,399
and you have to realize that this entity
 

12057
03:16:58,399 --> 03:17:00,630
and you have to realize that this entity
when a human sees a robot

03:17:00,630 --> 03:17:00,640
when a human sees a robot
 

12059
03:17:00,640 --> 03:17:02,389
when a human sees a robot
this is obvious in a physical

the thing looks like a dog they have
 

12073
03:17:14,880 --> 03:17:16,950
the thing looks like a dog they have
their own memories of what a dog is like

their own memories of what a dog is like
they have certain feelings and that's

they have certain feelings and that's
 

12077
03:17:18,800 --> 03:17:20,630
they have certain feelings and that's
going to be useful in a safety setting

going to be useful in a safety setting

safety critical setting which is one of

the most trivial settings for a robot

the most trivial settings for a robot
in terms of how to avoid

in terms of how to avoid
any kind of dangerous situations and a

any kind of dangerous situations and a
 

12087
03:17:29,439 --> 03:17:33,429
any kind of dangerous situations and a
robot should really con consider that in

12088
03:17:33,429 --> 03:17:33,439
robot should really con consider that in
 

12089
03:17:33,439 --> 03:17:35,590
robot should really con consider that in
navigating its environment and we humans

12090
03:17:35,590 --> 03:17:35,600
navigating its environment and we humans
 

12091
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:38,630
navigating its environment and we humans
are right to reason about how a robot

i i i also think our brains are designed

12103
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:51,030

um

12104
03:17:51,030 --> 03:17:51,040
um
 

12105
03:17:51,040 --> 03:17:55,349
um
human terms like game theory

12106
03:17:55,349 --> 03:17:55,359
human terms like game theory
 

12107
03:17:55,359 --> 03:17:57,910
human terms like game theory
i think is um

12108
03:17:57,910 --> 03:17:57,920
i think is um
 

12109
03:17:57,920 --> 03:18:00,309
i think is um
is is best applied in the space of human

12110
03:18:00,309 --> 03:18:00,319
is is best applied in the space of human

12113
03:18:01,520 --> 03:18:02,630
decisions
and so

12114
03:18:02,630 --> 03:18:02,640
and so
 

12115
03:18:02,640 --> 03:18:04,870
and so
uh right you're dealing i mean with

12116
03:18:04,870 --> 03:18:04,880
uh right you're dealing i mean with
 

12117
03:18:04,880 --> 03:18:08,630
uh right you're dealing i mean with
things like ai ais they are you know we

12118
03:18:08,630 --> 03:18:08,640
things like ai ais they are you know we
 

12119
03:18:08,640 --> 03:18:10,309
things like ai ais they are you know we
can somewhat

12120
03:18:10,309 --> 03:18:10,319
can somewhat
 

12121
03:18:10,319 --> 03:18:11,830
can somewhat
like i don't think it's

12122
03:18:11,830 --> 03:18:11,840
like i don't think it's
 

12123
03:18:11,840 --> 03:18:13,990
like i don't think it's
the reason i i say anthropomorphization

12124
03:18:13,990 --> 03:18:14,000
the reason i i say anthropomorphization
 

12125
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:15,910
the reason i i say anthropomorphization
we need to be careful with is because

12126
03:18:15,910 --> 03:18:15,920
we need to be careful with is because
 

12127
03:18:15,920 --> 03:18:17,910
we need to be careful with is because
there is a danger of

12128
03:18:17,910 --> 03:18:17,920
there is a danger of
 

12129
03:18:17,920 --> 03:18:20,710
there is a danger of
overly applying overly wrongly assuming

12130
03:18:20,710 --> 03:18:20,720
overly applying overly wrongly assuming
 

12131

overly applying overly wrongly assuming
that that this

12132
03:18:22,389 --> 03:18:22,399
that that this

that that this

artificial intelligence is going to

03:18:23,760 --> 03:18:25,990
artificial intelligence is going to
operate in any similar way to us because

it is

03:18:27,200 --> 03:18:28,950
it is

12141
03:18:28,960 --> 03:18:31,190
operating on a fundamentally different
substrate like even

12143
03:18:31,200 --> 03:18:33,510

03:18:35,110 --> 03:18:35,120
ways like

03:18:35,120 --> 03:18:36,710
ways like
anthromorphizing them is less of a

12151
03:18:38,399 --> 03:18:40,790

it's an ai we built and so on because at

03:18:40,790 --> 03:18:40,800
it's an ai we built and so on because at
 

12153
03:18:40,800 --> 03:18:41,990
it's an ai we built and so on because at

that you can hear through it but there's
also build up

12632

12635
03:26:23,359 --> 03:26:24,870
it's a beautiful solo but it's also
technically just visually the way it

12636
03:26:24,870 --> 03:26:24,880
technically just visually the way it
 

12637
03:26:24,880 --> 03:26:25,830
technically just visually the way it
looks

12638
03:26:25,830 --> 03:26:25,840
looks

when a person is watched you feel like a
rockstar player

12642

rockstar player
 

12643
03:26:29,600 --> 03:26:31,269
rockstar player
but it ultimately has to do with

12644
03:26:31,269 --> 03:26:31,279
but it ultimately has to do with
 

12645
03:26:31,279 --> 03:26:32,550
but it ultimately has to do with
technical

12646
03:26:32,550 --> 03:26:32,560
technical
 

12647
03:26:32,560 --> 03:26:33,510
technical
you

12648
03:26:33,510 --> 03:26:33,520
you
 

12649
03:26:33,520 --> 03:26:35,910
you
you're not developing the part of your

12650
03:26:35,910 --> 03:26:35,920
you're not developing the part of your
 

12651
03:26:35,920 --> 03:26:37,510
you're not developing the part of your
brain that i think

12652
03:26:37,510 --> 03:26:37,520
brain that i think
 

12653
03:26:37,520 --> 03:26:40,550
brain that i think
requires you to generate beautiful music

12654
03:26:40,550 --> 03:26:40,560
requires you to generate beautiful music
 

12655
03:26:40,560 --> 03:26:42,389
requires you to generate beautiful music
it is ultimately technical in nature and

12656
03:26:42,389 --> 03:26:42,399
it is ultimately technical in nature and
 

12657
03:26:42,399 --> 03:26:44,870
it is ultimately technical in nature and
so that took me a long time to

12658
03:26:44,870 --> 03:26:44,880
so that took me a long time to
 

12659
03:26:44,880 --> 03:26:47,269
so that took me a long time to
let go of that and just be able to write

12660
03:26:47,269 --> 03:26:47,279
let go of that and just be able to write
 

12661
03:26:47,279 --> 03:26:48,950
let go of that and just be able to write
music myself and

12662
03:26:48,950 --> 03:26:48,960
music myself and
 

12663
03:26:48,960 --> 03:26:50,469
music myself and
and that's a different

12664
03:26:50,469 --> 03:26:50,479
and that's a different
 

12665
03:26:50,479 --> 03:26:52,950
and that's a different
that's a different journey i think

12666
03:26:52,950 --> 03:26:52,960
that's a different journey i think
 

12667
03:26:52,960 --> 03:26:54,229
that's a different journey i think
i think that journey is a little bit

12668
03:26:54,229 --> 03:26:54,239
i think that journey is a little bit
 

12669
03:26:54,239 --> 03:26:56,150
i think that journey is a little bit
more inspired in the blues world for

12670
03:26:56,150 --> 03:26:56,160
more inspired in the blues world for
 

12671
03:26:56,160 --> 03:26:58,550
more inspired in the blues world for
example or improvisation is more valued

12672
03:26:58,550 --> 03:26:58,560
example or improvisation is more valued
 

12673
03:26:58,560 --> 03:27:00,950
example or improvisation is more valued
obviously in jails and so on but

12674
03:27:00,950 --> 03:27:00,960
obviously in jails and so on but
 

12675
03:27:00,960 --> 03:27:02,950
obviously in jails and so on but
um i i think ultimately it's a more

12676
03:27:02,950 --> 03:27:02,960
um i i think ultimately it's a more
 

12677
03:27:02,960 --> 03:27:04,550
um i i think ultimately it's a more
rewarding

12678
03:27:04,550 --> 03:27:04,560
rewarding
 

12679
03:27:04,560 --> 03:27:06,710
rewarding
journey because you get to

12680
03:27:06,710 --> 03:27:06,720
journey because you get to
 

12681
03:27:06,720 --> 03:27:08,550
journey because you get to
your relationship with the guitar then

12682
03:27:08,550 --> 03:27:08,560
your relationship with the guitar then
 

12683
03:27:08,560 --> 03:27:09,750
your relationship with the guitar then
becomes

12684
03:27:09,750 --> 03:27:09,760
becomes
 

12685
03:27:09,760 --> 03:27:11,429
becomes
a kind of escape

12686
03:27:11,429 --> 03:27:11,439
a kind of escape
 

12687
03:27:11,439 --> 03:27:13,510
a kind of escape
from the world where you can create

12688
03:27:13,510 --> 03:27:13,520
from the world where you can create
 

12689
03:27:13,520 --> 03:27:16,630
from the world where you can create

create i mean creating stuff is
 

12691
03:27:16,640 --> 03:27:18,630
create i mean creating stuff is
uh and it's something you work with

12692
03:27:18,630 --> 03:27:18,640
uh and it's something you work with
 

12693
03:27:18,640 --> 03:27:19,910
uh and it's something you work with
because my relationship with my guitar

12694
03:27:19,910 --> 03:27:19,920
because my relationship with my guitar
 

12695
03:27:19,920 --> 03:27:21,910
because my relationship with my guitar
was like it was something to tame and

12696
03:27:21,910 --> 03:27:21,920
was like it was something to tame and
 

12697
03:27:21,920 --> 03:27:23,349
was like it was something to tame and
defeat

12698
03:27:23,349 --> 03:27:23,359
defeat
 

12699
03:27:23,359 --> 03:27:24,710

bend this thing to my will

12710
03:27:33,110 --> 03:27:33,120
bend this thing to my will
 

12711
03:27:33,120 --> 03:27:34,469
bend this thing to my will
whereas

12712
03:27:34,469 --> 03:27:34,479
whereas
 

12713
03:27:34,479 --> 03:27:35,990
whereas
writing music is you were it's like a

12714
03:27:35,990 --> 03:27:36,000
writing music is you were it's like a
 

12715
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:37,830
writing music is you were it's like a
dance you work with it

12716
03:27:37,830 --> 03:27:37,840
dance you work with it
 

12717
03:27:37,840 --> 03:27:39,349
dance you work with it
but i think because of the competitive

12718
03:27:39,349 --> 03:27:39,359
but i think because of the competitive
 

12719
03:27:39,359 --> 03:27:41,670
but i think because of the competitive
aspect for me at least that's still

12720
03:27:41,670 --> 03:27:41,680
aspect for me at least that's still
 

12721
03:27:41,680 --> 03:27:42,389
aspect for me at least that's still
there

12722
03:27:42,389 --> 03:27:42,399

um there's there's like layers i mean i

12878
03:30:22,630 --> 03:30:22,640
um there's there's like layers i mean i
 

12879
03:30:22,640 --> 03:30:24,550
um there's there's like layers i mean i
i feel the urge to to live up to that to

12880
03:30:24,550 --> 03:30:24,560
i feel the urge to to live up to that to
 

12881
03:30:24,560 --> 03:30:27,830
i feel the urge to to live up to that to
be to be the inverse of evil yeah um or

12882
03:30:27,830 --> 03:30:27,840
be to be the inverse of evil yeah um or
 

12883
03:30:27,840 --> 03:30:29,750
be to be the inverse of evil yeah um or
even better because i don't think you

12884
03:30:29,750 --> 03:30:29,760
even better because i don't think you
 

12885
03:30:29,760 --> 03:30:30,550
even better because i don't think you
know

12886
03:30:30,550 --> 03:30:30,560
know
 

12887
03:30:30,560 --> 03:30:32,389
know
is the inverse of evil good or is good

12888
03:30:32,389 --> 03:30:32,399
is the inverse of evil good or is good
 

12889
03:30:32,399 --> 03:30:33,670
is the inverse of evil good or is good
something completely

12890
03:30:33,670 --> 03:30:33,680
something completely
 

12891
03:30:33,680 --> 03:30:36,070
something completely
separate to that i think my intuition

12892
03:30:36,070 --> 03:30:36,080
separate to that i think my intuition
 

12893
03:30:36,080 --> 03:30:37,349
separate to that i think my intuition
says it's the latter but i don't know

12894
03:30:37,349 --> 03:30:37,359
says it's the latter but i don't know
 

12895
03:30:37,359 --> 03:30:39,830
says it's the latter but i don't know
anyway again getting in the weeds um

12896
03:30:39,830 --> 03:30:39,840
anyway again getting in the weeds um
 

12897
03:30:39,840 --> 03:30:42,309
anyway again getting in the weeds um
what is the meaning of all this uh of

12898
03:30:42,309 --> 03:30:42,319
what is the meaning of all this uh of
 

12899
03:30:42,319 --> 03:30:43,349
what is the meaning of all this uh of
life

12900
03:30:43,349 --> 03:30:43,359
life
 

12901
03:30:43,359 --> 03:30:46,790
life
um why are we here

12902
03:30:46,790 --> 03:30:46,800
um why are we here
 

12903
03:30:46,800 --> 03:30:49,670
um why are we here
i think to

12904
03:30:49,670 --> 03:30:49,680

 

12905
03:30:49,680 --> 03:30:52,229

explore have fun and understand

12906
03:30:52,229 --> 03:30:52,239
explore have fun and understand
 

12907
03:30:52,239 --> 03:30:54,790
explore have fun and understand
um and make more of here and to keep the

12908
03:30:54,790 --> 03:30:54,800
um and make more of here and to keep the
 

12909
03:30:54,800 --> 03:30:57,830
um and make more of here and to keep the
game going over here more more of more

12910
03:30:57,830 --> 03:30:57,840
game going over here more more of more
 

12911
03:30:57,840 --> 03:30:58,710
game going over here more more of more
of

12912
03:30:58,710 --> 03:30:58,720
of
 

12913
03:30:58,720 --> 03:31:01,990
of
this whatever this is more of experience

12914
03:31:01,990 --> 03:31:02,000
this whatever this is more of experience
 

12915
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:03,429
this whatever this is more of experience
just to have more of experience and

12916
03:31:03,429 --> 03:31:03,439
just to have more of experience and
 

12917
03:31:03,439 --> 03:31:05,750
just to have more of experience and
ideally positive experience

12918
03:31:05,750 --> 03:31:05,760
ideally positive experience
 

12919
03:31:05,760 --> 03:31:08,309
ideally positive experience
um and

12920
03:31:08,309 --> 03:31:08,319
um and
 

12921
03:31:08,319 --> 03:31:09,110
um and
more

12922
03:31:09,110 --> 03:31:09,120
more
 

12923
03:31:09,120 --> 03:31:10,710
more
complex you know to i guess try and put

12924
03:31:10,710 --> 03:31:10,720
complex you know to i guess try and put
 

12925
03:31:10,720 --> 03:31:12,469
complex you know to i guess try and put
it into a sort of vaguely scientific

12926
03:31:12,469 --> 03:31:12,479
it into a sort of vaguely scientific
 

12927
03:31:12,479 --> 03:31:15,590
it into a sort of vaguely scientific
term um

12928
03:31:15,590 --> 03:31:15,600

 

12929
03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:18,389

make it so that the program required the

12930
03:31:18,389 --> 03:31:18,399
make it so that the program required the
 

12931
03:31:18,399 --> 03:31:20,469
make it so that the program required the
length of code required to describe the

12932
03:31:20,469 --> 03:31:20,479
length of code required to describe the
 

12933
03:31:20,479 --> 03:31:22,870
length of code required to describe the
universe is as long as possible

12934
03:31:22,870 --> 03:31:22,880
universe is as long as possible
 

12935
03:31:22,880 --> 03:31:25,110
universe is as long as possible
uh and you know highly complex and

12936
03:31:25,110 --> 03:31:25,120
uh and you know highly complex and
 

12937
03:31:25,120 --> 03:31:27,030
uh and you know highly complex and
therefore interesting

12938
03:31:27,030 --> 03:31:27,040
therefore interesting
 

12939
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:28,710
therefore interesting
because again like

12940
03:31:28,710 --> 03:31:28,720
because again like
 

12941
03:31:28,720 --> 03:31:31,190
because again like
i know you know we bang the the

12942
03:31:31,190 --> 03:31:31,200
i know you know we bang the the
 

12943
03:31:31,200 --> 03:31:33,670
i know you know we bang the the
the metaphor to death but like

12944
03:31:33,670 --> 03:31:33,680
the metaphor to death but like
 

12945
03:31:33,680 --> 03:31:35,349
the metaphor to death but like
tiled with

12946
03:31:35,349 --> 03:31:35,359
tiled with
 

12947
03:31:35,359 --> 03:31:37,750
tiled with
x you know told with uh paper clips

12948
03:31:37,750 --> 03:31:37,760
x you know told with uh paper clips
 

12949
03:31:37,760 --> 03:31:39,510
x you know told with uh paper clips
doesn't require that much of a code to

12950
03:31:39,510 --> 03:31:39,520
doesn't require that much of a code to
 

12951
03:31:39,520 --> 03:31:40,469
doesn't require that much of a code to
describe

12952
03:31:40,469 --> 03:31:40,479
describe
 

12953
03:31:40,479 --> 03:31:42,309
describe
um obviously maybe something emerges

12954
03:31:42,309 --> 03:31:42,319
um obviously maybe something emerges
 

12955
03:31:42,319 --> 03:31:43,830
um obviously maybe something emerges
from it but at that steady state

12956
03:31:43,830 --> 03:31:43,840
from it but at that steady state
 

12957
03:31:43,840 --> 03:31:45,110
from it but at that steady state
assuming a steady state it's not very

12958
03:31:45,110 --> 03:31:45,120
assuming a steady state it's not very
 

12959
03:31:45,120 --> 03:31:47,510
assuming a steady state it's not very
interesting whereas

12960
03:31:47,510 --> 03:31:47,520
interesting whereas
 

12961
03:31:47,520 --> 03:31:49,510
interesting whereas
it seems like our universe is over time

12962
03:31:49,510 --> 03:31:49,520
it seems like our universe is over time
 

12963
03:31:49,520 --> 03:31:50,950
it seems like our universe is over time
becoming more and more complex and

12964
03:31:50,950 --> 03:31:50,960
becoming more and more complex and
 

12965
03:31:50,960 --> 03:31:52,950
becoming more and more complex and
interesting there's so much richness and

12966
03:31:52,950 --> 03:31:52,960
interesting there's so much richness and
 

12967
03:31:52,960 --> 03:31:54,550
interesting there's so much richness and
beauty and diversity on this earth and i

12968
03:31:54,550 --> 03:31:54,560
beauty and diversity on this earth and i
 

12969
03:31:54,560 --> 03:31:56,229
beauty and diversity on this earth and i
want that to continue and get more i

12970
03:31:56,229 --> 03:31:56,239
want that to continue and get more i
 

12971
03:31:56,239 --> 03:31:57,429
want that to continue and get more i
want more

12972
03:31:57,429 --> 03:31:57,439
want more
 

12973
03:31:57,439 --> 03:31:59,429
want more
more more diversity and i in the very

12974
03:31:59,429 --> 03:31:59,439
more more diversity and i in the very
 

12975
03:31:59,439 --> 03:32:01,750
more more diversity and i in the very
best sense of that word um

12976
03:32:01,750 --> 03:32:01,760
best sense of that word um
 

12977
03:32:01,760 --> 03:32:03,670
best sense of that word um
is i to me the

12978
03:32:03,670 --> 03:32:03,680
is i to me the
 

12979
03:32:03,680 --> 03:32:07,110
is i to me the
the the the goal of all this uh yeah

12980
03:32:07,110 --> 03:32:07,120
the the the goal of all this uh yeah
 

12981
03:32:07,120 --> 03:32:09,269
the the the goal of all this uh yeah
yeah and somehow

12982
03:32:09,269 --> 03:32:09,279
yeah and somehow
 

12983
03:32:09,279 --> 03:32:11,910
yeah and somehow
have fun in the process yes

12984
03:32:11,910 --> 03:32:11,920
have fun in the process yes
 

12985
03:32:11,920 --> 03:32:13,750
have fun in the process yes
because we do create a lot of fun things

12986
03:32:13,750 --> 03:32:13,760
because we do create a lot of fun things
 

12987
03:32:13,760 --> 03:32:15,990
because we do create a lot of fun things
along instead of in this

12988
03:32:15,990 --> 03:32:16,000
along instead of in this
 

12989
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:17,830
along instead of in this
creative force

12990
03:32:17,830 --> 03:32:17,840
creative force
 

12991
03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:19,269
creative force
and all the beautiful things we create

12992
03:32:19,269 --> 03:32:19,279
and all the beautiful things we create
 

12993
03:32:19,279 --> 03:32:21,269
and all the beautiful things we create
somehow there's like a

12994
03:32:21,269 --> 03:32:21,279
somehow there's like a
 

12995
03:32:21,279 --> 03:32:23,510
somehow there's like a
funness to it and perhaps that has to do

12996
03:32:23,510 --> 03:32:23,520
funness to it and perhaps that has to do
 

12997
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:25,110
funness to it and perhaps that has to do
with the finiteness of life the

12998
03:32:25,110 --> 03:32:25,120
with the finiteness of life the
 

12999
03:32:25,120 --> 03:32:28,229
with the finiteness of life the
finiteness of all these experiences

13000
03:32:28,229 --> 03:32:28,239
finiteness of all these experiences
 

13001
03:32:28,239 --> 03:32:31,190
finiteness of all these experiences
which is what makes them kind of unique

13002
03:32:31,190 --> 03:32:31,200
which is what makes them kind of unique
 

13003
03:32:31,200 --> 03:32:32,950
which is what makes them kind of unique
like the the fact that they end there's

13004
03:32:32,950 --> 03:32:32,960
like the the fact that they end there's
 

13005
03:32:32,960 --> 03:32:35,349
like the the fact that they end there's
this uh whatever it is

13006
03:32:35,349 --> 03:32:35,359
this uh whatever it is
 

13007
03:32:35,359 --> 03:32:38,790
this uh whatever it is
falling in love or um

13008
03:32:38,790 --> 03:32:38,800
falling in love or um
 

13009

uh embeds it with
fun with joy

for the people involved i don't know

for the people involved i don't know
what that is

what that is
 

13037
03:33:09,680 --> 03:33:12,070
what that is
