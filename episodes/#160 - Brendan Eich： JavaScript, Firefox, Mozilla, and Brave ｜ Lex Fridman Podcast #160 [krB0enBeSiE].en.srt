i was a little late for the i think the
 

171
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,390
i was a little late for the i think the
you know the 20th century golden age

172
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
you know the 20th century golden age
 

173
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,830
you know the 20th century golden age
and i read a lot of science fiction so i

174
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
and i read a lot of science fiction so i
 

175
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,990
and i read a lot of science fiction so i
was like yeah it's onto hyperdrives and

176
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
was like yeah it's onto hyperdrives and
 

177
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,430
was like yeah it's onto hyperdrives and
warp drives and

178
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
warp drives and
 

179
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,350

quickly and i

182
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:50,879
quickly and i
 

183
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,790
quickly and i
started hacking on computers while i was

things like this custom email system
 

247
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,540
things like this custom email system
that had 25 word limit

dodged both the pascal and the fortran

254
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
dodged both the pascal and the fortran
 

255
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,589
dodged both the pascal and the fortran
bullets uh could you uh

256
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
bullets uh could you uh
 

257
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,789
bullets uh could you uh
maybe uh linger on the pascal like what

258
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
maybe uh linger on the pascal like what
 

259
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,390
maybe uh linger on the pascal like what
kind of programming language was it

what is it reminiscent of of today
 

263
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,429
what is it reminiscent of of today
because it sounds like

264
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
because it sounds like

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,990
because it sounds like
it may have had uh an impact on your own

283
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,870
successful
but pascal was kind of wordy procedures

284
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
but pascal was kind of wordy procedures
 

285
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,469
but pascal was kind of wordy procedures
and functions language

286
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
and functions language
 

287
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,990
and functions language
it distinguished between functions which

288
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
it distinguished between functions which
 

289
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,749
it distinguished between functions which
return of value and procedures which

290
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
return of value and procedures which
 

291

and you could say that whole algol
 

295
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,469

pascal had a second life thanks to

borland with turbo pascal
which was hugely successful uh i think

302
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
which was hugely successful uh i think
 

303
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,950
which was hugely successful uh i think
in large part due to anders helzberg who

314
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
so yeah there's there's a lineage here
 

315
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,350
so yeah there's there's a lineage here
uh but

316
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
uh but
 

317
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,830
uh but
i was also interested in c in unix by

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
i was also interested in c in unix by
 

319
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,590
i was also interested in c in unix by
the time i was an undergrad

320
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
the time i was an undergrad
 

321
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,749
the time i was an undergrad
because uh people were bringing unix up

322
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
because uh people were bringing unix up
 

323
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,110
because uh people were bringing unix up

you're saying this is a fundamental like

1154
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
you're saying this is a fundamental like
 

1155
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,029
you're saying this is a fundamental like
principle

1156
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
principle
 

1157
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,070
principle
of the internet is moving fast

1158
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
of the internet is moving fast
 

1159
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,230
of the internet is moving fast
wins you could say in in almost any

1160
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
wins you could say in in almost any
 

1161
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,669
wins you could say in in almost any
network system like in biological

1162
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
network system like in biological
 

1163
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,710
network system like in biological
evolution you see

1164
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:18,720
evolution you see
 

1165
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,630
evolution you see
successful alleles sweet populations and

1166
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
successful alleles sweet populations and
 

1167
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,990
successful alleles sweet populations and
they don't always have

1168
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
they don't always have
 

1169
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,710
they don't always have
um you know they are free of flaws the

1170
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:24,720
um you know they are free of flaws the
 

1171
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,029
um you know they are free of flaws the
heterozygous advantage right you can get

1172
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
heterozygous advantage right you can get
 

1173
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,070
heterozygous advantage right you can get
both parents give you the gene variant

1174
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,080
both parents give you the gene variant
 

1175
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,990
both parents give you the gene variant
and you get sickle cell anemia right but

1176
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
and you get sickle cell anemia right but
 

1177
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,430
and you get sickle cell anemia right but
but if one of them does you're more

1178
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
but if one of them does you're more
 

1179
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,710
but if one of them does you're more
resistant to malaria

1180
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
resistant to malaria
 

1181
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,070
resistant to malaria
and so this isn't um a beautiful process

1182
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
and so this isn't um a beautiful process
 

1183
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,669
and so this isn't um a beautiful process
except at large scale and then you

1184
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
except at large scale and then you
 

1185
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,830
except at large scale and then you
realize that because it moves fast and

1186
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:41,840
realize that because it moves fast and
 

1187
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,110
realize that because it moves fast and
can adapt it

1188
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
can adapt it
 

1189
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,990
can adapt it
it can win and people still struggle

1190
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,000
it can win and people still struggle
 

1191
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,750
it can win and people still struggle
with this i i used to struggle with this

1192
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
with this i i used to struggle with this
 

1193
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,110
with this i i used to struggle with this
because javascript was done in such a

1194
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,120
because javascript was done in such a
 

1195
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,990
because javascript was done in such a
hurry

1196
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
hurry
 

1197
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,789

early mistakes couldn't be
 

1201
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,390
early mistakes couldn't be

1202
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
fixed and even the standards process
 

1203
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,870

injected new mistakes as it will
 

1205
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,470

atp metabolism or whatever so um you
 

1217
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,230
atp metabolism or whatever so um you
have to kind of resign yourself to

1218

have to kind of resign yourself to
 

1219
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,590
have to kind of resign yourself to

that happened with javascript

1226
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
that happened with javascript
 

1227
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,669
that happened with javascript
and i'm way over it but it also i think

1228
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
and i'm way over it but it also i think
 

1229
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,669
and i'm way over it but it also i think
was a huge advantage why javascript has

1230
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
was a huge advantage why javascript has
 

1231
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,029
was a huge advantage why javascript has
kind of swept

1232
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
kind of swept
 

1233
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,510
kind of swept
a lot of programming domains um people

1234
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
a lot of programming domains um people
 

1235
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,710

well you're right but we also improved

1238
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,320
well you're right but we also improved

well you're right but we also improved
it over time in the standards body i

1240
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
it over time in the standards body i
 

1241
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:37,990
it over time in the standards body i
spent

1242
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
spent
 

1243
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,029
spent
20 years doing that and you don't get

1244
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
20 years doing that and you don't get
 

1245
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,470
20 years doing that and you don't get
that choice it's like

1246
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
that choice it's like
 

1247
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,789
that choice it's like
i'm not saying that that was the best

1248
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:44,799
i'm not saying that that was the best
 

1249
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,150
i'm not saying that that was the best
language i'm just saying that was the

1250
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
language i'm just saying that was the
 

1251
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,350
language i'm just saying that was the
right time to do it

1252
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
right time to do it
 

1253
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,510
right time to do it
and i like to say the alternative was

1254
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
and i like to say the alternative was
 

1255
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,710
and i like to say the alternative was
not to do it i could have

1256
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
not to do it i could have
 

1257
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,630
not to do it i could have
told netscape i can't do this it's too

1258
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,640
told netscape i can't do this it's too
 

1259
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,070
told netscape i can't do this it's too
rushed and it would have been

1260
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
rushed and it would have been
 

1261
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,549
rushed and it would have been
visual basic script it would have been

1262
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559
visual basic script it would have been
 

1263
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,510
visual basic script it would have been
bad

uh so that's a good way to present the

1266
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,280
uh so that's a good way to present the
 

1267
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,029
uh so that's a good way to present the
alternative but so you're it was a

1268
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
alternative but so you're it was a
 

1269
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,909
alternative but so you're it was a
netscape and

1270
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
netscape and
 

1271
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,430
netscape and
you were you have written in how many

1272
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
you were you have written in how many
 

1273
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,750
you were you have written in how many
days and why was it only that many days

1274
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:05,760
days and why was it only that many days
 

1275
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,870
days and why was it only that many days
and what was the

1276
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:06,880
and what was the
 

1277
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,789
and what was the
the goal and the underlying principles

1278
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
the goal and the underlying principles
 

1279
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,230
the goal and the underlying principles
in your mind so the whole

i'm sort of describing worse is better
in a frenetic way because it fit the

making the browser programmable too and
 

1461
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,950

so the
 

1463
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,029
so the
idea main idea was to put the java vm

1464
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:57,039
idea main idea was to put the java vm
 

1465
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,470
idea main idea was to put the java vm
which at that point was

1466
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,480
which at that point was
 

1467
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,310
which at that point was
not really easy to embed into netscape

1468
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,320
not really easy to embed into netscape
 

1469

looking like java meant

looking like java meant

looking like java meant
kind of the c curly brace syntax but

1798
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,000
kind of the c curly brace syntax but
 

1799
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,669
kind of the c curly brace syntax but
also some of the data types and objects

1800

also some of the data types and objects
 

1801
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,190
also some of the data types and objects
like objects and so on all that kind of

1802
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,200
like objects and so on all that kind of
 

1803
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,830
like objects and so on all that kind of
stuff

1804
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:11,840

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
yeah
 

1809
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,710
yeah
uh even the bitwise operators and the

1810
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720
uh even the bitwise operators and the
 

1811
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,029
uh even the bitwise operators and the
shift operators including the unsigned

1814
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,000
right shift which
 

1815
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,750
right shift which
java had because it didn't have unsigned

1816
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:21,760
java had because it didn't have unsigned
 

1817
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,430
java had because it didn't have unsigned
integer types it's it said if you want

1818
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:23,440
integer types it's it said if you want
 

1819
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,870
integer types it's it said if you want
to do unsigned operations use an

1820
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:24,880
to do unsigned operations use an
 

1821
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,590
to do unsigned operations use an
operator

1822
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:25,600
operator
 

1823
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,870
operator
and that turned out to be important much

1824
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880
and that turned out to be important much
 

1825
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,990
and that turned out to be important much
later i'll tell that story five time but

it did have concurrency right from the

it did have concurrency right from the

it did have concurrency right from the

concurrent that's right and the reason
 

1907
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,310
concurrent that's right and the reason
was java was going to run into plug-ins

was java was going to run into plug-ins
 

1909
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:42,950
was java was going to run into plug-ins
so it could

so it could
 

1911
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,110
so it could
fork threads and go go to town but the

1921
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,950

service the event loop and then go

service the event loop and then go

was in part like hypercard because

1942
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:16,159
was in part like hypercard because
 

1943
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,830
was in part like hypercard because
hypercard had this on

1944
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
hypercard had this on
 

1945
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,909
hypercard had this on
event name syntax and so that's why you

1946
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:19,919
event name syntax and so that's why you
 

1947
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,510
event name syntax and so that's why you
have in javascript on click

1948
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
have in javascript on click
 

1949
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,190
have in javascript on click
run together as the name of the event

1950
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,200
run together as the name of the event

bought my macro media
 

2347
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,349
bought my macro media
to improve flash and to improve the

2348
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
to improve flash and to improve the
 

2349
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,430
to improve flash and to improve the
version of javascript that was in flash

right i'm getting ahead of myself
 

2355
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,349
right i'm getting ahead of myself
yes yeah that's it that's right can we

2356
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:13,359
yes yeah that's it that's right can we
 

2357
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,670
yes yeah that's it that's right can we
just rewind yeah it's a magical like

2358
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:15,680
just rewind yeah it's a magical like
 

2359
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,069
just rewind yeah it's a magical like
you know it's a special moment in the

2360
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:18,079
you know it's a special moment in the
 

2361
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,829
you know it's a special moment in the

uh we'll talk about it later but it's

2364
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:21,599
uh we'll talk about it later but it's
 

2365
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,550
uh we'll talk about it later but it's
arguable it's possible that the entirety

00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:24,560
arguable it's possible that the entirety
 

2367
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,230
arguable it's possible that the entirety
of the world will run in javascript at

2368
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,240
of the world will run in javascript at
 

2369
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,109

and indeed there are problems if you did

2432
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:21,359
and indeed there are problems if you did
 

2433
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,030
and indeed there are problems if you did
it naively you'd see the code

2434
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,040
it naively you'd see the code
 

2435
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,349
it naively you'd see the code
laid out as like random gibberish so i

2436
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:25,359
laid out as like random gibberish so i
 

2437
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,630
laid out as like random gibberish so i
had to figure out how to hide that that

2438
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:26,640
had to figure out how to hide that that
 

2439
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,109
had to figure out how to hide that that
was a

2440
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:27,119
was a
 

2441
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,270
was a
challenge is that is it a breakthrough

2442
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
challenge is that is it a breakthrough
 

2443
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,230
challenge is that is it a breakthrough
idea i mean

2444
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240
idea i mean
 

2445
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,470
idea i mean
so you mark thinking about this idea

2446
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:32,480
so you mark thinking about this idea
 

2447
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,550
so you mark thinking about this idea
that you just inject code

2448
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:34,560
that you just inject code
 

2449
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,470
that you just inject code
in the middle of the market the web page

2450
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,480
in the middle of the market the web page
 

2451
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,910
in the middle of the market the web page
yeah it was considered kind of heretical

2452
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
yeah it was considered kind of heretical
 

2453
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,990
yeah it was considered kind of heretical
there was an sgml guru i forget his name

2454
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,000
there was an sgml guru i forget his name
 

2455
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,349
there was an sgml guru i forget his name
but he corresponded with me and at first

2456
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:41,359
but he corresponded with me and at first
 

2457
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,190
but he corresponded with me and at first
he was angry he's like

2458
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:43,200
he was angry he's like
 

2459
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,630
he was angry he's like
you should have used a marked section

2460
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
you should have used a marked section
 

2461
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,910
you should have used a marked section
why didn't you use a marked section and

2462
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:45,920
why didn't you use a marked section and
 

2463
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,710
why didn't you use a marked section and
i said well

2464
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:46,720
i said well
 

2465
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,150
i said well
html marked sections are not part of

2466
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,160
html marked sections are not part of
 

2467
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,270
html marked sections are not part of
html by the way and they're not

2468
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:49,280
html by the way and they're not
 

2469
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,630
html by the way and they're not
supported in the browser

2470
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:50,640
supported in the browser
 

2471
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,910
supported in the browser
and so i did some hack that was

2472
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:51,920
and so i did some hack that was
 

2473
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,750
and so i did some hack that was
equivalent and over time you could do

2474
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
equivalent and over time you could do
 

2475
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,310
equivalent and over time you could do
the proper sgml thing but it eventually

2476
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:56,320
the proper sgml thing but it eventually
 

2477
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,030
the proper sgml thing but it eventually
came around

2478
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,040
came around
 

2479
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,190
came around
and it was again sort of of evolutionary

2480
00:37:59,190 --> 00:37:59,200
and it was again sort of of evolutionary
 

2481
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,150
and it was again sort of of evolutionary
necessity it was almost like

2482
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,160
necessity it was almost like
 

2483
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,589
necessity it was almost like
introgression like like

2484
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:01,599
introgression like like
 

2485
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,870
introgression like like
you know the idea um which liam

2486
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:04,880
you know the idea um which liam
 

2487
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,990
you know the idea um which liam
arguelles i think

2488
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
arguelles i think
 

2489
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,550
arguelles i think
helped get across that uh we have to

2490
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:08,560
helped get across that uh we have to
 

2491
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,349
helped get across that uh we have to
consider

2492
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:09,359
consider
 

2493
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,430
consider
mutualism biology that maybe you know

2494
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,440
mutualism biology that maybe you know
 

2495
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,870
mutualism biology that maybe you know
mitochondria were ancient

2496
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:12,880
mitochondria were ancient
 

2497
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,510
mitochondria were ancient
uh prokaryotes that got into the cell

2498
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:15,520
uh prokaryotes that got into the cell
 

2499
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,950
uh prokaryotes that got into the cell
and became beneficial

2500
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
and became beneficial
 

2501
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,230
and became beneficial
um somehow uh the same sort of thinking

2502
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,240
um somehow uh the same sort of thinking
 

2503
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,230
um somehow uh the same sort of thinking
applies uh you have to embed javascript

2504
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240
applies uh you have to embed javascript
 

2505
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,550
applies uh you have to embed javascript
in html it's gonna be a good virus

2506
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:24,560
in html it's gonna be a good virus
 

2507
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,390
in html it's gonna be a good virus
it won't so the code the code becomes

00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
it won't so the code the code becomes

the netscape at that time

the netscape at that time
doesn't the browser have to support

00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:37,119
doesn't the browser have to support

mix of html yeah and whatever code i had

2524
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:41,520
mix of html yeah and whatever code i had
 

2525
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,870

to hide it from old browsers including

netscape one one which was predominant
 

2529
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,030

then

2530
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
then
 

2531
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,550
then
so i used an html comment but the

2532
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:48,560
so i used an html comment but the
 

2533
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,150
so i used an html comment but the
inside the container that comment lived

in the script tag which is a new element
 

2537
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,550
in the script tag which is a new element
i could make

2538
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
i could make
 

2539
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,870
i could make
different semantics in netscape 2 where

if you're writing a game or something

if you're writing a game or something

and you're
 

2847

and you're
doing event based allocation you run out

2848
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:30,800
doing event based allocation you run out
 

2849
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,870
doing event based allocation you run out

2850
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
of memory and this was noticed
 

2851
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,710
of memory and this was noticed
in the summer of 1995 and people were

2852
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:34,720
in the summer of 1995 and people were
 

2853
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,470
in the summer of 1995 and people were
like what's going on oh yeah i gotta get

2854
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:36,480
like what's going on oh yeah i gotta get
 

2855
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,750
like what's going on oh yeah i gotta get
i better go back and do reference

2856
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:37,760
i better go back and do reference

counting
 

2859
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,670
counting
and then the problem with reference

2860
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:39,680
and then the problem with reference
 

2861
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,270
and then the problem with reference
counting is you're writing the language

2862
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
counting is you're writing the language
 

2863
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:41,589
counting is you're writing the language
in

2864
00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:41,599
in
 

2865
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,630
in
the runtime in c an unsafe language and

2866
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:44,640
the runtime in c an unsafe language and
 

2867
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,390
the runtime in c an unsafe language and
if you're reference counting and you

2868
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:46,400
if you're reference counting and you
 

2869
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,069
if you're reference counting and you
overflow the counter you mismanage it so

2870
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
overflow the counter you mismanage it so
 

2871
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,910
overflow the counter you mismanage it so
it goes high it gets stuck high you leak

2872
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:49,920
it goes high it gets stuck high you leak
 

2873
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,510
it goes high it gets stuck high you leak
memory again and you run out

2874
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:51,520
memory again and you run out
 

2875
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,630
memory again and you run out
if you underflow it you pre-memory

2876
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:54,640
if you underflow it you pre-memory
 

2877
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,069
if you underflow it you pre-memory
that's still in use

2878
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:56,079
that's still in use
 

2879
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,950
that's still in use
and even then we knew what all the

2880
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:58,960
and even then we knew what all the

came to know that you therefore have a

potentially a remote
 

2887
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,829
potentially a remote
code execution vulnerability because

2888
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
code execution vulnerability because
 

2889
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,069
code execution vulnerability because
this was before things like

2890
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
this was before things like
 

2891
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,390
this was before things like
non-executable heap memory and

2892
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:12,400
non-executable heap memory and
 

2893
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,390
non-executable heap memory and
stack defenses against taking over

stack defenses against taking over
 

2895
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,069
stack defenses against taking over
memory so if you can

from the the remote side write some html

2898

from the the remote side write some html
 

2899
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,990
from the the remote side write some html
and javascript that just happens to

causes javascript to underflow a
 

2905
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,589

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,190
self-hosted or
so called bootstrap and so we could use

so once we could bootstrap in the kip's
vm we wouldn't need sun and

i saw that only he saw this sort of off
 

3893
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,950
i saw that only he saw this sort of off
by one bug in somewhere in the spec and

3894
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
by one bug in somewhere in the spec and
 

3895
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,390

fence post bug there and then
 

3899
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,349
fence post bug there and then
we kind of locked eyes and we realized

we kind of locked eyes and we realized

00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:31,839
what were the features that are being
 

3907
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,670
what were the features that are being
like struggled over and debated and

thought about and
 

3911
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,390
thought about and
it was mainly writing down what worked

3912
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:36,400
it was mainly writing down what worked
 

3913
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,670
it was mainly writing down what worked
and what we thought should work in the

3914
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:37,680
and what we thought should work in the
 

3915
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,670
and what we thought should work in the
edge cases that didn't interoperate or

3916
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:39,680
edge cases that didn't interoperate or
 

3917
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:39,990
edge cases that didn't interoperate or
that

3918

that
 

3919
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,230
that
seemed wrong uh but we were already

3920
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,240
seemed wrong uh but we were already
 

3921
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,670

editions that

3924
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:44,559
editions that
 

3925
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,549
editions that
i was already implementing i was still

00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:46,559
i was already implementing i was still
 

3927
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,069
i was already implementing i was still
trying to lead the standard

3928
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:48,079
trying to lead the standard
 

3929
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,710
trying to lead the standard
by using the dominant market power to

3930
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
by using the dominant market power to
 

3931
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,390
by using the dominant market power to
write the code that actually shipped

3932
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:52,400
write the code that actually shipped
 

3933
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,910
write the code that actually shipped
so the de facto standard would lead the

3934
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:53,920
so the de facto standard would lead the
 

3935
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,829
so the de facto standard would lead the
de jure standard and i was putting in

3936
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:55,839
de jure standard and i was putting in
 

3937
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:58,150
de jure standard and i was putting in
the the missing you know function forms

3938
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:58,160
the the missing you know function forms
 

3939
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,829
the the missing you know function forms
that i didn't have time for in the 10

3940
00:59:59,829 --> 00:59:59,839
that i didn't have time for in the 10
 

3941
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:00,390
that i didn't have time for in the 10
days

3942
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:00,400
days
 

3943
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,069
days
so this is the engineering mindset

3944
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:02,079
so this is the engineering mindset
 

3945
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,829
so this is the engineering mindset
versus the theoretician so you didn't

3946
01:00:03,829 --> 01:00:03,839
versus the theoretician so you didn't
 

3947
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:05,109
versus the theoretician so you didn't
want to create the perfect language but

3948
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:05,119
want to create the perfect language but
 

3949
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,549
want to create the perfect language but
one that was the popular and

3950
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
one that was the popular and
 

3951
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:07,670
one that was the popular and
shipped and all that kind of and you

3952
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
shipped and all that kind of and you
 

3953
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,030
shipped and all that kind of and you
could say there was i was standing on

3954
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:09,040
could say there was i was standing on
 

3955
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,390
could say there was i was standing on
the shoulders of giants so there was a

3956
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:10,400
the shoulders of giants so there was a
 

3957
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,390
the shoulders of giants so there was a
staged process where i had to hold back

3958
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:12,400
staged process where i had to hold back
 

3959
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,109

01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
things that were well designed by others
 

3961
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,390
things that were well designed by others
in other languages and i could

3962
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:16,400
in other languages and i could
 

3963
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,990
in other languages and i could
imitate but i couldn't do them all in

3964
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,000
imitate but i couldn't do them all in

01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:24,640
and they came into the third edition of
 

3971
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,150
and they came into the third edition of
the standard which was finally finalized

01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:40,319
think it's 2015 so it's off by
 

4181
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:43,589
think it's 2015 so it's off by
four yes yeah it was done finalized in

4182
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:43,599
four yes yeah it was done finalized in
 

4183
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:45,190
four yes yeah it was done finalized in
2015 it took a little longer than we

4184
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:45,200
2015 it took a little longer than we
 

4185
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,150
2015 it took a little longer than we
hoped but

4186
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:46,160
hoped but
 

4187
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,950
hoped but
um because es5 was 2009 and that was a

4188
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:48,960
um because es5 was 2009 and that was a
 

4189
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,630
um because es5 was 2009 and that was a
smaller increment from

4190
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:50,640
smaller increment from
 

4191
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,870
smaller increment from
es3 we skipped four again we mothballed

4192

01:05:46,069 --> 01:05:46,079
microsoft's had to kind of look around
 

4327
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,309
microsoft's had to kind of look around
corners at the standards body and guess

4328
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:48,319
corners at the standards body and guess
 

4329
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,270
corners at the standards body and guess
how

4330
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:49,280
how
 

4331
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,829
how
their version of modules or decorators

4332
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:51,839
their version of modules or decorators
 

4333
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,510
their version of modules or decorators
should work and and the standards body

4334
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:53,520
should work and and the standards body
 

4335
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,150
should work and and the standards body
then may

4336
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,160
then may
 

4337
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,549
then may
change things a bit so i think they're

4338
01:05:56,549 --> 01:05:56,559
change things a bit so i think they're
 

4339
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:57,990
change things a bit so i think they're
obligated with typescript either to

4340
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
obligated with typescript either to
 

4341
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,990
obligated with typescript either to
carry their own version or to

4342
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,000
carry their own version or to
 

4343
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,510
carry their own version or to
bring it back with incompatible changes

4344
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,520
bring it back with incompatible changes
 

4345
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,109
bring it back with incompatible changes
towards the standard over time

4346
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:03,119
towards the standard over time
 

4347
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,549
towards the standard over time
and i think they've played generally

4348
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:04,559
and i think they've played generally
 

4349
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,309
and i think they've played generally
fair there there's some sentiment that

4350
01:06:06,309 --> 01:06:06,319
fair there there's some sentiment that
 

4351
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:07,910
fair there there's some sentiment that
why don't they standardize typescript

4352
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:07,920
why don't they standardize typescript
 

4353
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,390
why don't they standardize typescript
well

4354

and in some ways you can say the same

4362
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
and in some ways you can say the same
 

4363
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,109
and in some ways you can say the same
thing to any of the other big companies

in the standards body why doesn't google

4366
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:18,720
in the standards body why doesn't google
 

4367
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,470
in the standards body why doesn't google
standardize its stuff um

4368
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:20,480
standardize its stuff um
 

4369
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,150
standardize its stuff um
so you you think it'll continue being

4370
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:22,160
so you you think it'll continue being
 

4371

there's a hope that at some point

there's a hope that at some point
if they keep reconverging it and the

if they keep reconverging it and the

01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,710
if they keep reconverging it and the
standard doesn't break them and

standard doesn't break them and
 

4381
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,190
standard doesn't break them and
goes in a good direction we will get at

4382
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:33,200
goes in a good direction we will get at
 

4383
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,069
goes in a good direction we will get at
least the annotation syntax and some

01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,749
that things became simpler the fetch api

javascript that you would

4522
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:43,520
javascript that you would

01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,550
javascript that you would
make more concise in terse in jquery

4524
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:46,560
make more concise in terse in jquery
 

4525
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,630
make more concise in terse in jquery
but it's it's not bad it's pretty good

4526
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:48,640
but it's it's not bad it's pretty good
 

4527
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,229
but it's it's not bad it's pretty good
whereas in the old dom of

01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:50,239
whereas in the old dom of
 

4529
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:51,990
whereas in the old dom of
15 years ago it was just too provost so

4530
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
15 years ago it was just too provost so
 

4531
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,309
15 years ago it was just too provost so
maybe the frameworks were born

4532
01:08:54,309 --> 01:08:54,319
maybe the frameworks were born
 

4533
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,189
maybe the frameworks were born
kind of uh because javascript lacks some

4534
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:57,199
kind of uh because javascript lacks some
 

4535
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,070
kind of uh because javascript lacks some
of the features of

4536
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,080
of the features of
 

4537
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,630
of the features of
jquery and so like uh now that

4538
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:00,640
jquery and so like uh now that
 

4539
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,829
jquery and so like uh now that
javascript is

4540
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
javascript is
 

4541
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,070
javascript is
swallowing what jquery was then the

4542
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,080
swallowing what jquery was then the
 

4543
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,189
swallowing what jquery was then the
frameworks will

4544
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:05,199
frameworks will
 

4545
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:07,189

only the ones that truly add value will

01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:07,199
only the ones that truly add value will
 

4547
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,709
only the ones that truly add value will
stick around and the other ones will die

4548
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:08,719
stick around and the other ones will die

also this division between the core

yes it was a little bit i don't know if

4774
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
yes it was a little bit i don't know if

4779
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,189
comment on that but to me it was a
little bit like go-to statement like

01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:41,199
little bit like go-to statement like
 

4781
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:43,430

that were introduced through the
 

4795
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,870
that were introduced through the

4796
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:54,880
animation process that i couldn't debug
 

4797
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,910
animation process that i couldn't debug
easily yes

4798
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:55,920
easily yes
 

4799
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,430

i heard that too i i didn't use it so

4800
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:57,440
i heard that too i i didn't use it so
 

4801
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,430
i heard that too i i didn't use it so
i'm doing the grass's greener thing here

4803
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,149
i'm doing the grass's greener thing here
yeah the thing i

4804
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:00,159
yeah the thing i
 

4805
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,990
yeah the thing i
like i liked about the animation model

4806
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,000
like i liked about the animation model
 

4807
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,430
like i liked about the animation model
was that it was this immutable function

4808
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:03,440
was that it was this immutable function
 

4809
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,550
was that it was this immutable function
of time so you could

4810
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
of time so you could
 

4811
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,790
of time so you could
time warp and you could if you dodged

4812
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:06,800
time warp and you could if you dodged
 

4813
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,390
time warp and you could if you dodged
these bugs or worked carefully

4814
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:08,400
these bugs or worked carefully
 

4815
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,750
these bugs or worked carefully
you could really make it sing in ways

4816
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:09,760
you could really make it sing in ways
 

4817
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,590
you could really make it sing in ways
that i think still a little challenging

4818
01:13:11,590 --> 01:13:11,600
that i think still a little challenging
 

4819
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,070
that i think still a little challenging
with

4820
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:12,080
with
 

4821
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,110
with
the web animation standards but

4822
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:15,120
the web animation standards but
 

4823
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,990
the web animation standards but
or just using raw canvas and webgl um

4824
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:18,000
or just using raw canvas and webgl um
 

4825
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,669
or just using raw canvas and webgl um
but there's so many tools now that maybe

4826
01:13:19,669 --> 01:13:19,679
but there's so many tools now that maybe
 

4827
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:20,630
but there's so many tools now that maybe
it doesn't matter

4828
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:20,640
it doesn't matter
 

4829
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,830
it doesn't matter
and and yet we had to you know do video

4830
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
and and yet we had to you know do video
 

4831

we had to do
 

4833
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,149
we had to do
uh webgl and then evolve it we had to do

4834
01:13:28,149 --> 01:13:28,159
uh webgl and then evolve it we had to do

so it's like a hack on javascript and

01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,750
so it's like a hack on javascript and
it's a subset and it uses those bitwise

maybe it can even be in process and

5126
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:01,600
maybe it can even be in process and
 

5127
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,709
maybe it can even be in process and
still be memory say that would be

5128
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:02,719
still be memory say that would be
 

5129
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,070
still be memory say that would be
awesome but they ended up using process

5130
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:04,080
awesome but they ended up using process
 

5131
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,590
awesome but they ended up using process
isolation too and that kind of

5132
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:05,600
isolation too and that kind of
 

5133
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,430
isolation too and that kind of
weakened it and in the end it was like

5134
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:07,440
weakened it and in the end it was like
 

5135
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,270
weakened it and in the end it was like

uh it's it's more like soft power yes
 

5961
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,790
uh it's it's more like soft power yes
and uh people are fighting back do you

5962
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:50,800
and uh people are fighting back do you
 

5963
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,350
and uh people are fighting back do you
think it's possible so the javascript

5964
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,360
think it's possible so the javascript
 

5965
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:56,550
think it's possible so the javascript
used to be uh for the front end of the

5966
01:30:56,550 --> 01:30:56,560
used to be uh for the front end of the
 

5967
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,030
used to be uh for the front end of the
web

5968
01:30:57,030 --> 01:30:57,040
web
 

5969
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,550
web
it's now increasingly so being used for

5970
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:00,560
it's now increasingly so being used for
 

5971
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,070
it's now increasingly so being used for
back end like running stuff that's

5972
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:04,080
back end like running stuff that's
 

5973
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,590
back end like running stuff that's
like behind the scenes and it's also

5974
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:07,600
like behind the scenes and it's also
 

5975
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,390
like behind the scenes and it's also
starting to be used uh quite a bit for

5976
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,400
starting to be used uh quite a bit for
 

5977
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,070
starting to be used uh quite a bit for
things like tensorflow.js

5978
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:12,080
things like tensorflow.js
 

5979
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,990
things like tensorflow.js
so starting to actually use like these

5980
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,000
so starting to actually use like these
 

5981
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,470
so starting to actually use like these

very lightweight vms and so gary took

very lightweight vms and so gary took
 

6101
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,510
very lightweight vms and so gary took
this idea and said

6102
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:07,520
this idea and said
 

6103
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,110
this idea and said
javascript will take over computing

6104
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:09,120
javascript will take over computing
 

6105
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,189
javascript will take over computing
because the system call boundaries too

6122
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:26,480
there's so many people that are
 

6123
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:28,470
there's so many people that are
interested in starting to learning about

6124
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:28,480
interested in starting to learning about
 

6125
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:31,189
interested in starting to learning about
programming getting into this world

6126
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:31,199
programming getting into this world
 

6127
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:34,870
programming getting into this world
is there um some number of languages

6128
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:34,880
is there um some number of languages
 

6129
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,550
is there um some number of languages
three to five programming languages that

6130
01:33:36,550 --> 01:33:36,560
three to five programming languages that
 

6131
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,149
three to five programming languages that
you would recommend people learn

6132
01:33:38,149 --> 01:33:38,159
you would recommend people learn
 

6133
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:41,189
you would recommend people learn
or maybe uh a broader

6134
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:41,199
or maybe uh a broader

advice on how to get started in

6136
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:42,800
advice on how to get started in
 

6137
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,709
advice on how to get started in
programming well so you asked about

6138
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:44,719
programming well so you asked about
 

6139
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,310
programming well so you asked about
machine learning and you know javascript

6140
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:46,320
machine learning and you know javascript
 

6141
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,110
machine learning and you know javascript
is a general purpose language and it's a

6142
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:49,120
is a general purpose language and it's a
 

6143
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,390
is a general purpose language and it's a
language that's not um

6144
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:52,400
language that's not um
 

6145
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,709
language that's not um
not that great for doing you know matrix

6146
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:54,719
not that great for doing you know matrix
 

6147
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,229
not that great for doing you know matrix
operations

6148
01:33:56,229 --> 01:33:56,239
operations
 

6149
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:58,550
operations
or doing parallel programming i would

6150
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:58,560
or doing parallel programming i would
 

6151
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,510
or doing parallel programming i would
say

6152
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,520
say
 

6153
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,510
say
without using some extensions or some

6154
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:01,520
without using some extensions or some
 

6155
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:03,590
without using some extensions or some
libraries that have some magic in them

6156
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:03,600
libraries that have some magic in them
 

6157
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,629
libraries that have some magic in them
so if someone wanted to you know learn

6158
01:34:06,629 --> 01:34:06,639
so if someone wanted to you know learn
 

6159
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,750
so if someone wanted to you know learn
um of the there are amazing languages in

6160
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:09,760
um of the there are amazing languages in
 

6161
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,430
um of the there are amazing languages in
sort of the apl family that are very

6162
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:11,440
sort of the apl family that are very
 

6163
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:12,229
sort of the apl family that are very
useful for

6164
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:12,239
useful for
 

6165
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:14,790
useful for
i would say linear algebra which gets to

6166
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:14,800
i would say linear algebra which gets to
 

6167
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,709
i would say linear algebra which gets to
a lot of the kernels in machine learning

6168
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
a lot of the kernels in machine learning
 

6169
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,790
a lot of the kernels in machine learning
and so apl had like j and then k

6170
01:34:20,790 --> 01:34:20,800
and so apl had like j and then k
 

6171
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,870
and so apl had like j and then k
and their k variants because the guy

6172
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:22,880
and their k variants because the guy
 

6173
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,229
and their k variants because the guy
that did k is still

6174
01:34:24,229 --> 01:34:24,239
that did k is still
 

6175
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:25,990
that did k is still
going and he's they're proprietary but

6176
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:26,000
going and he's they're proprietary but
 

6177
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,669
going and he's they're proprietary but
he's still innovating there

6178
01:34:27,669 --> 01:34:27,679
he's still innovating there
 

6179
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:30,390
he's still innovating there
um there are you know python is used so

6180
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:30,400
um there are you know python is used so
 

6181
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,110
um there are you know python is used so
people talk about

6182
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:31,120
people talk about
 

6183
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,350
people talk about
vlog js well it's not that's surprising

6184
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:33,360
vlog js well it's not that's surprising
 

6185
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,590
vlog js well it's not that's surprising
because python was heavily used for

because python was heavily used for
 

6187
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,070
because python was heavily used for

01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:42,480
tradition there were some projects that
 

6195
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,750
tradition there were some projects that
tried this and some of them were

6196
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:43,760
tried this and some of them were
 

6197
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,189
tried this and some of them were
interesting um

6198
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:45,199
interesting um
 

6199
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:48,629

the philosophy with python was oh you

6202
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:50,159
the philosophy with python was oh you
 

6203
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:52,070

need to go faster write a c plug-in and

6204
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:52,080
need to go faster write a c plug-in and
 

6205
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:55,189
need to go faster write a c plug-in and
drop into c code so i think people

6206
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:55,199
drop into c code so i think people
 

6207
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:55,830
drop into c code so i think people
should look

6208
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:55,840
should look
 

6209
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,470
should look
at multiple languages because they're

6210
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:58,480
at multiple languages because they're
 

6211
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,070
at multiple languages because they're
different tools in the belt if you're

programming but the the cool thing about
 

6385
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:36,070
programming but the the cool thing about
javascript is that you can create stuff

01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:42,080
you can create stuff and it'll visually
 

6393
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:44,149
you can create stuff and it'll visually
look like something and it'll do stuff

and it makes you feel good it makes you
 

6397
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,189

fall in love with programming

6398

fall in love with programming
 

6399
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:48,790
fall in love with programming
with python you could do the same it's a

6400
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:48,800
with python you could do the same it's a
 

6401
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,629
with python you could do the same it's a
little slower and with c plus it takes

6402
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:50,639
little slower and with c plus it takes
 

6403
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,229
little slower and with c plus it takes
five to ten years to write a program

6404
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:52,239
five to ten years to write a program
 

6405
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:53,590
five to ten years to write a program
that actually does something

6406

having just learned javascript they said

6452
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:39,119
having just learned javascript they said
 

6453
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:40,870
having just learned javascript they said
i can take a number and i can index into

6454
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:40,880
i can take a number and i can index into
 

6455
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,390
i can take a number and i can index into
it and get undefined out of it as a

6456
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:42,400
it and get undefined out of it as a
 

6457
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,270
it and get undefined out of it as a
property and

6458
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:43,280
property and
 

6459
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,950

why is that a number is not an object

6460
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:44,960
why is that a number is not an object
 

6461
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,629
why is that a number is not an object
and i explained why it is because like

6462
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:46,639
and i explained why it is because like
 

6463
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:47,430
and i explained why it is because like
in java

6464
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,440
in java
 

6465
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,950
in java
the primitive types which unfortunately

6466
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:48,960
the primitive types which unfortunately
 

6467
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,030
the primitive types which unfortunately
are not objects can be automatically

6468
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:51,040
are not objects can be automatically
 

6469
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,590
are not objects can be automatically
boxed or wrapped by an object and i made

6470
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:53,600
boxed or wrapped by an object and i made
 

6471
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,350

that implicit
 

6473
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,430
that implicit
in in java it's it's typed and you have

6474
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,440
in in java it's it's typed and you have
 

6475
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,950
in in java it's it's typed and you have
to declare things and you'll get

6476
01:38:58,950 --> 01:38:58,960
to declare things and you'll get
 

6477
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,430
to declare things and you'll get
type errors um but there are cases in

6478
01:39:01,430 --> 01:39:01,440
type errors um but there are cases in
 

6479
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,189
type errors um but there are cases in
java where you get auto boxing or auto

6480
01:39:03,189 --> 01:39:03,199
java where you get auto boxing or auto
 

6481
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:04,470
java where you get auto boxing or auto
wrapping because you've declared that

6482
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:04,480
wrapping because you've declared that
 

6483
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,910
wrapping because you've declared that
you want it

6484
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:05,920
you want it
 

6485
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,990
you want it
in javascript it just happens and so

6486
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:08,000
in javascript it just happens and so
 

6487
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,149
in javascript it just happens and so
once i explain it like oh wow i get it

6488
01:39:10,149 --> 01:39:10,159
once i explain it like oh wow i get it

look at it but we've already talked a
 

6515
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:34,870
look at it but we've already talked a
little bit about netscape and

6516
01:39:34,870 --> 01:39:34,880
little bit about netscape and
 

6517
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,310
little bit about netscape and
internet explorer uh in the early days

6518
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,320
internet explorer uh in the early days
 

6519

it didn't work but buying a bunch of

6560
01:40:17,270 --> 01:40:17,280
it didn't work but buying a bunch of
 

6561
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,310
it didn't work but buying a bunch of
companies usually

6562
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:18,320
companies usually
 

6563
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,270
companies usually
doesn't work i think the modern sort of

6564
01:40:21,270 --> 01:40:21,280
doesn't work i think the modern sort of
 

6565
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,310
doesn't work i think the modern sort of
approach it

6566
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:22,320
approach it
 

6567
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:25,189
approach it
roughly is like mark zuckerberg uh took

6568
01:40:25,189 --> 01:40:25,199
roughly is like mark zuckerberg uh took
 

6569
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:26,709
roughly is like mark zuckerberg uh took
which is to keep them at arm's length

01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,870
was going to come and start beheading
the executive because it didn't do

7242
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:34,880
the executive because it didn't do
 

7243
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:35,910
the executive because it didn't do
anything useful

7244
01:50:35,910 --> 01:50:35,920
anything useful
 

7245
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,189
anything useful
and there was a thought you should take

7246
01:50:37,189 --> 01:50:37,199
and there was a thought you should take
 

7247
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:39,109
and there was a thought you should take
the netscape browser engine and put it

7248
01:50:39,109 --> 01:50:39,119
the netscape browser engine and put it
 

7249
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:41,030
the netscape browser engine and put it
in the windows aol client which was the

7250
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:41,040
in the windows aol client which was the
 

7251
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,550
in the windows aol client which was the
dial-up client that all the

7252
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:42,560
dial-up client that all the
 

7253
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,629
dial-up client that all the
increasingly aging users of aol were

7254
01:50:44,629 --> 01:50:44,639
increasingly aging users of aol were
 

7255
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:47,030
increasingly aging users of aol were
using never happened it would have been

7256
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:47,040
using never happened it would have been
 

7257
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,790
using never happened it would have been
too big a change so it wasn't clear why

7258
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:48,800
too big a change so it wasn't clear why
 

7259
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,229
too big a change so it wasn't clear why
it all bought netscape but as i said

7260
01:50:50,229 --> 01:50:50,239
it all bought netscape but as i said
 

7261
01:50:50,239 --> 01:50:51,510
it all bought netscape but as i said
they left it alone but netscape didn't

7262
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:51,520
they left it alone but netscape didn't
 

7263
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:53,189
they left it alone but netscape didn't
leave mozilla alone

7264
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:53,199
leave mozilla alone
 

7265
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:57,189
leave mozilla alone
and so um in 2001

7266
01:50:57,189 --> 01:50:57,199
and so um in 2001
 

7267
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:58,870
and so um in 2001
mitchell called me up and said i'm no

7268
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:58,880
mitchell called me up and said i'm no
 

7269
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,470
mitchell called me up and said i'm no
longer employed and i'm saying what you

7270
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,480
longer employed and i'm saying what you
 

7271
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:00,790
longer employed and i'm saying what you
quit

7272
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:00,800
quit
 

7273
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,550
quit
no no this wasn't my choice and there

7274
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:02,560
no no this wasn't my choice and there
 

7275
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:03,830
no no this wasn't my choice and there
was a layoff

7276
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:03,840
was a layoff
 

7277
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:05,750
was a layoff
which maybe accidentally or on purpose

7278
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:05,760
which maybe accidentally or on purpose
 

7279
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:07,189
which maybe accidentally or on purpose
got rid of mitchell but the funny thing

7280
01:51:07,189 --> 01:51:07,199
got rid of mitchell but the funny thing
 

7281
01:51:07,199 --> 01:51:08,790
got rid of mitchell but the funny thing
was we had an open source project we had

7282
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:08,800
was we had an open source project we had
 

7283
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,470
was we had an open source project we had
a lot of the engineers on staff

7284
01:51:10,470 --> 01:51:10,480
a lot of the engineers on staff
 

7285
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:13,830
a lot of the engineers on staff
on our side and we had um people we'd

7286
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:13,840
on our side and we had um people we'd
 

7287
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,189
on our side and we had um people we'd
hired for the mosul community

7288
01:51:15,189 --> 01:51:15,199
hired for the mosul community
 

7289
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:17,350
hired for the mosul community
were top-notch they'd risen you know

7290
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:17,360
were top-notch they'd risen you know
 

7291
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,870
were top-notch they'd risen you know
they came in high quality they knew the

7292
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:18,880
they came in high quality they knew the
 

7293
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,070
they came in high quality they knew the
code and they actually were

7294
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:20,080
code and they actually were
 

7295
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,310
code and they actually were
better than the average or median higher

7296
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:22,320
better than the average or median higher
 

7297
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:23,189
better than the average or median higher
of netscape

7298
01:51:23,189 --> 01:51:23,199
of netscape
 

7299
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:26,310
of netscape
and so the funny thing was the

7300
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:26,320
and so the funny thing was the
 

7301
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,470
and so the funny thing was the
executive who thought they'd gotten rid

7302
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:28,480
executive who thought they'd gotten rid
 

7303
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:29,830
executive who thought they'd gotten rid
of mitchell in the layoff

7304
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:29,840
of mitchell in the layoff
 

7305
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:32,070
of mitchell in the layoff
on the next week's community call around

7306
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:32,080
on the next week's community call around
 

7307
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,270
on the next week's community call around
mozilla and what to do

7308
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:33,280
mozilla and what to do
 

7309
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:35,750
mozilla and what to do
there's mitchell and so this show you

7310
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:35,760
there's mitchell and so this show you
 

7311
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,510
there's mitchell and so this show you
can kind of transcend your

7312
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:37,520
can kind of transcend your
 

7313
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,750
can kind of transcend your
uh you know boundaries of corporate open

7314
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:39,760
uh you know boundaries of corporate open
 

7315
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,510
uh you know boundaries of corporate open
source if you get a project that has

7316
01:51:41,510 --> 01:51:41,520
source if you get a project that has
 

7317
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:42,149
source if you get a project that has
enough

7318
01:51:42,149 --> 01:51:42,159
enough
 

7319
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:43,669
enough
loyalty even among the paid staff

7320
01:51:43,669 --> 01:51:43,679
loyalty even among the paid staff
 

7321
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:44,629
loyalty even among the paid staff
because we had outside people

7322
01:51:44,629 --> 01:51:44,639
because we had outside people
 

7323
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:45,350
because we had outside people
contributing

7324
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:45,360
contributing
 

7325
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,510
contributing
with people at red hat and a few other

7326
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
with people at red hat and a few other
 

7327
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,270
with people at red hat and a few other
places but the majority of the hackers

7328
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:49,280
places but the majority of the hackers
 

7329
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:50,470
places but the majority of the hackers
were employed by netscape

7330
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:50,480
were employed by netscape
 

7331
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:52,149
were employed by netscape
but a lot of them at that point had had

7332
01:51:52,149 --> 01:51:52,159
but a lot of them at that point had had
 

7333
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:54,149
but a lot of them at that point had had
come from the community and others got

7334
01:51:54,149 --> 01:51:54,159
come from the community and others got
 

7335
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:55,750
come from the community and others got
the community and wanted to work with it

7336
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:55,760
the community and wanted to work with it
 

7337
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:57,350
the community and wanted to work with it
it was really the weakest engineers at

7338
01:51:57,350 --> 01:51:57,360
it was really the weakest engineers at
 

7339
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,430
it was really the weakest engineers at
netscape who didn't like mozilla and

7340
01:51:59,430 --> 01:51:59,440
netscape who didn't like mozilla and
 

7341
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:01,030
netscape who didn't like mozilla and
didn't like the the crucible of

7342
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:01,040
didn't like the the crucible of
 

7343
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,870
didn't like the the crucible of
competing with the the better

7344
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:02,880
competing with the the better
 

7345
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,790
competing with the the better
uh the programmers so if the project is

7346
01:52:04,790 --> 01:52:04,800
uh the programmers so if the project is
 

7347
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,950
uh the programmers so if the project is
good enough it will rise the phoenix

7348
01:52:06,950 --> 01:52:06,960
good enough it will rise the phoenix
 

7349
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:08,070
good enough it will rise the phoenix
will rise out of the

7350
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:08,080
will rise out of the
 

7351
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,669
will rise out of the
that's exactly right and so we had this

7352
01:52:09,669 --> 01:52:09,679
that's exactly right and so we had this
 

7353
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:11,270
that's exactly right and so we had this
this mozilla code base that was getting

7354
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:11,280
this mozilla code base that was getting
 

7355
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:12,070
this mozilla code base that was getting
better in fact

7356
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:12,080
better in fact
 

7357
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,669
better in fact
i think at some point in 2002 when we

7358
01:52:13,669 --> 01:52:13,679
i think at some point in 2002 when we
 

7359
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:16,390
i think at some point in 2002 when we
declared mozilla 1-0 we i

7360
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:16,400
declared mozilla 1-0 we i
 

7361
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,470
declared mozilla 1-0 we i
engineered a road map that successively

7363
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,990
engineered a road map that successively
through similar sort of six-week

like we all do with browser releases

7368
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:22,880
like we all do with browser releases
 

7369
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,109
like we all do with browser releases
nowadays chrome does and firefox

7370
01:52:25,109 --> 01:52:25,119
nowadays chrome does and firefox
 

7371

nowadays chrome does and firefox
um braved us three weeks we we we got to

7372
01:52:28,229 --> 01:52:28,239
um braved us three weeks we we we got to
 

7373
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:29,510
um braved us three weeks we we we got to
a point where we said you know what

7374
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:29,520
a point where we said you know what
 

7375
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,270
a point where we said you know what
it doesn't suck this is like the 1-0

7376
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:31,280
it doesn't suck this is like the 1-0
 

7377
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,550
it doesn't suck this is like the 1-0
that you want

7378
01:52:32,550 --> 01:52:32,560
that you want
 

7379
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:34,310
that you want
to release because if you hold it back

7380
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:34,320
to release because if you hold it back
 

7381
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:35,750
to release because if you hold it back
any longer to polish it you're denying

7382
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:35,760
any longer to polish it you're denying
 

7383
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:37,430
any longer to polish it you're denying
others the ability to use it so like pro

7384
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:37,440
others the ability to use it so like pro
 

7385

layout engine
 

7391
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,990
layout engine
and mozilla 1 0 was like a netscape

7392
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:46,000
and mozilla 1 0 was like a netscape
 

7393

01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:50,480
gotten male people to reintegrate mail
 

7397
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:51,669
gotten male people to reintegrate mail

did i have tabs it had tabs because all

8040
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:31,360
did i have tabs it had tabs because all
 

8041
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:32,790
did i have tabs it had tabs because all
browsers had tabs at this point

8042
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:32,800
browsers had tabs at this point
 

8043
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:35,830
browsers had tabs at this point
and it had this

8044
02:02:35,830 --> 02:02:35,840
and it had this
 

8045
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:37,430
and it had this
software fault isolation i mentioned it

8046
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:37,440
software fault isolation i mentioned it
 

8047
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:40,550
software fault isolation i mentioned it
was through process isolation so

8048
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:40,560
was through process isolation so
 

8049
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,629
was through process isolation so
in theory each tab has its own operating

8050
02:02:42,629 --> 02:02:42,639
in theory each tab has its own operating
 

8051
02:02:42,639 --> 02:02:44,149
in theory each tab has its own operating
system process and so

8052
02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:44,159
system process and so
 

8053
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,550
system process and so
what's going to take your tab down well

8054
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:46,560
what's going to take your tab down well

8074
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:03,119
of chrome which is just this bare-bones
 

8075
02:03:03,119 --> 02:03:04,070

tab browser

8076
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:04,080
tab browser
 

8077
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:05,830
tab browser
they loaded a site with a known flash

8078
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:05,840
they loaded a site with a known flash
 

8079
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:07,589
they loaded a site with a known flash
volume and then suddenly

8080
02:03:07,589 --> 02:03:07,599
volume and then suddenly
 

8081
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:09,189
volume and then suddenly
flash crashes and everyone expected the

8082
02:03:09,189 --> 02:03:09,199
flash crashes and everyone expected the
 

8083
02:03:09,199 --> 02:03:10,709
flash crashes and everyone expected the
whole browser to go down

8084
02:03:10,709 --> 02:03:10,719
whole browser to go down
 

8085
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:12,310
whole browser to go down
but instead you got this little sad face

8086
02:03:12,310 --> 02:03:12,320
but instead you got this little sad face
 

8087
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:13,910
but instead you got this little sad face
in the tab and you could reload it and

8088
02:03:13,910 --> 02:03:13,920
in the tab and you could reload it and
 

8089
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:14,629
in the tab and you could reload it and
there it is again

8090
02:03:14,629 --> 02:03:14,639
there it is again
 

8091
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:16,709
there it is again
so this was this was a an improvement it

security stuff but they ended up
 

8107
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:32,149
security stuff but they ended up
simplifying it to this process isolation

8108
02:03:32,149 --> 02:03:32,159
simplifying it to this process isolation
 

8109
02:03:32,159 --> 02:03:35,830
simplifying it to this process isolation
and um it was good and firefox didn't

8110

02:03:42,629 --> 02:03:42,639
security bugs so we knew chrome was
 

8117
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:43,990
security bugs so we knew chrome was
coming but it took two more years to

8118
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:44,000
coming but it took two more years to
 

8119
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,950

02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:53,520
firefox was still growing firefox
 

8131
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,510
firefox was still growing firefox
grew i think until 2011. that was when

8132
02:03:55,510 --> 02:03:55,520
grew i think until 2011. that was when
 

8133
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,790
grew i think until 2011. that was when
it peaked

8134
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:56,800
it peaked
 

8135
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,030
it peaked
and as it started falling it was because

8136
02:03:59,030 --> 02:03:59,040
and as it started falling it was because
 

8137
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,270
and as it started falling it was because

02:12:10,069 --> 02:12:10,079
you can get a request with the last
 

8675
02:12:10,079 --> 02:12:11,750
you can get a request with the last
cookie value and the response updates it

8676
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:11,760
cookie value and the response updates it
 

8677
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,109
cookie value and the response updates it
that's a tracking mechanism and that's

8678
02:12:13,109 --> 02:12:13,119
that's a tracking mechanism and that's
 

8679
02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:14,790
that's a tracking mechanism and that's
why you don't even need images to track

8680
02:12:14,790 --> 02:12:14,800
why you don't even need images to track
 

8681
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:16,310
why you don't even need images to track
now you just use scripts

8682
02:12:16,310 --> 02:12:16,320
now you just use scripts
 

8683
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:19,830
now you just use scripts
so this whole tracking economy evolved

8684
02:12:19,830 --> 02:12:19,840
so this whole tracking economy evolved
 

8685
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,550
so this whole tracking economy evolved
and it it

8686
02:12:20,550 --> 02:12:20,560
and it it
 

8687
02:12:20,560 --> 02:12:23,189
and it it
it depended on these accidents of the

8688
02:12:23,189 --> 02:12:23,199
it depended on these accidents of the
 

8689
02:12:23,199 --> 02:12:25,350
it depended on these accidents of the
90s these unintended consequences well

8690
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:25,360
90s these unintended consequences well
 

8691
02:12:25,360 --> 02:12:25,990
90s these unintended consequences well
it created

8692
02:12:25,990 --> 02:12:26,000
it created
 

8693
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:27,270
it created
some of the richest companies in the

8694
02:12:27,270 --> 02:12:27,280
some of the richest companies in the
 

8695
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:28,709
some of the richest companies in the
world right i mean it's the social media

8696
02:12:28,709 --> 02:12:28,719
world right i mean it's the social media
 

8697
02:12:28,719 --> 02:12:30,950
world right i mean it's the social media
all i got was t-shirts

8698
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:30,960
all i got was t-shirts
 

8699
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:33,990
all i got was t-shirts
all i got is this crappy t-shirt yeah

8700
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:34,000
all i got is this crappy t-shirt yeah
 

8701
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,430
all i got is this crappy t-shirt yeah
i mean uh so that's that's the

8702
02:12:37,430 --> 02:12:37,440
i mean uh so that's that's the
 

8703
02:12:37,440 --> 02:12:39,189
i mean uh so that's that's the
fundamental problem the world is facing

8704
02:12:39,189 --> 02:12:39,199
fundamental problem the world is facing
 

8705
02:12:39,199 --> 02:12:40,229
fundamental problem the world is facing
now they're looking at

8706
02:12:40,229 --> 02:12:40,239
now they're looking at
 

8707
02:12:40,239 --> 02:12:42,069
now they're looking at
what social media has created and

8708
02:12:42,069 --> 02:12:42,079
what social media has created and
 

8709
02:12:42,079 --> 02:12:43,589
what social media has created and
they're looking

8710
02:12:43,589 --> 02:12:43,599
they're looking
 

8711
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:45,830
they're looking
at and like a world is looking at itself

8712
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:45,840
at and like a world is looking at itself
 

8713
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:47,189
at and like a world is looking at itself
in the mirror

8714
02:12:47,189 --> 02:12:47,199
in the mirror
 

8715
02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:49,589
in the mirror
and seeing that privacy is actually

8716
02:12:49,589 --> 02:12:49,599
and seeing that privacy is actually
 

8717
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:50,950
and seeing that privacy is actually
something

8718
02:12:50,950 --> 02:12:50,960
something
 

8719
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:53,430
something
supposed to like a nice thing to have

8720
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:53,440
supposed to like a nice thing to have
 

8721
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:55,589
supposed to like a nice thing to have
it's something that is

8722
02:12:55,589 --> 02:12:55,599
it's something that is
 

8723
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:57,430
it's something that is
actually should be fundamental to the

8724
02:12:57,430 --> 02:12:57,440
actually should be fundamental to the
 

8725
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:59,109
actually should be fundamental to the
way we interact with the world

8726
02:12:59,109 --> 02:12:59,119
way we interact with the world
 

8727
02:12:59,119 --> 02:13:01,750
way we interact with the world
as part of our tooling and that's where

8728
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:01,760
as part of our tooling and that's where
 

8729
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:02,149
as part of our tooling and that's where
the

8730
02:13:02,149 --> 02:13:02,159
the
 

8731
02:13:02,159 --> 02:13:04,390
the
brave browser comes in and i suppose

8732
02:13:04,390 --> 02:13:04,400
brave browser comes in and i suppose
 

8733
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:05,669
brave browser comes in and i suppose
others as well are playing with this

8734
02:13:05,669 --> 02:13:05,679
others as well are playing with this
 

8735
02:13:05,679 --> 02:13:07,350
others as well are playing with this
idea but brave is at the forefront of

8736
02:13:07,350 --> 02:13:07,360
idea but brave is at the forefront of
 

8737
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:07,990
idea but brave is at the forefront of
that so

8738
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:08,000
that so
 

8739
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,470
that so
maybe can you like describe what brave

8740
02:13:10,470 --> 02:13:10,480
maybe can you like describe what brave
 

8741
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:13,350
maybe can you like describe what brave
is yes and what are its key principles

8742
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:13,360
is yes and what are its key principles
 

8743
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:15,109
is yes and what are its key principles
and uh what's broken and what is it

8744
02:13:15,109 --> 02:13:15,119
and uh what's broken and what is it
 

8745
02:13:15,119 --> 02:13:17,030
and uh what's broken and what is it
brave trying to fix so when i

8746
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:17,040
brave trying to fix so when i
 

8747
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:18,629
brave trying to fix so when i
realized that these accidents like the

8748
02:13:18,629 --> 02:13:18,639
realized that these accidents like the
 

8749
02:13:18,639 --> 02:13:20,069
realized that these accidents like the
third party cookie

8750
02:13:20,069 --> 02:13:20,079
third party cookie
 

8751
02:13:20,079 --> 02:13:21,830
third party cookie
the image or script that's tracking you

8752
02:13:21,830 --> 02:13:21,840
the image or script that's tracking you
 

8753
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:23,669
the image or script that's tracking you
or the um

8754
02:13:23,669 --> 02:13:23,679
or the um
 

8755
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:24,950
or the um
this javascripts that can do it

8756
02:13:24,950 --> 02:13:24,960
this javascripts that can do it
 

8757
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:27,270
this javascripts that can do it
invisibly now that all this stuff wasn't

8758
02:13:27,270 --> 02:13:27,280
invisibly now that all this stuff wasn't
 

8759
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:31,109
invisibly now that all this stuff wasn't
intended and that firefox had supported

8760
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:31,119
intended and that firefox had supported
 

8761
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:32,310
intended and that firefox had supported
extensions that blocked some of these

8762
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:32,320
extensions that blocked some of these
 

8763
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:33,510
extensions that blocked some of these
things i thought

8764
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:33,520
things i thought
 

8765
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:34,950
things i thought
probably we should have browsers just

8766
02:13:34,950 --> 02:13:34,960
probably we should have browsers just
 

8767
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:37,430
probably we should have browsers just
block some of these things by default

8768
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:37,440
block some of these things by default
 

8769
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:39,189
block some of these things by default
these were not intended and they're now

8770
02:13:39,189 --> 02:13:39,199
these were not intended and they're now

our friends in the federal government

9688
02:27:34,469 --> 02:27:34,479
our friends in the federal government
 

9689
02:27:34,479 --> 02:27:35,990
our friends in the federal government
are talking about requiring at some

9690
02:27:35,990 --> 02:27:36,000
are talking about requiring at some
 

9691
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,510
are talking about requiring at some
threshold knowing who that is

9692
02:27:37,510 --> 02:27:37,520
threshold knowing who that is
 

9693
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:40,389
threshold knowing who that is
so some threshold that's unreasonable

9694
02:27:40,389 --> 02:27:40,399
so some threshold that's unreasonable
 

9695
02:27:40,399 --> 02:27:41,510
so some threshold that's unreasonable
it's not that big

9696
02:27:41,510 --> 02:27:41,520
it's not that big
 

9697
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:43,030
it's not that big
um yeah yeah i don't know how this will

9698
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:43,040
um yeah yeah i don't know how this will
 

9699
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:44,870
um yeah yeah i don't know how this will
play out i think crypto's here to stay i

9700
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:44,880
play out i think crypto's here to stay i
 

9701
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:45,110
play out i think crypto's here to stay i
think

9702
02:27:45,110 --> 02:27:45,120
think
 

9703
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:46,630
think
the beauty of being able to send

9704
02:27:46,630 --> 02:27:46,640
the beauty of being able to send
 

9705
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,150
the beauty of being able to send
peer-to-peer without any bank in the

you know huge wire charge and two-day
 

9711
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,469
you know huge wire charge and two-day
delay and all that nonsense it's

9712
02:27:52,469 --> 02:27:52,479
delay and all that nonsense it's
 

9713
02:27:52,479 --> 02:27:54,230
delay and all that nonsense it's
beautiful and i've used it i love it

9714
02:27:54,230 --> 02:27:54,240
beautiful and i've used it i love it
 

9715
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:55,910
beautiful and i've used it i love it
but we're pragmatists to brave about

but we're pragmatists to brave about
 

9717
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:57,990
but we're pragmatists to brave about
crypto and we realized that anything

02:31:22,469 --> 02:31:22,479
it's just the link to an edge cache and
 

9955
02:31:22,479 --> 02:31:23,830
it's just the link to an edge cache and
there are many such edge caches we're

9956
02:31:23,830 --> 02:31:23,840
there are many such edge caches we're
 

9957
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:24,469
there are many such edge caches we're
not trying to

9958
02:31:24,469 --> 02:31:24,479
not trying to
 

9959
02:31:24,479 --> 02:31:26,469
not trying to
protect them from seeing your ip address

9960
02:31:26,469 --> 02:31:26,479
protect them from seeing your ip address
 

9961
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:28,389
protect them from seeing your ip address
it's not really feasible we could use

9962
02:31:28,389 --> 02:31:28,399
it's not really feasible we could use
 

9963
02:31:28,399 --> 02:31:29,670
it's not really feasible we could use
tor but we don't yet

9964
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:29,680
tor but we don't yet

um and some keywords about the ad so

9966
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:32,080
um and some keywords about the ad so
 

9967
02:31:32,080 --> 02:31:33,190
um and some keywords about the ad so
it's basically like

9968
02:31:33,190 --> 02:31:33,200
it's basically like
 

9969
02:31:33,200 --> 02:31:35,270
it's basically like
metadata and a link and that's what the

9970
02:31:35,270 --> 02:31:35,280
metadata and a link and that's what the
 

9971
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:36,630
metadata and a link and that's what the
catalog consists of and that's what the

9972
02:31:36,630 --> 02:31:36,640
catalog consists of and that's what the
 

9973
02:31:36,640 --> 02:31:37,429
catalog consists of and that's what the
machine learning picks

9974
02:31:37,429 --> 02:31:37,439
machine learning picks
 

9975
02:31:37,439 --> 02:31:38,950
machine learning picks
and the machine learning is learning

9976
02:31:38,950 --> 02:31:38,960
and the machine learning is learning
 

9977
02:31:38,960 --> 02:31:40,790
and the machine learning is learning
about you specifically

9978
02:31:40,790 --> 02:31:40,800
about you specifically
 

9979
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,630

02:31:46,230 --> 02:31:46,240
couldn't this possibly be like a
 

9985
02:31:46,240 --> 02:31:47,670
couldn't this possibly be like a
multi-billion dollar

9986

multi-billion dollar
 

9987
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:51,510
multi-billion dollar
is this taking on the google ad

so like what i mean one question to ask

9990
02:31:54,790 --> 02:31:54,800
so like what i mean one question to ask

so like what i mean one question to ask
there seems to be some really profound

9992
02:31:56,230 --> 02:31:56,240
there seems to be some really profound
 

9993
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,910
there seems to be some really profound
ideas here that that are

9994
02:31:57,910 --> 02:31:57,920
ideas here that that are
 

9995
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:00,230
ideas here that that are
different than what the internet has

9996
02:32:00,230 --> 02:32:00,240
different than what the internet has
 

9997
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:01,830
different than what the internet has
grown up to be

ideas underlying brave
 

10005
02:32:08,479 --> 02:32:13,110
ideas underlying brave
win out and runs 95 of the internet

10006
02:32:13,110 --> 02:32:13,120
win out and runs 95 of the internet
 

10007
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:17,110
win out and runs 95 of the internet
how does that change uh the

10008
02:32:17,110 --> 02:32:17,120
how does that change uh the
 

10009
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:18,469
how does that change uh the
what what are the major things these

10010
02:32:18,469 --> 02:32:18,479
what what are the major things these
 

10011
02:32:18,479 --> 02:32:20,150
what what are the major things these
changes about the internet so social

10012
02:32:20,150 --> 02:32:20,160
changes about the internet so social
 

10013
02:32:20,160 --> 02:32:21,750
changes about the internet so social
networks and then the creatives like

10014
02:32:21,750 --> 02:32:21,760
networks and then the creatives like
 

10015
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:23,270
networks and then the creatives like
youtube creators and all that kind of

10016
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,280
youtube creators and all that kind of
 

10017
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:24,469
youtube creators and all that kind of
stuff so let's talk about that

10018
02:32:24,469 --> 02:32:24,479
stuff so let's talk about that
 

10019
02:32:24,479 --> 02:32:26,389
stuff so let's talk about that
first of all if brave gets 95 i'm going

10020
02:32:26,389 --> 02:32:26,399
first of all if brave gets 95 i'm going
 

10021
02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:27,830
first of all if brave gets 95 i'm going
to demand a recount because i

10022
02:32:27,830 --> 02:32:27,840
to demand a recount because i
 

10023
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:30,230
to demand a recount because i
i won't believe it uh i don't know i i

10024
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:30,240
i won't believe it uh i don't know i i
 

10025
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:31,030
i won't believe it uh i don't know i i
think uh

10026
02:32:31,030 --> 02:32:31,040
think uh
 

10027
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:32,230
think uh
we're trying to put things into web

10028
02:32:32,230 --> 02:32:32,240
we're trying to put things into web
 

10029
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:34,230
we're trying to put things into web
standards that can be standardized

10030
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:34,240
standards that can be standardized
 

10031
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:35,349
standards that can be standardized
across browsers so

10032
02:32:35,349 --> 02:32:35,359
across browsers so
 

10033
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:37,590
across browsers so
the main value of brave will be the

10034
02:32:37,590 --> 02:32:37,600
the main value of brave will be the
 

10035
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:39,590
the main value of brave will be the
trust users have in us and our ability

10036
02:32:39,590 --> 02:32:39,600
trust users have in us and our ability
 

10037
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:39,910
trust users have in us and our ability
to

10038
02:32:39,910 --> 02:32:39,920
to
 

10039
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:42,950
to
give the best deal to users so 70 of the

10040
02:32:42,950 --> 02:32:42,960
give the best deal to users so 70 of the
 

10041
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:45,349
give the best deal to users so 70 of the
gross ad revenue we give to the user and

10042
02:32:45,349 --> 02:32:45,359
gross ad revenue we give to the user and
 

10043
02:32:45,359 --> 02:32:46,389
gross ad revenue we give to the user and
if they

10044
02:32:46,389 --> 02:32:46,399
if they
 

10045
02:32:46,399 --> 02:32:47,830
if they
go through that kyc process i mentioned

10046
02:32:47,830 --> 02:32:47,840
go through that kyc process i mentioned
 

10047
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:49,429
go through that kyc process i mentioned
they can take it out they can also give

10048
02:32:49,429 --> 02:32:49,439
they can take it out they can also give
 

10049
02:32:49,439 --> 02:32:50,630
they can take it out they can also give
it back they could take some out give

10050
02:32:50,630 --> 02:32:50,640
it back they could take some out give
 

10051
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:51,590
it back they could take some out give
the rest back they can

10052
02:32:51,590 --> 02:32:51,600
the rest back they can
 

10053
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:54,630
the rest back they can
add basic attention tokens to give back

10054
02:32:54,630 --> 02:32:54,640
add basic attention tokens to give back
 

10055
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:56,150
add basic attention tokens to give back
some of them turn off the ads because

10056
02:32:56,150 --> 02:32:56,160
some of them turn off the ads because
 

10057
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:57,750
some of them turn off the ads because
you just don't like ads but they put in

10058
02:32:57,750 --> 02:32:57,760
you just don't like ads but they put in
 

10059
02:32:57,760 --> 02:32:58,790
you just don't like ads but they put in
twenty dollars a month

10060
02:32:58,790 --> 02:32:58,800
twenty dollars a month
 

10061
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:00,710
twenty dollars a month
so i believe zuko of zcashframe does

10062
02:33:00,710 --> 02:33:00,720
so i believe zuko of zcashframe does
 

10063
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:02,309
so i believe zuko of zcashframe does
that and that's very generous because

10064
02:33:02,309 --> 02:33:02,319
that and that's very generous because
 

10065
02:33:02,319 --> 02:33:04,389
that and that's very generous because
the browser is just anonymously based on

his browsing
sort of keeping score on how much time

10070
02:33:06,870 --> 02:33:06,880
sort of keeping score on how much time
 

10071

10076
02:33:14,550 --> 02:33:14,560
like getting a domain certificate
 

10077
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:16,070
like getting a domain certificate
fashion they can get paid

10078
02:33:16,070 --> 02:33:16,080
fashion they can get paid
 

10079
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:19,110
fashion they can get paid
they can get part of his 20 a month

10080
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:19,120
they can get part of his 20 a month
 

10081
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:21,429
they can get part of his 20 a month
so that vision could go big and if it

10082
02:33:21,429 --> 02:33:21,439
so that vision could go big and if it
 

10083
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:22,870
so that vision could go big and if it
does i hope it's across multiple

02:33:22,870 --> 02:33:22,880
does i hope it's across multiple

does i hope it's across multiple
browsers i don't

10086
02:33:23,830 --> 02:33:23,840
browsers i don't
 

10087
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:26,309
browsers i don't
know that uh they'll all compete well on

10088
02:33:26,309 --> 02:33:26,319
know that uh they'll all compete well on
 

10089
02:33:26,319 --> 02:33:27,429
know that uh they'll all compete well on
the quality of the ads

10090
02:33:27,429 --> 02:33:27,439
the quality of the ads
 

10091
02:33:27,439 --> 02:33:28,950
the quality of the ads
the quality of the ad blocking and

the quality of the ad blocking and
 

10093
02:33:28,960 --> 02:33:30,790
the quality of the ad blocking and

tracking protection those those are
 

10095
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:31,990
tracking protection those those are
subject to competition it'll take a

10096
02:33:31,990 --> 02:33:32,000
subject to competition it'll take a
 

10097
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,190
subject to competition it'll take a
while to standardize them

10098
02:33:33,190 --> 02:33:33,200
while to standardize them
 

10099
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:35,190
while to standardize them
but i think that would be a better world

10100
02:33:35,190 --> 02:33:35,200
but i think that would be a better world
 

10101
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:38,070
but i think that would be a better world
it would have less counterparty risk

10102
02:33:38,070 --> 02:33:38,080
it would have less counterparty risk
 

10103
02:33:38,080 --> 02:33:39,670
it would have less counterparty risk
fewer fee takers in the middle really

10104
02:33:39,670 --> 02:33:39,680
fewer fee takers in the middle really
 

10105
02:33:39,680 --> 02:33:42,150
fewer fee takers in the middle really
just the browser we're taking 30 percent

10106
02:33:42,150 --> 02:33:42,160
just the browser we're taking 30 percent
 

10107
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:44,630
just the browser we're taking 30 percent
um sort of the app app store split and

10108
02:33:44,630 --> 02:33:44,640
um sort of the app app store split and
 

10109
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:46,309
um sort of the app app store split and
if we get bigger maybe we can take even

three percent and we did it in a way
 

10139
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,550
three percent and we did it in a way
that was

10140
02:34:16,550 --> 02:34:16,560
that was
 

10141
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:17,910
that was

02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:23,510
do you think it could be standardized
across browsers can like uh

10148
02:34:23,510 --> 02:34:23,520
across browsers can like uh

internet explorer come in again and and
 

10151
02:34:25,439 --> 02:34:27,910
internet explorer come in again and and
uh yeah protocols are easy to copy and

10152
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:27,920
uh yeah protocols are easy to copy and
 

10153
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:29,510
uh yeah protocols are easy to copy and
that they're meant to be interoperable

10154

that they're meant to be interoperable
so

10156
02:34:29,990 --> 02:34:30,000
so
 

10157
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,990
so
it's there's a risk there and the loyal

it's there's a risk there and the loyal
 

10159

because of that distribution power you

10164
02:34:36,230 --> 02:34:36,240
because of that distribution power you
 

10165
02:34:36,240 --> 02:34:37,830
because of that distribution power you
might end up getting stomped

10166
02:34:37,830 --> 02:34:37,840
might end up getting stomped
 

10167

02:48:41,110 --> 02:48:41,120
and rush him well that's probably the
 

11137
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:42,630
and rush him well that's probably the
only way to do it now yeah

11138

but it still a place do you think it's
 

11141
02:48:45,279 --> 02:48:46,790
but it still a place do you think it's
possible that silicon valley is still a
