1009
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,630
first for sure because my style at the
time was basically a rip-off version of

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
time was basically a rip-off version of

at the time was if it's bothering old

1030
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:35,400
at the time was if it's bothering old
 

1031

a reason yeah it's probably effective
 

1035
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,690
a reason yeah it's probably effective
and that's the path I took to sort of

1036
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:41,700
and that's the path I took to sort of
 

1037
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,150
and that's the path I took to sort of
try to rip off their moves and then

2026
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:39,420
don't work leglocks don't work but
 

2027
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,569
don't work leglocks don't work but
unfortunately age gets the best of all

2028
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:41,579
unfortunately age gets the best of all
 

2029
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:43,609
unfortunately age gets the best of all
of us I think he had some mileage on

2030
00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:43,619
of us I think he had some mileage on
 

2031
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,829
of us I think he had some mileage on
those ligaments yeah and the bone I

2032
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:45,839
those ligaments yeah and the bone I
 

2033
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,450
those ligaments yeah and the bone I
guess yeah so it's actually what the the

2034
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:47,460
guess yeah so it's actually what the the
 

2035
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,210
guess yeah so it's actually what the the
bone yeah his ankle like disconnected

2036
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:50,220
bone yeah his ankle like disconnected
 

2037
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,250
bone yeah his ankle like disconnected
from the tibia and the fibula but the

2038
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:52,260
from the tibia and the fibula but the
 

2039
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,410
from the tibia and the fibula but the
fibula definitely snaps pretty bad

2040
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:54,420
fibula definitely snaps pretty bad
 

2041
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,510
fibula definitely snaps pretty bad
though nice facility

2042
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:56,520
though nice facility
 

2043
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,490
though nice facility
the Dynamics of that okay anyway they

2044
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:58,500
the Dynamics of that okay anyway they
 

2045
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,990
the Dynamics of that okay anyway they
went into overtime what happened in

2046
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
went into overtime what happened in
 

2047
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,790
went into overtime what happened in
overtime okay we're having overtime

2048
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:01,800
overtime okay we're having overtime
 

2049
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,910
overtime okay we're having overtime
let's see trying to hang oh okay I go

2050
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:04,920
let's see trying to hang oh okay I go
 

2051
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,910
let's see trying to hang oh okay I go
defense first uh whistle blows I'm able

2052
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:07,920
defense first uh whistle blows I'm able
 

2053
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,210
defense first uh whistle blows I'm able
to escape in like 17 seconds and then

2054
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:11,220
to escape in like 17 seconds and then
 

2055
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,609
to escape in like 17 seconds and then
immediately after I go on his back and

2056
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:13,619
immediately after I go on his back and
 

2057
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,250
immediately after I go on his back and
he gets out in exactly 17 seconds I'm

2058
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:16,260
he gets out in exactly 17 seconds I'm
 

2059
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,690
he gets out in exactly 17 seconds I'm
like [\h__\h] all right I thought I had a

2060
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:17,700
like [\h__\h] all right I thought I had a
 

2061
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,630
like [\h__\h] all right I thought I had a
good start and then uh he gets on my

2062
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
good start and then uh he gets on my
 

2063
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,450
good start and then uh he gets on my
back right after that and uh he's able

2064
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:23,460
back right after that and uh he's able
 

2065
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,829
back right after that and uh he's able
to ride me out for pretty much the

2066
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:24,839
to ride me out for pretty much the
 

2067
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,030
to ride me out for pretty much the
entire round

2068
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:26,040
entire round
 

2069
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,790
entire round
after that he uh I got back on his back

2070
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:28,800
after that he uh I got back on his back
 

2071
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,950
after that he uh I got back on his back
he escapes him maybe like a minute and

2072
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:30,960
he escapes him maybe like a minute and
 

2073
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,990
he escapes him maybe like a minute and
some change uh I think where I went

2074
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,000
some change uh I think where I went
 

2075
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,849
some change uh I think where I went
wrong in the overtime is I should have

2076
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:34,859
wrong in the overtime is I should have
 

2077
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,530
wrong in the overtime is I should have
went I should have been less adamant

2078
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:36,540
went I should have been less adamant
 

2079
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,750
went I should have been less adamant
about chasing the submission and more

2080
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:38,760
about chasing the submission and more
 

2081
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,810
about chasing the submission and more
aware of collecting time if I kind of uh

2082
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:41,820
aware of collecting time if I kind of uh
 

2083
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,849
aware of collecting time if I kind of uh
diverted my attention towards acquiring

2084
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:43,859
diverted my attention towards acquiring
 

2085
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:45,950
diverted my attention towards acquiring
you know time on the clock it would have

2086

you know time on the clock it would have
been you know more my favor but yeah uh

that the ebi rules it's an interesting
 

2129
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,690
that the ebi rules it's an interesting
rule structure where the overtime you

2130
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:32,700
rule structure where the overtime you
 

2131
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,150
rule structure where the overtime you
put yourself in a in like the worst

2132
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:35,160
put yourself in a in like the worst
 

2133
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,130
put yourself in a in like the worst
possible position and the task is to

2134
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:37,140
possible position and the task is to
 

2135
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,450
possible position and the task is to
escape and then the other person gets

2136
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:38,460
escape and then the other person gets
 

2137
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,190
escape and then the other person gets
the same thing uh what do you guys think

2138
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,200
the same thing uh what do you guys think
 

2139
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,310
the same thing uh what do you guys think
about that rule set I I like it just

2140
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:43,320
about that rule set I I like it just
 

2141
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,750
about that rule set I I like it just
because

2142
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:44,760
because
 

2143
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,910
because
I first of all I don't I don't like the

2144
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:46,920
I first of all I don't I don't like the
 

2145
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,589
I first of all I don't I don't like the
idea of having to put somebody on my

2146
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:48,599
idea of having to put somebody on my
 

2147
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:51,349
idea of having to put somebody on my
back but I do like the definitive answer

2148
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:51,359
back but I do like the definitive answer
 

2149
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,510
back but I do like the definitive answer
in the match like either you escaped in

2150
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,520
in the match like either you escaped in
 

2151
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,849
in the match like either you escaped in
time or you got you know written out so

2152
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:55,859
time or you got you know written out so
 

2153
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,190
time or you got you know written out so
the absolutely like you have a you get

2154
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,200
the absolutely like you have a you get
 

2155
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,870
the absolutely like you have a you get
to the final winner that's great I'd

2156
00:38:59,870 --> 00:38:59,880
to the final winner that's great I'd
 

2157
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,430
to the final winner that's great I'd
much rather have that than a close

2158
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:01,440
much rather have that than a close
 

2159
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,589
much rather have that than a close
decision and it kind of goes other way

2160
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
decision and it kind of goes other way
 

2161
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,930
decision and it kind of goes other way
what about you I mean honestly there's

2162
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:05,940
what about you I mean honestly there's
 

2163
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,730
what about you I mean honestly there's
all the different rules when I look at

2164
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:07,740
all the different rules when I look at
 

2165
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,530
all the different rules when I look at
the Rose sets I just try to think of

2166
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:09,540
the Rose sets I just try to think of
 

2167
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,849
the Rose sets I just try to think of
what rule said I could beat that

2168
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:10,859
what rule said I could beat that
 

2169
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,770
what rule said I could beat that
individual in and I sort of geared

2170
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:12,780
individual in and I sort of geared
 

2171
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,510
individual in and I sort of geared
myself towards that

2172
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:14,520
myself towards that
 

2173
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,490
myself towards that
that's really the strategy there I think

2174
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:16,500
that's really the strategy there I think
 

2175
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,770
that's really the strategy there I think
there's some guys that like uh that

2176
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:18,780
there's some guys that like uh that
 

2177
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,569
there's some guys that like uh that
stall a lot that you would love to have

2178
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:20,579
stall a lot that you would love to have
 

2179

3109
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,049
how much is the enhancement I guess is
the question how much is is muscle

3110
00:56:21,049 --> 00:56:21,059
the question how much is is muscle
 

3111
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:22,849
the question how much is is muscle
valued right like if you're a question

valued right like if you're a question
 

3113
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:24,109
valued right like if you're a question
if you're doing gear and you're not

3114
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:24,119
if you're doing gear and you're not
 

3115
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:25,730
if you're doing gear and you're not
changing weight that much like maybe it

3116
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:25,740
changing weight that much like maybe it
 

3117
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,410
changing weight that much like maybe it
helps you a little bit but if you know

3118
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:27,420
helps you a little bit but if you know
 

3119
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,349
helps you a little bit but if you know
you're gaining 50 60 pounds of pure

3120
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:30,359
you're gaining 50 60 pounds of pure
 

3121
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:32,210
you're gaining 50 60 pounds of pure
muscle and it's like that's a huge

3122
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:32,220
muscle and it's like that's a huge
 

3123
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:35,150
muscle and it's like that's a huge
enhancement that's another human this

3124
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:35,160
enhancement that's another human this
 

3125
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:38,630
enhancement that's another human this
this muscle a small human yeah uh does

3126
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:38,640
this muscle a small human yeah uh does
 

3127
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,549
this muscle a small human yeah uh does
does muscle matter in Jiu Jitsu I guess

3128
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
does muscle matter in Jiu Jitsu I guess
 

3129
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,589
does muscle matter in Jiu Jitsu I guess
is the question is it possible that it

3130
00:56:42,589 --> 00:56:42,599
is the question is it possible that it
 

3131
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,569
is the question is it possible that it
gets in the way I say muscle matters but

3132
00:56:44,569 --> 00:56:44,579
gets in the way I say muscle matters but
 

3133
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:46,910
gets in the way I say muscle matters but
technique matters more I also think that

3134
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:46,920
technique matters more I also think that
 

3135
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,430
technique matters more I also think that
it it'll help you develop technique as

3136
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
it it'll help you develop technique as
 

3137
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,170
it it'll help you develop technique as
well because obviously you know

3138
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:51,180
well because obviously you know
 

3139
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,510
well because obviously you know
testosterone helps with recovery rate so

3140
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:53,520
testosterone helps with recovery rate so
 

3141
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,910
testosterone helps with recovery rate so
if you're on gear you're able to train a

3142
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:55,920
if you're on gear you're able to train a
 

3143
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,250
if you're on gear you're able to train a
lot more now that being said if you're

3144
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:58,260
lot more now that being said if you're
 

3145
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,290
lot more now that being said if you're
not able to learn obviously it's not

3146
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:00,300
not able to learn obviously it's not
 

3147
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,670
not able to learn obviously it's not
going to help in that aspect but if

3148
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,680
going to help in that aspect but if
 

3149
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,870
going to help in that aspect but if
you're somebody that knows how to learn

3150
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:02,880
you're somebody that knows how to learn
 

3151
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,730
you're somebody that knows how to learn
and get good at Jiu Jitsu and then you

3152
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:04,740
and get good at Jiu Jitsu and then you
 

3153
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,650
and get good at Jiu Jitsu and then you
add gear on top of that you're able to

3154
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:06,660
add gear on top of that you're able to
 

3155
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,270
add gear on top of that you're able to
do significantly more sessions

3156
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:08,280
do significantly more sessions
 

3157
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,430
do significantly more sessions
throughout the week okay and by the way

3158
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:10,440
throughout the week okay and by the way
 

3159
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,950
throughout the week okay and by the way
gears there is steroids yeah

3160
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
gears there is steroids yeah
 

3161
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,950
gears there is steroids yeah
I also think that you don't have to be

3162
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:14,960
I also think that you don't have to be
 

3163
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,230
I also think that you don't have to be
as consistent uh in like your sleep and

3164
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:18,240
as consistent uh in like your sleep and
 

3165
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,849
as consistent uh in like your sleep and
your food and stuff if you're if you're

3166
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:19,859
your food and stuff if you're if you're
 

3167
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:22,370
your food and stuff if you're if you're
on gear you have a little bit of leeway

3168
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:22,380
on gear you have a little bit of leeway
 

3169
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,770
on gear you have a little bit of leeway
um but I mean being consistent in your

3170
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:24,780
um but I mean being consistent in your
 

3171
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,210
um but I mean being consistent in your
diet and your sleep definitely would

3172
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:26,220
diet and your sleep definitely would
 

3173
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,250
diet and your sleep definitely would
would help you know the process since

3174
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:28,260
would help you know the process since
 

3175
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:31,309
would help you know the process since
you use most steroids of any athlete

3176
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:31,319
you use most steroids of any athlete
 

3177
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:33,549
you use most steroids of any athlete
I've ever met do you think steroids

3178
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:33,559
I've ever met do you think steroids
 

3179
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:37,010
I've ever met do you think steroids
Jiu Jitsu oh man I think obviously it

3180
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:37,020
Jiu Jitsu oh man I think obviously it
 

3181
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,510
Jiu Jitsu oh man I think obviously it
helps recovery in your ability to train

3182
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:38,520
helps recovery in your ability to train
 

3183
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,309
helps recovery in your ability to train
well but I think some I've seen some

3184
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:40,319
well but I think some I've seen some
 

3185
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,530
well but I think some I've seen some
guys go on steroids and then suddenly

3186
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:42,540
guys go on steroids and then suddenly
 

3187
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,569
guys go on steroids and then suddenly
they feel like the Incredible Hulk and

3188
00:57:44,569 --> 00:57:44,579
they feel like the Incredible Hulk and
 

3189
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:46,790
they feel like the Incredible Hulk and
now in the training room they start to

3190
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:46,800
now in the training room they start to
 

3191
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,589
now in the training room they start to
rely more on strength than the

3192
00:57:48,589 --> 00:57:48,599
rely more on strength than the
 

3193
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:51,049
rely more on strength than the
techniques they had and actually in some

3194
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:51,059
techniques they had and actually in some
 

3195
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:53,990
techniques they had and actually in some
respect Hinduism and make some gas more

3196
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,000
respect Hinduism and make some gas more
 

3197
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,490
respect Hinduism and make some gas more
in competition because then they're

3198
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:55,500
in competition because then they're
 

3199
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,250
in competition because then they're
using more of the muscle they never used

3200
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:58,260
using more of the muscle they never used
 

3201
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,329
using more of the muscle they never used
to have

3202
00:57:59,329 --> 00:57:59,339
to have
 

3203
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:02,270
to have
so you've implied that you're a natural

3204
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:02,280
so you've implied that you're a natural
 

3205
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,710
so you've implied that you're a natural

shouldn't be that big of a deal in
 

3247
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,109
shouldn't be that big of a deal in
retrospect because he kind of admitted

3248
00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:51,119
retrospect because he kind of admitted
 

3249
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,630
retrospect because he kind of admitted
it and whatnot previously

3250
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:53,640
it and whatnot previously
 

3251
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,970
it and whatnot previously
um so it's uh yeah I just kind of felt

3252
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:55,980

3561
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:41,390
opened it up yet but it'll be
interesting to see I mean I I feel like

3562
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:41,400
interesting to see I mean I I feel like

your higher belts they really understand

3564
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:44,599
your higher belts they really understand
 

3565
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:47,750
your higher belts they really understand
what the training room is you know what

3566
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:47,760
what the training room is you know what
 

3567
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,670
what the training room is you know what
I mean wipeouts early they're trying to

3568
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:49,680
I mean wipeouts early they're trying to
 

3569
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,109
I mean wipeouts early they're trying to
find their place in the gym could be

3570
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
find their place in the gym could be
 

3571
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,210
find their place in the gym could be
kind of awkward and stuff in that

3572
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:53,220
kind of awkward and stuff in that
 

3573
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,770
kind of awkward and stuff in that
environment so I think obviously those

3575
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,750
environment so I think obviously those

if you were to optimize the first six
months of a of a beginner there's a lot

3712
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:08,520
months of a of a beginner there's a lot
 

3713
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,069
months of a of a beginner there's a lot
of people who listen to this and haven't

3714
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:10,079
of people who listen to this and haven't
 

3715
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,750
of people who listen to this and haven't
tried they've been curious I have a lot

3716
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:11,760
tried they've been curious I have a lot
 

3717
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,370
tried they've been curious I have a lot
of friends who haven't who are like

3718
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:13,380
of friends who haven't who are like
 

3719
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,809
of friends who haven't who are like
you're just too curious they're

3720
01:07:14,809 --> 01:07:14,819
you're just too curious they're
 

3721
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:16,250
you're just too curious they're
constantly looking for an excuse to

3722
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:16,260
constantly looking for an excuse to
 

3723
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:19,670
constantly looking for an excuse to
start I think it's just got to be as

3724
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:19,680
start I think it's just got to be as
 

3725
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,069
start I think it's just got to be as
simple as possible you know like we

3726
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:22,079
simple as possible you know like we
 

3727
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,809
simple as possible you know like we
shouldn't be teaching more advanced

3728
01:07:23,809 --> 01:07:23,819
shouldn't be teaching more advanced
 

3729
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:25,609
shouldn't be teaching more advanced
movements I mean obviously in the grand

3730
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:25,619
movements I mean obviously in the grand
 

3731
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:27,950
movements I mean obviously in the grand
schema thinks this highly Advanced

3732
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:27,960
schema thinks this highly Advanced
 

3733
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,510
schema thinks this highly Advanced
Techniques and then they're slightly

3734
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:29,520
Techniques and then they're slightly
 

3735
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,210
Techniques and then they're slightly
Advanced and I think trying to teach

3736
01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:32,220
Advanced and I think trying to teach
 

3737
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,730
Advanced and I think trying to teach
those guys real specific positions even

3738
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:34,740
those guys real specific positions even
 

3739
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:38,150
those guys real specific positions even
like real specific types of God it's

3740
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:38,160
like real specific types of God it's
 

3741
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,910
like real specific types of God it's
just beyond them I think the best way to

3742
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:40,920
just beyond them I think the best way to
 

3743
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,710
just beyond them I think the best way to
learn is through problem solving and I

3744
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:42,720
learn is through problem solving and I
 

3745
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,329
learn is through problem solving and I
think if you show the technique before

3746
01:07:44,329 --> 01:07:44,339
think if you show the technique before
 

3747
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:46,670
think if you show the technique before
they've discovered that problem

3748
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:46,680
they've discovered that problem
 

3749
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,789
they've discovered that problem
the learning is sort of held back so I

3750
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:49,799
the learning is sort of held back so I
 

3751
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:51,410
the learning is sort of held back so I
like the idea of using

3752
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:51,420
like the idea of using
 

3753
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,329
like the idea of using
kids style games

3754
01:07:53,329 --> 01:07:53,339
kids style games
 

3755
01:07:53,339 --> 01:07:56,089
kids style games
to show them a problem and then use the

3756
01:07:56,089 --> 01:07:56,099
to show them a problem and then use the
 

3757
01:07:56,099 --> 01:07:58,370
to show them a problem and then use the
techniques to fix the problems they've

3758
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:58,380
techniques to fix the problems they've
 

3759
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,990
techniques to fix the problems they've
just discovered I think that's the best

3760
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:00,000
just discovered I think that's the best
 

3761
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,789
just discovered I think that's the best
way to learn can you give an example of

3762
01:08:01,789 --> 01:08:01,799
way to learn can you give an example of
 

3763
01:08:01,799 --> 01:08:03,470
way to learn can you give an example of
a problem to show them before you give

3764
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:03,480
a problem to show them before you give
 

3765
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,789
a problem to show them before you give
them the techniques like what are we

3766
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:04,799
them the techniques like what are we
 

3767
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:05,870
them the techniques like what are we
talking about all right so say you

3768
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:05,880
talking about all right so say you
 

3769
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,210
talking about all right so say you
wanted to teach uh posture in wrestling

3770
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:08,220
wanted to teach uh posture in wrestling
 

3771
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,190
wanted to teach uh posture in wrestling
you could create a game where one guy

3772
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:10,200
you could create a game where one guy
 

3773
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,069
you could create a game where one guy
the game might be get to a leg or get to

3774
01:08:13,069 --> 01:08:13,079
the game might be get to a leg or get to
 

3775
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:15,109
the game might be get to a leg or get to
two legs control the leg like super

3776
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:15,119
two legs control the leg like super
 

3777
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,150
two legs control the leg like super
simple but the rules the constraint

3778
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:17,160
simple but the rules the constraint
 

3779
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,610
simple but the rules the constraint
would be one guy is forced to keep

3780
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:19,620
would be one guy is forced to keep
 

3781
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,249
would be one guy is forced to keep
upright posture and one guy is forced

3782
01:08:22,249 --> 01:08:22,259
upright posture and one guy is forced
 

3783
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:23,930
upright posture and one guy is forced
will not force but he's allowed to keep

3784
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:23,940
will not force but he's allowed to keep
 

3785
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:26,870
will not force but he's allowed to keep
a bent at the hips lower posture and

3786
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:26,880
a bent at the hips lower posture and
 

3787
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:29,390
a bent at the hips lower posture and
obviously within the that constraint the

3788
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:29,400
obviously within the that constraint the
 

3789
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,729
obviously within the that constraint the
guy with the better posture is going to

3790
01:08:31,729 --> 01:08:31,739
guy with the better posture is going to
 

3791
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:33,890
guy with the better posture is going to
have more success he's gonna have a

3792
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:33,900
have more success he's gonna have a
 

3793
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,050
have more success he's gonna have a
better posture to secure a leg or secure

3794
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:36,060
better posture to secure a leg or secure
 

3795
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,550
better posture to secure a leg or secure
both legs and therefore you've

3796
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:37,560
both legs and therefore you've
 

3797
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,130
both legs and therefore you've
demonstrated the flaws of bad posture

3798
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:40,140
demonstrated the flaws of bad posture
 

3799
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,990
demonstrated the flaws of bad posture
without having to explain it to him

3800
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
without having to explain it to him
 

3801
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,209
without having to explain it to him
before they really tested that out okay

3802
01:08:44,209 --> 01:08:44,219
before they really tested that out okay
 

3803
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:45,650
before they really tested that out okay
and then the result of that you would

3804
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:45,660
and then the result of that you would
 

3805
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,390
and then the result of that you would
realize that the the bent over posture

3806
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:47,400
realize that the the bent over posture
 

3807
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,370
realize that the the bent over posture
is better yeah you have that aha moment

3808
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:49,380
is better yeah you have that aha moment
 

3809
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:52,430
is better yeah you have that aha moment
rather than just being having it spoken

3810
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:52,440
rather than just being having it spoken
 

3811
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:53,209
rather than just being having it spoken
to you

3812
01:08:53,209 --> 01:08:53,219
to you
 

3813
01:08:53,219 --> 01:08:56,329
to you
uh you wrote Craig I'm a big fan of

3814
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:56,339
uh you wrote Craig I'm a big fan of
 

3815
01:08:56,339 --> 01:08:57,890
uh you wrote Craig I'm a big fan of
constraint based learning I guess was

3816
01:08:57,890 --> 01:08:57,900
constraint based learning I guess was
 

3817
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,689
constraint based learning I guess was
just what you're talking about I love

3818
01:08:59,689 --> 01:08:59,699
just what you're talking about I love
 

3819
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:00,890
just what you're talking about I love
presenting beginners with a problem

3820
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:00,900
presenting beginners with a problem
 

3821
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,809
presenting beginners with a problem
before the solution like here attempt to

3822
01:09:02,809 --> 01:09:02,819
before the solution like here attempt to
 

3823
01:09:02,819 --> 01:09:04,910
before the solution like here attempt to
hold side control with no with no cues

3824
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:04,920
hold side control with no with no cues
 

3825
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,550
hold side control with no with no cues
on how then I see how the guy

3826
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:07,560
on how then I see how the guy
 

3827
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,189
on how then I see how the guy
got out and addressed issue by issue

3828
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:10,199
got out and addressed issue by issue
 

3829
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:12,349
got out and addressed issue by issue
cross face and hip control and so on

3830
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:12,359
cross face and hip control and so on
 

3831
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:14,329
cross face and hip control and so on
okay so what are some other examples

3832
01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:14,339
okay so what are some other examples
 

3833
01:09:14,339 --> 01:09:15,950
okay so what are some other examples
like side control yeah that would be

3834
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:15,960
like side control yeah that would be
 

3835
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,749
like side control yeah that would be
excellent one side control like teacher

3836
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
excellent one side control like teacher
 

3837
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,669
excellent one side control like teacher
like obviously we say oh you secure a

3838
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:19,679
like obviously we say oh you secure a
 

3839
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,470
like obviously we say oh you secure a
crossfire so they can't turn into you

3840
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:21,480
crossfire so they can't turn into you
 

3841
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,809
crossfire so they can't turn into you
much easier to have them try to hold

3842
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:23,819
much easier to have them try to hold
 

3843
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:25,249
much easier to have them try to hold
someone down without explaining what a

3844
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:25,259
someone down without explaining what a
 

3845
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:27,470
someone down without explaining what a
cross face is and then use that

3846
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:27,480
cross face is and then use that
 

3847
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,689
cross face is and then use that
technique to address the problem they've

3848
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:29,699
technique to address the problem they've
 

3849
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,849
technique to address the problem they've
just encountered so I think you could do

3850
01:09:31,849 --> 01:09:31,859
just encountered so I think you could do
 

3851
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:34,309
just encountered so I think you could do
that with a lot of areas of Jiu Jitsu

3852
01:09:34,309 --> 01:09:34,319
that with a lot of areas of Jiu Jitsu
 

3853
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,130
that with a lot of areas of Jiu Jitsu
like even more advanced say 50 50.

3854
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:37,140
like even more advanced say 50 50.
 

3855
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,229
like even more advanced say 50 50.
obviously a mirrored position where you

3856
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:39,239
obviously a mirrored position where you
 

3857
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:40,789
obviously a mirrored position where you
both have access to each other's heels

3858
01:09:40,789 --> 01:09:40,799
both have access to each other's heels
 

3859
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,530
both have access to each other's heels
most people are still out of that

3860
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:42,540
most people are still out of that
 

3861
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:43,970
most people are still out of that
position and keep their feet crossed I

3862
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:43,980
position and keep their feet crossed I
 

3863
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,289
position and keep their feet crossed I
think a great constraint for both of

3864
01:09:45,289 --> 01:09:45,299
think a great constraint for both of
 

3865
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:47,809
think a great constraint for both of
them you can't cross your feet now you

3866
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:47,819
them you can't cross your feet now you
 

3867
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:51,349
them you can't cross your feet now you
have to learn how to uh slip the heel

3868
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
have to learn how to uh slip the heel
 

3869
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:53,809
have to learn how to uh slip the heel
hook when they expose it and how to

3870
01:09:53,809 --> 01:09:53,819
hook when they expose it and how to
 

3871
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:55,729
hook when they expose it and how to
safely re-attack of your own so the

3872
01:09:55,729 --> 01:09:55,739
safely re-attack of your own so the
 

3873
01:09:55,739 --> 01:09:58,130
safely re-attack of your own so the
constraint is you can't be too defensive

3874
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:58,140
constraint is you can't be too defensive
 

3875
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,870
constraint is you can't be too defensive
in that position and I think the learn

3876
01:09:59,870 --> 01:09:59,880
in that position and I think the learn
 

3877
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:02,209
in that position and I think the learn
the rate of learning increases why do

3878
01:10:02,209 --> 01:10:02,219
the rate of learning increases why do
 

3879
01:10:02,219 --> 01:10:03,470
the rate of learning increases why do
you think the rate of learning increases

3880
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:03,480
you think the rate of learning increases
 

3881
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,610
you think the rate of learning increases
like why do you think that works because

3882
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:04,620
like why do you think that works because
 

3883
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,250
like why do you think that works because
you can counter more problems say in

3884
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:07,260
you can counter more problems say in
 

3885
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:08,689
you can counter more problems say in
that situation they're going to get you

3886
01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:08,699
that situation they're going to get you
 

3887
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:11,330
that situation they're going to get you
healed a lot more in whatever period of

3888
01:10:11,330 --> 01:10:11,340
healed a lot more in whatever period of
 

3889
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:13,669
healed a lot more in whatever period of
time you allocate the drill for than if

3890
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:13,679
time you allocate the drill for than if
 

3891
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,470
time you allocate the drill for than if
the legs across I don't think the hard

3892
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:15,480
the legs across I don't think the hard
 

3893
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,209
the legs across I don't think the hard
part splitting the legs to get to the

3894
01:10:17,209 --> 01:10:17,219
part splitting the legs to get to the
 

3895
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:18,770
part splitting the legs to get to the
submission I think the hard part

3896
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:18,780
submission I think the hard part
 

3897
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,750
submission I think the hard part
practicing control while they're trying

3898
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:20,760
practicing control while they're trying
 

3899
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,550
practicing control while they're trying
to slip it out of later stage and then

3900
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:22,560
to slip it out of later stage and then
 

3901
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,530
to slip it out of later stage and then
obviously trying to slip your heel when

3902
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:24,540
obviously trying to slip your heel when
 

3903
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:25,610
obviously trying to slip your heel when
you're in more danger also makes you

3904
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:25,620
you're in more danger also makes you
 

3905
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:27,649
you're in more danger also makes you
more comfortable in that bad position if

3906
01:10:27,649 --> 01:10:27,659
more comfortable in that bad position if
 

3907
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:29,450
more comfortable in that bad position if
you're used to doing it with open legs

3908
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:29,460
you're used to doing it with open legs
 

3909
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,790
you're used to doing it with open legs
yeah I think that probably that style of

3910
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:31,800
yeah I think that probably that style of
 

3911
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,510
yeah I think that probably that style of
teaching forces people to focus on

3912
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:35,520
teaching forces people to focus on
 

3913
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,890
teaching forces people to focus on
because it's so easy to fall into

3914
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:36,900
because it's so easy to fall into
 

3915
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,050
because it's so easy to fall into
focusing on like memorizing a particular

3916
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:39,060
focusing on like memorizing a particular
 

3917
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:41,030
focusing on like memorizing a particular

01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,120
is higher up
 

3963
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,330
is higher up
well I think the I think wrestling

3964
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:23,340
well I think the I think wrestling
 

3965
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:26,330
well I think the I think wrestling
posture is just a bit too low because

3966
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:26,340
posture is just a bit too low because
 

3967
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,130
posture is just a bit too low because
it's not necessary right if wrestlers

3968
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:28,140
it's not necessary right if wrestlers
 

3969
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,810
it's not necessary right if wrestlers
are like low enough to the ground where

3970
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:29,820
are like low enough to the ground where
 

3971
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,850
are like low enough to the ground where
your hands can touch the mat uh but in

3972
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:31,860
your hands can touch the mat uh but in
 

3973
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,709
your hands can touch the mat uh but in
Jiu Jitsu you know it's a it's kind of a

3974
01:11:33,709 --> 01:11:33,719
Jiu Jitsu you know it's a it's kind of a
 

3975
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:36,649
Jiu Jitsu you know it's a it's kind of a
mix between like wrestling and like uh

3976
01:11:36,649 --> 01:11:36,659
mix between like wrestling and like uh
 

3977
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:40,910
mix between like wrestling and like uh
Judo or or Greco-Roman wrestling so

3978
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:40,920
Judo or or Greco-Roman wrestling so
 

3979
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:43,250
Judo or or Greco-Roman wrestling so
um I think it's just a bit more more

3980
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:43,260
um I think it's just a bit more more
 

3981
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,590
um I think it's just a bit more more
relaxed and it's it's bent over but it's

3982
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:45,600
relaxed and it's it's bent over but it's
 

3983
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,870
relaxed and it's it's bent over but it's
not upright and it's also not super low

3984
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:47,880
not upright and it's also not super low
 

3985
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,610
not upright and it's also not super low
you know a bit more room for attitude

3986
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:49,620
you know a bit more room for attitude
 

3987
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,189
you know a bit more room for attitude
because obviously the uh Jiu Jitsu guy

3988
01:11:52,189 --> 01:11:52,199
because obviously the uh Jiu Jitsu guy
 

3989
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,169
because obviously the uh Jiu Jitsu guy
shot isn't going to be as athletic as

3990
01:11:54,169 --> 01:11:54,179
shot isn't going to be as athletic as
 

3991
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:56,330
shot isn't going to be as athletic as
quick as a wrestlers especially wrestle

3992
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:56,340
quick as a wrestlers especially wrestle
 

3993
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:57,770
quick as a wrestlers especially wrestle
with shoes so it actually comes down to

3994
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:57,780
with shoes so it actually comes down to
 

3995
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:59,330
with shoes so it actually comes down to
the fact that Jiu Jitsu people just on

3996
01:11:59,330 --> 01:11:59,340
the fact that Jiu Jitsu people just on
 

3997
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,130
the fact that Jiu Jitsu people just on
average even at the top level are not

3998
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:01,140
average even at the top level are not

01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,330
average even at the top level are not
good at shooting

01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:02,340
good at shooting
 

4001
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,550
good at shooting
I think so yeah I think obviously I mean

4002
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:04,560
I think so yeah I think obviously I mean
 

4003
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,649
I think so yeah I think obviously I mean
all the wrestlers in American stuff

where's this bias you know we've got

4078
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:29,820
where's this bias you know we've got
 

4079
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,610
where's this bias you know we've got
some Australian judges here I was really

4080
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:31,620
some Australian judges here I was really
 

4081
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,410
some Australian judges here I was really
hoping we give it a bias yeah

4082
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:33,420
hoping we give it a bias yeah
 

4083
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,090
hoping we give it a bias yeah
unfortunately not hopefully they lose

unfortunately not hopefully they lose
 

4085
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,890

their jobs but

4086
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:36,900
their jobs but
 

4087
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,870

everything he does is going to get a

4096
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:46,800
everything he does is going to get a
 

4097
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,689
everything he does is going to get a

4101
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,950
guy you buy us towards the underdog so
you sort of whatever the underdog does

4102
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:54,960
you sort of whatever the underdog does
 

4103
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,870
you sort of whatever the underdog does
has a bigger impact in your mind and

has a bigger impact in your mind and
 

4105
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,330
has a bigger impact in your mind and
sometimes they can bias as the fight

4106
01:13:59,330 --> 01:13:59,340

safe setting I think to do that in Jiu
 

4643
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:04,370
safe setting I think to do that in Jiu

dangerous so your approach is just as
 

4651
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:12,430
dangerous so your approach is just as
don't warm up and don't try too hard

up you know the old Gracie put the hand
but I mean that's that doesn't work it

4744
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
but I mean that's that doesn't work it
 

4745
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,790
but I mean that's that doesn't work it
hasn't worked for 20 years you know if

4746
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:49,800
hasn't worked for 20 years you know if
 

4747
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,169
hasn't worked for 20 years you know if
you look at everyone that gets up in MMA

4748
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:51,179
you look at everyone that gets up in MMA
 

4749
01:24:51,179 --> 01:24:52,910
you look at everyone that gets up in MMA
they're using Turtle to get up they're

4750
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:52,920
they're using Turtle to get up they're
 

4751
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,310
they're using Turtle to get up they're
using wrestling together you know what I

4752
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:55,320
using wrestling together you know what I
 

4753
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,830
using wrestling together you know what I
mean yeah which is uh counter to what

4754
01:24:57,830 --> 01:24:57,840
mean yeah which is uh counter to what
 

4755
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,330
mean yeah which is uh counter to what
pure Jiu Jitsu says they say don't

4756
01:24:59,330 --> 01:24:59,340
pure Jiu Jitsu says they say don't
 

4757
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:01,669
pure Jiu Jitsu says they say don't
expose the back don't ever expose your

4758
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:01,679
expose the back don't ever expose your
 

4759
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,370
expose the back don't ever expose your
back I think Jiu Jitsu is a terrible way

4760
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:04,380
back I think Jiu Jitsu is a terrible way
 

4761
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:06,950
back I think Jiu Jitsu is a terrible way
to get back to the feet because if you

4762
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:06,960
to get back to the feet because if you
 

4763
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,630
to get back to the feet because if you
were to retain guard and go half got a

4764
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:08,640
were to retain guard and go half got a
 

4765
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,610
were to retain guard and go half got a
close guard super hard positions to get

4766
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:10,620
close guard super hard positions to get
 

4767
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:11,930
close guard super hard positions to get
up you're basically putting yourself in

4768
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:11,940
up you're basically putting yourself in
 

4769
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,209
up you're basically putting yourself in
a leg tuck for wrestling so I think you

4770
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:14,219
a leg tuck for wrestling so I think you
 

4771
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:15,830
a leg tuck for wrestling so I think you
need to borrow from wrestling to learn

4772
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:15,840
need to borrow from wrestling to learn
 

4773
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,169
need to borrow from wrestling to learn
how to get up in an MMA fighter so

4774
01:25:18,169 --> 01:25:18,179
how to get up in an MMA fighter so
 

4775
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:20,390
how to get up in an MMA fighter so
basically how to safely expose your own

4776
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:20,400
basically how to safely expose your own
 

4777
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,250
basically how to safely expose your own
back while I'm not allowing them to get

4778
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:22,260
back while I'm not allowing them to get
 

4779
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:24,950
back while I'm not allowing them to get
Hooks and use that to get back up or at

4780
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:24,960
Hooks and use that to get back up or at
 

4781
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,930
Hooks and use that to get back up or at
least not allow them to get two hooks

4782
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:26,940
least not allow them to get two hooks
 

4783
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:29,330
least not allow them to get two hooks
and that applies for MMA especially for

4784
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:29,340
and that applies for MMA especially for
 

4785
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:31,610
and that applies for MMA especially for
MMA especially because obviously uh

4786
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:31,620
MMA especially because obviously uh
 

4787
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:34,370
MMA especially because obviously uh
striking is a factor but if they are

4788
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:34,380
striking is a factor but if they are
 

4789
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:36,229
striking is a factor but if they are
striking they don't have locked hands

4790
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:36,239
striking they don't have locked hands
 

4791
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,510
striking they don't have locked hands
around your body means you are able to

4792
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:38,520
around your body means you are able to

being on bottom and on top I think the

4828
01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:18,780
being on bottom and on top I think the
 

4829
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,750
being on bottom and on top I think the
longer the match is probably the

4830
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:20,760
longer the match is probably the
 

4831
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:22,610
longer the match is probably the
favorites the top guy more just because

4832
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:22,620
favorites the top guy more just because
 

4833
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:24,470
favorites the top guy more just because
every movement the bottom guy makes is

4834
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:24,480

probably carrying your your weight

4836
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:26,100
probably carrying your your weight
 

4837
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,310
probably carrying your your weight
carrying that gravity on top of you so I

4838
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:28,320
carrying that gravity on top of you so I
 

4839
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,290
carrying that gravity on top of you so I
think it's a bit more efficient uh

4840
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:30,300
think it's a bit more efficient uh
 

4841
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,090
think it's a bit more efficient uh
passing from the top as opposed to

4842
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:32,100
passing from the top as opposed to
 

4843
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,010
passing from the top as opposed to
sweeping from bottom Bottom's reactive

4844
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:34,020
sweeping from bottom Bottom's reactive
 

4845
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,970
sweeping from bottom Bottom's reactive

01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:47,340
reactive reactive you're gonna get
 

4857
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:49,790
reactive reactive you're gonna get
fatigued yeah I think I think it's very

4858
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:49,800
fatigued yeah I think I think it's very
 

4859
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,070
fatigued yeah I think I think it's very
difficult to gas somebody out while

4860
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,080
difficult to gas somebody out while
 

4861
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,470
difficult to gas somebody out while
playing guard but I think it's very easy

01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:54,480
playing guard but I think it's very easy
 

4863
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,810
playing guard but I think it's very easy
to gas somebody out uh when attempting

4864
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:56,820
to gas somebody out uh when attempting
 

4865
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,490
to gas somebody out uh when attempting
to pass it well you guys are talking

to pass it well you guys are talking
 

4867
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,110
to pass it well you guys are talking
about guessing people out but is there

4868
01:27:00,110 --> 01:27:00,120
about guessing people out but is there
 

4869
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,990
about guessing people out but is there
are more dangers from the bottom like in

4870
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:03,000

01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:06,300
of stuff or no I'm back and forth
 

4875
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,270
of stuff or no I'm back and forth
because I'm a top I'm a top player but I

4876
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:08,280
because I'm a top I'm a top player but I
 

4877
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:10,250
because I'm a top I'm a top player but I
understand the value of being on bottom

4878
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:10,260
understand the value of being on bottom
 

4879
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:12,410
understand the value of being on bottom
like when I do play guard the bottom I

4880
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:12,420
like when I do play guard the bottom I
 

4881
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,510
like when I do play guard the bottom I
feel like this the submissions come much

4882
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:14,520
feel like this the submissions come much
 

4883
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,890
feel like this the submissions come much
easier uh and when I'm on top they come

4884
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:17,900
easier uh and when I'm on top they come
 

4885
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,990
easier uh and when I'm on top they come
also pretty easy but uh maybe I just

4886
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:21,000
also pretty easy but uh maybe I just
 

4887
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,669
also pretty easy but uh maybe I just
take a different route

4888
01:27:24,669 --> 01:27:24,679

 

4889
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:26,930

4906
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:43,260

4907
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:44,570
matter what yeah I mean from my
perspective there's a lot of pressure

4908
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:44,580
perspective there's a lot of pressure
 

4909
01:27:44,580 --> 01:27:47,090
perspective there's a lot of pressure
for that you know like that's a that's

4910
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:47,100
for that you know like that's a that's
 

4911
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,129
for that you know like that's a that's
that's a lot of pressure for me to go in

4913
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:50,930
that's a lot of pressure for me to go in
and think that I could possibly figure

4914
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:50,940
and think that I could possibly figure
 

4915
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:53,689
and think that I could possibly figure
out a way to help this guy address this

4916
01:27:53,689 --> 01:27:53,699
out a way to help this guy address this
 

4917
01:27:53,699 --> 01:27:55,370
out a way to help this guy address this
guy that's basically never been beaten I

4918
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:55,380
guy that's basically never been beaten I
 

4919
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:56,629
guy that's basically never been beaten I
think he got knocked out once but

4920
01:27:56,629 --> 01:27:56,639
think he got knocked out once but
 

4921
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,910
think he got knocked out once but
basically not really even been put in

4922
01:27:58,910 --> 01:27:58,920
basically not really even been put in
 

4923
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:00,470
basically not really even been put in
bad positions you know what I mean

4924
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:00,480
bad positions you know what I mean
 

4925
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:01,430
bad positions you know what I mean
that's a lot of pressure on me

4926
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:01,440
that's a lot of pressure on me
 

4927
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,590

5182
01:32:37,910 --> 01:32:37,920
Islam macachev and in terms of Ortega
 

5183
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,250
Islam macachev and in terms of Ortega
was able to survive Ortega who has some

of the most dangerous emissions in Jiu
 

5187
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,370
of the most dangerous emissions in Jiu
Jitsu so I think in my opinion

5188
01:32:43,370 --> 01:32:43,380
Jitsu so I think in my opinion
 

5189
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:45,890
Jitsu so I think in my opinion
technically he's the best

5190
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:45,900
technically he's the best
 

5191
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:47,990
technically he's the best
so even though even though he

5192
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:48,000
so even though even though he
 

5193
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,090
so even though even though he
technically lost he's still he still has

5194
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:50,100
technically lost he's still he still has
 

5195
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:52,790
technically lost he's still he still has
a crown I I believe in himself given the

5196
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:52,800
a crown I I believe in himself given the
 

5197
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,229
a crown I I believe in himself given the
size difference given he's moving up in

5198
01:32:54,229 --> 01:32:54,239
size difference given he's moving up in
 

5199
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:55,850
size difference given he's moving up in
white yeah I think all those factors

5200
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:55,860

5201
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,709

really the underdog everything the

problem it's like it's it's it's a bit
 

5415
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:54,709
problem it's like it's it's it's a bit
of a I mean some things he definitely

5416
01:36:54,709 --> 01:36:54,719
of a I mean some things he definitely
 

5417
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,930
of a I mean some things he definitely
takes too far you know but I felt like

5418
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:56,940
takes too far you know but I felt like
 

5419
01:36:56,940 --> 01:37:00,110
takes too far you know but I felt like
early on he had the right balance where

5420
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:00,120
early on he had the right balance where
 

5421
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:01,669
early on he had the right balance where
he wouldn't really cross the line but he

5422
01:37:01,669 --> 01:37:01,679
he wouldn't really cross the line but he
 

5423
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,590
he wouldn't really cross the line but he
would do he would do enough he just took

5424
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:03,600
would do he would do enough he just took
 

5425
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,209
would do he would do enough he just took
it to another level obviously later in

5426
01:37:05,209 --> 01:37:05,219
it to another level obviously later in
 

5427
01:37:05,219 --> 01:37:06,169
it to another level obviously later in
his career

5428
01:37:06,169 --> 01:37:06,179
his career
 

5429
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:08,450
his career
but I think early on a bit of innocent

5430
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:08,460
but I think early on a bit of innocent
 

5431
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,310

a hobbyist or or a professional uh

6082
01:48:57,709 --> 01:48:57,719
a hobbyist or or a professional uh

01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:00,600
athlete you should be lifting um you
 

6085
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,510
athlete you should be lifting um you
know whether you're rehabbing an injury

know whether you're rehabbing an injury
 

6087

know whether you're rehabbing an injury
or just for an injury prevention so I'm

6088
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:04,980
or just for an injury prevention so I'm
 

6089
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:06,950
or just for an injury prevention so I'm
actually closer to uh correction I've

6090
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:06,960
actually closer to uh correction I've
 

6091
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:09,950
actually closer to uh correction I've
trained my whole life like pretty hard

6092
01:49:09,950 --> 01:49:09,960
trained my whole life like pretty hard

01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:15,300
a day did Judo wrestling all that never
 

6097

a day did Judo wrestling all that never
broke anything never injured kind of

6098
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:17,520
broke anything never injured kind of
 

6099
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,109
broke anything never injured kind of
like similar philosophy except like last

6100
01:49:21,109 --> 01:49:21,119
like similar philosophy except like last
 

6101
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:23,510
like similar philosophy except like last
year I guess a year and a half ago I got

6102
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:23,520
year I guess a year and a half ago I got
 

6103
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,629
year I guess a year and a half ago I got
a tiny like growing pool injury and it

6104
01:49:26,629 --> 01:49:26,639
a tiny like growing pool injury and it
 

6105
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:28,609
a tiny like growing pool injury and it
still hasn't healed and I've been using

6106
01:49:28,609 --> 01:49:28,619
still hasn't healed and I've been using
 

6107
01:49:28,619 --> 01:49:31,609
still hasn't healed and I've been using
your approach of not giving a [\h__\h] yeah

6108
01:49:31,609 --> 01:49:31,619
your approach of not giving a [\h__\h] yeah
 

6109
01:49:31,619 --> 01:49:33,890
your approach of not giving a [\h__\h] yeah
and like all right surely this is gonna

6110
01:49:33,890 --> 01:49:33,900
and like all right surely this is gonna
 

6111
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:36,709
and like all right surely this is gonna
heal it'll be fine but it hasn't but of

6112
01:49:36,709 --> 01:49:36,719
heal it'll be fine but it hasn't but of
 

6113
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:38,390
heal it'll be fine but it hasn't but of
course if I was like an actual athlete I

6114
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:38,400
course if I was like an actual athlete I
 

6115
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,890
course if I was like an actual athlete I
would like probably still train through

6116
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:39,900
would like probably still train through
 

6117
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,990
would like probably still train through
it just [\h__\h] it figure it out but when

6118
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:42,000
it just [\h__\h] it figure it out but when
 

6119
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,250
it just [\h__\h] it figure it out but when
you have other stuff going on you just

6120
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:43,260
you have other stuff going on you just
 

6121
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:45,890
you have other stuff going on you just
kind of wait it out yeah but no I think

6122
01:49:45,890 --> 01:49:45,900
kind of wait it out yeah but no I think
 

6123
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:47,750
kind of wait it out yeah but no I think
probably we have especially as you get

6124
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:47,760
probably we have especially as you get
 

6125
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,250
probably we have especially as you get
older you have to do that kind of stuff

6126
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:49,260
older you have to do that kind of stuff
 

6127
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:51,649
older you have to do that kind of stuff
I think it's important for people to you

6128
01:49:51,649 --> 01:49:51,659
I think it's important for people to you
 

6129
01:49:51,659 --> 01:49:53,510
I think it's important for people to you
know determine whether they're what

they're just hurt a little bit because
 

6135
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:58,609
they're just hurt a little bit because
injury you know for sure take time rehab

6136
01:49:58,609 --> 01:49:58,619
injury you know for sure take time rehab
 

6137
01:49:58,619 --> 01:50:00,109
injury you know for sure take time rehab
it and get better but a lot of people

6138
01:50:00,109 --> 01:50:00,119
it and get better but a lot of people
 

6139
01:50:00,119 --> 01:50:01,370

like they'll stubble toe or something

6140
01:50:01,370 --> 01:50:01,380
like they'll stubble toe or something
 

6141
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:03,109
like they'll stubble toe or something
like uh you're out for a few weeks you

6142
01:50:03,109 --> 01:50:03,119
like uh you're out for a few weeks you
 

6143
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:05,270
like uh you're out for a few weeks you
know so well that's that's the problem

6144
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:05,280
know so well that's that's the problem
 

6145
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,550
know so well that's that's the problem
with the injury I have it feels like a

6146
01:50:07,550 --> 01:50:07,560
with the injury I have it feels like a
 

6147
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:10,129
with the injury I have it feels like a
stubbed toe so I was like yeah I'll just

6148
01:50:10,129 --> 01:50:10,139
stubbed toe so I was like yeah I'll just
 

6149
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:11,689
stubbed toe so I was like yeah I'll just
wait a couple days it'll be fine and

6150
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:11,699
wait a couple days it'll be fine and
 

6151
01:50:11,699 --> 01:50:13,129
wait a couple days it'll be fine and
then a couple days later it's not fine

6152
01:50:13,129 --> 01:50:13,139
then a couple days later it's not fine
 

6153
01:50:13,139 --> 01:50:15,530
then a couple days later it's not fine
and you wait and then I never got an MRI

6154
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:15,540
and you wait and then I never got an MRI
 

6155
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:17,209
and you wait and then I never got an MRI
I never got any of that it's like I'm

6156
01:50:17,209 --> 01:50:17,219
I never got any of that it's like I'm
 

6157
01:50:17,219 --> 01:50:20,330
I never got any of that it's like I'm
sure I'll be fine yeah so it's hard to

6158
01:50:20,330 --> 01:50:20,340
sure I'll be fine yeah so it's hard to
 

6159
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:22,250
sure I'll be fine yeah so it's hard to
know sometimes like

6160
01:50:22,250 --> 01:50:22,260
know sometimes like
 

6161
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:25,310
know sometimes like
what is hard to know I feel like a lot

6162
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:25,320
what is hard to know I feel like a lot
 

6163
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,450
what is hard to know I feel like a lot
of people

6164
01:50:26,450 --> 01:50:26,460
of people
 

6165
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:29,270
of people
will just not check it out be fine well

6166
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:29,280
will just not check it out be fine well
 

6167
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,310
will just not check it out be fine well
because there's several failure cases

6168
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:31,320
because there's several failure cases
 

6169
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,050
because there's several failure cases
there is a failure case of where

6170
01:50:33,050 --> 01:50:33,060
there is a failure case of where
 

6171
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:34,970
there is a failure case of where
everything is a stub tote you're like

6172
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:34,980
everything is a stub tote you're like

6791
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:17,330
wouldn't like Craig take me down like
we're not going live we're just drilling

6792
02:01:17,330 --> 02:01:17,340
we're not going live we're just drilling
 

6793
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:18,770
we're not going live we're just drilling
but I just wouldn't let him put me on

6794
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:18,780
but I just wouldn't let him put me on
 

6795
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:22,629
but I just wouldn't let him put me on
the floor so things like that you know

6796
02:01:22,629 --> 02:01:22,639

 

6797
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:26,510

I knew it escalate yeah uh so you met

6798
02:01:26,510 --> 02:01:26,520
I knew it escalate yeah uh so you met
 

6799
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,430
I knew it escalate yeah uh so you met
your mom like uh so you do positional

6800
02:01:28,430 --> 02:01:28,440
your mom like uh so you do positional
 

6801
02:01:28,440 --> 02:01:30,229
your mom like uh so you do positional
training so is that would that be the

6802
02:01:30,229 --> 02:01:30,239
training so is that would that be the
 

6803
02:01:30,239 --> 02:01:32,209
training so is that would that be the
hardest versus like live training uh

6804
02:01:32,209 --> 02:01:32,219
hardest versus like live training uh
 

6805
02:01:32,219 --> 02:01:34,189
hardest versus like live training uh
open like starting from guard I would

6806
02:01:34,189 --> 02:01:34,199

6811
02:01:38,219 --> 02:01:40,370
definitely made me very tough because

02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:40,380
you spent all this effort getting off of
 

6813
02:01:40,380 --> 02:01:42,589
you spent all this effort getting off of
bottom out and then you gotta get on top

6814
02:01:42,589 --> 02:01:42,599
bottom out and then you gotta get on top
 

6815

6837
02:02:01,739 --> 02:02:03,589
constant Circle man it's it's very tough
but definitely uh you know build some

6838
02:02:03,589 --> 02:02:03,599
but definitely uh you know build some
 

6839
02:02:03,599 --> 02:02:05,030
but definitely uh you know build some
character on the map what do you think

6840
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:05,040
character on the map what do you think
 

6841
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:06,649
character on the map what do you think
is the value of positional training in

6842
02:02:06,649 --> 02:02:06,659
is the value of positional training in
 

6843
02:02:06,659 --> 02:02:08,930
is the value of positional training in
general in Jiu Jitsu actually this one

6844
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:08,940
general in Jiu Jitsu actually this one
 

6845
02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:10,550
general in Jiu Jitsu actually this one
just interacting with you guys it's not

6846
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:10,560
just interacting with you guys it's not
 

6847
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,470
just interacting with you guys it's not
commonly done it's just like regular

6848
02:02:12,470 --> 02:02:12,480
commonly done it's just like regular
 

6849
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:14,689
commonly done it's just like regular
Jiu-Jitsu gyms would you see because

6850
02:02:14,689 --> 02:02:14,699
Jiu-Jitsu gyms would you see because
 

6851
02:02:14,699 --> 02:02:16,189
Jiu-Jitsu gyms would you see because
probably it's not commonly done because

6852
02:02:16,189 --> 02:02:16,199
probably it's not commonly done because
 

6853
02:02:16,199 --> 02:02:18,229
probably it's not commonly done because
it's so most of the experience is just

6854
02:02:18,229 --> 02:02:18,239
it's so most of the experience is just
 

6855
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:19,970
it's so most of the experience is just
frustrating

6856
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:19,980
frustrating
 

6857
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:22,129
frustrating
like if you're evenly matched you're

6858
02:02:22,129 --> 02:02:22,139
like if you're evenly matched you're
 

6859
02:02:22,139 --> 02:02:24,350
like if you're evenly matched you're
basically frustrated the whole time

6860
02:02:24,350 --> 02:02:24,360
basically frustrated the whole time
 

6861
02:02:24,360 --> 02:02:25,970
basically frustrated the whole time
if you're if you're doing it right these

6862
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:25,980
if you're if you're doing it right these
 

6863
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:27,770
if you're if you're doing it right these
are psychological battle that happens in

6864
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:27,780
are psychological battle that happens in
 

6865
02:02:27,780 --> 02:02:29,030
are psychological battle that happens in
like the mountain Turtle Islands it's

6866
02:02:29,030 --> 02:02:29,040
like the mountain Turtle Islands it's
 

6867
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:30,709
like the mountain Turtle Islands it's
like you know because you maybe you get

6868
02:02:30,709 --> 02:02:30,719
like you know because you maybe you get
 

6869
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:32,629
like you know because you maybe you get
close to sub in a guy and or maybe you

6870
02:02:32,629 --> 02:02:32,639
close to sub in a guy and or maybe you
 

6871
02:02:32,639 --> 02:02:34,910
close to sub in a guy and or maybe you
do SUB them uh you know when you're

6872
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:34,920
do SUB them uh you know when you're
 

6873
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:36,050
do SUB them uh you know when you're
starting turtle and you're on their back

6874
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:36,060
starting turtle and you're on their back
 

6875
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:37,790
starting turtle and you're on their back
you finish them and then you get this

6876
02:02:37,790 --> 02:02:37,800
you finish them and then you get this
 

6877
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:39,169
you finish them and then you get this
High Point and then immediately you

6878
02:02:39,169 --> 02:02:39,179
High Point and then immediately you
 

6879
02:02:39,179 --> 02:02:41,149
High Point and then immediately you
gotta go back down to defensive posture

6880
02:02:41,149 --> 02:02:41,159
gotta go back down to defensive posture
 

6881
02:02:41,159 --> 02:02:43,129
gotta go back down to defensive posture
yeah it's very like it's emotionally

6882
02:02:43,129 --> 02:02:43,139
yeah it's very like it's emotionally
 

6883
02:02:43,139 --> 02:02:45,050
yeah it's very like it's emotionally
like up and down so it's hard to deal

6884
02:02:45,050 --> 02:02:45,060
like up and down so it's hard to deal
 

6885
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:46,669
like up and down so it's hard to deal
with super important if you're one of

6886
02:02:46,669 --> 02:02:46,679
with super important if you're one of
 

6887
02:02:46,679 --> 02:02:47,990
with super important if you're one of
the better people in the gym because it

6888
02:02:47,990 --> 02:02:48,000
the better people in the gym because it
 

6889
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,910
the better people in the gym because it
just puts you in positions you don't

6890
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:49,920
just puts you in positions you don't
 

6891
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,370
just puts you in positions you don't
find yourself in in regular training so

6892
02:02:52,370 --> 02:02:52,380
find yourself in in regular training so
 

6893
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:54,770
find yourself in in regular training so
I think like a lot of uh if you're a big

6894
02:02:54,770 --> 02:02:54,780
I think like a lot of uh if you're a big
 

6895
02:02:54,780 --> 02:02:56,030
I think like a lot of uh if you're a big
fish in a small pond you don't do

6896
02:02:56,030 --> 02:02:56,040
fish in a small pond you don't do
 

6897
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:57,530
fish in a small pond you don't do
positional spying you're probably going

6898
02:02:57,530 --> 02:02:57,540
positional spying you're probably going
 

6899
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:59,570
positional spying you're probably going
to get exposed in competition you might

6900
02:02:59,570 --> 02:02:59,580
to get exposed in competition you might
 

6901
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:01,310
to get exposed in competition you might
even look silly in those positions so

6902
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:01,320
even look silly in those positions so
 

6903
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:02,930
even look silly in those positions so
you really have to force yourself to do

6904
02:03:02,930 --> 02:03:02,940
you really have to force yourself to do
 

6905
02:03:02,940 --> 02:03:04,550
you really have to force yourself to do
it despite the fact that you're giving

6906
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:04,560
it despite the fact that you're giving
 

6907
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,709
it despite the fact that you're giving
someone worse than you a position where

6908
02:03:06,709 --> 02:03:06,719
someone worse than you a position where
 

6909
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:08,030
someone worse than you a position where
they might catch you so you have to sort

6910
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:08,040
they might catch you so you have to sort
 

6911
02:03:08,040 --> 02:03:10,609
they might catch you so you have to sort
of put the ego aside

6912
02:03:10,609 --> 02:03:10,619
of put the ego aside
 

6913
02:03:10,619 --> 02:03:13,070
of put the ego aside
yeah that's one of the things when I was

6914
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:13,080
yeah that's one of the things when I was
 

6915
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:14,510
yeah that's one of the things when I was
training regularly of course training

6916
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:14,520
training regularly of course training
 

6917
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:17,570
training regularly of course training
with you guys it's like trivial but uh I

6918
02:03:17,570 --> 02:03:17,580
with you guys it's like trivial but uh I
 

6919
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:19,430
with you guys it's like trivial but uh I
didn't work on putting myself in bad

6920
02:03:19,430 --> 02:03:19,440
didn't work on putting myself in bad
 

6921
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,770
didn't work on putting myself in bad
positions when you get better and you

6922
02:03:21,770 --> 02:03:21,780
positions when you get better and you
 

6923
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:23,990
positions when you get better and you
regret it because the the big negative

6924
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:24,000
regret it because the the big negative
 

6925
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,729
regret it because the the big negative
thing it has consequence it has on

6926
02:03:25,729 --> 02:03:25,739
thing it has consequence it has on
 

6927
02:03:25,739 --> 02:03:27,169
thing it has consequence it has on
competition is you don't take as many

6928
02:03:27,169 --> 02:03:27,179
competition is you don't take as many
 

6929
02:03:27,179 --> 02:03:29,750
competition is you don't take as many
risks because you're kind of afraid

6930
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:29,760
risks because you're kind of afraid
 

6931
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:31,790
risks because you're kind of afraid
for you back to get taken all that kind

6932
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:31,800
for you back to get taken all that kind
 

6933
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:33,589
for you back to get taken all that kind
of stuff that was me before I went to

6934
02:03:33,589 --> 02:03:33,599
of stuff that was me before I went to
 

6935
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:34,910
of stuff that was me before I went to
DDS I remember I showed up there in that

6936
02:03:34,910 --> 02:03:34,920
DDS I remember I showed up there in that
 

6937
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:38,089
DDS I remember I showed up there in that
old position I was like [\h__\h] this you

6938
02:03:38,089 --> 02:03:38,099
old position I was like [\h__\h] this you
 

6939
02:03:38,099 --> 02:03:39,589
old position I was like [\h__\h] this you
better earn this position you know yeah

6940
02:03:39,589 --> 02:03:39,599
better earn this position you know yeah
 

6941
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:43,669

exactly I didn't really have escapes

6942
02:03:43,669 --> 02:03:43,679
exactly I didn't really have escapes
 

6943
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:46,089
exactly I didn't really have escapes
I was a learning curve for me for sure

6944
02:03:46,089 --> 02:03:46,099
I was a learning curve for me for sure
 

6945
02:03:46,099 --> 02:03:48,470
I was a learning curve for me for sure
uh do you see the value in positional

6946
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:48,480
uh do you see the value in positional
 

6947
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:50,149
uh do you see the value in positional
training or is it just the source of

6948
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:50,159
training or is it just the source of
 

6949
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:52,910
training or is it just the source of
tremendous frustration uh yeah I

6950
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:52,920
tremendous frustration uh yeah I
 

6951
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:55,070
tremendous frustration uh yeah I
definitely uh think it plays a big part

6952
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:55,080
definitely uh think it plays a big part
 

6953
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,510
definitely uh think it plays a big part
in you know your confidence when you

6954
02:03:56,510 --> 02:03:56,520
in you know your confidence when you
 

6955
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:58,729
in you know your confidence when you
step out onto the the competition mats

6956
02:03:58,729 --> 02:03:58,739
step out onto the the competition mats
 

6957
02:03:58,739 --> 02:04:00,290
step out onto the the competition mats
you know being confident that even if

6958
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:00,300
you know being confident that even if
 

6959
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:01,970
you know being confident that even if
you get put in the worst possible

6960
02:04:01,970 --> 02:04:01,980
you get put in the worst possible
 

6961
02:04:01,980 --> 02:04:04,250
you get put in the worst possible
situations you know what to do and know

6962
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:04,260
situations you know what to do and know
 

6963
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:05,990
situations you know what to do and know
how to work out of them

6964
02:04:05,990 --> 02:04:06,000
how to work out of them
 

6965
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,450
how to work out of them
so I had a long argument with uh with

6966
02:04:08,450 --> 02:04:08,460
so I had a long argument with uh with
 

6967
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:10,129
so I had a long argument with uh with
Taja Gracie when he visited and he

6968
02:04:10,129 --> 02:04:10,139
Taja Gracie when he visited and he
 

6969
02:04:10,139 --> 02:04:12,830
Taja Gracie when he visited and he
thinks Mal is the most dominant position

6970
02:04:12,830 --> 02:04:12,840
thinks Mal is the most dominant position
 

6971
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,689
thinks Mal is the most dominant position
even Noki

6972
02:04:14,689 --> 02:04:14,699
even Noki
 

6973
02:04:14,699 --> 02:04:17,270
even Noki
uh versus back would you is there a case

6974
02:04:17,270 --> 02:04:17,280
uh versus back would you is there a case
 

6975
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,370
uh versus back would you is there a case
to be made for that or no dude I think I

6976
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:19,380
to be made for that or no dude I think I
 

6977

to be made for that or no dude I think I
think all of your opponent's utensils

6978
02:04:21,109 --> 02:04:21,119
think all of your opponent's utensils
 

6979
02:04:21,119 --> 02:04:23,450
think all of your opponent's utensils
their tools are in front of them so like

6980
02:04:23,450 --> 02:04:23,460
their tools are in front of them so like
 

6981
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:25,310
their tools are in front of them so like
if you're on Mount they still have you

6982
02:04:25,310 --> 02:04:25,320
if you're on Mount they still have you
 

6983
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:26,510
if you're on Mount they still have you
know there's a few ways to get out of

6984
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:26,520
know there's a few ways to get out of
 

6985
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:27,890
know there's a few ways to get out of
them out I think if you're on somebody's

6986
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:27,900
them out I think if you're on somebody's
 

6987
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:29,570
them out I think if you're on somebody's
back I'd personally much rather be on

6988
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:29,580
back I'd personally much rather be on
 

6989
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:31,970
back I'd personally much rather be on
somebody's back than flattened out I'd

6990
02:04:31,970 --> 02:04:31,980
somebody's back than flattened out I'd
 

6991
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:33,649
somebody's back than flattened out I'd
rather have someone's back and then

6992
02:04:33,649 --> 02:04:33,659
rather have someone's back and then
 

6993
02:04:33,659 --> 02:04:35,750
rather have someone's back and then
flattened out boots in flattened out

6994
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:35,760
flattened out boots in flattened out
 

6995
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:38,209
flattened out boots in flattened out
yeah yeah boots and flat out so not not

6996
02:04:38,209 --> 02:04:38,219
yeah yeah boots and flat out so not not
 

6997
02:04:38,219 --> 02:04:40,790
yeah yeah boots and flat out so not not
even body triangle but just flatten just

6998
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:40,800
even body triangle but just flatten just
 

6999
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,290
even body triangle but just flatten just
completely flat almost like a position

7000
02:04:42,290 --> 02:04:42,300
completely flat almost like a position
 

7001
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:43,910
completely flat almost like a position
in my way you see guys get finished

7002
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:43,920
in my way you see guys get finished
 

7003
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:45,290
in my way you see guys get finished
because they can't get out I think that

7004
02:04:45,290 --> 02:04:45,300
because they can't get out I think that
 

7005
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:46,970
because they can't get out I think that
position is probably the hardest

7006
02:04:46,970 --> 02:04:46,980
position is probably the hardest
 

7007
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:48,350
position is probably the hardest
position to escape can you see what

7008
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:48,360
position to escape can you see what
 

7009
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:49,970
position to escape can you see what
hydra's talking about with mounters he

there's

7022
02:05:01,370 --> 02:05:01,380
there's
 

7023
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:03,589
there's
he actually thinks there's more ways to

get out from the back of the nurse from
the mount prior to getting up including

7028
02:05:07,910 --> 02:05:07,920
the mount prior to getting up including
 

7029
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:10,070
the mount prior to getting up including
like physically prior to the Kipping

7030
02:05:10,070 --> 02:05:10,080
like physically prior to the Kipping

Escape
 

7033
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:13,129
Escape
I'll probably agree with him but they're

7034
02:05:13,129 --> 02:05:13,139
I'll probably agree with him but they're
 

7035
02:05:13,139 --> 02:05:14,870
I'll probably agree with him but they're
keeping escapes so difficult to manage

7036
02:05:14,870 --> 02:05:14,880
keeping escapes so difficult to manage
 

7037
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,830
keeping escapes so difficult to manage
it's the funny looking Escape we uh yeah

7038
02:05:17,830 --> 02:05:17,840
it's the funny looking Escape we uh yeah
 

7039
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:20,390
it's the funny looking Escape we uh yeah
people have a lot of trouble it's like

7040
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:20,400
people have a lot of trouble it's like
 

7041
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:22,129
people have a lot of trouble it's like
super hard to learn how to do but then

7042
02:05:22,129 --> 02:05:22,139
super hard to learn how to do but then
 

7043
02:05:22,139 --> 02:05:23,390
super hard to learn how to do but then
once you learn how to do it the

7044
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:23,400
once you learn how to do it the
 

7045
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:26,209
once you learn how to do it the
effectiveness is just huge yeah it's a

7046
02:05:26,209 --> 02:05:26,219
effectiveness is just huge yeah it's a
 

7047
02:05:26,219 --> 02:05:29,209
effectiveness is just huge yeah it's a
weird one when that comes to be a thing

guys using it first I think yeah who's
the first guy to discover something like

7054
02:05:36,709 --> 02:05:36,719
the first guy to discover something like
 

7055
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:38,270
the first guy to discover something like
that this seems like a ridiculous thing

you know what I mean I'll just tell them
this is a technique and watch him

7088
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,280
this is a technique and watch him
 

7089
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,010
this is a technique and watch him
try to work out if I'm being serious or

be the gym twice a day every day when
 

7251
02:09:06,420 --> 02:09:07,790
be the gym twice a day every day when
I'm back just because I travel a bit

7252
02:09:07,790 --> 02:09:07,800
I'm back just because I travel a bit
 

7253
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:09,890
I'm back just because I travel a bit
more than uh these guys so I try to be

7254
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:09,900
more than uh these guys so I try to be
 

7255
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:11,810
more than uh these guys so I try to be
there 8 and 12 every day hang out in

7256
02:09:11,810 --> 02:09:11,820
there 8 and 12 every day hang out in
 

7257
02:09:11,820 --> 02:09:14,870
there 8 and 12 every day hang out in
between uh usually definitely usually

7258
02:09:14,870 --> 02:09:14,880
between uh usually definitely usually
 

7259
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:16,669
between uh usually definitely usually
train both of those sessions depending

7260
02:09:16,669 --> 02:09:16,679
train both of those sessions depending
 

7261
02:09:16,679 --> 02:09:17,990
train both of those sessions depending
on how my body feels you're doing

7262
02:09:17,990 --> 02:09:18,000
on how my body feels you're doing
 

7263
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,609
on how my body feels you're doing
positional doing everything like

7264
02:09:19,609 --> 02:09:19,619
positional doing everything like
 

7265
02:09:19,619 --> 02:09:21,830
positional doing everything like
technique positional live I should

7266
02:09:21,830 --> 02:09:21,840
technique positional live I should
 

7267
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:23,330
technique positional live I should
probably do more positional because I'm

7268
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:23,340
probably do more positional because I'm
 

7269
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:24,530
probably do more positional because I'm
just trying to work on wrestling and

7270
02:09:24,530 --> 02:09:24,540
just trying to work on wrestling and
 

7271
02:09:24,540 --> 02:09:26,330
just trying to work on wrestling and
stuff and especially leading up to the

7272
02:09:26,330 --> 02:09:26,340
stuff and especially leading up to the
 

7273
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:27,950
stuff and especially leading up to the
volcanovskis last while I was trying to

7274
02:09:27,950 --> 02:09:27,960
volcanovskis last while I was trying to
 

7275
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:29,870
volcanovskis last while I was trying to
wrestle more and focus on those areas

7276
02:09:29,870 --> 02:09:29,880
wrestle more and focus on those areas
 

7277
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:31,970
wrestle more and focus on those areas
even before I traveled over there just

7278
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:31,980
even before I traveled over there just
 

7279
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:34,250
even before I traveled over there just
some experimentation with some stuff but

7280
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:34,260
some experimentation with some stuff but
 

7281
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:36,169
some experimentation with some stuff but
yeah yeah how do you experiment with

7282
02:09:36,169 --> 02:09:36,179
yeah yeah how do you experiment with
 

7283
02:09:36,179 --> 02:09:37,729
yeah yeah how do you experiment with
stuff like how do you so there's like

7284
02:09:37,729 --> 02:09:37,739
stuff like how do you so there's like
 

7285
02:09:37,739 --> 02:09:39,109
stuff like how do you so there's like
regular positional stuff but when you

7286
02:09:39,109 --> 02:09:39,119
regular positional stuff but when you
 

7287
02:09:39,119 --> 02:09:40,729
regular positional stuff but when you
have ideas

7288
02:09:40,729 --> 02:09:40,739
have ideas
 

7289
02:09:40,739 --> 02:09:43,550
have ideas
like what like where do you do it in

7290
02:09:43,550 --> 02:09:43,560
like what like where do you do it in
 

7291
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:44,990
like what like where do you do it in
during the training sessions to do it

7292
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:45,000
during the training sessions to do it
 

7293
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,390
during the training sessions to do it
outside of that you get you get together

7294
02:09:47,390 --> 02:09:47,400
outside of that you get you get together
 

7295
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,370
outside of that you get you get together
with somebody usually every session I

7296
02:09:49,370 --> 02:09:49,380
with somebody usually every session I
 

7297
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:51,350
with somebody usually every session I
show up with something I'm thinking of

7298
02:09:51,350 --> 02:09:51,360
show up with something I'm thinking of
 

7299
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:53,390
show up with something I'm thinking of
usually selling from Top maybe selling

7300
02:09:53,390 --> 02:09:53,400
usually selling from Top maybe selling
 

7301
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,729
usually selling from Top maybe selling
for bottom but and then I just try to

7302
02:09:55,729 --> 02:09:55,739
for bottom but and then I just try to
 

7303
02:09:55,739 --> 02:09:58,129
for bottom but and then I just try to
maybe pick the right people some people

7304
02:09:58,129 --> 02:09:58,139
maybe pick the right people some people
 

7305
02:09:58,139 --> 02:10:00,169
maybe pick the right people some people
obviously I'm just fighting to the death

7306
02:10:00,169 --> 02:10:00,179
obviously I'm just fighting to the death
 

7307
02:10:00,179 --> 02:10:02,149
obviously I'm just fighting to the death
with it's not a good time to experiment

7308
02:10:02,149 --> 02:10:02,159
with it's not a good time to experiment
 

7309
02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:04,189
with it's not a good time to experiment
and then others obviously you can you

7310
02:10:04,189 --> 02:10:04,199
and then others obviously you can you
 

7311
02:10:04,199 --> 02:10:06,470
and then others obviously you can you
can play around with ideas on

7312
02:10:06,470 --> 02:10:06,480
can play around with ideas on
 

7313
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:09,290
can play around with ideas on
okay uh what about you uh what's a

7314
02:10:09,290 --> 02:10:09,300
okay uh what about you uh what's a
 

7315
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:12,229
okay uh what about you uh what's a
perfect week look like uh maybe well you

7316
02:10:12,229 --> 02:10:12,239
perfect week look like uh maybe well you
 

7317

said you're 100 now yeah
 

7319
02:10:14,760 --> 02:10:16,189
said you're 100 now yeah
um so yeah honestly I have pretty much

7320
02:10:16,189 --> 02:10:16,199
um so yeah honestly I have pretty much
 

7321
02:10:16,199 --> 02:10:17,870
um so yeah honestly I have pretty much
the same schedule as Nikki Rod so Monday

7322
02:10:17,870 --> 02:10:17,880
the same schedule as Nikki Rod so Monday
 

7323
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,790
the same schedule as Nikki Rod so Monday
Wednesday Friday I do twice a day uh

7324
02:10:19,790 --> 02:10:19,800
Wednesday Friday I do twice a day uh
 

7325
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:22,010
Wednesday Friday I do twice a day uh
every other day once a day and then uh

7326
02:10:22,010 --> 02:10:22,020
every other day once a day and then uh
 

7327
02:10:22,020 --> 02:10:24,050
every other day once a day and then uh
normally uh noon practice is like our

7328
02:10:24,050 --> 02:10:24,060
normally uh noon practice is like our
 

7329
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:25,550
normally uh noon practice is like our
biggest class that's where you know all

7330
02:10:25,550 --> 02:10:25,560
biggest class that's where you know all
 

7331
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:27,830
biggest class that's where you know all
the pros go in so I tend to do more open

7332
02:10:27,830 --> 02:10:27,840
the pros go in so I tend to do more open
 

7333
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:30,050
the pros go in so I tend to do more open
rounds there and then we have a 7 P.M

7334
02:10:30,050 --> 02:10:30,060
rounds there and then we have a 7 P.M
 

7335
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:32,570
rounds there and then we have a 7 P.M
class as well which is more hobbyist uh

7336
02:10:32,570 --> 02:10:32,580
class as well which is more hobbyist uh
 

7337
02:10:32,580 --> 02:10:34,010
class as well which is more hobbyist uh
and that's where I'll do my positional

7338
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,020
and that's where I'll do my positional
 

7339
02:10:34,020 --> 02:10:35,750
and that's where I'll do my positional
rounds and you know force myself to be

7340
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:35,760
rounds and you know force myself to be
 

7341
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:38,209
rounds and you know force myself to be
put in uh bad positions

7342
02:10:38,209 --> 02:10:38,219
put in uh bad positions
 

7343
02:10:38,219 --> 02:10:41,270
put in uh bad positions
so you have what you do eight a.m 12

7344
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:41,280
so you have what you do eight a.m 12
 

7345
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:44,689
so you have what you do eight a.m 12
like in terms of what B team has 8 am 12

7346
02:10:44,689 --> 02:10:44,699
like in terms of what B team has 8 am 12
 

7347
02:10:44,699 --> 02:10:47,450
like in terms of what B team has 8 am 12
and 7 p.m and the hobbyists are more 7

7348
02:10:47,450 --> 02:10:47,460
and 7 p.m and the hobbyists are more 7
 

7349
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:49,850
and 7 p.m and the hobbyists are more 7
P.M yes okay

7350
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:49,860
P.M yes okay
 

7351
02:10:49,860 --> 02:10:52,609
P.M yes okay
do you believe in overtraining

7352
02:10:52,609 --> 02:10:52,619
do you believe in overtraining
 

7353
02:10:52,619 --> 02:10:54,169
do you believe in overtraining
do you think you can over train I used

7354
02:10:54,169 --> 02:10:54,179
do you think you can over train I used
 

7355
02:10:54,179 --> 02:10:57,229
do you think you can over train I used
to not believe in it but I then I got

7356
02:10:57,229 --> 02:10:57,239
to not believe in it but I then I got
 

7357
02:10:57,239 --> 02:10:59,030
to not believe in it but I then I got
hurt I was like all right oh you

7358
02:10:59,030 --> 02:10:59,040
hurt I was like all right oh you
 

7359
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,169
hurt I was like all right oh you
attribute that

7360
02:11:00,169 --> 02:11:00,179
attribute that
 

7361
02:11:00,179 --> 02:11:03,290
attribute that
to over training I think uh dude I'm

7362
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:03,300
to over training I think uh dude I'm
 

7363
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:05,209
to over training I think uh dude I'm
telling you I train I listed like a

7364
02:11:05,209 --> 02:11:05,219
telling you I train I listed like a
 

7365
02:11:05,219 --> 02:11:07,550
telling you I train I listed like a
bodybuilder for like seven years and by

7366
02:11:07,550 --> 02:11:07,560
bodybuilder for like seven years and by
 

7367
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:09,470
bodybuilder for like seven years and by
lifting on me I was lifting seven days a

7368
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:09,480
lifting on me I was lifting seven days a
 

7369
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:13,310
lifting on me I was lifting seven days a
week and I train arms most days like

7370
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:13,320
week and I train arms most days like
 

7371
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:15,709
week and I train arms most days like
almost every day I would do like you

7372
02:11:15,709 --> 02:11:15,719
almost every day I would do like you
 

7373
02:11:15,719 --> 02:11:17,689
almost every day I would do like you
know four or five sets and get a get a

7374
02:11:17,689 --> 02:11:17,699
know four or five sets and get a get a
 

7375
02:11:17,699 --> 02:11:19,490
know four or five sets and get a get a
pretty good bicep pump

7376
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:19,500
pretty good bicep pump
 

7377
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:22,010
pretty good bicep pump
in addition to my lift I think I that

7378
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:22,020
in addition to my lift I think I that
 

7379
02:11:22,020 --> 02:11:23,689
in addition to my lift I think I that
had to contribute somewhat towards

7380
02:11:23,689 --> 02:11:23,699
had to contribute somewhat towards
 

7381
02:11:23,699 --> 02:11:24,970
had to contribute somewhat towards
towards my uh

7382
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:24,980
towards my uh
 

7383
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:27,709
towards my uh
yeah fair enough well what about on on

7384
02:11:27,709 --> 02:11:27,719
yeah fair enough well what about on on
 

7385
02:11:27,719 --> 02:11:29,149
yeah fair enough well what about on on
the actual mat over training like

7386
02:11:29,149 --> 02:11:29,159
the actual mat over training like
 

7387
02:11:29,159 --> 02:11:30,709
the actual mat over training like
spending too much time on the mat well

7388
02:11:30,709 --> 02:11:30,719
spending too much time on the mat well
 

7389
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:33,109
spending too much time on the mat well
psychological physical overtraining I

7390
02:11:33,109 --> 02:11:33,119
psychological physical overtraining I
 

7391
02:11:33,119 --> 02:11:35,450
psychological physical overtraining I
think you can definitely over train but

7392
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:35,460
think you can definitely over train but
 

7393
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:37,070
think you can definitely over train but
it's more of a uh I guess your body's

7394
02:11:37,070 --> 02:11:37,080
it's more of a uh I guess your body's
 

7395
02:11:37,080 --> 02:11:38,330
it's more of a uh I guess your body's
healthy you have to make sure your mind

7396
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:38,340
healthy you have to make sure your mind
 

7397
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:41,030
healthy you have to make sure your mind
is sharp like sometimes uh maybe taking

7398
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:41,040
is sharp like sometimes uh maybe taking
 

7399
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:44,149
is sharp like sometimes uh maybe taking
a a day away or even even diverting your

7400
02:11:44,149 --> 02:11:44,159
a a day away or even even diverting your
 

7401
02:11:44,159 --> 02:11:45,890
a a day away or even even diverting your
attention in a different aspect of

7402
02:11:45,890 --> 02:11:45,900
attention in a different aspect of
 

7403
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,450
attention in a different aspect of
training can help you be a little bit

7404
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:47,460
training can help you be a little bit
 

7405
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:50,089
training can help you be a little bit
sharper overall sometimes it can be like

7406
02:11:50,089 --> 02:11:50,099
sharper overall sometimes it can be like
 

7407
02:11:50,099 --> 02:11:52,910
sharper overall sometimes it can be like
uh it can get a little like

7408
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:52,920
uh it can get a little like
 

7409
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:54,169
uh it can get a little like
um stagnant because you're doing the

7410
02:11:54,169 --> 02:11:54,179
um stagnant because you're doing the
 

7411
02:11:54,179 --> 02:11:55,910
um stagnant because you're doing the
same stuff over and over but I think if

7412
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:55,920
same stuff over and over but I think if
 

7413
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:57,350
same stuff over and over but I think if
you just keep like you know over

7414
02:11:57,350 --> 02:11:57,360
you just keep like you know over
 

7415
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:59,570
you just keep like you know over
training then your overall Baseline just

7416
02:11:59,570 --> 02:11:59,580
training then your overall Baseline just
 

7417
02:11:59,580 --> 02:12:01,129
training then your overall Baseline just
gets higher and you that becomes you

7418
02:12:01,129 --> 02:12:01,139
gets higher and you that becomes you
 

7419
02:12:01,139 --> 02:12:04,129
gets higher and you that becomes you
become you know accustomed to that

7420
02:12:04,129 --> 02:12:04,139
become you know accustomed to that
 

7421
02:12:04,139 --> 02:12:06,229
become you know accustomed to that
uh what about you you don't seem like a

7422
02:12:06,229 --> 02:12:06,239
uh what about you you don't seem like a
 

7423
02:12:06,239 --> 02:12:09,470
uh what about you you don't seem like a
guy that over okay I've heard of it I've

7424
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:09,480
guy that over okay I've heard of it I've
 

7425
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:11,450
guy that over okay I've heard of it I've
never been close to it

7426
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:11,460
never been close to it
 

7427
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:15,290
never been close to it
now I think uh controlling uh how do you

7428
02:12:15,290 --> 02:12:15,300
now I think uh controlling uh how do you
 

7429
02:12:15,300 --> 02:12:16,910
now I think uh controlling uh how do you
train is definitely protects you from

7430
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:16,920
train is definitely protects you from
 

7431
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:18,290
train is definitely protects you from
injury you know what I mean like if

you're redlining yourself and then
 

7435
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:21,770
you're redlining yourself and then
you're fighting to the death of the gym

7436
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:21,780
you're fighting to the death of the gym
 

7437

obviously enough food post training and
 

7445
02:12:30,599 --> 02:12:33,290
obviously enough food post training and
that sort of helps me to train a bit

7446
02:12:33,290 --> 02:12:33,300
that sort of helps me to train a bit
 

7447
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:36,649
that sort of helps me to train a bit
harder but still try to avoid red line

7448
02:12:36,649 --> 02:12:36,659
harder but still try to avoid red line
 

7449

better
 

7493
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:25,910
better
I think uh being consistent like find a

7494
02:13:25,910 --> 02:13:25,920
I think uh being consistent like find a
 

7495
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:27,470
I think uh being consistent like find a
schedule that you can consistently train

7496
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:27,480
schedule that you can consistently train
 

7497
02:13:27,480 --> 02:13:29,270
schedule that you can consistently train
maybe it's like you know three four

7498
02:13:29,270 --> 02:13:29,280
maybe it's like you know three four
 

7499
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:31,129
maybe it's like you know three four
times a week or even a little bit less

7500
02:13:31,129 --> 02:13:31,139
times a week or even a little bit less
 

7501
02:13:31,139 --> 02:13:33,470
times a week or even a little bit less
just be consistent over the over the

7502
02:13:33,470 --> 02:13:33,480
just be consistent over the over the
 

7503
02:13:33,480 --> 02:13:35,089
just be consistent over the over the
years I think too too often people are

7504
02:13:35,089 --> 02:13:35,099
years I think too too often people are
 

7505
02:13:35,099 --> 02:13:36,290
years I think too too often people are
like oh I want to get really good really

like oh I want to get really good really
 

7507
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:38,149
like oh I want to get really good really
fast and it's like definitely takes a

7508
02:13:38,149 --> 02:13:38,159
fast and it's like definitely takes a
 

7509
02:13:38,159 --> 02:13:39,530
fast and it's like definitely takes a
long time to get to where you want to be

7510
02:13:39,530 --> 02:13:39,540
long time to get to where you want to be

stuff you're working on
so honestly I think one big thing uh for

7518
02:13:48,290 --> 02:13:48,300
so honestly I think one big thing uh for
 

7519
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:49,910
so honestly I think one big thing uh for
me which is something I actually started

7520
02:13:49,910 --> 02:13:49,920
me which is something I actually started
 

7521
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:52,729
me which is something I actually started
doing once once B team was formed was uh

7522
02:13:52,729 --> 02:13:52,739
doing once once B team was formed was uh
 

7523
02:13:52,739 --> 02:13:55,370
doing once once B team was formed was uh
filming all of your rounds and then

7524
02:13:55,370 --> 02:13:55,380
filming all of your rounds and then
 

7525
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:57,589
filming all of your rounds and then
watching it every day because you can

7526
02:13:57,589 --> 02:13:57,599
watching it every day because you can
 

7527
02:13:57,599 --> 02:13:59,390
watching it every day because you can
see what specific problems you're having

7528
02:13:59,390 --> 02:13:59,400
see what specific problems you're having
 

7529
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:01,010
see what specific problems you're having
and then you can base your positional

7530
02:14:01,010 --> 02:14:01,020
and then you can base your positional
 

7531
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:03,589
and then you can base your positional
rounds around those problems

7532
02:14:03,589 --> 02:14:03,599
rounds around those problems
 

7533
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:05,270
rounds around those problems
that's really interesting it's kind of

7579
02:14:56,699 --> 02:14:58,490
going to get injured you're burnt out
that way you're not going to learn as

7580
02:14:58,490 --> 02:14:58,500
that way you're not going to learn as
 

7581
02:14:58,500 --> 02:15:01,669
that way you're not going to learn as
much it's tough I would say just as a

7582
02:15:01,669 --> 02:15:01,679
much it's tough I would say just as a
 

7583
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:03,470
much it's tough I would say just as a
black bug who took just very seriously

7584
02:15:03,470 --> 02:15:03,480
black bug who took just very seriously
 

7585
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:04,910
black bug who took just very seriously
for a very long time

7586
02:15:04,910 --> 02:15:04,920
for a very long time
 

7587
02:15:04,920 --> 02:15:08,629
for a very long time
basically when you become a hobbyist

7588
02:15:08,629 --> 02:15:08,639
basically when you become a hobbyist
 

7589
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:11,390
basically when you become a hobbyist
your skill is basically slipping your

7590
02:15:11,390 --> 02:15:11,400
your skill is basically slipping your
 

7591
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:13,129
your skill is basically slipping your
age and your skill

7592
02:15:13,129 --> 02:15:13,139
age and your skill
 

7593
02:15:13,139 --> 02:15:15,410
age and your skill
and so not taking stuff seriously is

7594
02:15:15,410 --> 02:15:15,420
and so not taking stuff seriously is
 

7595
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:18,050
and so not taking stuff seriously is
actually its own psychological skill of

7596
02:15:18,050 --> 02:15:18,060
actually its own psychological skill of
 

7597
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:21,050
actually its own psychological skill of
like you go

7598
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:21,060
like you go
 

7599
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:24,530

02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:27,530
that it's tough it's tough like it's
tough in a way that uh is different when

one time and it was actually

8152
02:25:10,610 --> 02:25:10,620
one time and it was actually
 

8153
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:13,070
one time and it was actually
it was surprising I had to put a lot of

it was surprising I had to put a lot of
 

8155
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:15,770
it was surprising I had to put a lot of
force into that I suppose some shoulders

8156
02:25:15,770 --> 02:25:15,780
force into that I suppose some shoulders
 

8157
02:25:15,780 --> 02:25:17,929

sometimes people don't appreciate some
 

9131
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:07,250
sometimes people don't appreciate some
of the ways you help them and they just

9132
02:43:07,250 --> 02:43:07,260
of the ways you help them and they just
 

9133
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:10,849
of the ways you help them and they just

is very difficult to manage but I think
again like we we both see the situation

9140

release because people are going to try
 

9299
02:46:10,319 --> 02:46:13,130
release because people are going to try
to emulate that so I think that's those

9300
02:46:13,130 --> 02:46:13,140
to emulate that so I think that's those
 

9301
02:46:13,140 --> 02:46:15,170
to emulate that so I think that's those
type of instructions just stand up power

9302
