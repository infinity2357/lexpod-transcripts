and
you know subduing people it's the art of

situation
 

267
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,950
situation
um i think it's pretty much evolved

268
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
um i think it's pretty much evolved
 

269
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,029
um i think it's pretty much evolved
since then though you know it's

270
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
since then though you know it's
 

271
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,350
since then though you know it's
as you include like the sport aspect of

272
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
as you include like the sport aspect of
 

273
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,870
as you include like the sport aspect of
it it's

274
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
it it's
 

275
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,189
it it's
it's grown to be something more and more

276
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
it's grown to be something more and more
 

277
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,469
it's grown to be something more and more
dynamic

278
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
dynamic
 

279
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,790
dynamic
and it's kind of gotten away from that

280
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
and it's kind of gotten away from that
 

281
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,469
and it's kind of gotten away from that
so the basics is

282
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
so the basics is
 

283
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,790
so the basics is
people wear something called a ghee yep

284
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
people wear something called a ghee yep
 

285
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,230
people wear something called a ghee yep
which i think

286
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240
which i think
 

287
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,029
which i think
nicely mimics like outdoor clothing yep

288
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:33,039
nicely mimics like outdoor clothing yep
 

289
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,469
nicely mimics like outdoor clothing yep
like a jacket

290
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
like a jacket
 

291
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,830
like a jacket
and uh they start on the

292
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
and uh they start on the
 

293
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,430
and uh they start on the
feet and there's uh

294
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
feet and there's uh
 

295
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,189
feet and there's uh
they get to grip each other and the

296
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199
they get to grip each other and the
 

297
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,029
they get to grip each other and the
scoring works by

298
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
scoring works by
 

299
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,270
scoring works by
the more badass the throw is the more

300
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
the more badass the throw is the more
 

301
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,270
the more badass the throw is the more
points you get and if

302
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
points you get and if
 

303
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,189
points you get and if
you throw the person

304
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
you throw the person
 

305
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,070
you throw the person
big

306
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
big
 

307
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,350
big
and hard

308
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
and hard
 

309
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,629
and hard
on their back

310
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
on their back
 

311
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,310
on their back
you win the match and it's over and

312
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
you win the match and it's over and
 

313
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,390
you win the match and it's over and
that's called an e-pawn yep which is

314
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
that's called an e-pawn yep which is
 

315
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,469
that's called an e-pawn yep which is
equivalent to a knockout so i guess

316
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
equivalent to a knockout so i guess
 

317
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,270
equivalent to a knockout so i guess
there's no knock-downs no judo we don't

318
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
there's no knock-downs no judo we don't
 

319
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,510
there's no knock-downs no judo we don't
count those yeah they gotta hit their

320
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
count those yeah they gotta hit their
 

321
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,670
count those yeah they gotta hit their
back and they gotta hit it with force

322
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
back and they gotta hit it with force
 

323
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,590
back and they gotta hit it with force
and so there's a huge incentive for the

324
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
and so there's a huge incentive for the
 

325
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,510
and so there's a huge incentive for the
big throws

326
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
big throws
 

327
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,870
big throws
and

328
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
and
 

329
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,870
and
there's also the drama

330
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
there's also the drama
 

331
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,150
there's also the drama
of

332

00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
i saw this coming
 

343
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,870

right so there's like a set of a small

360
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
right so there's like a set of a small
 

361
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,510
right so there's like a set of a small
set of throws maybe you can go through

362
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
set of throws maybe you can go through
 

363
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,110
set of throws maybe you can go through
them that are like

364
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
them that are like
 

365
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,550
them that are like
you saw it coming but you couldn't do

you saw it coming but you couldn't do
anything about it and then there's the

368
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:50,800
anything about it and then there's the
 

369
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,629
anything about it and then there's the
set of throws that are more like

370
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
set of throws that are more like
 

371
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,189
set of throws that are more like
surprises so first of all the counters

372
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
surprises so first of all the counters
 

373

491
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,150
right those are the those are the tough
ones to deal with actually have you had

492
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
ones to deal with actually have you had
 

493
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,070
ones to deal with actually have you had
moments like that yeah where you don't

494
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
moments like that yeah where you don't
 

495
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,430
moments like that yeah where you don't
understand how it happened you have to

496
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
understand how it happened you have to
 

497
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,710
understand how it happened you have to
watch footage to understand what

498
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
watch footage to understand what
 

499
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,150
watch footage to understand what
happened even when you watch it you're

500
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
happened even when you watch it you're
 

501
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,910
happened even when you watch it you're
just like

502
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:57,920
just like
 

503
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,389
just like
i don't get it like why wasn't i in a

504
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
i don't get it like why wasn't i in a
 

505
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,269
i don't get it like why wasn't i in a
position to stop this

506
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
position to stop this
 

507
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,829
position to stop this
it makes zero sense

508
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
it makes zero sense
 

509
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,350
it makes zero sense
conceptually when you watch it you're

510
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
conceptually when you watch it you're
 

511
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,630
conceptually when you watch it you're
like i understand how to play defense i

understand
 

515
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,910
understand
it looks like i'm in a defensive

516
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
it looks like i'm in a defensive
 

517
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,630
it looks like i'm in a defensive
position but at the end of the day

518
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
position but at the end of the day
 

519
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,030
position but at the end of the day

match
you have a

526
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
you have a
 

527
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,990
you have a
non-traditional gripping style yeah

528
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
non-traditional gripping style yeah
 

529

but on a greater sense
what you try to do is not necessarily

they've almost like relaxed for that
 

609
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,750
they've almost like relaxed for that
split second because you've

610
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760
split second because you've
 

611
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,550
split second because you've
lured them into like a sense of comfort

00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
turn your hips and go in for the throw
 

653
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,190
turn your hips and go in for the throw
i'm actually trying to

654
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
i'm actually trying to
 

655
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,829
i'm actually trying to
create

656
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839
create
 

657
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,990
create
a a sense of weightlessness for my lead

658
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
a a sense of weightlessness for my lead
 

659
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,069
a a sense of weightlessness for my lead
leg which would be my right leg

660
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079
leg which would be my right leg
 

661
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,829
leg which would be my right leg
and

662
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
and
 

663
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,710
and
a sense of resistance from my partner

664
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
a sense of resistance from my partner
 

665
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,949
a sense of resistance from my partner
so you aren't you both kind of leaning

666
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:54,959
so you aren't you both kind of leaning
 

667
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,790
so you aren't you both kind of leaning
into each other and it creates like an

668
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
into each other and it creates like an
 

669
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,069
into each other and it creates like an
a-frame

670
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
a-frame
 

671
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,670
a-frame
yeah but when the a-frame is held

672
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
yeah but when the a-frame is held
 

673
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,269
yeah but when the a-frame is held
together at the top half which would be

674
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
together at the top half which would be
 

675
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,110
together at the top half which would be
my left hand and their right hand posted

676
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
my left hand and their right hand posted
 

677
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,350
my left hand and their right hand posted
on each other's chest it means our legs

678
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
on each other's chest it means our legs
 

679
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,190
on each other's chest it means our legs
are free to move and our hips are free

680
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
are free to move and our hips are free
 

681
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,110
are free to move and our hips are free
to move right and they're not gonna feel

682
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
to move right and they're not gonna feel
 

683
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,030
to move right and they're not gonna feel
your leg move because of the

684
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
your leg move because of the
 

685
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,870
your leg move because of the
weightlessness and is there a feeling

686
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
weightlessness and is there a feeling
 

687
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,790
weightlessness and is there a feeling
like for them is there feeling like

688
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
like for them is there feeling like
 

689
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,470
like for them is there feeling like
nothing bad can happen here we're all

690
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
nothing bad can happen here we're all
 

691
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,389
nothing bad can happen here we're all
relaxed everything's fine

692
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:18,399
relaxed everything's fine
 

693
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,509
relaxed everything's fine
yeah

694
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
yeah
 

695
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,949
yeah
and then they're standing off at a funny

696
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
and then they're standing off at a funny
 

697
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,110
and then they're standing off at a funny
angle and before they know it i've spun

698
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
angle and before they know it i've spun
 

699
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,710
angle and before they know it i've spun
and my back is on their chest and they

700
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
and my back is on their chest and they
 

701
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,629
and my back is on their chest and they
can't go anywhere yeah

702
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
can't go anywhere yeah
 

703
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,629
can't go anywhere yeah
yeah uh how did you first develop that

704
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:28,639
yeah uh how did you first develop that
 

705
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,710
yeah uh how did you first develop that
throw so for people um

706
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
throw so for people um
 

707
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,870
throw so for people um
it's called ippon seinagi which means

708
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
it's called ippon seinagi which means
 

709
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,190
it's called ippon seinagi which means
your right hand goes under their like

710
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
your right hand goes under their like
 

711
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,790
your right hand goes under their like
armpit area

712
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800
armpit area
 

713
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,269
armpit area
and that that's like a vice that

714
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
and that that's like a vice that
 

715
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,230
and that that's like a vice that
connects you to them yeah and then they

716
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,240
connects you to them yeah and then they
 

717
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,150
connects you to them yeah and then they
get go on for the ride yep the

718
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
get go on for the ride yep the
 

719
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,829
get go on for the ride yep the
interesting thing with the standing one

720
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
interesting thing with the standing one
 

721
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,590
interesting thing with the standing one
is uh as opposed to drop sanagi version

722
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
is uh as opposed to drop sanagi version
 

723
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,470
is uh as opposed to drop sanagi version
the drop saying you kind of um

724
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
the drop saying you kind of um
 

725
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,030
the drop saying you kind of um
drop under them and because there's the

726
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
drop under them and because there's the
 

727
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,350
drop under them and because there's the
vice they're like pulled

728
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:57,360
vice they're like pulled
 

729
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,389
vice they're like pulled
pulled under and like over yeah

730
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
pulled under and like over yeah
 

731
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,030
pulled under and like over yeah
with the standing one i suppose there's

732
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
with the standing one i suppose there's
 

733
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,269
with the standing one i suppose there's
some similar physics but you're kind of

734
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
some similar physics but you're kind of
 

735
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,269
some similar physics but you're kind of
loading them onto your hip

736
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
loading them onto your hip
 

737
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,350
loading them onto your hip
and so they're in the air

738
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
and so they're in the air
 

739
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,269
and so they're in the air
while you're standing still

740
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
while you're standing still
 

741
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,509
while you're standing still
there's there's a there's a sense in

742
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
there's there's a there's a sense in
 

743
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,110
there's there's a there's a sense in
which they're

744
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
which they're
 

745
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,750
which they're
like you're lifting them above

746
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
like you're lifting them above
 

747
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,990
like you're lifting them above
where they started yes

748
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
where they started yes
 

749
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,150
where they started yes
that's how you get the really big error

750
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
that's how you get the really big error
 

751
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,389
that's how you get the really big error
yeah if obviously if

752
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:24,399
yeah if obviously if
 

753
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,750
yeah if obviously if
um

754
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
um
 

755
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,670
um
if everything is right so how did you

756
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
if everything is right so how did you
 

757
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,910
if everything is right so how did you
first develop that how did you first i

758
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920
first develop that how did you first i
 

759
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,590
first develop that how did you first i
first learned just learning like the

760
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
first learned just learning like the
 

761
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,710
first learned just learning like the
very basics of the throw you know foot

762
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
very basics of the throw you know foot
 

763
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,790
very basics of the throw you know foot
placement all that kind of stuff and

764
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
placement all that kind of stuff and
 

765
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,829
placement all that kind of stuff and
then

766
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
then
 

767
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,509
then
you know like anything the basics are

768
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,519
you know like anything the basics are
 

769
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,629
you know like anything the basics are
nice

770
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
nice
 

771
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,030
nice
um but once you get good at the basics

772
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
um but once you get good at the basics
 

773
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,269
um but once you get good at the basics
it's it's very easy to stop but it gives

774
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
it's it's very easy to stop but it gives
 

775
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,430
it's it's very easy to stop but it gives
you a good like fundamental platform to

776
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
you a good like fundamental platform to
 

777
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,350
you a good like fundamental platform to
learn off of and

778
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
learn off of and
 

779
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,350
learn off of and
to expand off of

780
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:51,360
to expand off of
 

781
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,430
to expand off of
and then i expanded when i first started

782
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440
and then i expanded when i first started
 

783
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,230
and then i expanded when i first started

basic like root of it
there's a philosophy and a mentality of

974
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
there's a philosophy and a mentality of
 

975
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,949
there's a philosophy and a mentality of
judo of how the throes work

976
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
judo of how the throes work
 

977
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,710
judo of how the throes work
right there's a mechanical structure

978
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
right there's a mechanical structure
 

979
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,150
right there's a mechanical structure
there like

980
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
there like
 

981
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,110
there like
this makes sense if i follow that

982
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
this makes sense if i follow that
 

983
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,909
this makes sense if i follow that
principle i can do anything i want

984
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
principle i can do anything i want
 

985
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,909
principle i can do anything i want
nothing else matters as long as we

986
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
nothing else matters as long as we
 

987
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,069
nothing else matters as long as we
follow those core principles so in the

988
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:26,079
follow those core principles so in the
 

989
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,750
follow those core principles so in the
early days even

990
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
early days even
 

991
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,430
early days even
even then you were able to think on your

992
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
even then you were able to think on your
 

993
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,390
even then you were able to think on your
own yeah and i was able to develop a

994
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
own yeah and i was able to develop a
 

995
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,710
own yeah and i was able to develop a
pattern for my foot placement

996
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
pattern for my foot placement
 

997
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,630
pattern for my foot placement
based on my opponent's height

998
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
based on my opponent's height
 

999
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,510
based on my opponent's height
because

1000
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:37,520
because
 

1001
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,350
because
the number one thing any judo coach will

1002
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
the number one thing any judo coach will
 

1003
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,630
the number one thing any judo coach will
tell you is you need your center of

1004
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
tell you is you need your center of
 

1005
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,549
tell you is you need your center of
gravity below yours

1006
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
gravity below yours
 

1007
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,630
gravity below yours
well now i now i know exactly where to

1008
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
well now i now i know exactly where to
 

1009
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,190
well now i now i know exactly where to
put my feet because the shorter you are

1010
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
put my feet because the shorter you are
 

1011
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,190
put my feet because the shorter you are
the bigger the split because the lower i

1012
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,200
the bigger the split because the lower i
 

1013
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,710
the bigger the split because the lower i
need to get the taller you are the less

1014
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
need to get the taller you are the less
 

1015
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,470
need to get the taller you are the less
of a split i need

1016
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
of a split i need
 

1017
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,350
of a split i need
is there something you can say about

1018
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
is there something you can say about
 

1019
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,150
is there something you can say about
fundamental principles of judo is there

1020
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,160
fundamental principles of judo is there
 

1021
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,350
fundamental principles of judo is there
over all that time not 20 over 20 years

1022
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:01,360
over all that time not 20 over 20 years
 

1023
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,270
over all that time not 20 over 20 years
that you've been doing judo

1024
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
that you've been doing judo
 

1025
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,870
that you've been doing judo
uh it's not approaching 30 is it

1026
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:06,880
uh it's not approaching 30 is it
 

1027
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,950
uh it's not approaching 30 is it
yeah it's it's yeah getting it's going

1028
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
yeah it's it's yeah getting it's going
 

1029
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,150
yeah it's it's yeah getting it's going
getting there okay

1030
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
getting there okay
 

1031
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,510
getting there okay
we're a couple years away let's get in

1032
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
we're a couple years away let's get in
 

1033
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,470
we're a couple years away let's get in
there

1034
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
there
 

1035
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,590
there
um

1036
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
um
 

1037
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,110
um
is there some like

1038
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
is there some like
 

1039
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,270
is there some like
principles that have emerged like you

1040
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
principles that have emerged like you
 

1041
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,110
principles that have emerged like you
said you have to have your center of

1042
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,120
said you have to have your center of
 

1043
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,590
said you have to have your center of
gravity below theirs yeah is there other

1044
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
gravity below theirs yeah is there other
 

1045
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,150
gravity below theirs yeah is there other
kind of both on the gripping side the

1046
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
kind of both on the gripping side the
 

1047
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,750
kind of both on the gripping side the
footwork side

1048
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760
footwork side
 

1049
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,950
footwork side
leverage

1050
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:26,960
leverage
 

1051
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,630
leverage
anything you can speak to there's some

1052
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
anything you can speak to there's some
 

1053
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,430
anything you can speak to there's some
that

1054
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
that
 

1055
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,190
that
have withstood like

1056
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
have withstood like
 

1057
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,590
have withstood like
time like

1058
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600
time like
 

1059
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,430
time like
you have to be able to get below their

1060
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
you have to be able to get below their
 

1061
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,870
you have to be able to get below their
center of gravity because you have to be

1062
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
center of gravity because you have to be
 

1063
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,789
center of gravity because you have to be
able to rotate them

1064
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
able to rotate them
 

1065
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,950
able to rotate them
around their center of gravity and then

1066
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:40,960
around their center of gravity and then
 

1067
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,870
around their center of gravity and then
the other one is

1068
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
the other one is
 

1069
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,549
the other one is
that was always a principle when i was

1070
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
that was always a principle when i was
 

1071
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,070
that was always a principle when i was
growing up and i didn't change until

1072
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
growing up and i didn't change until
 

1073
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,549
growing up and i didn't change until
later on in my career was you have to be

1074
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
later on in my career was you have to be
 

1075
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,990
later on in my career was you have to be
able to pull

1076
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000
able to pull
 

1077
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,990
able to pull
you need to be able to pull to get them

1078
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,000
you need to be able to pull to get them
 

1079
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,669
you need to be able to pull to get them
off balance

1080
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
off balance
 

1081
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,590
off balance
but when you think about that statement

1082
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
but when you think about that statement
 

1083
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,909
but when you think about that statement
as a whole it ended with they have to be

1084
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
as a whole it ended with they have to be
 

1085
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,350
as a whole it ended with they have to be
off balance

1086
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
off balance
 

1087
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,029
off balance
i don't need the pull to get you off

1088
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:01,039
i don't need the pull to get you off
 

1089
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,830
i don't need the pull to get you off
balance i just need you off balance

1090
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
balance i just need you off balance
 

1091
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,590
balance i just need you off balance
and when you think about it that way it

1092
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:05,600
and when you think about it that way it
 

1093
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,390
and when you think about it that way it
allows you to open up the doors to

1094
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
allows you to open up the doors to
 

1095
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,310
allows you to open up the doors to
what do i need to do to get you off

1096
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
what do i need to do to get you off
 

1097
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,110
what do i need to do to get you off
balance i could push pull i could flinch

1098
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
balance i could push pull i could flinch
 

1099
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,590
balance i could push pull i could flinch
i could fake and you could put yourself

1100
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
i could fake and you could put yourself
 

1101
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,470
i could fake and you could put yourself
in your own off balance state

1102
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480
in your own off balance state
 

1103
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,789
in your own off balance state
right when you think about people who

1104
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,799
right when you think about people who
 

1105
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,990
right when you think about people who
wrestle right if i fake shoot it causes

1106
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
wrestle right if i fake shoot it causes
 

1107
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,669
wrestle right if i fake shoot it causes
you to over lean forward which means

1108
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:25,679
you to over lean forward which means
 

1109
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,110
you to over lean forward which means
you're off balance

1110
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
you're off balance
 

1111
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,710
you're off balance
there's no pull there's no push there's

1112
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
there's no pull there's no push there's
 

1113
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,190
there's no pull there's no push there's
no nothing i just get a reaction that

1114
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200
no nothing i just get a reaction that
 

1115
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,110
no nothing i just get a reaction that
leaves the opportunity in the door open

1116
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
leaves the opportunity in the door open
 

1117
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,470
leaves the opportunity in the door open
for an attack

1118
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,480
for an attack
 

1119
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,990
for an attack
and that off balance could be very

1120
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
and that off balance could be very
 

1121
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,789
and that off balance could be very
subtle it could be very subtle and the

1122
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
subtle it could be very subtle and the
 

1123
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,390
subtle it could be very subtle and the
better you get and the more skills you

1124
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
better you get and the more skills you
 

1125
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,110
better you get and the more skills you
get

1126
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
get
 

1127
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,710
get
the less subtle it is

1128
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720

 

1129
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,230

so we should also mention that there is

1130
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
so we should also mention that there is
 

1131
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,390
so we should also mention that there is
something called forward throws

1132
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
something called forward throws
 

1133
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,830
something called forward throws
where you

1134
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:49,840
where you
 

1135
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,830
where you
throw the person

1136
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:51,840
throw the person
 

1137
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,990
throw the person
you know they they're going to fly

1138
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
you know they they're going to fly
 

1139
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,909
you know they they're going to fly
facing forward they're going to fly

1140
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
facing forward they're going to fly
 

1141
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,310
facing forward they're going to fly
forward and then a backward throw is

1142
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,320
forward and then a backward throw is
 

1143
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,870
forward and then a backward throw is
they're going to fly back yep and then

1144
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:00,880
they're going to fly back yep and then
 

1145
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,710
they're going to fly back yep and then
there's lateral you know they actually

1146
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
there's lateral you know they actually
 

1147
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,510
there's lateral you know they actually
go sideways over like a cartwheel almost

1148
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
go sideways over like a cartwheel almost
 

1149
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,149
go sideways over like a cartwheel almost
okay so the forward throws there's the

1150
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
okay so the forward throws there's the
 

1151
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,990
okay so the forward throws there's the
one we've been talking about which is uh

1152
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
one we've been talking about which is uh
 

1153
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,270
one we've been talking about which is uh
say nagi and there's a bunch of

1154
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
say nagi and there's a bunch of
 

1155
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,070
say nagi and there's a bunch of
different variants ippon marote seinagi

1156
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,080
different variants ippon marote seinagi
 

1157
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,590
different variants ippon marote seinagi
there's drop and there's standing

1158
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
there's drop and there's standing
 

1159
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,070
there's drop and there's standing
versions of them and that all

1160
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,080
versions of them and that all
 

1161
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,190
versions of them and that all
i don't know if there's a way to

1162
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:19,200
i don't know if there's a way to
 

1163
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,470
i don't know if there's a way to
summarize it

1164
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
summarize it
 

1165
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,070
summarize it
but that's like as clean as uh getting

1166
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
but that's like as clean as uh getting
 

1167
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,230
but that's like as clean as uh getting
your center of gravity under theirs

1168
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
your center of gravity under theirs
 

1169
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,669
your center of gravity under theirs
as it gets

1170
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
as it gets
 

1171
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,110
as it gets
and then the rest is just gripping

1172
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
and then the rest is just gripping
 

1173
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,510
and then the rest is just gripping
variations yep i guess it's all gripping

1174
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
variations yep i guess it's all gripping
 

1175
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,470
variations yep i guess it's all gripping
variations on all of these throws but um

1176
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
variations on all of these throws but um
 

1177
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,950
variations on all of these throws but um
and then uh there's

1178
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
and then uh there's
 

1179
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,710
and then uh there's
uh in terms of forward throws there's

1180
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:40,720
uh in terms of forward throws there's
 

1181
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,110
uh in terms of forward throws there's
the other big one in competition is

1182
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,120
the other big one in competition is
 

1183
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,470
the other big one in competition is
uchimada

1184
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480
uchimada
 

1185
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,549
uchimada
which is

1186
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:46,559
which is
 

1187
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,390
which is
i don't know we can try to explain that

1188
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
i don't know we can try to explain that
 

1189
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,149
i don't know we can try to explain that
one but it uh ends up being where

1190
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
one but it uh ends up being where
 

1191
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,990
one but it uh ends up being where
one or you're standing on just one of

1192
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
one or you're standing on just one of
 

1193
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,110
one or you're standing on just one of
your feet

1194
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,120
your feet
 

1195
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,350
your feet
and the other one is up in the air and i

1196
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:57,360
and the other one is up in the air and i
 

1197
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,630
and the other one is up in the air and i
don't know if you put in that same

1198
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
don't know if you put in that same
 

1199
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,750
don't know if you put in that same
category haragoshi like

1200
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:01,760
category haragoshi like
 

1201
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,350
category haragoshi like
those kinds of throws where you're kind

1202
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,360
those kinds of throws where you're kind
 

1203
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,149
those kinds of throws where you're kind
of a little bit single footed yeah and

1204
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
of a little bit single footed yeah and
 

1205
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,750
of a little bit single footed yeah and
so there's two footed techniques and

1206
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:07,760
so there's two footed techniques and
 

1207
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,590
so there's two footed techniques and
then there's a single footed yeah oh

1208
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
then there's a single footed yeah oh
 

1209
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,909
then there's a single footed yeah oh
goshi where it's like

1210
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919
goshi where it's like
 

1211
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,870
goshi where it's like
you're doing a mix between the uchimada

1212
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:14,880
you're doing a mix between the uchimada
 

1213
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,710
you're doing a mix between the uchimada
and

1214
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
and
 

1215
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,070
and
it's a hug

1216
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
it's a hug
 

1217
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,230
it's a hug
you you hug a person and then you turn

1218
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
you you hug a person and then you turn
 

1219
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,390
you you hug a person and then you turn
your hips around such that you're now

1220
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
your hips around such that you're now
 

1221
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,470
your hips around such that you're now
hugging facing the same direction when

1222
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
hugging facing the same direction when
 

1223
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,710
hugging facing the same direction when
it comes to forward throw there's

1224
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:26,720
it comes to forward throw there's
 

1225
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,230
it comes to forward throw there's
regardless of the name of the throw or

1226
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
regardless of the name of the throw or
 

1227
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,630
regardless of the name of the throw or
the gripping variation that you're using

1228
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
the gripping variation that you're using
 

1229
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,470
the gripping variation that you're using
the whole principle is how do i get this

1230
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:34,480
the whole principle is how do i get this
 

1231
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,510
the whole principle is how do i get this
person to do a forward roll in midair

1232
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
person to do a forward roll in midair
 

1233
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,070
person to do a forward roll in midair
and land on their back

1234
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
and land on their back
 

1235
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,549
and land on their back
the more of a forward roll i can get the

1236
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
the more of a forward roll i can get the
 

1237
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,950
the more of a forward roll i can get the
bigger the score if i get like

1238
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:44,960
bigger the score if i get like
 

1239
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,549
bigger the score if i get like
a quarter of a turn where like you land

1240
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
a quarter of a turn where like you land
 

1241
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,070
a quarter of a turn where like you land
on your side and you don't go over your

1242
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,080
on your side and you don't go over your
 

1243
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,350
on your side and you don't go over your
back it's a half score yeah but they all

1244
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:51,360
back it's a half score yeah but they all
 

1245
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,909
back it's a half score yeah but they all
require me to get you to do that forward

1246
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:53,919
require me to get you to do that forward
 

1247
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,990
require me to get you to do that forward
rolling action so just if we think of

1248
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,000
rolling action so just if we think of
 

1249
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,630
rolling action so just if we think of
one person if they do this nice

1250
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
one person if they do this nice
 

1251
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,789
one person if they do this nice
leap forward and they do a roll and

1252
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:00,799
leap forward and they do a roll and
 

1253
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,870
leap forward and they do a roll and
their back nicely rolls over the ground

1254
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
their back nicely rolls over the ground
 

1255
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,470
their back nicely rolls over the ground
you're trying to do the exact same thing

1256
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
you're trying to do the exact same thing
 

1257
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,630
you're trying to do the exact same thing
with you connected to them well and if

1258
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
with you connected to them well and if
 

1259
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,950
with you connected to them well and if
it's nice and it's smooth it's probably

1260
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:08,960
it's nice and it's smooth it's probably
 

1261
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,830
it's nice and it's smooth it's probably
not a full score it needs to have like

1262
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
not a full score it needs to have like
 

1263
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,950
not a full score it needs to have like
somewhat of a violent impact

1264
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:14,960
somewhat of a violent impact
 

1265
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,549
somewhat of a violent impact
right so if you think of a drop saying

1266
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:16,559
right so if you think of a drop saying
 

1267
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,830
right so if you think of a drop saying
agi if i

1268
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:17,840
agi if i
 

1269
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,750
agi if i
if i'm moving too slow

1270
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:19,760
if i'm moving too slow
 

1271
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,510
if i'm moving too slow
and you still roll over your shoulders

1272
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
and you still roll over your shoulders
 

1273
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,750
and you still roll over your shoulders
and there's no direct impact it's only a

1274
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
and there's no direct impact it's only a
 

1275
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,110
and there's no direct impact it's only a
half score right they want the force

1276
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,120
half score right they want the force
 

1277
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,990
half score right they want the force
the force the violence that's good

1278
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
the force the violence that's good
 

1279
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,310
the force the violence that's good
okay uh so then uh

1280
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:32,320
okay uh so then uh
 

1281
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,750
okay uh so then uh
in terms of uh backward throws

1282
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:35,760
in terms of uh backward throws
 

1283
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,630
in terms of uh backward throws
the traditional ones there's stuff where

1284
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:38,640
the traditional ones there's stuff where
 

1285
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,549
the traditional ones there's stuff where
you trip them

1286
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:40,559
you trip them
 

1287
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,070
you trip them
from outside their body like osotogari

1288
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
from outside their body like osotogari
 

1289
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,870
from outside their body like osotogari
it's a trip where you hook your leg onto

1290
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
it's a trip where you hook your leg onto
 

1291
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,270
it's a trip where you hook your leg onto
their leg and you trip them but your

1292
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
their leg and you trip them but your
 

1293
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,070
their leg and you trip them but your
hook it goes outside of their legs and

1294
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,080
hook it goes outside of their legs and
 

1295
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,470
hook it goes outside of their legs and
then there's the trips from inside

1296
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:54,480
then there's the trips from inside
 

1297
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,789
then there's the trips from inside
their body there's uh one foot is called

1298
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:57,799
their body there's uh one foot is called
 

1299
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,230
their body there's uh one foot is called
kuchigari and then the other is ochigari

1300
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
kuchigari and then the other is ochigari
 

1301
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,149
kuchigari and then the other is ochigari
it doesn't matter the the most important

1302
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
it doesn't matter the the most important
 

1303
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,270
it doesn't matter the the most important
thing is outside and inside

1304
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,280
thing is outside and inside
 

1305
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,510
thing is outside and inside
uh and then there's like i don't even

1306
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
uh and then there's like i don't even
 

1307
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,110
uh and then there's like i don't even
know how you throw them sideways except

1308
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
know how you throw them sideways except
 

1309
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,470
know how you throw them sideways except
foot sweeps and then there's the foot

1310
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:10,480
foot sweeps and then there's the foot
 

1311
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,310
foot sweeps and then there's the foot
sweeps where you can

1312
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,320
sweeps where you can
 

1313
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,789
sweeps where you can
sweep one of their legs from out of them

1314
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
sweep one of their legs from out of them
 

1315
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,029
sweep one of their legs from out of them
or both their legs at the same time

1316
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
or both their legs at the same time
 

1317
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,950
or both their legs at the same time
and like we were talking about this kind

1318
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:18,960
and like we were talking about this kind
 

1319
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,990
and like we were talking about this kind
of

1320
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000
of
 

1321
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,549
of
is when timed perfectly it's it's

1322
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
is when timed perfectly it's it's
 

1323
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,070
is when timed perfectly it's it's
effortless for everybody involved and uh

1324
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
effortless for everybody involved and uh
 

1325
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,190
effortless for everybody involved and uh
the ending like you said is big dramatic

1326
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:29,200
the ending like you said is big dramatic
 

1327
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,430
the ending like you said is big dramatic
and violent yeah

1328
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
and violent yeah
 

1329
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,510
and violent yeah
is there other kind of oh yeah there's

1330
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:33,520
is there other kind of oh yeah there's
 

1331
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,390
is there other kind of oh yeah there's
uh sacrifice techniques

1332
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:36,400
uh sacrifice techniques
 

1333
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,990
uh sacrifice techniques
there's a bunch of them

1334
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000
there's a bunch of them
 

1335
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,669
there's a bunch of them
and that ultimately the variations have

1336
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
and that ultimately the variations have
 

1337
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,230
and that ultimately the variations have
to do with uh gripping but you're

1338
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:42,240
to do with uh gripping but you're
 

1339
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,789
to do with uh gripping but you're
basically you the attacker fall onto

1340
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
basically you the attacker fall onto
 

1341
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,149
basically you the attacker fall onto
your back

1342
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,159
your back
 

1343
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,870
your back
sticking your legs somewhere on

1344
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
sticking your legs somewhere on
 

1345
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,549
sticking your legs somewhere on
onto their body which is like this

1346
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:50,559
onto their body which is like this
 

1347
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,029
onto their body which is like this
fulcrum over which they fly and do that

1348
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
fulcrum over which they fly and do that
 

1349
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,630
fulcrum over which they fly and do that
same kind of role that you mentioned you

1350
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:54,640
same kind of role that you mentioned you
 

1351
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,789
same kind of role that you mentioned you
basically sacrifice your back to the mat

1352
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
basically sacrifice your back to the mat
 

1353
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,029
basically sacrifice your back to the mat
in order to throw them into that

1354
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
in order to throw them into that
 

1355
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,510
in order to throw them into that
circular pattern so they hit their back

1356
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
circular pattern so they hit their back
 

1357
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,190
circular pattern so they hit their back
sometimes we use a foot sometimes we

1358
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
sometimes we use a foot sometimes we
 

1359
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,390
sometimes we use a foot sometimes we
don't and so we should probably say

1360
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
don't and so we should probably say
 

1361
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,269
don't and so we should probably say
it's okay for you to go on to your back

1362
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:09,279
it's okay for you to go on to your back
 

1363
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,510
it's okay for you to go on to your back
as long as you're clearly demonstrating

1364
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
as long as you're clearly demonstrating
 

1365
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,990
as long as you're clearly demonstrating
control over the other person's body

1366
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
control over the other person's body
 

1367
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,630
control over the other person's body
correct you can't go to your back in the

1368
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,640
correct you can't go to your back in the
 

1369
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,269
correct you can't go to your back in the
same direction that your opponent is

1370
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
same direction that your opponent is
 

1371
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,070
same direction that your opponent is
trying to put you to your back right you

1372
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
trying to put you to your back right you
 

1373
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,149
trying to put you to your back right you
have to go the other way or you have to

1374
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
have to go the other way or you have to
 

1375
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:25,510
have to go the other way or you have to
initiate

1376
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
initiate
 

1377
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,830
initiate
you going to your own back

1378
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
you going to your own back
 

1379
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,710
you going to your own back
right

1380
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
right
 

1381
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,310
right
uh like clearly and then um and then

1382
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
uh like clearly and then um and then
 

1383
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,310
uh like clearly and then um and then
there's all the counters which almost

1384
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,320
there's all the counters which almost
 

1385
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,430
there's all the counters which almost
kind of

1386
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,440
kind of
 

1387
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,510
kind of
have a whole group of their own even

1388
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:37,520
have a whole group of their own even
 

1389
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,950
have a whole group of their own even
though they have

1390
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:38,960
though they have
 

1391
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,950
though they have
echoes of the same types of techniques

1392
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:40,960
echoes of the same types of techniques
 

1393
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,549
echoes of the same types of techniques
it seems like they're their own whole

1394
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
it seems like they're their own whole
 

1395
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,549
it seems like they're their own whole
thing yeah but they follow the same

1396
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:44,559
thing yeah but they follow the same
 

1397
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,029
thing yeah but they follow the same
principles it's just most

1398
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
principles it's just most
 

1399
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,590
principles it's just most
counters like if you wanted to counter

1400
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
counters like if you wanted to counter
 

1401
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,830
counters like if you wanted to counter
enuchimata for example

1402
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
enuchimata for example
 

1403
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,669
enuchimata for example
you're trying to throw me in a

1404
00:24:53,669 --> 00:24:53,679
you're trying to throw me in a
 

1405
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,390
you're trying to throw me in a
somersault over my right shoulder

1406
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
somersault over my right shoulder
 

1407
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,549
somersault over my right shoulder
therefore i would counter you by

1408
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
therefore i would counter you by
 

1409
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,590
therefore i would counter you by
throwing you over your left shoulder

1410
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:01,600
throwing you over your left shoulder
 

1411
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,110
throwing you over your left shoulder
it goes in the opposite shoulder

1412
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
it goes in the opposite shoulder
 

1413
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,909
it goes in the opposite shoulder
direction but in the same somersault

1414
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,919
direction but in the same somersault
 

1415
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,789
direction but in the same somersault
idea

1416
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
idea
 

1417
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,230
idea
and there used to be

1418
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240
and there used to be
 

1419
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,149
and there used to be
i already at this point forget the years

1420
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
i already at this point forget the years
 

1421
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,549
i already at this point forget the years
but it might be 20 before the 2012

1422
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
but it might be 20 before the 2012
 

1423
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,430
but it might be 20 before the 2012
olympics where they banned uh you you

1424
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,440
olympics where they banned uh you you
 

1425
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,350
olympics where they banned uh you you
used to be allowed to grab legs in the

1426
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:17,360
used to be allowed to grab legs in the
 

1427
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,909
used to be allowed to grab legs in the
same way you do in wrestling so you have

1428
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
same way you do in wrestling so you have
 

1429
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,510
same way you do in wrestling so you have
basically all the techniques you would

1430
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
basically all the techniques you would
 

1431
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,750
basically all the techniques you would
have in wrestling

1432
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
have in wrestling
 

1433
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,990
have in wrestling
available to you if you would like

1434
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
available to you if you would like
 

1435
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,669
available to you if you would like
yeah it's just that some of the

1436
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
yeah it's just that some of the
 

1437
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,430
yeah it's just that some of the
techniques in wrestling are not that

1438
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
techniques in wrestling are not that
 

1439
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,269
techniques in wrestling are not that
effective for getting your opponent your

1440
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:31,279
effective for getting your opponent your
 

1441
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,630
effective for getting your opponent your
to their back

1442
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
to their back
 

1443
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,230
to their back
wrestlers want to take the other person

1444
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
wrestlers want to take the other person
 

1445
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,830
wrestlers want to take the other person
down in any way possible and have

1446
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
down in any way possible and have
 

1447
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,149
down in any way possible and have

go is
i guess what's called the fireman's

1602
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
i guess what's called the fireman's
 

1603
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,029
i guess what's called the fireman's
carry

1604
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
carry
 

1605
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,029
carry
which is uh

1606
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:39,039
which is uh
 

1607
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,269
which is uh
you know it does lead to judo like

1608
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,279
you know it does lead to judo like
 

1609
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,510
you know it does lead to judo like
beautiful throws and the fact that that

1610
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,520
beautiful throws and the fact that that
 

1611
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,630
beautiful throws and the fact that that
was gone is is that one i missed a

1612
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:46,640
was gone is is that one i missed a
 

1613
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,710
was gone is is that one i missed a
little bit but then a bunch of people i

1614
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:48,720
little bit but then a bunch of people i
 

1615
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,630
little bit but then a bunch of people i
guess came up with the variance where

1616
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:50,640
guess came up with the variance where
 

1617
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,870
guess came up with the variance where
you don't need to grab the leg

1618
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:52,880
you don't need to grab the leg
 

1619
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,750
you don't need to grab the leg
it's definitely not as effective as

1620
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:55,760
it's definitely not as effective as
 

1621
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,789
it's definitely not as effective as
being able to grab it but i'm also on

1622
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
being able to grab it but i'm also on
 

1623
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,870
being able to grab it but i'm also on
the side of the fence having competed in

1624
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,880
the side of the fence having competed in
 

1625
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,909
the side of the fence having competed in
all three

1626
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
all three
 

1627
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,149
all three
it was definitely better for the sport

1628
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159
it was definitely better for the sport
 

1629
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,669
it was definitely better for the sport
to remove it

1630
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
to remove it
 

1631
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,029
to remove it
as a whole

1632
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
as a whole
 

1633
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,630
as a whole
it's probably good to cover sort of the

1634
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
it's probably good to cover sort of the
 

1635
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,190
it's probably good to cover sort of the
whole spectrum of rules of judo is uh

1636
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
whole spectrum of rules of judo is uh
 

1637
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,070
whole spectrum of rules of judo is uh
there's groundwork so there's uh you do

1638
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,080
there's groundwork so there's uh you do
 

1639
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,350
there's groundwork so there's uh you do
all the stuff on the feet where you're

1640
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
all the stuff on the feet where you're
 

1641
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,190
all the stuff on the feet where you're
trying to murder each other with a giant

1642
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
trying to murder each other with a giant
 

1643
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,590
trying to murder each other with a giant
throw but then you know if the throat

1644
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
throw but then you know if the throat
 

1645
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,070
throw but then you know if the throat
doesn't succeed you go to the ground and

1646
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
doesn't succeed you go to the ground and
 

1647
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,430
doesn't succeed you go to the ground and
you stay on the ground for some amount

1648
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
you stay on the ground for some amount
 

1649
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,269
you stay on the ground for some amount
of time like short amount of time you

1650
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,279
of time like short amount of time you
 

1651
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,870
of time like short amount of time you
have to move quickly you have to be

1652
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
have to move quickly you have to be
 

1653
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,870
have to move quickly you have to be
attacking and

1654
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:28,880
attacking and
 

1655
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,549
attacking and
two of the ways you can win

1656
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:30,559
two of the ways you can win
 

1657
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,950
two of the ways you can win
is similar to people who do jiu jitsu's

1658
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
is similar to people who do jiu jitsu's
 

1659
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,630
is similar to people who do jiu jitsu's
you can submit them

1660
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:34,640
you can submit them
 

1661
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,110
you can submit them
uh chokes arm breaks all that kind of

1662
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
uh chokes arm breaks all that kind of
 

1663
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,269
uh chokes arm breaks all that kind of
stuff no foot locks

1664
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
stuff no foot locks
 

1665
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,870
stuff no foot locks
and uh

1666
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
and uh
 

1667
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,310
and uh
and you can also

1668
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
and you can also
 

1669
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,230
and you can also
pin them yep which is get around their

1670
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,240
pin them yep which is get around their
 

1671
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,149
pin them yep which is get around their
legs and this is very

1672
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
legs and this is very
 

1673
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,230
legs and this is very
no this is not like wrestling you have

1674
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:48,240
no this is not like wrestling you have
 

1675
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,310
no this is not like wrestling you have
to actually get around their legs

1676
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,320
to actually get around their legs
 

1677
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,389
to actually get around their legs
and uh pin them and

1678
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
and uh pin them and
 

1679
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,909
and uh pin them and
what indigest is called side control

1680
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:53,919
what indigest is called side control
 

1681
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,830
what indigest is called side control
mount all kinds of ways that doesn't

1682
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:55,840
mount all kinds of ways that doesn't
 

1683
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,830
mount all kinds of ways that doesn't
involve their legs yeah and then you pin

1684
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
involve their legs yeah and then you pin
 

1685
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,909
involve their legs yeah and then you pin
them for like whatever 20 seconds 25

1686
00:29:59,909 --> 00:29:59,919
them for like whatever 20 seconds 25
 

1687
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,389
them for like whatever 20 seconds 25
seconds yeah 20 seconds now i think the

1688
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:02,399
seconds yeah 20 seconds now i think the
 

1689
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,990
seconds yeah 20 seconds now i think the
distinction is

1690
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
distinction is
 

1691
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,389
distinction is
their back has to be facing the mat

1692
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:06,399
their back has to be facing the mat
 

1693
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,470
their back has to be facing the mat
you have to be past their legs and your

1694
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
you have to be past their legs and your
 

1695
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,470
you have to be past their legs and your
chest has to be on the same plane as

1696
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:10,480
chest has to be on the same plane as
 

1697
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,470
chest has to be on the same plane as
theirs yeah so it doesn't have to

1698
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
theirs yeah so it doesn't have to
 

1699
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,789
theirs yeah so it doesn't have to
necessarily be on top but it has to be

1700
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:14,799
necessarily be on top but it has to be
 

1701
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,110
necessarily be on top but it has to be
on the same plane yeah and all of this

1702
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,120
on the same plane yeah and all of this
 

1703
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,310
on the same plane yeah and all of this
is

1704
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:18,320
is
 

1705
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,190
is
i think

1706
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200
i think
 

1707
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,710
i think
different sports of different versions

1708
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
different sports of different versions
 

1709
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,389
different sports of different versions
of this but it's like

1710
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:22,399
of this but it's like
 

1711
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,630
of this but it's like
an approximation of what dominance looks

1712
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:24,640
an approximation of what dominance looks
 

1713
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,070
an approximation of what dominance looks
like yeah so pin and wrestling is

1714
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,080
like yeah so pin and wrestling is
 

1715
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,830
like yeah so pin and wrestling is
dominating your opponent presumably if

1716
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:29,840
dominating your opponent presumably if
 

1717
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,990
dominating your opponent presumably if
you're in a street fight that position

1718
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
you're in a street fight that position
 

1719
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,070
you're in a street fight that position
allows you to then do a lot of damage

1720
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
allows you to then do a lot of damage
 

1721
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,669
allows you to then do a lot of damage
obviously submissions is dominance

1722
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:35,679
obviously submissions is dominance
 

1723
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,190
obviously submissions is dominance
because you're breaking their arm or

1724
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,200
because you're breaking their arm or
 

1725
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,190
because you're breaking their arm or
choking them to uh

1726
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,200
choking them to uh
 

1727
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,389
choking them to uh
unconscious

1728
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:40,399
unconscious
 

1729
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,310
unconscious
and then obviously the throw

1730
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,320
and then obviously the throw
 

1731
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,990
and then obviously the throw
which is not often

1732
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:44,000
which is not often
 

1733
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,590
which is not often
talked about but like if you talk about

1734
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:45,600
talked about but like if you talk about
 

1735
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,870
talked about but like if you talk about
a street

1736
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:46,880
a street
 

1737
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,269
a street
fight situation a throw

1738
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
fight situation a throw
 

1739
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,389
fight situation a throw
is like the best way to murder somebody

1740
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:52,399
is like the best way to murder somebody
 

1741
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,269
is like the best way to murder somebody
like this could end anyone's life yes

1742
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:55,279
like this could end anyone's life yes
 

1743
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,190
like this could end anyone's life yes
it's terrifying actually so okay so

1744
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
it's terrifying actually so okay so
 

1745
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,389
it's terrifying actually so okay so
these are all elements of dominance

1746
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
these are all elements of dominance
 

1747
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,110
these are all elements of dominance
so

1748
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
so
 

1749
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,110
so
going back to set of principles you're

1750
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,120
going back to set of principles you're
 

1751
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,470
going back to set of principles you're
mentioning

1752
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
mentioning
 

1753
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,710
mentioning
getting your center of mass under theirs

1754
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
getting your center of mass under theirs
 

1755
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,669
getting your center of mass under theirs
which i think applies for type of um

1756
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:09,679
which i think applies for type of um
 

1757
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,590
which i think applies for type of um
like the forward say nagi throws is

1758
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
like the forward say nagi throws is
 

1759
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,909
like the forward say nagi throws is
there is there other stuff

1760
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:13,919
there is there other stuff
 

1761
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,830
there is there other stuff
um obviously you mentioned off-balance

1762
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:15,840
um obviously you mentioned off-balance
 

1763
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,230
um obviously you mentioned off-balance
yep there's the off-balance one where

1764
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:18,240
yep there's the off-balance one where
 

1765
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,990
yep there's the off-balance one where
you can either pull to get an off

1766
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,000
you can either pull to get an off
 

1767
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,110
you can either pull to get an off
balance

1768
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
balance
 

1769
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,909
balance
or you can give way to the force

1770
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:23,919
or you can give way to the force
 

1771
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,549
or you can give way to the force
which can also lead to an off balance

1772
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
which can also lead to an off balance
 

1773
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,509
which can also lead to an off balance
um

1774
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:27,519
um
 

1775
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,350
um
you can amplify somebody's force to so

1776
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,360
you can amplify somebody's force to so
 

1777
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,389
you can amplify somebody's force to so
for example

1778
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
for example
 

1779
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,389
for example
if you push me

1780
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:34,399
if you push me
 

1781
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,950
if you push me
you expect a certain

1782
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:36,960
you expect a certain
 

1783
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,350
you expect a certain
reaction that you're ready for

1784
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,360
reaction that you're ready for
 

1785
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,149
reaction that you're ready for
but if you push me and i pull you

1786
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
but if you push me and i pull you
 

1787
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,830
but if you push me and i pull you
now you didn't expect that much force

1788
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:43,840
now you didn't expect that much force
 

1789
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,430
now you didn't expect that much force
coming out of you therefore you're off

1790
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
coming out of you therefore you're off
 

1791
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,430
coming out of you therefore you're off
balance

1792
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:47,440
balance
 

1793
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,590
balance
the thing that's distinctly recognizable

1794
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600

the time in judo it's fascinating and so
 

1835
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,310
the time in judo it's fascinating and so
the beginning part of that

1836
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
the beginning part of that
 

1837
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,230
the beginning part of that
is because there's a jacket

1838
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240
is because there's a jacket
 

1839
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,909
is because there's a jacket
there's also this whole thing that

1840
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:39,919
there's also this whole thing that
 

1841
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,909
there's also this whole thing that
you're master of which is like which is

1842
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:41,919
you're master of which is like which is
 

1843
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,230
you're master of which is like which is
gripping yeah so is there something you

1844
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
gripping yeah so is there something you
 

1845
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,070
gripping yeah so is there something you
can say about

1846
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,080
can say about
 

1847
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,990
can say about
are there some fundamental principles of

1848
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,000
are there some fundamental principles of
 

1849
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,070
are there some fundamental principles of
gripping that you can speak to

1850
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,080
gripping that you can speak to
 

1851
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,149
gripping that you can speak to
like what the hell is gripping

1852
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:52,159
like what the hell is gripping
 

1853
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,870
like what the hell is gripping
gripping is having the ability to

1854
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:54,880
gripping is having the ability to
 

1855
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,789
gripping is having the ability to
hold your opponent in such a way where

1856
00:32:56,789 --> 00:32:56,799
hold your opponent in such a way where
 

1857
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,430
hold your opponent in such a way where
you have the ability to be offensive

1858
00:32:59,430 --> 00:32:59,440
you have the ability to be offensive
 

1859
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,310
you have the ability to be offensive
and also the ability to be defensive at

1860
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,320
and also the ability to be defensive at
 

1861
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,110
and also the ability to be defensive at
the same given time

1862
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,120
the same given time
 

1863
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,470
the same given time
and

1864
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:05,480
and
 

1865
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,710
and
[Music]

1866
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:06,720
[Music]
 

1867
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,549
[Music]
it's a distinction because i can hold

1868
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:08,559
it's a distinction because i can hold
 

1869
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,789
it's a distinction because i can hold
you in such a way where

1870
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:10,799
you in such a way where
 

1871
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,110
you in such a way where
i might be able to feel offensive

1872
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,120
i might be able to feel offensive
 

1873
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,509
i might be able to feel offensive
but if you can take a purely defensive

1874
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:15,519
but if you can take a purely defensive
 

1875
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,830
but if you can take a purely defensive
grip and then i can't be offensive we

1876
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,840
grip and then i can't be offensive we
 

1877
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,750
grip and then i can't be offensive we
are no longer gripping we are holding

1878
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:19,760
are no longer gripping we are holding
 

1879
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,590
are no longer gripping we are holding
each other

1880
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,600
each other
 

1881
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,470
each other
right

1882
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
right
 

1883
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,789
right
right so like that would be the act of

1884
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:24,799
right so like that would be the act of
 

1885
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,750
right so like that would be the act of
being able to grip is to be in a

1886
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:27,760
being able to grip is to be in a
 

1887
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,149
being able to grip is to be in a
situation where you have me and i have

1888
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:30,159
situation where you have me and i have
 

1889
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,630
situation where you have me and i have
you and i can play both offense and

1890
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:32,640
you and i can play both offense and
 

1891
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,870
you and i can play both offense and
defense at the same time where you can

1892
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
defense at the same time where you can
 

1893
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,789
defense at the same time where you can
only play defense

1894
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:36,799
only play defense
 

1895
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,350
only play defense
so donahue talks about like jiu jitsu

1896
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,360
so donahue talks about like jiu jitsu
 

1897
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,350
so donahue talks about like jiu jitsu
that way and not that way but maybe you

1898
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360
that way and not that way but maybe you
 

1899
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,149
that way and not that way but maybe you
can see if there's a distinction so you

1900
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
can see if there's a distinction so you
 

1901
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,830
can see if there's a distinction so you
have a set of weapons the other person

1902
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
have a set of weapons the other person
 

1903
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,389
have a set of weapons the other person
has a set of weapons you want to

1904
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:48,399
has a set of weapons you want to
 

1905
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,470
has a set of weapons you want to
sort of maximize the use of your weapons

1906
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:50,480
sort of maximize the use of your weapons
 

1907
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,750
sort of maximize the use of your weapons
and shut down

1908
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,760
and shut down
 

1909
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,750
and shut down
the set of weapons that they have that

1910
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:53,760
the set of weapons that they have that
 

1911
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,789
the set of weapons that they have that
they have

1912
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:54,799
they have
 

1913
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,389
they have
you see gripping the same way on the on

1914
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399
you see gripping the same way on the on
 

1915
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,509
you see gripping the same way on the on
the feet

1916
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:57,519
the feet
 

1917
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,909
the feet
i do if we want to include body

1918
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
i do if we want to include body
 

1919
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,389
i do if we want to include body
positioning with our gripping

2050
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,440
and then there's people who just like
 

2051

00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,200
step in the pocket
 

2053
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,109
step in the pocket
and they don't almost don't care if

2054
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:23,119
and they don't almost don't care if
 

2055
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,230
and they don't almost don't care if
they're getting thrown because they have

2056
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,240
they're getting thrown because they have
 

2057
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,430
they're getting thrown because they have
the confidence that they're going to

2058

2061
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,910
throw first yep and those like there's a
clear distinction between the people

2062
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
clear distinction between the people
 

2063
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,230
clear distinction between the people
that do one or the other and i think

2064
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,240
that do one or the other and i think
 

2065
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,109
that do one or the other and i think
both can be done extremely successfully

2066
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:35,119
both can be done extremely successfully
 

2067
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,950
both can be done extremely successfully
at the highest level it's just like

2068
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
at the highest level it's just like

obviously you admire the people that
 

2071
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,030
obviously you admire the people that
step in the pocket and and i think when

2072
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
step in the pocket and and i think when
 

2073
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,710
step in the pocket and and i think when
you look at the people who do judo

2074
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:44,720
you look at the people who do judo
 

2075
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,790
you look at the people who do judo
the best like if we want to talk about

00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:42,880
and it's just i put myself in scenarios
 

2183
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,630
and it's just i put myself in scenarios
where i don't even know how i'm going to

2184
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
where i don't even know how i'm going to

win
 

2187
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,630
win
but what i've done in those scenarios is

2188
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:48,640
but what i've done in those scenarios is
 

2189
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,950

mass when i went to 2008 i was probably
 

2407
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,630
mass when i went to 2008 i was probably
like

2408
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:46,640
like
 

2409
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,430
like
80 to 83 kilos walking around so weight

2410
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
80 to 83 kilos walking around so weight
 

2411
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,910
80 to 83 kilos walking around so weight
cutting wasn't a thing for me

2412
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:51,920
cutting wasn't a thing for me
 

2413
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,109
cutting wasn't a thing for me
in

00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:53,119
in
 

2415
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,109
in
london we actually weighed in the

2416
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:55,119
london we actually weighed in the
 

2417
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,510
london we actually weighed in the
morning of so weigh-ins were at like 6

2418

a.m
 

2421
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,470
a.m
and the olympics were always beneficial

2422
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:00,480
and the olympics were always beneficial
 

2423
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,710
and the olympics were always beneficial
to me because they actually don't start

2424
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:02,720
to me because they actually don't start
 

2425
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,030
to me because they actually don't start
until like 10 or 11.

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,030
until like 10 or 11.
so you actually were able to recover

2428

so you actually were able to recover
 

2429
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,630
so you actually were able to recover
where on the circuit you would weigh in

2430
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640
where on the circuit you would weigh in
 

2431

who's a sleep scientist about sleep and
 

2533
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,030
who's a sleep scientist about sleep and
it's like if you believe sleep is

2534
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,040
it's like if you believe sleep is
 

2535
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,870
it's like if you believe sleep is
essential it's essential to get eight

2536
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:54,880
essential it's essential to get eight
 

2537
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,230
essential it's essential to get eight
hours of sleep every single night

2538
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:56,240
hours of sleep every single night
 

2539

00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:00,880
when you don't get it and then i think
 

2545
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,790
when you don't get it and then i think
it will negatively affect the stress

2546
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
it will negatively affect the stress
 

2547

for an x period of time guess get a
 

3095
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,150
for an x period of time guess get a
small tangent

3096
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,160
small tangent
 

3097
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,789

on it and that breaks most men yeah

3146
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040
on it and that breaks most men yeah
 

3147
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,470
on it and that breaks most men yeah
that like little thing in the back of

3148
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
that like little thing in the back of
 

3149
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,670
that like little thing in the back of
their mind thinking oh like what if

3150
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:03,680
their mind thinking oh like what if
 

3151
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,030
their mind thinking oh like what if
there's no what if like there's only

3152
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,040
there's no what if like there's only
 

3153
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,950
there's no what if like there's only
right here right now yeah if it doesn't

3154
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:06,960
right here right now yeah if it doesn't
 

3155
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,390
right here right now yeah if it doesn't
work it doesn't work let's just quickly

3156
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:08,400
work it doesn't work let's just quickly
 

3157
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,470
work it doesn't work let's just quickly
come up with the solution to fix the

3158
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:10,480
come up with the solution to fix the
 

3159
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,390
come up with the solution to fix the
problem by the way as another small

3160
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:12,400
problem by the way as another small
 

3161
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:15,030
problem by the way as another small
tangent all the greatest people i've

3162
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:15,040
tangent all the greatest people i've
 

3163
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,150
tangent all the greatest people i've
interacted with at the highest level

3164
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
interacted with at the highest level
 

3165
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,789
interacted with at the highest level
think like that they don't linger on the

3166
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
think like that they don't linger on the
 

3167
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,030
think like that they don't linger on the
no it's like the next thing yeah because

3168
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,040
no it's like the next thing yeah because
 

3169
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,349
no it's like the next thing yeah because
like if you want to do something great

3170
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:25,359
like if you want to do something great
 

3171
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:27,750
like if you want to do something great
heart stuff is gonna keep happening to

3172
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:27,760
heart stuff is gonna keep happening to
 

3173
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,670
heart stuff is gonna keep happening to
you and if you're gonna let that affect

3174
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:29,680
you and if you're gonna let that affect
 

3175
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,510
you and if you're gonna let that affect
you you're not ever going to do the

3176
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,520
you you're not ever going to do the
 

3177
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,030
you you're not ever going to do the
great thing yeah it's fascinating

3178
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:33,040
great thing yeah it's fascinating
 

3179
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,789
great thing yeah it's fascinating
actually like that's the one skill you

3180
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:34,799
actually like that's the one skill you
 

3181
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:35,910
actually like that's the one skill you
have to learn

3182

have to learn
 

3183
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,309
have to learn
um elon musk is great at this constantly

you have achieved another level in judo

4136
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:38,880
you have achieved another level in judo
 

4137
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,709
you have achieved another level in judo
and i think that means

4138
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:40,719
and i think that means
 

4139
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:42,790
and i think that means
the intensity with which you approach

4140
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:42,800
the intensity with which you approach
 

4141
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,070
the intensity with which you approach
judo

4142
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,080
judo
 

4143
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,870
judo
to achieve that world-class level

4144
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:46,880
to achieve that world-class level
 

4145
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,270
to achieve that world-class level
probably is the source of the injuries

4146
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:49,280
probably is the source of the injuries
 

4147
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,950
probably is the source of the injuries
yeah because

4148
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:50,960
yeah because
 

4149
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,390
yeah because
the mentality of how i

4150
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:54,400
the mentality of how i
 

4151
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,950
the mentality of how i
approach judo versus jiu-jitsu

4152
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:56,960
approach judo versus jiu-jitsu
 

4153
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,830
approach judo versus jiu-jitsu
jiu-jitsu to me is

4154
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:58,840
jiu-jitsu to me is
 

4155
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,950
jiu-jitsu to me is
like a game that like we would play like

4156

it's an anticipation and there's a
distinct distinction there

5330
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:38,960
distinct distinction there
 

5331
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,270
distinct distinction there
between the two

5332
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:41,280

5411
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,910
on video
because like you often on video you're

5412
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:07,920
because like you often on video you're
 

5413
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,189
because like you often on video you're
going against the best people in the

5414
01:36:09,189 --> 01:36:09,199
going against the best people in the
 

5415
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:11,270
going against the best people in the
world it's tough to get like that much

5416
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:11,280
world it's tough to get like that much
 

5417
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:12,070
world it's tough to get like that much
air

5418
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:12,080
air
 

5419
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:14,390
air
and a lot of times the the ones that we

5420
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:14,400
and a lot of times the the ones that we
 

5421
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,310
and a lot of times the the ones that we
do see and you know the part that a lot

5422
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:16,320
do see and you know the part that a lot
 

5423
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,390
do see and you know the part that a lot
of people don't

5424
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:18,400
of people don't
 

5425
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,629
of people don't
experience is

5426
01:36:20,629 --> 01:36:20,639
experience is
 

5427
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,149
experience is
a lot of those times right through

5428
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:22,159
a lot of those times right through
 

5429
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:23,669
a lot of those times right through
people with that throw

5430
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
people with that throw
 

5431
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,510
people with that throw
it was in training camps

5432
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:25,520
it was in training camps
 

5433
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,270
it was in training camps
so by the time i got to the competition

5434
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:27,280
so by the time i got to the competition
 

5435
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,030
so by the time i got to the competition
with these guys

5436
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
with these guys
 

5437
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,350
with these guys
they were playing a hundred percent

5438
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:31,360
they were playing a hundred percent
 

5439
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,229
they were playing a hundred percent
defense to never let me do that yeah

5440
01:36:34,229 --> 01:36:34,239
defense to never let me do that yeah
 

5441
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:35,990
defense to never let me do that yeah
so you do this

5442
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,000
so you do this
 

5443
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,310
so you do this
um here are you kind of pulling him down

5444
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:38,320
um here are you kind of pulling him down
 

5445
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,709
um here are you kind of pulling him down
no he's i'm trying to get him to come up

5446
01:36:40,709 --> 01:36:40,719
no he's i'm trying to get him to come up
 

5447
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:42,390
no he's i'm trying to get him to come up
to come up but are you pulling him down

5448
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:42,400
to come up but are you pulling him down
 

5449
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:43,990
to come up but are you pulling him down
to get to fake him off i'm not doing

5450
01:36:43,990 --> 01:36:44,000
to get to fake him off i'm not doing
 

5451
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,470
to get to fake him off i'm not doing
anything with my left hand

5452
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:46,480
anything with my left hand
 

5453
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:49,030
anything with my left hand
uh so here the the opponent's so what

5454
01:36:49,030 --> 01:36:49,040
uh so here the the opponent's so what
 

5455
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:51,350
uh so here the the opponent's so what
i'm doing right now is his head is like

5456
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:51,360
i'm doing right now is his head is like
 

5457
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,470
i'm doing right now is his head is like
in my chest

5458
01:36:52,470 --> 01:36:52,480
in my chest
 

5459
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,830
in my chest
i'm pressing him to get his head to lift

5460
01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:55,840
i'm pressing him to get his head to lift
 

5461
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,990
i'm pressing him to get his head to lift
with my chest

5462
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:58,000
with my chest
 

5463
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,990
with my chest
so i'm pressing his hand down so i can

5464
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:00,000
so i'm pressing his hand down so i can
 

5465
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,790
so i'm pressing his hand down so i can
use my chest to like pinch my scaps and

5466
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:02,800
use my chest to like pinch my scaps and
 

5467
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,109
use my chest to like pinch my scaps and
roll his head up so he wants to pick it

5468
01:37:05,109 --> 01:37:05,119
roll his head up so he wants to pick it
 

5469
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:06,470
roll his head up so he wants to pick it
up

5470
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:06,480
up
 

5471
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:07,750
up
and

5472
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:07,760
and
 

5473
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:09,109
and
and then he i mean doesn't he know

5474
01:37:09,109 --> 01:37:09,119
and then he i mean doesn't he know
 

5475
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,390
and then he i mean doesn't he know
what's coming here

5476
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:10,400
what's coming here
 

5477
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,470
what's coming here
oh no he might not

5478
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:12,480
oh no he might not
 

5479
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,229
oh no he might not
oh no he knew he was a former teammate

5480
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:14,239
oh no he knew he was a former teammate
 

5481
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,390
oh no he knew he was a former teammate
he knew exactly what i was trying to do

5482
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:16,400
he knew exactly what i was trying to do
 

5483
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,030
he knew exactly what i was trying to do
and that was a really big step with your

5484
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,040
and that was a really big step with your
 

5485
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:23,669
and that was a really big step with your
right foot it covers uh about four feet

5486
01:37:23,669 --> 01:37:23,679
right foot it covers uh about four feet
 

5487
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,229
right foot it covers uh about four feet
so you use the distance

5488
01:37:26,229 --> 01:37:26,239
so you use the distance
 

5489
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,950
so you use the distance
and your left

5490
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:28,960
and your left
 

5491
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,149
and your left
um

5492
01:37:30,149 --> 01:37:30,159
um
 

5493
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,790
um
catches up in like perfect position yeah

5494
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:32,800
catches up in like perfect position yeah
 

5495
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:36,070
catches up in like perfect position yeah
you back it up a little bit

5496
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080

 

5497
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:37,510

keep going

5498
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:37,520
keep going
 

5499
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:38,870
keep going
keep going

5500
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880
keep going
 

5501
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,629
keep going
right there that's this is like an

5502
01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:40,639
right there that's this is like an
 

5503
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:43,189
right there that's this is like an
important distinction between mine and

5504
01:37:43,189 --> 01:37:43,199
important distinction between mine and
 

5505
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,109
important distinction between mine and
everybody else's is

5506
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,119
everybody else's is
 

5507
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:48,950
everybody else's is
because i split his hip um i actually

5508
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:48,960
because i split his hip um i actually
 

5509
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,709
because i split his hip um i actually
once i'm able to split i no longer need

5510
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:52,719
once i'm able to split i no longer need
 

5511
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,430
once i'm able to split i no longer need
his center of gravity below mine

5512
01:37:55,430 --> 01:37:55,440
his center of gravity below mine
 

5513
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:57,109
his center of gravity below mine
right and when you say split you mean

5514
01:37:57,109 --> 01:37:57,119
right and when you say split you mean
 

5515
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:59,430
right and when you say split you mean
you put your foot in between

5516
01:37:59,430 --> 01:37:59,440
you put your foot in between
 

5517
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,510
you put your foot in between
why do that split that four foot split

5518
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:01,520
why do that split that four foot split
 

5519
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,669
why do that split that four foot split
yes and then when i get my feet back

5520
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:03,679
yes and then when i get my feet back
 

5521
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:05,669
yes and then when i get my feet back
together it doesn't matter that i'm

5522
01:38:05,669 --> 01:38:05,679
together it doesn't matter that i'm
 

5523
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,870
together it doesn't matter that i'm
under his center gravity or not yeah

5524
01:38:08,870 --> 01:38:08,880
under his center gravity or not yeah
 

5525
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,510
under his center gravity or not yeah
that's why my chest is right around his

5526
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,520
that's why my chest is right around his
 

5527
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,390
that's why my chest is right around his
like

5528
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:12,400
like
 

5529
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,830
like
sternum height

5530
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:13,840
sternum height
 

5531
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:15,109
sternum height
for me

5532
01:38:15,109 --> 01:38:15,119
for me
 

5533
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:17,350
for me
yeah so so the there i mean how does he

5534
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:17,360
yeah so so the there i mean how does he
 

5535
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,030
yeah so so the there i mean how does he
get uh for people just listening to this

5536
01:38:19,030 --> 01:38:19,040
get uh for people just listening to this
 

5537
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,510
get uh for people just listening to this
travis steps is like that's a big

5538
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:21,520
travis steps is like that's a big
 

5539
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,750
travis steps is like that's a big
huge step gets

5540
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:23,760
huge step gets
 

5541
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:25,830
huge step gets
like my hip is probably right around his

5542
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:25,840
like my hip is probably right around his
 

5543
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,910
like my hip is probably right around his
nipple because he's he's sprawled back

5544
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:27,920
nipple because he's he's sprawled back
 

5545
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:31,109
nipple because he's he's sprawled back
so much yeah that's right so like so

5546
01:38:31,109 --> 01:38:31,119
so much yeah that's right so like so
 

5547
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:33,030
so much yeah that's right so like so
you're how does the physics of this work

5548
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:33,040
you're how does the physics of this work
 

5549
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,270
you're how does the physics of this work
you're violating the principle of

5550
01:38:35,270 --> 01:38:35,280
you're violating the principle of
 

5551
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:37,109
you're violating the principle of
your center of mass being under oh i

5552
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:37,119
your center of mass being under oh i
 

5553
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,709
your center of mass being under oh i
guess somehow it is

5554
01:38:38,709 --> 01:38:38,719
guess somehow it is
 

5555
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,709
guess somehow it is
i don't know but he has nowhere to go

5556
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:40,719
i don't know but he has nowhere to go
 

5557
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:43,990
i don't know but he has nowhere to go
he's screwed yes that's the kicker is

5558
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:44,000
he's screwed yes that's the kicker is
 

5559
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,270
he's screwed yes that's the kicker is
the way my

5560
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:45,280
the way my
 

5561
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,430
the way my
mind works is

5562
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,440
mind works is
 

5563
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,350
mind works is
in order for him to play an effective

5564
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:49,360
in order for him to play an effective
 

5565
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:50,790
in order for him to play an effective
defense

5566
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:50,800
defense
 

5567
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,270
defense
he needs to have his feet firmly planted

5568
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:53,280
he needs to have his feet firmly planted
 

5569
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,350
he needs to have his feet firmly planted
on the ground with friction

5570
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:55,360
on the ground with friction
 

5571
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,070
on the ground with friction
yeah otherwise he can't press into me to

5572
01:38:58,070 --> 01:38:58,080
yeah otherwise he can't press into me to
 

5573
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:00,390
yeah otherwise he can't press into me to
stop it so when i get him to sprawl back

5574
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:00,400
stop it so when i get him to sprawl back
 

5575
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,310
stop it so when i get him to sprawl back
when i split his legs

5576
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:02,320
when i split his legs
 

5577
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,030
when i split his legs
he effectively loses that contact with

5578
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:05,040
he effectively loses that contact with
 

5579
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,470
he effectively loses that contact with
the floor even though his feet are on

5580
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:06,480
the floor even though his feet are on
 

5581
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,510
the floor even though his feet are on
the floor

5582
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:07,520
the floor
 

5583
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,950
the floor
they're not in a position where he can

5584
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:08,960
they're not in a position where he can
 

5585
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,350
they're not in a position where he can
drive from them yeah therefore when i

5586
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:11,360
drive from them yeah therefore when i
 

5587
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:14,229
drive from them yeah therefore when i
flip he flips so there's a

5588

that timing
 

5667
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,669
that timing
it's timing

5668
01:40:35,669 --> 01:40:35,679
it's timing
 

5669
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:37,830
it's timing
it's like anything like if i wanted to

5670
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:37,840
it's like anything like if i wanted to

5674
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:41,920
it to really do that if you know you can
 

5675
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:44,229
it to really do that if you know you can
just play defense and block it yeah the

5676
01:40:44,229 --> 01:40:44,239
just play defense and block it yeah the
 

5677
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,310
just play defense and block it yeah the
trick is to get them to play defense to

5678
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:46,320
trick is to get them to play defense to
 

5679
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:50,629
trick is to get them to play defense to
something that never happened

5680
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:50,639

 

5681
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:52,390

and then you go through like another way

5682
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:52,400
and then you go through like another way
 

5683
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,149
and then you go through like another way
and then you just go through what would

5684
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:54,159
and then you just go through what would
 

5685
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:55,990
and then you just go through what would
technically be your first plan if you

5686
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:56,000
technically be your first plan if you
 

5687
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,070
technically be your first plan if you
planned on them playing defense

5688
01:40:58,070 --> 01:40:58,080
planned on them playing defense
 

5689
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,990
planned on them playing defense
so i set the stage from the very

5690
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:00,000
so i set the stage from the very
 

5691
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,590
so i set the stage from the very
beginning for this to work

5692
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:03,600
beginning for this to work
 

5693
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,910
beginning for this to work
so then this you're uh you're

5694
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:05,920
so then this you're uh you're
 

5695

up until this point
 

7483
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:32,470
up until this point
not one match at the olympic games has

7484
02:12:32,470 --> 02:12:32,480
not one match at the olympic games has
 

7485
02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:34,709
not one match at the olympic games has
ever been a split decision

7486
02:12:34,709 --> 02:12:34,719
ever been a split decision
 

7487
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:37,350
ever been a split decision
meaning out of three people

7488
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:37,360
meaning out of three people
 

7489
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:39,270
meaning out of three people
not one of them voted against the other

7490
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:39,280
not one of them voted against the other
 

7491
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:41,109
not one of them voted against the other
group members

7492
02:12:41,109 --> 02:12:41,119
group members
 

7493
02:12:41,119 --> 02:12:43,270
group members
so they were all unified blue or all

7494
02:12:43,270 --> 02:12:43,280
so they were all unified blue or all
 

7495
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:47,270
so they were all unified blue or all
unified white yeah right which is um

7496
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:47,280
unified white yeah right which is um
 

7497
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:50,470
unified white yeah right which is um
statistically difficult to imagine yes

7498
02:12:50,470 --> 02:12:50,480
statistically difficult to imagine yes
 

7499
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:52,470
statistically difficult to imagine yes
it's almost like the they had a referee

7500
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:52,480
it's almost like the they had a referee
 

7501
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,629
it's almost like the they had a referee
meeting and said um it's better for the

7502
02:12:54,629 --> 02:12:54,639
meeting and said um it's better for the
 

7503
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:58,069
meeting and said um it's better for the
olympics to never have a split yeah

7504
02:12:58,069 --> 02:12:58,079
olympics to never have a split yeah
 

7505
02:12:58,079 --> 02:12:59,990
olympics to never have a split yeah
okay

7506
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:00,000
okay
 

7507
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,709
okay
so the question becomes

7508
02:13:02,709 --> 02:13:02,719
so the question becomes
 

7509
02:13:02,719 --> 02:13:06,390
so the question becomes
if you click that frame by frame

7510
02:13:06,390 --> 02:13:06,400
if you click that frame by frame
 

7511
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:07,990
if you click that frame by frame
right

7512
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:08,000
right
 

7513
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,750
right
so right now we have all the refs with

7514
02:13:09,750 --> 02:13:09,760
so right now we have all the refs with
 

7515
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,589
so right now we have all the refs with
their flags out

7516
02:13:11,589 --> 02:13:11,599
their flags out
 

7517
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:14,310
their flags out
and then click that so the middle middle

7518
02:13:14,310 --> 02:13:14,320
and then click that so the middle middle
 

7519
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:15,350
and then click that so the middle middle
guy is

7520
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
guy is
 

7521
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:17,990
guy is
he is all the way up all the way up the

7522
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:18,000
he is all the way up all the way up the
 

7523
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,149
he is all the way up all the way up the
other side judges haven't moved

7524
02:13:20,149 --> 02:13:20,159
other side judges haven't moved
 

7525
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:23,510
other side judges haven't moved
we now have one side raft all the way up

7526
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:23,520
we now have one side raft all the way up
 

7527
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,669
we now have one side raft all the way up
then we have a third side ref

7528
02:13:25,669 --> 02:13:25,679
then we have a third side ref
 

7529
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:28,550
then we have a third side ref
all the way up

7530
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:28,560

 

7531
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:31,350

yeah so there there's a the time point

7532
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:31,360
yeah so there there's a the time point
 

7533
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:33,189
yeah so there there's a the time point
when the middle guy has the flag all the

7534
02:13:33,189 --> 02:13:33,199
when the middle guy has the flag all the
 

7535
02:13:33,199 --> 02:13:35,750
when the middle guy has the flag all the
way up if not 80 90 of the way there

7536
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:35,760
way up if not 80 90 of the way there
 

7537
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:37,750
way up if not 80 90 of the way there
yeah then the other one does

7538
02:13:37,750 --> 02:13:37,760
yeah then the other one does
 

7539
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:39,669
yeah then the other one does
and then the third one goes

7540
02:13:39,669 --> 02:13:39,679
and then the third one goes
 

7541
02:13:39,679 --> 02:13:43,270
and then the third one goes
uh so now the question becomes who

7542
02:13:43,270 --> 02:13:43,280
uh so now the question becomes who
 

7543
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:44,550
uh so now the question becomes who
really

7544
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:44,560
really
 

7545
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,550
really
like did the outside refs really have an

7546
02:13:46,550 --> 02:13:46,560
like did the outside refs really have an
 

7547
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:49,109
like did the outside refs really have an
opinion

7548
02:13:49,109 --> 02:13:49,119

 

7549
02:13:49,119 --> 02:13:51,430

or were they told

7550
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:51,440
or were they told
 

7551
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:54,310
or were they told
to wait for the center one to start

7552
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:54,320
to wait for the center one to start
 

7553
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,830
to wait for the center one to start
and then

7554
02:13:55,830 --> 02:13:55,840
and then
 

7555
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:59,270
and then
lift whatever flag the center ref picked

7556
02:13:59,270 --> 02:13:59,280
lift whatever flag the center ref picked
 

7557
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:01,830
lift whatever flag the center ref picked
yeah this is very unfortunate because

7558
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:01,840
yeah this is very unfortunate because
 

7559
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:03,510
yeah this is very unfortunate because
it's very honestly it's very possible

7560
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:03,520
it's very honestly it's very possible
 

7561
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,109
it's very honestly it's very possible
that they had this meeting

7562
02:14:05,109 --> 02:14:05,119
that they had this meeting
 

7563
02:14:05,119 --> 02:14:05,990
that they had this meeting
um

7564
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,000
um
 

7565
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,069
um
this this is the problem with

7566
02:14:08,069 --> 02:14:08,079
this this is the problem with
 

7567
02:14:08,079 --> 02:14:09,109
this this is the problem with
the

7568
02:14:09,109 --> 02:14:09,119
the
 

7569
02:14:09,119 --> 02:14:11,030
the
the olympics they sometimes

7570
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,040
the olympics they sometimes
 

7571
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,030
the olympics they sometimes
it's also the problem in the soviet

7572
02:14:13,030 --> 02:14:13,040
it's also the problem in the soviet
 

7573
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:15,270
it's also the problem in the soviet
union with communism you think the the

7574
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:15,280
union with communism you think the the
 

7575
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:16,310
union with communism you think the the
committee

7576
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:16,320
committee
 

7577
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,149
committee
knows what's good for the people and so

7578
02:14:18,149 --> 02:14:18,159
knows what's good for the people and so
 

7579
02:14:18,159 --> 02:14:19,910
knows what's good for the people and so
on so they decide

7580
02:14:19,910 --> 02:14:19,920
on so they decide
 

7581
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:21,510
on so they decide
universally as opposed to letting the

7582
02:14:21,510 --> 02:14:21,520
universally as opposed to letting the
 

7583
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:24,069
universally as opposed to letting the
magic of the olympics

7584
02:14:24,069 --> 02:14:24,079
magic of the olympics
 

7585
02:14:24,079 --> 02:14:27,589
magic of the olympics
be what it is but nevertheless

7586
02:14:27,589 --> 02:14:27,599
be what it is but nevertheless
 

7587
02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:29,830
be what it is but nevertheless
the in this case the center ref decided

7588
02:14:29,830 --> 02:14:29,840
the in this case the center ref decided
 

7589
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:31,109
the in this case the center ref decided
blue

7590
02:14:31,109 --> 02:14:31,119
blue
 

7591
02:14:31,119 --> 02:14:32,870
blue
like what do you think

7592
02:14:32,870 --> 02:14:32,880
like what do you think
 

7593
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:35,510
like what do you think
do you think it's just a shitty call or

7594
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:35,520
do you think it's just a shitty call or
 

7595
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,470
do you think it's just a shitty call or
like

7596
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:36,480
like
 

7597
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:39,189
like
he has the right to pick but yeah the

7598
02:14:39,189 --> 02:14:39,199
he has the right to pick but yeah the
 

7599
02:14:39,199 --> 02:14:40,629
he has the right to pick but yeah the
problem is is

7600
02:14:40,629 --> 02:14:40,639
problem is is
 

7601
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:43,430
problem is is
the other two i don't think did

7602
02:14:43,430 --> 02:14:43,440
the other two i don't think did
 

7603
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:44,870
the other two i don't think did
yeah so

7604
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:44,880
yeah so
 

7605
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:47,270
yeah so
and then so when you do this frame by

7606
02:14:47,270 --> 02:14:47,280
and then so when you do this frame by
 

7607
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:48,709
and then so when you do this frame by
frame again

7608
02:14:48,709 --> 02:14:48,719
frame again
 

7609
02:14:48,719 --> 02:14:49,830
frame again
right

7610
02:14:49,830 --> 02:14:49,840
right
 

7611
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:52,390
right
like i can see from my own perspective

7612
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:52,400
like i can see from my own perspective
 

7613
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:56,550
like i can see from my own perspective
two of the refs and i see them both blue

7614
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:56,560
two of the refs and i see them both blue
 

7615
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:58,790
two of the refs and i see them both blue
right so when you fast forward that a

7616
02:14:58,790 --> 02:14:58,800
right so when you fast forward that a
 

7617
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,510
right so when you fast forward that a
little bit to get to like all the flags

7618
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:01,520
little bit to get to like all the flags
 

7619
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:04,310
little bit to get to like all the flags
i see the two go blue and i go

it almost feels like there's more
 

10699
03:08:36,960 --> 03:08:39,190
it almost feels like there's more
variety at 90 kilo because some of them

the hungarian player was like a hundred

11580
03:23:47,990 --> 03:23:48,000
the hungarian player was like a hundred
 

11581
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:51,190
the hungarian player was like a hundred
percent defense and he still did this

11582
03:23:51,190 --> 03:23:51,200
percent defense and he still did this
 

11583
03:23:51,200 --> 03:23:52,710
percent defense and he still did this
right so

11584
03:23:52,710 --> 03:23:52,720
right so
 

11585
03:23:52,720 --> 03:23:54,870
right so
right here like press pause

11586
03:23:54,870 --> 03:23:54,880
right here like press pause
 

11587
03:23:54,880 --> 03:23:57,590
right here like press pause
this this is like

11588
03:23:57,590 --> 03:23:57,600
this this is like
 

11589
03:23:57,600 --> 03:23:59,510
this this is like
and identify if you're trying to like

11590
03:23:59,510 --> 03:23:59,520
and identify if you're trying to like
 

11591
03:23:59,520 --> 03:24:01,429
and identify if you're trying to like
learn judo and figure out how to set it

11592
03:24:01,429 --> 03:24:01,439
learn judo and figure out how to set it
 

11593
03:24:01,439 --> 03:24:02,150
learn judo and figure out how to set it
up

11594
03:24:02,150 --> 03:24:02,160
up
 

11595
03:24:02,160 --> 03:24:04,950
up
because knowing how to get to the point

11596
03:24:04,950 --> 03:24:04,960
because knowing how to get to the point
 

11597
03:24:04,960 --> 03:24:06,309
because knowing how to get to the point
right before you pull the trigger is

11598
03:24:06,309 --> 03:24:06,319
right before you pull the trigger is
 

11599
03:24:06,319 --> 03:24:08,389
right before you pull the trigger is
probably the most important

11600
03:24:08,389 --> 03:24:08,399
probably the most important
 

11601
03:24:08,399 --> 03:24:10,790
probably the most important
so when we watch this play out what ono

11602
03:24:10,790 --> 03:24:10,800
so when we watch this play out what ono
 

11603
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:12,550
so when we watch this play out what ono
ono's going to do is he's going to pivot

11604
03:24:12,550 --> 03:24:12,560
ono's going to do is he's going to pivot
 

11605
03:24:12,560 --> 03:24:14,389
ono's going to do is he's going to pivot
off his right leg right here

11606
03:24:14,389 --> 03:24:14,399
off his right leg right here
 

11607
03:24:14,399 --> 03:24:16,070
off his right leg right here
he's going to back step with his left

11608
03:24:16,070 --> 03:24:16,080
he's going to back step with his left
 

11609
03:24:16,080 --> 03:24:18,710
he's going to back step with his left
and it's going to pull um garvey's front

11610
03:24:18,710 --> 03:24:18,720
and it's going to pull um garvey's front
 

11611
03:24:18,720 --> 03:24:20,309
and it's going to pull um garvey's front
leg all the way forward into what we

11612
03:24:20,309 --> 03:24:20,319
leg all the way forward into what we
 

11613
03:24:20,319 --> 03:24:22,950
leg all the way forward into what we
would call like a neutral square stance

11614
03:24:22,950 --> 03:24:22,960
would call like a neutral square stance
 

11615
03:24:22,960 --> 03:24:25,030
would call like a neutral square stance
so he plants hard

11616
03:24:25,030 --> 03:24:25,040
so he plants hard
 

11617
03:24:25,040 --> 03:24:26,550
so he plants hard
and look at there's an interesting pull

11618
03:24:26,550 --> 03:24:26,560
and look at there's an interesting pull
 

11619
03:24:26,560 --> 03:24:28,309
and look at there's an interesting pull
with the track oh no it's not try so he

11620
03:24:28,309 --> 03:24:28,319
with the track oh no it's not try so he
 

11621
03:24:28,319 --> 03:24:30,790
with the track oh no it's not try so he
almost like if he starts with the tricep

11622
03:24:30,790 --> 03:24:30,800
almost like if he starts with the tricep
 

11623
03:24:30,800 --> 03:24:31,910
almost like if he starts with the tricep
and he like collects the gear or

11624
03:24:31,910 --> 03:24:31,920
and he like collects the gear or
 

11625
03:24:31,920 --> 03:24:33,349
and he like collects the gear or
something like that but it's still above

11626
03:24:33,349 --> 03:24:33,359
something like that but it's still above
 

11627
03:24:33,359 --> 03:24:35,349
something like that but it's still above
the elbow because you can see the bend

11628
03:24:35,349 --> 03:24:35,359
the elbow because you can see the bend
 

11629
03:24:35,359 --> 03:24:37,910
the elbow because you can see the bend
right and right here see how he never

11630
03:24:37,910 --> 03:24:37,920
right and right here see how he never
 

11631
03:24:37,920 --> 03:24:40,950
right and right here see how he never
put back it up a little bit

11632
03:24:40,950 --> 03:24:40,960
put back it up a little bit
 

11633
03:24:40,960 --> 03:24:41,750
put back it up a little bit
that

11634
03:24:41,750 --> 03:24:41,760
that
 

11635
03:24:41,760 --> 03:24:43,510
that
this is kind of like one of those things

11636
03:24:43,510 --> 03:24:43,520
this is kind of like one of those things
 

11637
03:24:43,520 --> 03:24:45,269
this is kind of like one of those things
yeah pause it right there

11638
03:24:45,269 --> 03:24:45,279
yeah pause it right there
 

11639
03:24:45,279 --> 03:24:47,750
yeah pause it right there
so when he puts his right foot down he's

11640
03:24:47,750 --> 03:24:47,760
so when he puts his right foot down he's
 

11641
03:24:47,760 --> 03:24:50,389
so when he puts his right foot down he's
pulling so hard with his back

11642
03:24:50,389 --> 03:24:50,399
pulling so hard with his back
 

11643
03:24:50,399 --> 03:24:52,229
pulling so hard with his back
that when ono goes to put his left foot

11644
03:24:52,229 --> 03:24:52,239
that when ono goes to put his left foot
 

11645
03:24:52,239 --> 03:24:54,870
that when ono goes to put his left foot
down it never touches the mat

11646
03:24:54,870 --> 03:24:54,880
down it never touches the mat
 

11647
03:24:54,880 --> 03:24:57,190
down it never touches the mat
but by putting his left foot back

11648
03:24:57,190 --> 03:24:57,200
but by putting his left foot back
 

11649
03:24:57,200 --> 03:24:58,870
but by putting his left foot back
it actually pulls him garvey's foot

11650
03:24:58,870 --> 03:24:58,880
it actually pulls him garvey's foot
 

11651
03:24:58,880 --> 03:25:00,309
it actually pulls him garvey's foot
forward

11652
03:25:00,309 --> 03:25:00,319
forward
 

11653
03:25:00,319 --> 03:25:02,229
forward
and so he's able to speed up his throw

11654
03:25:02,229 --> 03:25:02,239
and so he's able to speed up his throw
 

11655
03:25:02,239 --> 03:25:04,710
and so he's able to speed up his throw
by just continuing that motion back yeah

11656
03:25:04,710 --> 03:25:04,720
by just continuing that motion back yeah
 

11657
03:25:04,720 --> 03:25:06,469
by just continuing that motion back yeah
which what was supposed to have been a

11658
03:25:06,469 --> 03:25:06,479
which what was supposed to have been a
 

11659
03:25:06,479 --> 03:25:07,750
which what was supposed to have been a
step

11660
03:25:07,750 --> 03:25:07,760
step
 

11661
03:25:07,760 --> 03:25:09,670
step
turned out to just

11662
03:25:09,670 --> 03:25:09,680
turned out to just
 

11663
03:25:09,680 --> 03:25:12,150
turned out to just
in the middle of the action he makes a

11664
03:25:12,150 --> 03:25:12,160
in the middle of the action he makes a
 

11665
03:25:12,160 --> 03:25:13,910
in the middle of the action he makes a
split second decision before putting the

11666
03:25:13,910 --> 03:25:13,920
split second decision before putting the
 

11667
03:25:13,920 --> 03:25:15,990
split second decision before putting the
foot down to just continue yeah because

11668
03:25:15,990 --> 03:25:16,000
foot down to just continue yeah because
 

11669
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:18,070
foot down to just continue yeah because
he recognizes that feel in his hands

11670
03:25:18,070 --> 03:25:18,080
he recognizes that feel in his hands
 

11671
03:25:18,080 --> 03:25:20,229
he recognizes that feel in his hands
yeah and so it's like it never it's a

11672
03:25:20,229 --> 03:25:20,239
yeah and so it's like it never it's a
 

11673
03:25:20,239 --> 03:25:21,990
yeah and so it's like it never it's a
swing like he never touches the guard

11674
03:25:21,990 --> 03:25:22,000
swing like he never touches the guard
 

11675
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:24,070
swing like he never touches the guard
but it never it never started as like a

11676
03:25:24,070 --> 03:25:24,080
but it never it never started as like a
 

11677
03:25:24,080 --> 03:25:26,550
but it never it never started as like a
big swing to a back step yeah he changed

11678
03:25:26,550 --> 03:25:26,560
big swing to a back step yeah he changed
 

11679
03:25:26,560 --> 03:25:28,469
big swing to a back step yeah he changed
his mind part way through so it's right

11680
03:25:28,469 --> 03:25:28,479
his mind part way through so it's right
 

11681
03:25:28,479 --> 03:25:29,349
his mind part way through so it's right
there

11682
03:25:29,349 --> 03:25:29,359
there
 

11683
03:25:29,359 --> 03:25:31,750
there
right yeah and then he goes nope he's

11684
03:25:31,750 --> 03:25:31,760
right yeah and then he goes nope he's
 

11685
03:25:31,760 --> 03:25:32,870
right yeah and then he goes nope he's
bringing that foot forward i'm just

11686
03:25:32,870 --> 03:25:32,880
bringing that foot forward i'm just
 

11687
03:25:32,880 --> 03:25:36,309
bringing that foot forward i'm just
gonna go for it and wait is he full like

11688
03:25:36,309 --> 03:25:36,319
gonna go for it and wait is he full like
 

11689
03:25:36,319 --> 03:25:37,590
gonna go for it and wait is he full like
full air

11690
03:25:37,590 --> 03:25:37,600
full air
 

11691
03:25:37,600 --> 03:25:38,630
full air
look at that

11692
03:25:38,630 --> 03:25:38,640
look at that
 

11693
03:25:38,640 --> 03:25:41,190
look at that
boom boom and look at if you go a few

11694
03:25:41,190 --> 03:25:41,200
boom boom and look at if you go a few
 

11695
03:25:41,200 --> 03:25:44,550
boom boom and look at if you go a few
more steps forward right there his hip

11696
03:25:44,550 --> 03:25:44,560
more steps forward right there his hip
 

11697
03:25:44,560 --> 03:25:46,229
more steps forward right there his hip
is the same height as um garvey's

11698
03:25:46,229 --> 03:25:46,239
is the same height as um garvey's
 

11699
03:25:46,239 --> 03:25:47,990
is the same height as um garvey's
shoulder yeah

11700
03:25:47,990 --> 03:25:48,000
shoulder yeah
 

11701
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:50,389
shoulder yeah
because he's leaning so far into the

11702
03:25:50,389 --> 03:25:50,399
because he's leaning so far into the
 

11703
03:25:50,399 --> 03:25:52,870
because he's leaning so far into the
throw with his body weight

11704
03:25:52,870 --> 03:25:52,880
throw with his body weight
 

11705
03:25:52,880 --> 03:25:55,269
throw with his body weight
and he's allowing that tricep grip to

11706
03:25:55,269 --> 03:25:55,279
and he's allowing that tricep grip to
 

11707
03:25:55,279 --> 03:25:57,590
and he's allowing that tricep grip to
rotate that's going to draw and garvey

11708
03:25:57,590 --> 03:25:57,600
rotate that's going to draw and garvey
 

11709
03:25:57,600 --> 03:25:58,630
rotate that's going to draw and garvey
forward

11710
03:25:58,630 --> 03:25:58,640
forward
 

11711
03:25:58,640 --> 03:26:01,030
forward
and now when you pause it right here

11712
03:26:01,030 --> 03:26:01,040
and now when you pause it right here
 

11713
03:26:01,040 --> 03:26:03,429
and now when you pause it right here
you think about the sheer physics to

11714
03:26:03,429 --> 03:26:03,439
you think about the sheer physics to
 

11715
03:26:03,439 --> 03:26:06,950
you think about the sheer physics to
like get your body into this position

11716
03:26:06,950 --> 03:26:06,960
like get your body into this position
 

11717
03:26:06,960 --> 03:26:09,429
like get your body into this position
jimmy and i were so like when we saw

11719
03:26:09,439 --> 03:26:11,510
jimmy and i were so like when we saw
this for the first time we tried to just

11720
03:26:11,510 --> 03:26:11,520
this for the first time we tried to just
 

11721
03:26:11,520 --> 03:26:13,590
this for the first time we tried to just
stand like that and we couldn't do it

11722
03:26:13,590 --> 03:26:13,600
stand like that and we couldn't do it
 

11723
03:26:13,600 --> 03:26:14,550
stand like that and we couldn't do it
his

11724
03:26:14,550 --> 03:26:14,560
his
 

11725
03:26:14,560 --> 03:26:17,030
his
left foot is pointing straight ahead

11726
03:26:17,030 --> 03:26:17,040
left foot is pointing straight ahead
 

11727
03:26:17,040 --> 03:26:19,670
left foot is pointing straight ahead
his chest is perpendicular to that foot

11728
03:26:19,670 --> 03:26:19,680
his chest is perpendicular to that foot
 

11729
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:21,590
his chest is perpendicular to that foot
or parallel with it right and his head

11730
03:26:21,590 --> 03:26:21,600
or parallel with it right and his head
 

11731
03:26:21,600 --> 03:26:23,830
or parallel with it right and his head
is by his foot yeah is that only

11732
03:26:23,830 --> 03:26:23,840
is by his foot yeah is that only
 

11733
03:26:23,840 --> 03:26:25,590
is by his foot yeah is that only

11900
03:29:22,950 --> 03:29:22,960
else i just stick to one plan
 

11901
03:29:22,960 --> 03:29:25,190
else i just stick to one plan
and i learn all the ins and outs of that

11902
03:29:25,190 --> 03:29:25,200
and i learn all the ins and outs of that
 

11903

03:29:26,469 --> 03:29:26,479
one plan
 

11905
03:29:26,479 --> 03:29:29,349
one plan
and then i develop another plan right

11906
03:29:29,349 --> 03:29:29,359
and then i develop another plan right
 

11907
03:29:29,359 --> 03:29:31,110
and then i develop another plan right
like i might practice

11908
03:29:31,110 --> 03:29:31,120
like i might practice
 

11909
03:29:31,120 --> 03:29:33,190
like i might practice
like a london opening for example and

11910
03:29:33,190 --> 03:29:33,200
like a london opening for example and
 

11911

11913
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:37,670
just i don't even care if i win or lose
i just want to figure out how i'm going

11914
03:29:37,670 --> 03:29:37,680
i just want to figure out how i'm going
 

11915
03:29:37,680 --> 03:29:38,790
i just want to figure out how i'm going
to lose

11916
03:29:38,790 --> 03:29:38,800
to lose
 

11917
03:29:38,800 --> 03:29:40,389
to lose
and then figure out how i'm going to win

11918
03:29:40,389 --> 03:29:40,399
and then figure out how i'm going to win
 

11919
03:29:40,399 --> 03:29:41,830
and then figure out how i'm going to win
and once i know

11920
03:29:41,830 --> 03:29:41,840
and once i know
 

11921
03:29:41,840 --> 03:29:44,309
and once i know
that position is now done then i start

11922
03:29:44,309 --> 03:29:44,319
that position is now done then i start
 

11923
03:29:44,319 --> 03:29:46,150
that position is now done then i start
with another position

11924
03:29:46,150 --> 03:29:46,160
with another position
 

11925
03:29:46,160 --> 03:29:47,830
with another position
and then once i've figured out how i'm

11926
03:29:47,830 --> 03:29:47,840
and then once i've figured out how i'm
 

11927
03:29:47,840 --> 03:29:49,510
and then once i've figured out how i'm
going to lose and how i'm going to win

11928
03:29:49,510 --> 03:29:49,520
going to lose and how i'm going to win
 

11929
03:29:49,520 --> 03:29:51,190
going to lose and how i'm going to win
the next thing i do is i don't go to a

11930
03:29:51,190 --> 03:29:51,200
the next thing i do is i don't go to a
 

11931
03:29:51,200 --> 03:29:53,590
the next thing i do is i don't go to a
third i figure out the bridge between

11932
03:29:53,590 --> 03:29:53,600
third i figure out the bridge between
 

11933
03:29:53,600 --> 03:29:55,030
third i figure out the bridge between
the two

11934
03:29:55,030 --> 03:29:55,040
the two
 

11935
03:29:55,040 --> 03:29:56,870
the two
like at what point during my openings

like at what point during my openings
can i transition back into this opening

11938
03:29:59,349 --> 03:29:59,359
can i transition back into this opening
 

11939
03:29:59,359 --> 03:30:01,269
can i transition back into this opening
right so like you

11940
03:30:01,269 --> 03:30:01,279
right so like you
 

11941
03:30:01,279 --> 03:30:03,269
right so like you
have like some basic openings and you

11942
03:30:03,269 --> 03:30:03,279
have like some basic openings and you
 

11943
03:30:03,279 --> 03:30:04,710
have like some basic openings and you
want to see how they go wrong how they

11944
03:30:04,710 --> 03:30:04,720
want to see how they go wrong how they
 

11945
03:30:04,720 --> 03:30:06,150
want to see how they go wrong how they
go right all the different ways and then

11946
03:30:06,150 --> 03:30:06,160
go right all the different ways and then
 

11947
03:30:06,160 --> 03:30:08,150
go right all the different ways and then
that starts to solidify

11948
03:30:08,150 --> 03:30:08,160
that starts to solidify
 

11949
03:30:08,160 --> 03:30:09,590
that starts to solidify
a higher level concept of that

11950
03:30:09,590 --> 03:30:09,600
a higher level concept of that
 

11951
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:10,950
a higher level concept of that
particular opening and you start to

11952
03:30:10,950 --> 03:30:10,960
particular opening and you start to
 

11953

particular opening and you start to
stitch together the concept the concepts

11954
03:30:12,790 --> 03:30:12,800
stitch together the concept the concepts
 

11955
03:30:12,800 --> 03:30:14,550
stitch together the concept the concepts
together because being able to go from
