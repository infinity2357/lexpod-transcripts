gonna happen but
i think that uh my philosophy on it is

2204
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:51,680
i think that uh my philosophy on it is
 

2205
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,270
i think that uh my philosophy on it is
that

2206
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,280

 

2207
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,109

we're gonna

2208
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
we're gonna
 

2209
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,950
we're gonna
continue to advance

2210
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:58,960
continue to advance
 

2211
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,990
continue to advance
and continue to advance things around us

2212
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,000
and continue to advance things around us
 

2213
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,630
and continue to advance things around us
but i don't see us becoming extinct well

2214
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
but i don't see us becoming extinct well
 

2215
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,710
but i don't see us becoming extinct well
i mean the reason i bring up sort of

2216
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:06,720
i mean the reason i bring up sort of
 

2217
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,109
i mean the reason i bring up sort of
wu-tang in that context and

2218
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:09,119
wu-tang in that context and
 

2219
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,550
wu-tang in that context and
this is a special moment in human

2220
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,560
this is a special moment in human
 

2221
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,150
this is a special moment in human
history it's like a hundred years and

2222
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,160
history it's like a hundred years and
 

2223
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,310
history it's like a hundred years and
we've created all of this music just if

2224
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:14,320
we've created all of this music just if
 

2225
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,069
we've created all of this music just if
you think of all the richness of music

2226
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:16,079
you think of all the richness of music
 

2227
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,230
you think of all the richness of music
that's been created over 100 years

2228
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:18,240
that's been created over 100 years
 

2229
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,829
that's been created over 100 years
it's like it's not obvious to me that

2230
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:19,839
it's like it's not obvious to me that
 

2231
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,750
it's like it's not obvious to me that
that's not going to stop right like

2232
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,760
that's not going to stop right like
 

2233
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,670
that's not going to stop right like
there's a flourishing here

2234
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:23,680
there's a flourishing here
 

2235
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,589

so it's it's funny because that i could

2236
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:25,599
so it's it's funny because that i could
 

2237
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,950
so it's it's funny because that i could
see where the

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:26,960
see where the
 

2239
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,349
see where the
the book of human history is written

the book of human history is written
there's a chapter on this period of time

2242
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,280
there's a chapter on this period of time
 

2243
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,910
there's a chapter on this period of time
right and one of the things we did well

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:33,920
right and one of the things we did well
 

2245
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,790
right and one of the things we did well
is like all the technological innovation

2246
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:36,800
is like all the technological innovation
 

2247
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,470
is like all the technological innovation
with like

2248
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:38,480
with like
 

2249
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,710
with like
with rockets and with the internet but

2250
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:40,720
with rockets and with the internet but
 

2251
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,470
with rockets and with the internet but

you think about this kind of stuff but
 

3225
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,069
you think about this kind of stuff but
building ai systems as they become more

3226
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:48,079
building ai systems as they become more
 

3227
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,750
building ai systems as they become more
and more human-like

3228
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:49,760
and more human-like
 

3229

if we give
 

3235
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,950
if we give
the capacity for ai systems to suffer

3236
00:56:58,950 --> 00:56:58,960
the capacity for ai systems to suffer
 

3237
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,829
the capacity for ai systems to suffer
first to feel but then to suffer

first to feel but then to suffer
 

3239

3242
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:07,440
how do we deal with that
 

3243
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,270
how do we deal with that
it starts asking the same questions you

3244
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:09,280
it starts asking the same questions you
 

3245
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,870

00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:16,799
and i don't think we should add the
 

3253
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,349
and i don't think we should add the
suffering because it's not necessary

suffering because it's not necessary
 

3255
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,230
suffering because it's not necessary
like look if it's necessary right

3256
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,240
like look if it's necessary right
 

3257
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,270
like look if it's necessary right
because we're

3258
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
because we're
 

3259

actually think philosophically about
what

3376
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:27,680
what
 

3377
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,549
what
from a perspective of a lobster

from a perspective of a lobster
that's like symbolic or something

00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:32,160
that's like symbolic or something
 

3381
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,069
that's like symbolic or something
because you're basically put

3382
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:34,079
because you're basically put
 

3383
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,030
because you're basically put
in in the water like cold water and then

3384
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,040
in in the water like cold water and then
 

3385
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,190
in in the water like cold water and then
it heats up slowly

3386
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:39,200
it heats up slowly
 

3387
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,589
it heats up slowly
until until it's no more torture yeah it

3388
00:59:41,589 --> 00:59:41,599
until until it's no more torture yeah it
 

3389
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,190
until until it's no more torture yeah it
must have been like

3390
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:43,200
must have been like
 

3391
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,470
must have been like
they started eating lobsters in the

after the torture is finished that's
 

3405
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,710
after the torture is finished that's
probably how they discovered it

3419
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,710

so do we so are you

3420
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:08,720
so do we so are you
 

3421
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,150
so do we so are you
thinking there's an algorithm for

3422
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
thinking there's an algorithm for
 

3423
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,069
thinking there's an algorithm for
emotion

3424
01:00:12,069 --> 01:00:12,079
emotion
 

3425
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,270
emotion
yes

3426
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,280
yes
 

3427
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,069
yes
but i think emotion isn't something that

3428
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:16,079
but i think emotion isn't something that
 

3429
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,109
but i think emotion isn't something that
there's a

3430
01:00:17,109 --> 01:00:17,119
there's a
 

3431
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,589
there's a
algorithm for for a particular system we

3432
01:00:19,589 --> 01:00:19,599
algorithm for for a particular system we
 

3433
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,630
algorithm for for a particular system we
create emotions together so

3434
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:22,640
create emotions together so
 

3435
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,470
create emotions together so
emotion is something like this

3436
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:24,480
emotion is something like this
 

3437
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,710
emotion is something like this
conversation it's like magic we create

3438
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:26,720
conversation it's like magic we create
 

3439
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,390
conversation it's like magic we create
together so

3440
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:28,400
together so
 

3441
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,069
together so
um i have i've worked with quite a few

3442
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:30,079
um i have i've worked with quite a few
 

3443
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,630
um i have i've worked with quite a few
robots i've a very simple version of

3444
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:32,640
robots i've a very simple version of
 

3445
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,390
robots i've a very simple version of
that i've had you know roomba vacuum

3446
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:34,400
that i've had you know roomba vacuum
 

3447
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,349
that i've had you know roomba vacuum
cleaners

3448
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:35,359
cleaners
 

3449
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,190
cleaners
they're i've had them make different

3450
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:37,200
they're i've had them make different
 

3451
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,750
they're i've had them make different
sounds and one of them is like screaming

3452
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:39,760
sounds and one of them is like screaming
 

3453
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,670
sounds and one of them is like screaming
and pain like lightly and just having

3454
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:41,680
and pain like lightly and just having
 

3455
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,270
and pain like lightly and just having
them do that when you kick them or when

3456
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:43,280
them do that when you kick them or when
 

3457
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,910
them do that when you kick them or when
they run into stuff immediately

3458
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:45,920
they run into stuff immediately
 

3459
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,230
they run into stuff immediately
i start to feel something right so the

3460
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
i start to feel something right so the
 

3461
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,990
i start to feel something right so the
emotion okay so the emotion you're

3462
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:50,000
emotion okay so the emotion you're
 

3463
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,190
emotion okay so the emotion you're
saying is

3464
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:51,200
saying is
 

3465
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,430
saying is
impulse back on the human yeah but i'm

3466
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:53,440
impulse back on the human yeah but i'm
 

3467
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,349
impulse back on the human yeah but i'm
asking do you think there's an algorithm

3468
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:55,359
asking do you think there's an algorithm
 

3469
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:56,950
asking do you think there's an algorithm
for the emotion to being post from

3470
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:56,960
for the emotion to being post from
 

3471
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,950
for the emotion to being post from
machine to machine

3472
01:00:58,950 --> 01:00:58,960
machine to machine
 

3473
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,950
machine to machine
yeah that that's a really good way to

3474
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:00,960
yeah that that's a really good way to
 

3475
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,190
yeah that that's a really good way to
ask it

3476
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:03,200
ask it
 

3477
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,390
ask it
um

3478
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400
um
 

3479
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,309
um
it's it's difficult because i think

3480
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,319
it's it's difficult because i think
 

3481
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,069
it's it's difficult because i think
ultimately i only know how to exist in

3482
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:08,079
ultimately i only know how to exist in
 

3483
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,230
ultimately i only know how to exist in
the human world so it's like it's the

3484
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:10,240
the human world so it's like it's the
 

3485
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,230
the human world so it's like it's the
question of if a tree falls in the

3486
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
question of if a tree falls in the
 

3487
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,150
question of if a tree falls in the
forest nobody's there to see it does it

3488
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,160
forest nobody's there to see it does it
 

3489
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,270
forest nobody's there to see it does it
still fall

3490
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:15,280
still fall
 

3491
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,309
still fall
i i still think that ultimately machines

3492
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:18,319
i i still think that ultimately machines
 

3493
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,710
i i still think that ultimately machines
will have to

3494
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:20,720
will have to
 

3495
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,789
will have to
show emotion to other humans and that's

3496
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
show emotion to other humans and that's
 

3497
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,630
show emotion to other humans and that's
when it becomes real i've been thinking

3498
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:24,640
when it becomes real i've been thinking
 

3499
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,390
when it becomes real i've been thinking
about this a lot too

3500
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:26,400
about this a lot too
 

3501
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,150
about this a lot too
and uh

3502
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:28,160
and uh
 

3503
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,109
and uh
i just okay

3504
01:01:31,109 --> 01:01:31,119

 

3505
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,150

i'm not gonna come hit you with this

3506
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
i'm not gonna come hit you with this
 

3507
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,870
i'm not gonna come hit you with this
because i've been thinking about this

3508
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:32,880
because i've been thinking about this
 

3509
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,549
because i've been thinking about this
thing this is just your field yeah

3510
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:36,559

 

3511
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,150

well do you think the emotion is wave

3512
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:40,160
well do you think the emotion is wave
 

3513
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,990
well do you think the emotion is wave
like light is wave and or think it's

3514
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,000
like light is wave and or think it's
 

3515
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,589
like light is wave and or think it's
particle

3516
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599

 

3517
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,910

so emotion is just a small it's like a

3518
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
so emotion is just a small it's like a
 

3519
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,750
so emotion is just a small it's like a
shadow of something bigger and i think

3520
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760
shadow of something bigger and i think
 

3521
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,470
shadow of something bigger and i think
that bigger thing is consciousness so

3522
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:52,480
that bigger thing is consciousness so
 

3523
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,510
that bigger thing is consciousness so
emotion is just a wave or a particle

3524
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:55,520
emotion is just a wave or a particle
 

3525
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,950
emotion is just a wave or a particle
i haven't i haven't thought about that

3526
01:01:58,950 --> 01:01:58,960
i haven't i haven't thought about that
 

3527
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,710
i haven't i haven't thought about that
i have thought about it whether it's

3528
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:00,720
i have thought about it whether it's
 

3529
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,190
i have thought about it whether it's
there's something like um

3530
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:03,200
there's something like um
 

3531
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,430
there's something like um
whether consciousness or emotion is the

3532
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:05,440
whether consciousness or emotion is the
 

3533
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,750
whether consciousness or emotion is the
law of physics like if it's that

3534
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:07,760
law of physics like if it's that
 

3535
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,670
law of physics like if it's that
fundamental to you i had a lyric i had a

3536
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:09,680
fundamental to you i had a lyric i had a
 

3537
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,470
fundamental to you i had a lyric i had a
lyric i had a lyric that said this

3538
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:12,480
lyric i had a lyric that said this
 

3539
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,470
lyric i had a lyric that said this
it comes out uh they did this

3540
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:14,480
it comes out uh they did this
 

3541
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,069
it comes out uh they did this
documentary about the planet and i gave

3542
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,079
documentary about the planet and i gave
 

3543
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,910
documentary about the planet and i gave
i wrote a song it's called the world of

3544
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
i wrote a song it's called the world of
 

3545
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,349
i wrote a song it's called the world of
confusion

3546
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:19,359
confusion
 

3547
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,109
confusion
and uh i'll try to paraphrase the lyrics

3548
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:21,119
and uh i'll try to paraphrase the lyrics
 

3549
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:22,630
and uh i'll try to paraphrase the lyrics
but in the world of the confusion where

3550
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:22,640
but in the world of the confusion where
 

3551
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,470
but in the world of the confusion where
there's so much illusions we suck the

3552
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
there's so much illusions we suck the
 

3553
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,309
there's so much illusions we suck the
blood from the planet

3554
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:26,319
blood from the planet
 

3555
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,470
blood from the planet
now it needs a transfusion and the

3556
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
now it needs a transfusion and the
 

3557
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,349
now it needs a transfusion and the
redistribution of wealth

3558
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
redistribution of wealth
 

3559
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,349
redistribution of wealth
of health

3560
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:33,359
of health
 

3561
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,029
of health
and wealth of self

3562
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:35,039
and wealth of self
 

3563
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,670
and wealth of self
in a deeper understanding about mental

3564
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680

01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,200
the doctor
 

3569
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,190
the doctor
prescribed the physical solution

3570
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,200
prescribed the physical solution
 

3571
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,510
prescribed the physical solution
the psychiatrist

3572
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:47,520
the psychiatrist
 

3573
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,870
the psychiatrist
wants to build a bigger institution

3574
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:50,880
wants to build a bigger institution
 

3575
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,670
wants to build a bigger institution
but neither have the solution

3576
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:53,680
but neither have the solution
 

3577
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,990
but neither have the solution
or the equation

3578
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,000
or the equation
 

3579
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,950
or the equation
to make an instrument to measure the

3581
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,390
to make an instrument to measure the
weight

3582
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400
weight
 

3583
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,270
weight
of the hate vibration

3584
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:03,280
of the hate vibration
 

3585
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,950
of the hate vibration
what is the weight of

3586
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:04,960
what is the weight of
 

3587
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,390
what is the weight of
hate

3588
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:06,400
hate
 

3589
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,230
hate
is it heavier than the weight of love

3590
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240

 

3591
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,309

is it heavier

3592
01:03:12,309 --> 01:03:12,319
is it heavier
 

3593
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,190
is it heavier
than the weight of lead inside of a slug

3594
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:15,200
than the weight of lead inside of a slug
 

3595
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,390
than the weight of lead inside of a slug
with just

3596
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
with just
 

3597
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,829
with just
10 milligrams that's all it takes to

3598
01:03:17,829 --> 01:03:17,839
10 milligrams that's all it takes to
 

3599
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,750
10 milligrams that's all it takes to
kill a man but anyways they're not going

3600
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:19,760
kill a man but anyways they're not going
 

3601
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,990
kill a man but anyways they're not going
from there but damn that's good but the

3602
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:22,000
from there but damn that's good but the
 

3603
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,990
from there but damn that's good but the
question you see the question there yeah

3604
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,000
question you see the question there yeah
 

3605
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,230
question you see the question there yeah
yeah yeah and that can be measured yeah

3606
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:26,240
yeah yeah and that can be measured yeah
 

3607
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,950
yeah yeah and that can be measured yeah
can that be measured i think so i think

3608
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:28,960
can that be measured i think so i think
 

3609
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,430
can that be measured i think so i think
so just look at the estimate yet yeah i

3610
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:31,440
so just look at the estimate yet yeah i
 

3611
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,589
so just look at the estimate yet yeah i
yeah so we're in the

3612
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:33,599
yeah so we're in the
 

3613
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,670
yeah so we're in the
dark ages of that but i think it could

3614
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
dark ages of that but i think it could
 

3615
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:38,230
dark ages of that but i think it could
be measured i think there's something

3616
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:38,240
be measured i think there's something
 

3617
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,950
be measured i think there's something
physical like something that connects us

3618
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:40,960
physical like something that connects us
 

3619
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,710
physical like something that connects us
all this much you know we tend to think

3620
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:42,720
all this much you know we tend to think
 

3621
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,029
all this much you know we tend to think
we humans are distinct entities and we

3622
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:45,039
we humans are distinct entities and we
 

3623
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,309
we humans are distinct entities and we
move about this world but i think

3624
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,319
move about this world but i think
 

3625
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,710
move about this world but i think
there's some deeper connection

3626
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:48,720
there's some deeper connection
 

3627
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,470
there's some deeper connection
and but we're so

3628
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
and but we're so
 

3629
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,990
and but we're so

3639
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,150
side
we don't know anything about human

3640
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,160
we don't know anything about human
 

3641
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,990
we don't know anything about human
psychology we barely know much about

human biology
 

3645
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:05,589
human biology
we're trying to figure it all out

3646
01:04:05,589 --> 01:04:05,599
we're trying to figure it all out
 

3647
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,549
we're trying to figure it all out
yeah i i had another theory

3648
01:04:08,549 --> 01:04:08,559
yeah i i had another theory
 

3649
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,829
yeah i i had another theory
because you know you think about

3650
01:04:10,829 --> 01:04:10,839
because you know you think about
 

3651
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,750
because you know you think about
quantum right

3652
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:13,760
quantum right
 

3653
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,430
quantum right
as long as you say that there's an

3654
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:15,440
as long as you say that there's an
 

3655
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,069
as long as you say that there's an
uncertainty

3656
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:18,079
uncertainty
 

3657
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:19,510
uncertainty
and you have me believe there's an

3658
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:19,520
and you have me believe there's an
 

3659
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,150
and you have me believe there's an
uncertainty then there's uncertainty

3660
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:22,160
uncertainty then there's uncertainty
 

3661
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,390
uncertainty then there's uncertainty
but if there's not an uncertainty what

3662
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:24,400
but if there's not an uncertainty what
 

3663
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,309
but if there's not an uncertainty what
happens

3664
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:26,319
happens
 

3665
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:27,910
happens
so i'm only saying that it's not that

3666
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:27,920
so i'm only saying that it's not that
 

3667
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,190
so i'm only saying that it's not that
last because you look at quantum

3668
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:29,200
last because you look at quantum
 

3669
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,710
last because you look at quantum
computers they're going to give you the

3670
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:30,720
computers they're going to give you the
 

3671
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,510
computers they're going to give you the
o

3672
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:31,520
o
 

3673
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:32,630
o
the one

3674
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:32,640
the one
 

3675
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:33,990
the one
the one the oh they're gonna get they're

3676
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,000
the one the oh they're gonna get they're
 

3677
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,990
the one the oh they're gonna get they're
gonna take two things and make it eight

3678
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
gonna take two things and make it eight
 

3679
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,589
gonna take two things and make it eight
things and by the time you multiply four

3680
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:37,599
things and by the time you multiply four
 

3681
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,190
things and by the time you multiply four
of those things together

3682
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:39,200
of those things together
 

3683
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,029
of those things together
it's like this chess board right

3684
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
it's like this chess board right
 

3685
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,990
it's like this chess board right
the moves goes into the millions

3686
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:44,000
the moves goes into the millions
 

3687
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,990
the moves goes into the millions
but

3688
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:46,000
but
 

3689
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,910
but
the thing that's introduced is the

3690
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:47,920
the thing that's introduced is the
 

3691
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,910
the thing that's introduced is the
uncertainty

3692
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:49,920
uncertainty
 

3693
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,190
uncertainty
right

3694
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:51,200
right
 

3695
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:57,829
right
you're gonna make a move

3696
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:57,839

 

3697
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,829

this you know this already

3698
01:04:59,829 --> 01:04:59,839
this you know this already
 

3699
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:00,789
this you know this already
right

3700
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:00,799
right
 

3701
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:01,990
right
because this has

3702
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,000
because this has
 

3703
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,910
because this has
been played a thousand times

3704
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:03,920
been played a thousand times
 

3705
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,910
been played a thousand times
but sooner or later something uncertain

3706
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,920
but sooner or later something uncertain
 

3707
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,349
but sooner or later something uncertain
is going to come in or

3708
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
is going to come in or
 

3709
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:13,750
is going to come in or
make the next move

3710
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:13,760

 

3711
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,829

i like the weight of these

3712
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:15,839
i like the weight of these
 

3713
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,230
i like the weight of these
they add they add the certainty

3714
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:18,240
they add they add the certainty
 

3715
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,430
they add they add the certainty
i think it's just like quitting

3716
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,440
i think it's just like quitting
 

3717
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,109
i think it's just like quitting
unpredictable that there's something

3718
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
unpredictable that there's something
 

3719
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,510
unpredictable that there's something
about uh us humans that really doesn't

3720
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:23,520
about uh us humans that really doesn't
 

3721
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,510
about uh us humans that really doesn't
like everything to be fully predictable

3722
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:25,520
like everything to be fully predictable
 

3723
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,109
like everything to be fully predictable
i mean chess two

3724
01:05:27,109 --> 01:05:27,119
i mean chess two
 

3725
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,789
i mean chess two
is uh

3726
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
is uh
 

3727
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,029
is uh
perfectly solvable there's nothing

3728
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:31,039
perfectly solvable there's nothing
 

3729
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,670
perfectly solvable there's nothing
unpredictable about chess right i could

3730
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
unpredictable about chess right i could
 

3731
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,510
unpredictable about chess right i could
agree to that because

3732
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:37,520

 

3733
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,349

bobby fischer said in one of his books

3734
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:39,359
bobby fischer said in one of his books
 

3735
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,549
bobby fischer said in one of his books
watch which i actually love what he said

3736
01:05:42,549 --> 01:05:42,559
watch which i actually love what he said
 

3737
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,510
watch which i actually love what he said
he said every game of chess

3738
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:45,520
he said every game of chess
 

3739
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,230
he said every game of chess
is a draw

3740
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:48,240
is a draw
 

3741
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:49,510
is a draw
yeah

3742
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:49,520
yeah
 

3743
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,349
yeah
the only way somebody wins is when one

3744
01:05:51,349 --> 01:05:51,359

it give me give me give me some type of
answer i'll say from life itself

4316
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:50,480
answer i'll say from life itself
 

4317
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,830
answer i'll say from life itself
but what does it feel like because you

4318
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840
but what does it feel like because you
 

4319

4338
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:12,400
hard work it's almost like i said in one
 

4339

like
in fact there's actually a scientific

4350
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:24,800
in fact there's actually a scientific
 

4351
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,470
in fact there's actually a scientific
scientific thing i read about that now

4352
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:26,480
scientific thing i read about that now
 

4353
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:27,990
scientific thing i read about that now
that you might be nanny said that you

4354
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:28,000
that you might be nanny said that you
 

4355
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,110
that you might be nanny said that you
heard this i know you've had to hear

4356
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,120
heard this i know you've had to hear
 

4357
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:29,910
heard this i know you've had to hear
this

4358
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:29,920
this
 

4359
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,590
this
they say that

4360
01:16:33,590 --> 01:16:33,600

 

4361
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,390

you know

4362
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
you know
 

4363
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,709
you know
the atoms in our atmosphere

4364
01:16:36,709 --> 01:16:36,719
the atoms in our atmosphere
 

4365
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,630
the atoms in our atmosphere
which seem to be infinite in number

4366
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:40,640
which seem to be infinite in number
 

4367
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,310
which seem to be infinite in number
are not infinite in the space they

4368
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:42,320
are not infinite in the space they
 

4369
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,390
are not infinite in the space they
occupy

4370
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:44,400
occupy
 

4371
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:48,149
occupy
how can they in our atmosphere

4372
01:16:48,149 --> 01:16:48,159
how can they in our atmosphere
 

4373
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,790
how can they in our atmosphere
and so there's a chance

4374
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:50,800
and so there's a chance
 

4375
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,950
and so there's a chance
that at least one million atoms that you

4376
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:52,960
that at least one million atoms that you
 

4377
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,030
that at least one million atoms that you
breathed in your life

4378
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:55,040
breathed in your life
 

4379
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,310
breathed in your life
was breathed by galileo

4380
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:58,320
was breathed by galileo
 

4381
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,310
was breathed by galileo
you heard this before all right yeah

4382
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:00,320
you heard this before all right yeah
 

4383
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,709
you heard this before all right yeah
okay

4384
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:02,719
okay
 

4385
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,070
okay
it's very accurate

4386
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
it's very accurate
 

4387
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,270
it's very accurate
okay

4388
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:05,280
okay
 

4389
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:10,550
okay
how does your body digest it

4390
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:10,560

 

4391
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,310

well let's start at the fact that most

4392
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:12,320
well let's start at the fact that most
 

4393
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,070
well let's start at the fact that most
of the atoms

4394
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:14,080
of the atoms
 

4395
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,030
of the atoms
in our

4396
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:15,040
in our
 

4397
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,709
in our
what that we're made of is from like

4398
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:16,719
what that we're made of is from like
 

4399
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,830
what that we're made of is from like
stars right from stars bursts so like

4400
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:19,840
stars right from stars bursts so like
 

4401
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,910
stars right from stars bursts so like
we're all really connected fundamentally

4402
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,920
we're all really connected fundamentally
 

4403
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,669
we're all really connected fundamentally
somehow and then they get the atoms that

4404
01:17:23,669 --> 01:17:23,679
somehow and then they get the atoms that
 

4405
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,990
somehow and then they get the atoms that
make up our body come and leave and the

4406
01:17:25,990 --> 01:17:26,000
make up our body come and leave and the
 

4407
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,910
make up our body come and leave and the
same with the cells that are in our body

4408
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:27,920
same with the cells that are in our body
 

4409
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,390
same with the cells that are in our body
they die and are reborn and we don't pay

4410
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:30,400
they die and are reborn and we don't pay
 

4411
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,910
they die and are reborn and we don't pay
attention to any of that that all just

4412
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:31,920
attention to any of that that all just
 

4413
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,189
attention to any of that that all just
goes through us

4414
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
goes through us
 

4415
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,630
goes through us
i don't know

4416
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:34,640
i don't know
 

4417
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,270
i don't know
that

4418
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280

 

4419
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,110

that makes me feel

4420
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:39,120
that makes me feel
 

4421
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,470
that makes me feel
like

4422
01:17:40,470 --> 01:17:40,480
like
 

4423
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,350
like
i'm not an individual i'm just

4424
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,360
i'm not an individual i'm just
 

4425
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,750
i'm not an individual i'm just
a finger of something much bigger some

4426
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:45,760
a finger of something much bigger some
 

4427
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,430
a finger of something much bigger some
much bigger organism

4428
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:47,440
much bigger organism
 

4429
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,590
much bigger organism
well because you're drinking the coffee

4430
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:49,600
well because you're drinking the coffee
 

4431
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:50,950
well because you're drinking the coffee
there yeah

4432
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:50,960
there yeah
 

4433
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,070
there yeah
right you're going to digest that

4434
01:17:54,070 --> 01:17:54,080
right you're going to digest that
 

4435
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,709
right you're going to digest that
you're going to digest those atoms

4436
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:56,719
you're going to digest those atoms
 

4437
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:57,830
you're going to digest those atoms
whether you're going to put them through

4438
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:57,840
whether you're going to put them through
 

4439
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:00,070
whether you're going to put them through
the bowel or through the urination it's

4440
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,080
the bowel or through the urination it's
 

4441
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,750
the bowel or through the urination it's
coming out or maybe you'll sweat it out

4442
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:01,760
coming out or maybe you'll sweat it out
 

4443
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,990
coming out or maybe you'll sweat it out
yeah you might sneeze it out yeah but

4444
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:04,000
yeah you might sneeze it out yeah but
 

4445
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,750
yeah you might sneeze it out yeah but
they're going to make their way out how

4446
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:05,760
they're going to make their way out how
 

4447
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,510
they're going to make their way out how
do you digest the atoms if you just

4448
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:07,520
do you digest the atoms if you just
 

4449
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,990
do you digest the atoms if you just
breathe in galileo

4450
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,000
breathe in galileo
 

4451
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,870
breathe in galileo
right how and that's what i think a

4452
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:12,880
right how and that's what i think a
 

4453
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,470
right how and that's what i think a
artist does

4454
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
artist does
 

4455
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,229
artist does
i think something in the artist it's

4456
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
i think something in the artist it's
 

4457
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:17,590
i think something in the artist it's
like some people eat things and they're

4458
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:17,600
like some people eat things and they're
 

4459
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,950
like some people eat things and they're
going to gain weight some people ain't

4460
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:18,960
going to gain weight some people ain't
 

4461
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,830
going to gain weight some people ain't
going in the game but they're going to

4462
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:19,840
going in the game but they're going to
 

4463
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,830
going in the game but they're going to
gain muscle

4464
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:21,840
gain muscle
 

4465
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,590
gain muscle
my i'm just giving an analogy here i'm

4466
01:18:23,590 --> 01:18:23,600
my i'm just giving an analogy here i'm
 

4467
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,350
my i'm just giving an analogy here i'm
thinking that the artist breathes in and

4468
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:27,360
thinking that the artist breathes in and
 

4469
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,910
thinking that the artist breathes in and
translates it into the art first they

4470
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:29,920
translates it into the art first they
 

4471
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,590
translates it into the art first they
got to hear it i think most of us don't

4472
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
got to hear it i think most of us don't
 

4473
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,750
got to hear it i think most of us don't
hear that like don't

4474
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
hear that like don't
 

4475
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,270
hear that like don't
we receive it but it's just this right

4476
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:35,280
we receive it but it's just this right
 

4477
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:37,430
we receive it but it's just this right
it's not yeah we not have the frequency

4478
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:37,440
it's not yeah we not have the frequency
 

4479
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,709
it's not yeah we not have the frequency
i said this to about artists and even

4480
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:40,719
i said this to about artists and even
 

4481
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,390
i said this to about artists and even
you know new york consider ourselves

4482
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:42,400
you know new york consider ourselves
 

4483
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,990
you know new york consider ourselves
artists in a certain way but not you

4484
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:44,000
artists in a certain way but not you
 

4485
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,110
artists in a certain way but not you
know but let's just say

4486
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:47,120
know but let's just say
 

4487
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,030
know but let's just say
there's only

4488
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,040
there's only
 

4489
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,830
there's only
one million artists in the world yeah

4490
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840
one million artists in the world yeah
 

4491
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:57,430
one million artists in the world yeah
good

4492
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:57,440

 

4493
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,390

if you divide that into the population

4494
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:00,400
if you divide that into the population
 

4495
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,750
if you divide that into the population
what would that what what part of the

4496
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:01,760
what would that what what part of the
 

4497
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:04,470
what would that what what part of the
table would it be a tiny part yeah it

4498
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:04,480
table would it be a tiny part yeah it
 

4499
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,229
table would it be a tiny part yeah it
might be that right

4500
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:06,239
might be that right
 

4501
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,189
might be that right
yeah

4502
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:07,199
yeah
 

4503
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:09,350
yeah
um and yeah it's that

4504
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
um and yeah it's that
 

4505
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,350
um and yeah it's that
that inspires that

4506
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:11,360
that inspires that
 

4507
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:12,709
that inspires that
oh yeah you know what's so crazy about

4508
01:19:12,709 --> 01:19:12,719
oh yeah you know what's so crazy about
 

4509
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:13,830
oh yeah you know what's so crazy about
that though

4510
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:13,840
that though
 

4511
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,669
that though
there's also a chance i'm just going

4512
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:15,679
there's also a chance i'm just going
 

4513
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,910
there's also a chance i'm just going
numbers and i'm just hypothesizing with

4514
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
numbers and i'm just hypothesizing with
 

4515
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,910
numbers and i'm just hypothesizing with
you but there's also a chance that all

4516
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:19,920
you but there's also a chance that all
 

4517
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,310
you but there's also a chance that all
of this

4518
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320
of this
 

4519
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,550
of this
is actually informing that yeah

4520
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:26,560

 

4521
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,790

the artist is just watching this all of

4522
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:28,800
the artist is just watching this all of
 

4523
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:29,669
the artist is just watching this all of
this

4524
01:19:29,669 --> 01:19:29,679
this
 

4525
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:32,870
this
all the the chaos of this yeah so it's

4526
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:32,880
all the the chaos of this yeah so it's
 

4527
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,470
all the the chaos of this yeah so it's
hard to know where the beauty comes from

4528
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:34,480
hard to know where the beauty comes from
 

4529
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,630
hard to know where the beauty comes from
is it the artist or the chaos from the

4530
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:36,640
is it the artist or the chaos from the
 

4531
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,630
is it the artist or the chaos from the
so i just so i said i don't know i don't

4532
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:38,640
so i just so i said i don't know i don't
 

4533
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,390
so i just so i said i don't know i don't
have the answer but i if i was to be

4534
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:40,400
have the answer but i if i was to be
 

4535
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,149
have the answer but i if i was to be
forced to say or something you're not

4536
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,159
forced to say or something you're not
 

4537
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:44,229
forced to say or something you're not
twisting my arm but yeah i would say i

4538
01:19:44,229 --> 01:19:44,239
twisting my arm but yeah i would say i
 

4539
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:46,390
twisting my arm but yeah i would say i
can if you want me no thank you i'll say

4540
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:46,400
can if you want me no thank you i'll say
 

4541
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,229
can if you want me no thank you i'll say
life

4542
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
life
 

4543
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,430
life
yeah yeah life

4544
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:51,440
yeah yeah life
 

4545
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:53,590
yeah yeah life
in the tao of wu you write

4546
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:53,600
in the tao of wu you write
 

4547
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,350
in the tao of wu you write
something about confusion which i really

4548
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,360
something about confusion which i really
 

4549
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,550
something about confusion which i really
like confusion is a gift from god

4550
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
like confusion is a gift from god
 

4551
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,709
like confusion is a gift from god
those times when you feel most desperate

4552
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
those times when you feel most desperate
 

4553
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,790
those times when you feel most desperate
