00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,910

I think it's actually not that hard to

00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:01,920
I think it's actually not that hard to
 

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,649
I think it's actually not that hard to
imagine we are the only civilization in

00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:03,659
imagine we are the only civilization in
 

5
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,170
imagine we are the only civilization in
the Galaxy right now living yeah that's

6
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:06,180
the Galaxy right now living yeah that's
 

7
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,450
the Galaxy right now living yeah that's
that's currently extent but there may be

8
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:08,460
that's currently extent but there may be
 

9
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,089
that's currently extent but there may be
very many extinct civilizations if each

10
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:11,099
very many extinct civilizations if each
 

11
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,589
very many extinct civilizations if each
civilization has a typical lifetime

12
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:12,599
civilization has a typical lifetime
 

13
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,930
civilization has a typical lifetime
comparable to let's say AI is the demise

00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:14,940
comparable to let's say AI is the demise
 

15
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,910
comparable to let's say AI is the demise
of our own that's only a few hundred

00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:16,920
of our own that's only a few hundred
 

17
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,410
of our own that's only a few hundred
years of technological development or

18
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:18,420
years of technological development or
 

19
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,269
years of technological development or
maybe 10 000 years if you go back to the

20
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:20,279
maybe 10 000 years if you go back to the
 

21
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,790
maybe 10 000 years if you go back to the
nearest Revolution the dawn of

00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
nearest Revolution the dawn of
 

23
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,009
nearest Revolution the dawn of
Agriculture you know hardly anything can

00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:25,019
Agriculture you know hardly anything can

Cosmic time span

26
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:26,939
Cosmic time span
 

27
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,490
Cosmic time span
um that that's nothing that's the blink

28
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:28,500
um that that's nothing that's the blink
 

29
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,830
um that that's nothing that's the blink
of an eye and so it's not surprising at

30
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:30,840
of an eye and so it's not surprising at
 

31
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,170
of an eye and so it's not surprising at
all that we would happen not to co-exist

32
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:33,180
all that we would happen not to co-exist
 

33
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,389
all that we would happen not to co-exist
with anyone else but that doesn't mean

34
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:35,399
with anyone else but that doesn't mean
 

35
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,670
with anyone else but that doesn't mean
nobody else was ever here

36
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
nobody else was ever here
 

37
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,910
nobody else was ever here
and if other civilizations come to that

38
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:40,920
and if other civilizations come to that
 

39
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,310
and if other civilizations come to that
same conclusion and realization maybe

40
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,320
same conclusion and realization maybe
 

41
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,170
same conclusion and realization maybe
they scour the Galaxy around them to

42
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,180
they scour the Galaxy around them to
 

43
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,150
they scour the Galaxy around them to
find any evidence for intelligence

44
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,160
find any evidence for intelligence
 

45
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,069
find any evidence for intelligence
then they have two options they can

46
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:49,079
then they have two options they can
 

47
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,290
then they have two options they can
either give up on communication and just

48
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:51,300
either give up on communication and just
 

49
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,270
either give up on communication and just
say well it's never going to happen uh

50
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,280
say well it's never going to happen uh
 

51
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,610
say well it's never going to happen uh
we just may as well just you know worry

52
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:55,620
we just may as well just you know worry
 

53
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,689
we just may as well just you know worry
about what's Happening Here on our own

your research at Columbia is in part
 

93
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,249
your research at Columbia is in part
focused on what you call cool worlds or

94
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:46,259
focused on what you call cool worlds or
 

95
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,469
focused on what you call cool worlds or
worlds outside our solar system where

96
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
worlds outside our solar system where
 

97
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,810
worlds outside our solar system where
temperature is sufficiently cool to

98
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:50,820
temperature is sufficiently cool to
 

99
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,850
temperature is sufficiently cool to
allow for moons rings and Life to form

100
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:52,860
allow for moons rings and Life to form
 

101
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,090
allow for moons rings and Life to form
and for us humans to observe it so can

102
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,100
and for us humans to observe it so can
 

103
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,090
and for us humans to observe it so can
you tell me more about this idea this

104
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,100
you tell me more about this idea this
 

105
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,149
you tell me more about this idea this
place of cool worlds yeah the history of

106
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
place of cool worlds yeah the history of
 

107
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,770
place of cool worlds yeah the history of
discovering planets outside our solar

108
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:03,780
discovering planets outside our solar
 

109
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,170
discovering planets outside our solar
system was really dominated by these hot

110
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,180
system was really dominated by these hot
 

111
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,210
system was really dominated by these hot
planets and that's just because of the

112
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,220
planets and that's just because of the
 

113
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,669
planets and that's just because of the
fact they're easier to find when the

114
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:10,679
fact they're easier to find when the
 

115
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,470
fact they're easier to find when the
very first methods came online these

116
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
very first methods came online these
 

117
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,690
very first methods came online these
were primarily the Doppler spectroscopy

118
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:14,700
were primarily the Doppler spectroscopy
 

119
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,869
were primarily the Doppler spectroscopy
method looking for wobbling stars and

120
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
method looking for wobbling stars and
 

121
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,610
method looking for wobbling stars and
also the transit method and these two

122
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:19,620
also the transit method and these two
 

123
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,130
also the transit method and these two
both have a really strong bias towards

124
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:22,140
both have a really strong bias towards
 

125
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,890
both have a really strong bias towards
finding these hot planets now

126
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:24,900
finding these hot planets now
 

127
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,750
finding these hot planets now
hot plants are interesting the chemistry

128
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:26,760
hot plants are interesting the chemistry
 

129
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,550
hot plants are interesting the chemistry
in their atmosphere is fascinating it's

130
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
in their atmosphere is fascinating it's
 

131
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,930
in their atmosphere is fascinating it's
very alien

132
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:29,940
very alien
 

133
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,449
very alien
um an example of one that's particularly

134
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:32,459
um an example of one that's particularly
 

135
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,210
um an example of one that's particularly
close to my heart is trace2b whose

136
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:35,220
close to my heart is trace2b whose
 

137
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,830
close to my heart is trace2b whose
atmosphere is so dark it's less

138
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:36,840
atmosphere is so dark it's less
 

139
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,050
atmosphere is so dark it's less
reflective than coal and so they have

140
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,060
reflective than coal and so they have
 

141
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,509
reflective than coal and so they have
really bizarre photometric properties

142
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
really bizarre photometric properties
 

143
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,630
really bizarre photometric properties
yet at the same time they resemble

144
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
yet at the same time they resemble
 

145
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,550
yet at the same time they resemble
nothing like our own home

146
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
nothing like our own home
 

147
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,009
nothing like our own home
and so it said there's two types of

148
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:49,019
and so it said there's two types of
 

149
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,509
and so it said there's two types of
astrophysicists the astrophysicists who

150
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:50,519
astrophysicists the astrophysicists who
 

151
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,610
astrophysicists the astrophysicists who
care about how the universe works they

152
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:52,620
care about how the universe works they
 

153
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,250
care about how the universe works they
want to understand the mechanics of the

154
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,260
want to understand the mechanics of the
 

155
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,990
want to understand the mechanics of the
Machinery of this universe why did the

156
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,000
Machinery of this universe why did the
 

157
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,550
Machinery of this universe why did the
big bang happen why is the universe

158
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
big bang happen why is the universe
 

159
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,830
big bang happen why is the universe
expanding how are galaxies formed and

160
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:00,840
expanding how are galaxies formed and
 

161
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,270
expanding how are galaxies formed and
there's another type of astrophysicist

162
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,280
there's another type of astrophysicist
 

163
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,710
there's another type of astrophysicist
which perhaps

164
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:03,720

Whispers into your ear and that is why

170
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
Whispers into your ear and that is why
 

171
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,710
Whispers into your ear and that is why
are we here

172
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:09,720
are we here
 

173
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,229
are we here
are we alone are there others out there

174
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
are we alone are there others out there

and ultimately along this journey the
hot plants aren't going to get us there

178
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:16,379
hot plants aren't going to get us there
 

179
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,410
hot plants aren't going to get us there
we when we're looking for life in the

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:18,420
we when we're looking for life in the

we when we're looking for life in the
universe seems to make perfect sense

182
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
universe seems to make perfect sense
 

183
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,009
universe seems to make perfect sense
that there should be plants like our own

184
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:22,019
that there should be plants like our own
 

185
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,250
that there should be plants like our own
out there maybe even moons like our own

186
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,260
out there maybe even moons like our own
 

187
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,930
out there maybe even moons like our own
planet around gas giants that could be

188
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:26,940
planet around gas giants that could be
 

189
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,690
planet around gas giants that could be
habitable and so my research has been

190
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:29,700
habitable and so my research has been
 

191
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,670
habitable and so my research has been
driven by trying to find these more

192
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
driven by trying to find these more
 

193
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,949
driven by trying to find these more
draculous globes that might resemble our

194
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:33,959
draculous globes that might resemble our
 

195
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:34,970
draculous globes that might resemble our
own planet

196
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:34,980
own planet
 

197
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,130
own planet
so they're the ones that lurk more in

198
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,140
so they're the ones that lurk more in
 

199
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,930
so they're the ones that lurk more in
the shadows in terms of how difficult it

200
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:38,940
the shadows in terms of how difficult it
 

201
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,270
the shadows in terms of how difficult it
is to detect that much harder they're

202
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
is to detect that much harder they're
 

203
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,009
is to detect that much harder they're
harder for several reasons the method we

204
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:43,019
harder for several reasons the method we
 

205
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,869
harder for several reasons the method we
primarily use is the transit method so

206
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
primarily use is the transit method so
 

207
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,330
primarily use is the transit method so
this is really eclipses as the planet

208
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:47,340
this is really eclipses as the planet
 

209
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,130
this is really eclipses as the planet
passes in front of the star it blocks

210
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,140
passes in front of the star it blocks
 

211
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,930
passes in front of the star it blocks
out some Starlight the problem with that

212
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:50,940
out some Starlight the problem with that
 

213
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,850
out some Starlight the problem with that
is that not all planets pass in front of

214
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:52,860
is that not all planets pass in front of
 

215
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,830
is that not all planets pass in front of
their star they have to be aligned

216
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:54,840
their star they have to be aligned
 

217
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,410
their star they have to be aligned
correctly from your line of sight and so

218
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:57,420
correctly from your line of sight and so
 

219
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,970
correctly from your line of sight and so
the further away the planet is from the

220
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:58,980
the further away the planet is from the
 

221
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,430
the further away the planet is from the
Star the cooler it is the less likely it

222
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:01,440
Star the cooler it is the less likely it
 

223
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,270
Star the cooler it is the less likely it
is that you're going to get that

224
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,280
is that you're going to get that
 

225
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,089
is that you're going to get that
geometric alignment so whereas a hot

226
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:05,099
geometric alignment so whereas a hot
 

227
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,649
geometric alignment so whereas a hot
Jupiter about one percent of hot

228
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:06,659
Jupiter about one percent of hot
 

229
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,210
Jupiter about one percent of hot
Jupiters will transit in front of their

230
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:08,220
Jupiters will transit in front of their
 

231
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,170
Jupiters will transit in front of their
star only about uh 0.5 percent maybe

232
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,180
star only about uh 0.5 percent maybe
 

233
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,610
star only about uh 0.5 percent maybe
even a quarter of a percent of

234
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:13,620
even a quarter of a percent of
 

235
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,809
even a quarter of a percent of
earth-like planets will have the right

236
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:14,819
earth-like planets will have the right
 

237
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,689
earth-like planets will have the right
geometry to Transit and so that makes it

238
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:17,699
geometry to Transit and so that makes it
 

239
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,550
geometry to Transit and so that makes it
much much harder for us what's the

240
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
much much harder for us what's the
 

241
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,050
much much harder for us what's the
connection between temperature of the

242
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,060
connection between temperature of the
 

243
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,610
connection between temperature of the
plan and geometric alignment the

244
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:22,620
plan and geometric alignment the
 

245
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,930
plan and geometric alignment the
probability of geometrical element

246
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:23,940
probability of geometrical element
 

247
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,670
probability of geometrical element
there's not a direct connection but

248
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
there's not a direct connection but
 

249
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,110
there's not a direct connection but
they're connected varying intermediate

250
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
they're connected varying intermediate
 

251
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,670
they're connected varying intermediate
parameter which is their separation from

252
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:28,680
parameter which is their separation from
 

253
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,189
parameter which is their separation from
the Star so the planet will be cool if

254
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:31,199
the Star so the planet will be cool if
 

255
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,409
the Star so the planet will be cool if
it's further away from the Star which in

256
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:33,419
it's further away from the Star which in
 

257
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,670
it's further away from the Star which in
turn means the probability of getting

258
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:34,680
turn means the probability of getting
 

259
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,070
turn means the probability of getting
that alignment correct is going to be

260
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,080
that alignment correct is going to be
 

261
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,010
that alignment correct is going to be
less on top of that they also Transit

262
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:40,020
less on top of that they also Transit
 

263
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,290
less on top of that they also Transit
their star less frequently so if you go

264
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:42,300
their star less frequently so if you go
 

265
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,030
their star less frequently so if you go
to the telescope and you want to

266
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,040
to the telescope and you want to
 

267
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,530
to the telescope and you want to
discover a hot Jupiter you could

268
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:45,540
discover a hot Jupiter you could
 

269
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,909
discover a hot Jupiter you could
probably do it in a week or so because

270
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:46,919
probably do it in a week or so because
 

271
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,770
probably do it in a week or so because
the orbital periods of order of one two

272
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:48,780
the orbital periods of order of one two
 

273
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,510
the orbital periods of order of one two
three days so you can actually get the

274
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:50,520
three days so you can actually get the
 

275
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,189
three days so you can actually get the
full orbit two or three times over

276
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,199
full orbit two or three times over
 

277
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,110
full orbit two or three times over
whereas everyone's touched an Earth-like

278
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,120
whereas everyone's touched an Earth-like
 

279
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,450
whereas everyone's touched an Earth-like
planet you have to observe that star for

280
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:56,460
planet you have to observe that star for
 

281
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,670
planet you have to observe that star for
three four years and that's actually one

282
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:58,680
three four years and that's actually one
 

283
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,790
three four years and that's actually one
of the problems with Kepler Kepler was

284
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:01,800
of the problems with Kepler Kepler was
 

285
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,710
of the problems with Kepler Kepler was
this very successful mission that NASA

286
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:03,720
this very successful mission that NASA
 

287
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,909
this very successful mission that NASA
launched

288
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:04,919
launched
 

289
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,730
launched
um over a decade ago now I think and it

290
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:07,740
um over a decade ago now I think and it
 

291
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,469
um over a decade ago now I think and it
discovered thousands of planets it's

292
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:09,479
discovered thousands of planets it's
 

293
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,689
discovered thousands of planets it's
still the dominant source of exoplanets

294
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:11,699
still the dominant source of exoplanets
 

295
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,030
still the dominant source of exoplanets
that we know about but unfortunately it

296
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,040
that we know about but unfortunately it
 

297
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,469
that we know about but unfortunately it
didn't last as long as we would have

298
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:15,479
didn't last as long as we would have
 

299
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,890
didn't last as long as we would have
liked it to it died after about 4.35

300
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:18,900
liked it to it died after about 4.35
 

301
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,290
liked it to it died after about 4.35
years I think it was and so for an

302
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:21,300
years I think it was and so for an
 

303
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,909
years I think it was and so for an
Earth-like planet that's just enough to

304
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:22,919
Earth-like planet that's just enough to
 

305
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,189
Earth-like planet that's just enough to
catch four transits and four transits

306
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
catch four transits and four transits
 

307
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,930
catch four transits and four transits
was kind of seen as the minimum but of

308
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:26,940
was kind of seen as the minimum but of
 

309
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,270
was kind of seen as the minimum but of
course the more transits you see the

310
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
course the more transits you see the
 

311
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,590
course the more transits you see the
easier it is to detect it because you

312
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,600
easier it is to detect it because you
 

313
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,510
easier it is to detect it because you
build up signal to noise if you see the

314
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:32,520
build up signal to noise if you see the
 

315
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,510
build up signal to noise if you see the
same thing the more ticks you get the

316
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
same thing the more ticks you get the
 

317
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,370
same thing the more ticks you get the
easier is to find it and so it was

318
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:37,380
easier is to find it and so it was
 

319
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,249
easier is to find it and so it was
really a shame that Kepler was just at

320
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:40,259
really a shame that Kepler was just at
 

321
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,990
really a shame that Kepler was just at
the limit of where we were expecting it

322
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
the limit of where we were expecting it
 

323
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,330
the limit of where we were expecting it
to start to see earth-ite planets and in

324
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:44,340
to start to see earth-ite planets and in
 

325
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,570
to start to see earth-ite planets and in
fact it really found zero zero planets

326
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:47,580
fact it really found zero zero planets
 

327
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,370
fact it really found zero zero planets
that are around stars like the sun

328
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:49,380
that are around stars like the sun
 

329
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,170
that are around stars like the sun
they're all bits similar to the Earth

330
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,180
they're all bits similar to the Earth
 

331
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,629
they're all bits similar to the Earth
around the Sun and could potentially be

332
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:53,639
around the Sun and could potentially be
 

333
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,370
around the Sun and could potentially be
similar to our own planet in terms of

334
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:55,380
similar to our own planet in terms of
 

335
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,590
similar to our own planet in terms of
its composition and so it's a great

336
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
its composition and so it's a great
 

337
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,510
its composition and so it's a great
shame but um that's why it gives

338
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
shame but um that's why it gives
 

339
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,730
shame but um that's why it gives
astronomers more to do in the future

340
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:01,740
astronomers more to do in the future
 

341
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,390
astronomers more to do in the future
just to clarify the transit method

342
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,400
just to clarify the transit method
 

343
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,510
just to clarify the transit method
is our primary way of detecting these

344
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:08,520
is our primary way of detecting these
 

345
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,710
is our primary way of detecting these
things

346
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:09,720
things
 

347
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,409
things
and what it is is uh

348
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:12,419
and what it is is uh
 

349
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,490
and what it is is uh
when the object passes occludes the

350
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:16,500
when the object passes occludes the
 

351
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,650
when the object passes occludes the
source of light just a tiny bit a few

352
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:18,660
source of light just a tiny bit a few
 

353
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,870
source of light just a tiny bit a few
pixels and from that we can infer

354
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
pixels and from that we can infer
 

355
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,610
pixels and from that we can infer
something about its mass and size and

356
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:22,620
something about its mass and size and
 

357
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,249
something about its mass and size and
distance geometry all of that that's

358
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:25,259
distance geometry all of that that's
 

359
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,950
distance geometry all of that that's
like trying to tell

360
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:27,960
like trying to tell
 

361
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,590
like trying to tell
what uh

362
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:30,600
what uh
 

363
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,510
what uh
uh at a party you can't see anything

364
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,520
uh at a party you can't see anything
 

365
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,210
uh at a party you can't see anything
about a a person but you can just see by

366
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:35,220
about a a person but you can just see by
 

367
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,370
about a a person but you can just see by
the way they occlude others so this is

368
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:37,380
the way they occlude others so this is
 

369
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,430
the way they occlude others so this is
the method but is this is super far away

370
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:40,440
the method but is this is super far away
 

371
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,529
the method but is this is super far away
how many pixels of information do we

372
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:42,539
how many pixels of information do we
 

373
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:43,330
how many pixels of information do we
have

374
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,340
have
 

375
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,010
have
basically how high resolution is the

376
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:46,020
basically how high resolution is the
 

377
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,390
basically how high resolution is the
signal that we

378
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:47,400
signal that we
 

379
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,830
signal that we
um that we can get about these

380
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:48,840
um that we can get about these
 

381
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,210
um that we can get about these
occlusions

382
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:50,220
occlusions
 

383
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,309
occlusions
you're right in your description I think

384
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
you're right in your description I think
 

385
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,510
you're right in your description I think
just to build upon that a little bit

386
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
just to build upon that a little bit
 

387
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,790
just to build upon that a little bit
more it might be almost like your vision

388
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:55,800
more it might be almost like your vision
 

389
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,650
more it might be almost like your vision
is completely blurry like you have an

390
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:57,660
is completely blurry like you have an
 

391
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,930
is completely blurry like you have an
extreme you know High prescription and

392
00:06:59,930 --> 00:06:59,940
extreme you know High prescription and
 

393
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,550
extreme you know High prescription and
so you can't resolve anything

394
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
so you can't resolve anything
 

395
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,070
so you can't resolve anything
everything's just blurs and but you can

396
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
everything's just blurs and but you can
 

397
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,450
everything's just blurs and but you can
tell that something was there because it

398
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:05,460
tell that something was there because it
 

399
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,430
tell that something was there because it
just got fainter for a short amount of

400
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
just got fainter for a short amount of
 

401
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,749
just got fainter for a short amount of
time something someone passed in front

402
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:08,759
time something someone passed in front
 

403
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,610
time something someone passed in front
of a light yeah and so that light in

404
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:10,620
of a light yeah and so that light in
 

405
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,110
of a light yeah and so that light in
your eyes would just dim for a short

406
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,120
your eyes would just dim for a short
 

407
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,909
your eyes would just dim for a short
moment now the reason we have that

408
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
moment now the reason we have that
 

409
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,550
moment now the reason we have that
problem with blown us a resolution is

410
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
problem with blown us a resolution is
 

411
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,710
problem with blown us a resolution is
just because the stars are so far away I

412
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
just because the stars are so far away I
 

413
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,629
just because the stars are so far away I
mean these are the closest stars of four

414
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
mean these are the closest stars of four
 

415
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,950
mean these are the closest stars of four
light years away but most of the Stars

416
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:21,960
light years away but most of the Stars
 

417
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,270
light years away but most of the Stars
Kappa looked at were thousands of light

418
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
Kappa looked at were thousands of light
 

419
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,290
Kappa looked at were thousands of light
years away

420
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,300
years away
 

421
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,330
years away
and so you there's absolutely no chance

422
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:26,340
and so you there's absolutely no chance
 

423
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,710
and so you there's absolutely no chance
that the telescope can physically

424
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:27,720
that the telescope can physically
 

425
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,850
that the telescope can physically
resolve

426
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:28,860
resolve
 

427
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,150
resolve
the star or even the separation between

428
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
the star or even the separation between
 

429
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,670
the star or even the separation between
the planet and the star is too small

430
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:34,680
the planet and the star is too small
 

431
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,050
the planet and the star is too small
especially for a telescope like Kepler

432
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,060
especially for a telescope like Kepler
 

433
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,330
especially for a telescope like Kepler
it's only a meter across in principle

434
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,340
it's only a meter across in principle
 

435
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,510
it's only a meter across in principle
you can make those detections but

436
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
you can make those detections but
 

437
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,370
you can make those detections but
you need a different kind of telescope

438
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:43,380
you need a different kind of telescope
 

439
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,930
you need a different kind of telescope
we call that direct Imaging and direct

440
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:44,940
we call that direct Imaging and direct
 

441
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,110
we call that direct Imaging and direct
Imaging is a very exciting distinct way

442
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,120
Imaging is a very exciting distinct way
 

443
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,749
Imaging is a very exciting distinct way
of detecting planets but it as you can

444
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:50,759
of detecting planets but it as you can
 

445
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,150
of detecting planets but it as you can
imagine is going to be far easier to

446
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,160
imagine is going to be far easier to
 

447
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,589
imagine is going to be far easier to
detect plants which are really far away

448
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:54,599
detect plants which are really far away
 

449
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,850
detect plants which are really far away
from their star to do that because

450
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:55,860
from their star to do that because
 

451
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,930
from their star to do that because
that's going to make that separation

452
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:56,940
that's going to make that separation
 

453
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,610
that's going to make that separation
really big and then you also want the

454
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:58,620
really big and then you also want the
 

455
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,170
really big and then you also want the
star to be really close to us so the

456
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,180
star to be really close to us so the
 

457
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,570
star to be really close to us so the
nearest Stars not only that but you

458
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:02,580
nearest Stars not only that but you
 

459
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,670
nearest Stars not only that but you
would prefer that planet to be really

460
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:04,680
would prefer that planet to be really
 

461
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,589
would prefer that planet to be really
hot because the hotter it is the

462
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:06,599
hot because the hotter it is the
 

463
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,990
hot because the hotter it is the
brighter it is and so that tends to bias

464
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,000
brighter it is and so that tends to bias
 

465
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,610
brighter it is and so that tends to bias
direct Imaging towards plants which are

466
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:10,620
direct Imaging towards plants which are
 

467
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,770
direct Imaging towards plants which are
in the processor forming so things which

468
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:12,780
in the processor forming so things which
 

469
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,390
in the processor forming so things which
have just formed the planets still got

470
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
have just formed the planets still got
 

471
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,670
have just formed the planets still got
all of its primordial heat embedded

472
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:16,680
all of its primordial heat embedded
 

473
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,890
all of its primordial heat embedded
within it and it's glowing we can see

474
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:18,900
within it and it's glowing we can see
 

475
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,749
within it and it's glowing we can see
those quite easily but for the planets

476
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:20,759
those quite easily but for the planets
 

477
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,770
those quite easily but for the planets
more like the Earth of course they've

478
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:21,780
more like the Earth of course they've
 

479
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,170
more like the Earth of course they've
cooled down and so we can't see that the

480
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,180
cooled down and so we can't see that the
 

481
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,029
cooled down and so we can't see that the
light is pitiful compared to a newly

482
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:26,039
light is pitiful compared to a newly
 

483
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,189
light is pitiful compared to a newly
formed planet we would like to get there

484
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:28,199
formed planet we would like to get there
 

485
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,050
formed planet we would like to get there
with direct Imaging that's the dream is

486
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,060
with direct Imaging that's the dream is
 

487
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,149
with direct Imaging that's the dream is
to have the Pale Blue Dart natural

488
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
to have the Pale Blue Dart natural
 

489
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,250
to have the Pale Blue Dart natural
photograph of it maybe even just a one

490
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,260
photograph of it maybe even just a one
 

491
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,469
photograph of it maybe even just a one
pixel photograph of it but for now the

492
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
pixel photograph of it but for now the
 

493
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,170
pixel photograph of it but for now the
entire solar system is one pixel with a

494
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:39,180
entire solar system is one pixel with a
 

495
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,490
entire solar system is one pixel with a
certainly the transit method most of the

496
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:40,500
certainly the transit method most of the
 

497
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,949
certainly the transit method most of the
telescopes and so all you can do is see

498
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
telescopes and so all you can do is see
 

499
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,350
telescopes and so all you can do is see
where that one pixel which contains

500
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
where that one pixel which contains
 

501
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,570
where that one pixel which contains
potentially dozens of planets and the

502
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:47,580
potentially dozens of planets and the
 

503
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,269
potentially dozens of planets and the
star maybe even multiple Stars dims for

504
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:50,279
star maybe even multiple Stars dims for
 

505
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,370
star maybe even multiple Stars dims for
a short amount of time it dims just a

506
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:52,380
a short amount of time it dims just a
 

507
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,690
a short amount of time it dims just a
little bit and from that you're gonna

508
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:53,700
little bit and from that you're gonna
 

509
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,850
little bit and from that you're gonna
throw something yeah I mean it's it's

510
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:55,860
throw something yeah I mean it's it's
 

511
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,889
throw something yeah I mean it's it's
like being a detective in the scene

512
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:57,899
like being a detective in the scene
 

513
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,530
like being a detective in the scene
right it's very it's indirect clues of

514
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:00,540
right it's very it's indirect clues of
 

515
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,329
right it's very it's indirect clues of
the existence of the planet it's amazing

516
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:02,339
the existence of the planet it's amazing
 

517
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:03,889
the existence of the planet it's amazing
that humans can do that we're just

518
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:03,899
that humans can do that we're just
 

519
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,070
that humans can do that we're just
looking out in these immense distances

520
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,080
looking out in these immense distances
 

521
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,410
looking out in these immense distances
and looking you know if there's alien

522
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:09,420
and looking you know if there's alien
 

523
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,389
and looking you know if there's alien
civilizations out there like let's say

524
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:11,399
civilizations out there like let's say
 

525
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,150
civilizations out there like let's say
one exactly like our own

526
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,160
one exactly like our own
 

527
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,650
one exactly like our own
or like

528
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:15,660
or like
 

529
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,630
or like
would we even be able to see an earth

530
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:17,640
would we even be able to see an earth
 

531
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,090
would we even be able to see an earth
that passes

532
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,100
that passes
 

533
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,949
that passes
in the way of its sun and slightly dims

534
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:21,959
in the way of its sun and slightly dims
 

535
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,650
in the way of its sun and slightly dims
and that's the only sign we have of that

536
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:24,660
and that's the only sign we have of that
 

537
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,230
and that's the only sign we have of that
of that alien human-like civilization

538
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,240
of that alien human-like civilization
 

539
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,090
of that alien human-like civilization
out there is it's a little bit of a

540
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,100
out there is it's a little bit of a
 

541
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,490
out there is it's a little bit of a
dimming yeah I mean it depends on the

542
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:31,500
dimming yeah I mean it depends on the
 

543
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,810
dimming yeah I mean it depends on the
type of style we're talking about if it

544
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:32,820
type of style we're talking about if it
 

545
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,389
type of style we're talking about if it
is a star truly like the sun the dip

546
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:35,399
is a star truly like the sun the dip
 

547
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,150
is a star truly like the sun the dip
that causes is 84 parts per million I

548
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
that causes is 84 parts per million I
 

549
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,790
that causes is 84 parts per million I
mean that's just it's like the same as a

550
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
mean that's just it's like the same as a
 

551
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,710
mean that's just it's like the same as a
um it's like a firefly flying in front

552
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
um it's like a firefly flying in front
 

553
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,750
um it's like a firefly flying in front
of like a giant floodlight at a stadium

554
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:44,760
of like a giant floodlight at a stadium
 

555
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,009
of like a giant floodlight at a stadium
or something that's the kind of the

556
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:46,019
or something that's the kind of the
 

557
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,509
or something that's the kind of the
brightness contrast that you're trying

558
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
brightness contrast that you're trying
 

559
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,269
brightness contrast that you're trying
to compare to so it's it's extremely

560
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:50,279
to compare to so it's it's extremely
 

561
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,710
to compare to so it's it's extremely
difficult detection

562
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:51,720
difficult detection
 

563
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,410
difficult detection
and in the very very best cases we can

564
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:54,420
and in the very very best cases we can
 

565
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,970
and in the very very best cases we can
get down to that but as I said we don't

566
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:55,980
get down to that but as I said we don't
 

567
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,190
get down to that but as I said we don't
really have any true Earth analogs that

568
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:58,200
really have any true Earth analogs that
 

569
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,310
really have any true Earth analogs that
have been in the exoplank Canada yet

570
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
have been in the exoplank Canada yet
 

571
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,470
have been in the exoplank Canada yet
unless you relax that definition you say

572
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:03,480
unless you relax that definition you say
 

573
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,970
unless you relax that definition you say
it's not just doesn't have to be a star

574
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:04,980
it's not just doesn't have to be a star
 

575
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,350
it's not just doesn't have to be a star
just like the sun it could be a star

576
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:06,360
just like the sun it could be a star
 

577
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,970
just like the sun it could be a star
that's smaller than the sun it could be

578
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:07,980
that's smaller than the sun it could be
 

579
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,190
that's smaller than the sun it could be
these orange dwarfs or even the red

580
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,200
these orange dwarfs or even the red
 

581
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,410
these orange dwarfs or even the red
dwarf stars and the fact those stars are

582
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:12,420
dwarf stars and the fact those stars are
 

583
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,269
dwarf stars and the fact those stars are
smaller means that for the same size

584
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:14,279
smaller means that for the same size
 

585
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,610
smaller means that for the same size
Planet passing in front of it more light

586
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:16,620
Planet passing in front of it more light
 

587
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,949
Planet passing in front of it more light
is blocked out and so a very exciting

588
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:18,959
is blocked out and so a very exciting
 

589
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,829
is blocked out and so a very exciting
system for example is trappist-1 which

590
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
system for example is trappist-1 which
 

591
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,410
system for example is trappist-1 which
has seven planets which are smaller than

592
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:24,420
has seven planets which are smaller than
 

593
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,470
has seven planets which are smaller than
the earth and those who are quite easily

594
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:27,480
the earth and those who are quite easily
 

595
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,090
the earth and those who are quite easily
detectable not with a space-based

596
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,100
detectable not with a space-based
 

597
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,290
detectable not with a space-based
telescope even from the ground and

598
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,300
telescope even from the ground and
 

599
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,730
telescope even from the ground and
that's just because the star is so much

600
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:31,740
that's just because the star is so much
 

601
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,670
that's just because the star is so much
smaller that the relative increase in or

602
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:34,680
smaller that the relative increase in or
 

603
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,110
smaller that the relative increase in or
decrease in brightness is enhanced

604
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,120
decrease in brightness is enhanced
 

605
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,910
decrease in brightness is enhanced
significantly because that's smaller

606
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:37,920
significantly because that's smaller
 

607
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,889
significantly because that's smaller
size so trap is one e it's a planet

608
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:39,899
size so trap is one e it's a planet
 

609
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,449
size so trap is one e it's a planet
which is in the right distance for

610
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:41,459
which is in the right distance for
 

611
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,590
which is in the right distance for
liquid water

612
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:42,600
liquid water
 

613
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,690
liquid water
and it has a slightly smaller size on

614
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:44,700
and it has a slightly smaller size on
 

615
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,650
and it has a slightly smaller size on
the earth

616
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:45,660
the earth
 

617
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,090
the earth
um it's about 90 the size of the Earth

618
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,100
um it's about 90 the size of the Earth
 

619
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,850
um it's about 90 the size of the Earth
about 80 the mass and it's one of the

620
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:49,860
about 80 the mass and it's one of the
 

621
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,009
about 80 the mass and it's one of the
top targets right now for potentially

622
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:52,019
top targets right now for potentially
 

623
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,509
top targets right now for potentially
having life

624
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
having life
 

625
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,569
having life
um and yet it raises many questions

626
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:56,579
um and yet it raises many questions
 

627
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,130
um and yet it raises many questions
about

628
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:58,140
about
 

629
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,389
about
um what would that environment be like

630
00:10:59,389 --> 00:10:59,399
um what would that environment be like
 

631
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,090
um what would that environment be like
this is a star which is 1 8 the mass of

632
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,100
this is a star which is 1 8 the mass of
 

633
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,069
this is a star which is 1 8 the mass of
the sun it's

634
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:04,079
the sun it's
 

635
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,829
the sun it's
um stars like that take a long time to

636
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:06,839
um stars like that take a long time to
 

637
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,650
um stars like that take a long time to
come off that adolescence when stars

638
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:09,660
come off that adolescence when stars
 

639
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,090
come off that adolescence when stars
first form like the sun it takes them

640
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:11,100
first form like the sun it takes them
 

641
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,889
first form like the sun it takes them
maybe 10 100 million years to sort of

642
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:12,899
maybe 10 100 million years to sort of
 

643
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,750
maybe 10 100 million years to sort of
settle into that main sequence lifetime

644
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:14,760
settle into that main sequence lifetime
 

645
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,930
settle into that main sequence lifetime
but for stars like these late M dwarfs

646
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:17,940
but for stars like these late M dwarfs
 

647
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,850
but for stars like these late M dwarfs
as we call them they can take up to a

648
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:19,860
as we call them they can take up to a
 

649
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,930
as we call them they can take up to a
billion years or more to calm down and

650
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:23,940
billion years or more to calm down and
 

651
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,490
billion years or more to calm down and
during that period they're producing

652
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:25,500
during that period they're producing
 

653
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,530
during that period they're producing
huge amounts of x-rays ultraviolet

654
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:27,540
huge amounts of x-rays ultraviolet
 

655
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,990
huge amounts of x-rays ultraviolet
radiation that could potentially rip off

656
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
radiation that could potentially rip off
 

657
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,690
radiation that could potentially rip off
the entire atmosphere it may desiccate

658
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:32,700
the entire atmosphere it may desiccate
 

659
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,030
the entire atmosphere it may desiccate
the plants in the system and so even if

660
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
the plants in the system and so even if
 

661
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,730
the plants in the system and so even if
water arrived by comets or something it

662
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:37,740
water arrived by comets or something it
 

663
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,590
water arrived by comets or something it
may have lost all that water due to this

664
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
may have lost all that water due to this
 

665
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,170
may have lost all that water due to this
prolonged period of high activity so we

666
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,180
prolonged period of high activity so we
 

667
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,329
prolonged period of high activity so we
have lots of of open-ended questions

668
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:44,339
have lots of of open-ended questions
 

669
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,329
have lots of of open-ended questions
about these M dwarf planets but they are

670
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:47,339
about these M dwarf planets but they are
 

671
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,090
about these M dwarf planets but they are
the most accessible and so in the near

672
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,100
the most accessible and so in the near
 

673
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,250
the most accessible and so in the near
term if we detect anything in terms of

674
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,260
term if we detect anything in terms of
 

675
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,069
term if we detect anything in terms of
buyer signatures it's going to be for

676
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:55,079
buyer signatures it's going to be for
 

677
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,170
buyer signatures it's going to be for
one of these red dwarf stars it's not

678
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:57,180
one of these red dwarf stars it's not
 

679
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,389
one of these red dwarf stars it's not
going to be a true Earth twin as we

680
00:11:59,389 --> 00:11:59,399
going to be a true Earth twin as we
 

681
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,650
going to be a true Earth twin as we
would recognize it as having a yellow

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:00,660
would recognize it as having a yellow
 

683
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,750
would recognize it as having a yellow
star well let me ask you I mean there's

684
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:02,760
star well let me ask you I mean there's
 

685
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,970
star well let me ask you I mean there's
a million ways to ask this question I'm

a million ways to ask this question I'm
 

687
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,750
a million ways to ask this question I'm
sure I'll ask it about habitable worlds

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:08,760
sure I'll ask it about habitable worlds
 

689
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,090
sure I'll ask it about habitable worlds
let's just go to our own solar system

00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,100
let's just go to our own solar system
 

691
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,370
let's just go to our own solar system
what can we learn about the planets and

692
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:13,380
what can we learn about the planets and
 

693
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,509
what can we learn about the planets and
moons

694
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:14,519
moons
 

695
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,690
moons
in our solar system that

696
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:17,700
in our solar system that
 

697
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,750
in our solar system that
might contain life whether it's Mars or

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:20,760
might contain life whether it's Mars or
 

699
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,110
might contain life whether it's Mars or

00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,509
some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn
what kind of characteristics because you

702
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:26,519
what kind of characteristics because you
 

703
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,009
what kind of characteristics because you
said it might not need to be Earth-like

704
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:28,019
said it might not need to be Earth-like
 

705
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,509
said it might not need to be Earth-like
what kind of characteristics might be

706
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
what kind of characteristics might be
 

707
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,670
what kind of characteristics might be
we'd be looking for

708
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
we'd be looking for
 

709
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,710
we'd be looking for
when we look for life it's hard to

710
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:33,720
when we look for life it's hard to
 

711
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,990
when we look for life it's hard to
Define even what life is

712
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
Define even what life is
 

713
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,730
Define even what life is
um but we can maybe do a better job in

714
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:37,740
um but we can maybe do a better job in
 

715
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,470
um but we can maybe do a better job in
defining the sorts of things that life

716
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:39,480
defining the sorts of things that life
 

717
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,550
defining the sorts of things that life
does and that provides some aspects to

718
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:43,560
does and that provides some aspects to
 

719
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,190
does and that provides some aspects to
some Avenue for looking for them

720
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:46,200
some Avenue for looking for them
 

721
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,829
some Avenue for looking for them
um any classically conventionally I

722
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:48,839
um any classically conventionally I
 

723
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,090
um any classically conventionally I
think we thought the way to look for

724
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,100
think we thought the way to look for
 

725
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,090
think we thought the way to look for
life was to look for oxygen oxygen is a

726
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,100
life was to look for oxygen oxygen is a
 

727
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,530
life was to look for oxygen oxygen is a
byproduct of photosynthesis on this

728
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:54,540
byproduct of photosynthesis on this
 

729
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,449
byproduct of photosynthesis on this
planet we didn't always have it

730
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:56,459
planet we didn't always have it
 

731
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:57,889
planet we didn't always have it
certainly if you go back to the Arcane

732
00:12:57,889 --> 00:12:57,899
certainly if you go back to the Arcane
 

733
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,210
certainly if you go back to the Arcane
period

734
00:12:59,210 --> 00:12:59,220
period
 

735
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,889
period
um there was you know you have this

736
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:00,899
um there was you know you have this
 

737
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,569
um there was you know you have this
period called the Great oxidation event

738
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:02,579
period called the Great oxidation event
 

739
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,310
period called the Great oxidation event
where the Earth floods with oxygen for

740
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
where the Earth floods with oxygen for
 

741
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,810
where the Earth floods with oxygen for
the first time and starts to saturate

742
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:05,820
the first time and starts to saturate
 

743
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,449
the first time and starts to saturate
the oceans and then the atmosphere and

744
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:08,459
the oceans and then the atmosphere and
 

745
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,670
the oceans and then the atmosphere and
so that oxygen if we detect it on

746
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:10,680
so that oxygen if we detect it on
 

747
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,710
so that oxygen if we detect it on
another planet whether it be Mars Venus

748
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
another planet whether it be Mars Venus
 

749
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,930
another planet whether it be Mars Venus
or an exoplank whatever it is

750
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:14,940
or an exoplank whatever it is
 

751
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,030
or an exoplank whatever it is
um that was long thought to be evidence

752
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
um that was long thought to be evidence
 

753
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,829
um that was long thought to be evidence
for something doing photosynthesis

754
00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:18,839
for something doing photosynthesis
 

755
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,990
for something doing photosynthesis
because if you took away all the plant

756
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,000
because if you took away all the plant
 

757
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,269
because if you took away all the plant
life on the earth the oxygen wouldn't

758
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
life on the earth the oxygen wouldn't
 

759
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,769
life on the earth the oxygen wouldn't
just hang around here it's a highly

760
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:24,779
just hang around here it's a highly
 

761
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,470
just hang around here it's a highly
reactive molecule it would oxidize

762
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:27,480
reactive molecule it would oxidize
 

763
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,449
reactive molecule it would oxidize
things and So within about a million

764
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:29,459
things and So within about a million
 

765
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:30,710
things and So within about a million
years you would probably lose all the

766
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:30,720
years you would probably lose all the
 

767
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,509
years you would probably lose all the
oxygen on planet Earth

768
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:32,519
oxygen on planet Earth
 

769
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,550
oxygen on planet Earth
so that was a conventionally how we

770
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
so that was a conventionally how we
 

771
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,230
so that was a conventionally how we
thought we could look for life and then

772
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,240
thought we could look for life and then
 

773
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,490
thought we could look for life and then
we started to realize that it's not so

774
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:37,500
we started to realize that it's not so
 

775
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,350
we started to realize that it's not so
simple because either might be other

776
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
simple because either might be other
 

777
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,790
simple because either might be other
things that life does apart from

778
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
things that life does apart from
 

779
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,530
things that life does apart from
photosynthesis

780
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:42,540
photosynthesis
 

781
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,790
photosynthesis
um certainly the vast majority of the

782
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:43,800
um certainly the vast majority of the
 

783
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,410
um certainly the vast majority of the
Earth's history had no oxygen and yet

784
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:45,420
Earth's history had no oxygen and yet
 

785
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,030
Earth's history had no oxygen and yet
there was living things on it so that

786
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
there was living things on it so that
 

787
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,970
there was living things on it so that
doesn't seem like a complete test

788
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:49,980
doesn't seem like a complete test
 

789
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,590
doesn't seem like a complete test
um and secondly could there be other

790
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
um and secondly could there be other
 

791
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,449
um and secondly could there be other
things that produce oxygen besides from

792
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:53,459
things that produce oxygen besides from
 

793
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,769
things that produce oxygen besides from
Life

794
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:54,779
Life
 

795
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,650
Life
um a growing concern has been these

796
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:57,660
um a growing concern has been these
 

797
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,110
um a growing concern has been these
false positives in biosignature work and

798
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,120
false positives in biosignature work and
 

799
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,310
false positives in biosignature work and
so one example of that would be

800
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:01,320
so one example of that would be
 

801
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,990
so one example of that would be
photolysis that happens in the

802
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,000
photolysis that happens in the
 

803
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,690
photolysis that happens in the
atmosphere when ultraviolet right hits

804
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:05,700
atmosphere when ultraviolet right hits
 

805
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,310
atmosphere when ultraviolet right hits
the upper atmosphere can break up water

806
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:07,320
the upper atmosphere can break up water
 

807
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,430
the upper atmosphere can break up water
vapor the hydrogen spits off to the

808
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:10,440
vapor the hydrogen spits off to the
 

809
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,410
vapor the hydrogen spits off to the
oxygen the hydrogen is much lighter

810
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:12,420
oxygen the hydrogen is much lighter
 

811
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,210
oxygen the hydrogen is much lighter
Atomic species and so it can actually

812
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,220
Atomic species and so it can actually
 

813
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,069
Atomic species and so it can actually
Escape certainly plants like the Earth's

814
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
Escape certainly plants like the Earth's
 

815
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,690
Escape certainly plants like the Earth's
gravity that's why we don't have any

816
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:17,700
gravity that's why we don't have any
 

817
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,509
gravity that's why we don't have any
hydrogen or very little helium and so

818
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:20,519
hydrogen or very little helium and so
 

819
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,310
hydrogen or very little helium and so
that leaves you with the oxygen which

820
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
that leaves you with the oxygen which
 

821
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,009
that leaves you with the oxygen which
then oxidizes the surface and so there

822
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:25,019
then oxidizes the surface and so there
 

823
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,990
then oxidizes the surface and so there
could be a residual oxygen signature

824
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,000
could be a residual oxygen signature
 

825
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,449
could be a residual oxygen signature
just due to this photolysis process so

826
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:29,459
just due to this photolysis process so
 

827
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,269
just due to this photolysis process so
we've been trying to generalize and

828
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:32,279
we've been trying to generalize and
 

829
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,009
we've been trying to generalize and
um recently in recent years there's been

830
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:34,019
um recently in recent years there's been
 

831
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,210
um recently in recent years there's been
other suggestions things we could look

832
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:35,220
other suggestions things we could look
 

833
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,250
other suggestions things we could look
for in the solar system Beyond uh

834
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,260
for in the solar system Beyond uh
 

835
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,009
for in the solar system Beyond uh
nitrous oxide basically laughing gas is

836
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:40,019
nitrous oxide basically laughing gas is
 

837
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,050
nitrous oxide basically laughing gas is
a product of microbes

838
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:42,060
a product of microbes
 

839
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,730
a product of microbes
um that's something that we're starting

840
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:43,740
um that's something that we're starting
 

841
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,930
um that's something that we're starting
to get more interested in looking for

842
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:44,940
to get more interested in looking for
 

843
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,629
to get more interested in looking for
methane gas in combination with other

844
00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:47,639
methane gas in combination with other
 

845
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,030
methane gas in combination with other
gases can be an important biosignature

846
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,040
gases can be an important biosignature
 

847
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,150
gases can be an important biosignature
uh phosphine as well and phosphine is

848
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,160
uh phosphine as well and phosphine is
 

849
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,230
uh phosphine as well and phosphine is
particularly relevant to the solar

850
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
particularly relevant to the solar
 

851
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,610
particularly relevant to the solar
system because there was a lot of

852
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:55,620
system because there was a lot of
 

853
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,670
system because there was a lot of
interest for Venus recently

854
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:58,680
interest for Venus recently
 

855
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,290
interest for Venus recently
um you may have heard that there was a

856
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:00,300
um you may have heard that there was a
 

857
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,110
um you may have heard that there was a
claim of a biosignature in Venus's

858
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
claim of a biosignature in Venus's
 

859
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,970
claim of a biosignature in Venus's
atmosphere I think it was like two years

860
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:04,980
atmosphere I think it was like two years
 

861
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,350
atmosphere I think it was like two years
ago now

862
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:06,360
ago now
 

863
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,389
ago now
and the the judge and jury is still out

864
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:08,399
and the the judge and jury is still out
 

865
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,470
and the the judge and jury is still out
on that

866
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:09,480
on that
 

867
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,650
on that
um there was a very provocative claim

868
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:12,660
um there was a very provocative claim
 

869
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,750
um there was a very provocative claim
and signature of a phosphine-like

870
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:14,760
and signature of a phosphine-like
 

871
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,269
and signature of a phosphine-like
spectral absorption

872
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:17,279
spectral absorption
 

873
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,850
spectral absorption
um but it could have also have been some

874
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:19,860
um but it could have also have been some
 

875
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,290
um but it could have also have been some
of the molecule in particular sulfur

876
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:21,300
of the molecule in particular sulfur
 

877
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,310
of the molecule in particular sulfur
dioxide

878
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
dioxide
 

879
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,650
dioxide
which is not a buyer signature so this

880
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:24,660
which is not a buyer signature so this
 

881
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,329
which is not a buyer signature so this
is a detection of a gas in the

882
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:26,339
is a detection of a gas in the
 

883
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,930
is a detection of a gas in the
atmosphere yeah Venus and and uh it

884
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:29,940
atmosphere yeah Venus and and uh it
 

885
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,930
atmosphere yeah Venus and and uh it
might be controversial on several

886
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:31,940
might be controversial on several
 

887
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,569
might be controversial on several
Dimensions so one had to interpret that

888
00:15:35,569 --> 00:15:35,579
Dimensions so one had to interpret that
 

889
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,030
Dimensions so one had to interpret that
two is a thread gas and three is this

890
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,040
two is a thread gas and three is this
 

891
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,650
two is a thread gas and three is this
even the right detection is this is

892
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:39,660
even the right detection is this is
 

893
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,110
even the right detection is this is
there an error in the detection yeah I

894
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,120
there an error in the detection yeah I
 

895
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,250
there an error in the detection yeah I
mean how much do we believe that's

896
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:43,260
mean how much do we believe that's
 

897
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,170
mean how much do we believe that's
actually in the first place if you do

898
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,180
actually in the first place if you do
 

899
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,030
actually in the first place if you do
believe it does that necessarily mean

900
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
believe it does that necessarily mean
 

901
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,269
believe it does that necessarily mean
there's life there and um what gives how

902
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:50,279
there's life there and um what gives how
 

903
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,829
there's life there and um what gives how
can you have life in the Venus's

904
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
can you have life in the Venus's
 

905
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,910
can you have life in the Venus's
atmosphere in the first place because

906
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:52,920
atmosphere in the first place because
 

907
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,129
atmosphere in the first place because
that's you know been seen as like a hell

908
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:55,139
that's you know been seen as like a hell
 

909
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,590
that's you know been seen as like a hell
hole place for imagining life but I

910
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
hole place for imagining life but I
 

911
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,449
hole place for imagining life but I
guess the the counter that has been that

912
00:15:59,449 --> 00:15:59,459
guess the the counter that has been that
 

913
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,790
guess the the counter that has been that
okay yes the surface is a horrendous

914
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:01,800
okay yes the surface is a horrendous
 

915
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,550
okay yes the surface is a horrendous
place to imagine life thriving

916
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
place to imagine life thriving
 

917
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,129
place to imagine life thriving
um but as you go up in altitude the very

918
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:07,139
um but as you go up in altitude the very
 

919
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,629
um but as you go up in altitude the very
dense atmosphere means that there is a

920
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
dense atmosphere means that there is a
 

921
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,069
dense atmosphere means that there is a
cloud layer

922
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
cloud layer
 

923
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,050
cloud layer
um where the temperature and the

924
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,060
um where the temperature and the
 

925
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,550
um where the temperature and the
pressure become actually fairly similar

926
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:13,560
pressure become actually fairly similar
 

927
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,470
pressure become actually fairly similar
to the surface of the Earth and so maybe

928
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:15,480
to the surface of the Earth and so maybe
 

929
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,629
to the surface of the Earth and so maybe
there are microbes stirring around in

930
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:17,639
there are microbes stirring around in
 

931
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,509
there are microbes stirring around in
the clouds which are producing phosphine

932
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:20,519
the clouds which are producing phosphine
 

933
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,910
the clouds which are producing phosphine
um at the moment this is fascinating

934
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:22,920
um at the moment this is fascinating
 

935
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,670
um at the moment this is fascinating
it's got a lot of us

936
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:24,680
it's got a lot of us
 

937
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,050
it's got a lot of us
reinvigorated about the prospects of

938
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,060
reinvigorated about the prospects of
 

939
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,910
reinvigorated about the prospects of
going back to Venus and doing another

940
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:28,920
going back to Venus and doing another
 

941
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,590
going back to Venus and doing another
mission there in fact there's now two

942
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:30,600
mission there in fact there's now two
 

943
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,410
mission there in fact there's now two
NASA missions Veritas and DaVinci which

944
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:33,420
NASA missions Veritas and DaVinci which
 

945
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,850
NASA missions Veritas and DaVinci which
are going to be going back and before

946
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:34,860
are going to be going back and before
 

947
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,490
are going to be going back and before
23rd to the 2030s

948
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:37,500
23rd to the 2030s
 

949
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,290
23rd to the 2030s
um and then we have a European Mission I

950
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:39,300
um and then we have a European Mission I
 

951
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,670
um and then we have a European Mission I
think that's slated now and even a

952
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:40,680
think that's slated now and even a
 

953
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,470
think that's slated now and even a
Chinese Mission might be coming along

954
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
Chinese Mission might be coming along
 

955
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,610
Chinese Mission might be coming along
the way as well so we might have

956
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:43,620
the way as well so we might have
 

957
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,170
the way as well so we might have
multiple missions going to Venus which

958
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,180
multiple missions going to Venus which
 

959
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,870
multiple missions going to Venus which
has long been overlooked I mean apart

960
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:47,880
has long been overlooked I mean apart
 

961
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,090
has long been overlooked I mean apart
from the Soviets there really has been

962
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,100
from the Soviets there really has been
 

963
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,769
from the Soviets there really has been
very little in the way of exploration of

964
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:51,779
very little in the way of exploration of
 

965
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,530
very little in the way of exploration of
Venus certainly as compared to Mars Mars

966
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:54,540
Venus certainly as compared to Mars Mars
 

967
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,629
Venus certainly as compared to Mars Mars
has enjoyed most of the activity from

968
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
has enjoyed most of the activity from
 

969
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,530
has enjoyed most of the activity from
NASA's Rovers and surveys and Mars is

970
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:00,540
NASA's Rovers and surveys and Mars is
 

971
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,269
NASA's Rovers and surveys and Mars is
certainly fascinating there's you know

972
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:02,279
certainly fascinating there's you know
 

973
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,889
certainly fascinating there's you know
this signature of methane that has been

974
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:03,899
this signature of methane that has been
 

975
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,689
this signature of methane that has been
seen there before

976
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:05,699
seen there before
 

977
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,150
seen there before
um again there the discussion is whether

978
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,160
um again there the discussion is whether
 

979
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,130
um again there the discussion is whether
that methane is a product of biology

980
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,140
that methane is a product of biology
 

981
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,710
that methane is a product of biology
which is possible something that happens

982
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
which is possible something that happens
 

983
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,870
which is possible something that happens
on the earth or whether it's some

984
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
on the earth or whether it's some
 

985
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,289
on the earth or whether it's some
geological process that we are yet to

986
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:18,299
geological process that we are yet to
 

987
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,870
geological process that we are yet to
fully understand could be a for example

988
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
fully understand could be a for example
 

989
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,549
fully understand could be a for example
a reservoir of methane that's trapped

990
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:22,559
a reservoir of methane that's trapped
 

991
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,929
a reservoir of methane that's trapped
under the surface and it's leaking out

992
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:23,939
under the surface and it's leaking out
 

993
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:26,150
under the surface and it's leaking out
seasonally so the nice thing about Venus

994
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,160
seasonally so the nice thing about Venus
 

995
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,490
seasonally so the nice thing about Venus
is if there's a giant living

996
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:28,500
is if there's a giant living
 

997
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,610
is if there's a giant living
civilization there it'll be airborne so

998
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:31,620
civilization there it'll be airborne so
 

999
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,409
civilization there it'll be airborne so
you can just fly through and collect

1000
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:33,419
you can just fly through and collect
 

1001
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,250
you can just fly through and collect
samples yeah with Mars and uh moons of

1002
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:37,260
samples yeah with Mars and uh moons of
 

1003
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,169
samples yeah with Mars and uh moons of
uh Saturn Jupiter you're gonna have to

1004
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:39,179
uh Saturn Jupiter you're gonna have to
 

1005
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,250
uh Saturn Jupiter you're gonna have to
dig

1006
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:40,260
dig
 

1007
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,770
dig
under to find the civilizations right

1008
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:42,780
under to find the civilizations right
 

1009
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,630
under to find the civilizations right
dead or living right and so yeah maybe

1010
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
dead or living right and so yeah maybe
 

1011
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,130
dead or living right and so yeah maybe
it's easier than for Venus because

1012
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,140
it's easier than for Venus because
 

1013
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,870
it's easier than for Venus because
suddenly you can imagine just a balloon

1014
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:47,880
suddenly you can imagine just a balloon
 

1015
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,090
suddenly you can imagine just a balloon
floating through the atmosphere

1016
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,100
floating through the atmosphere
 

1017
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,310
floating through the atmosphere
um the or a drone or something that

1018
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
um the or a drone or something that
 

1019
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,870
um the or a drone or something that
would have the capability of just

1020
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:53,880
would have the capability of just
 

1021
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,150
would have the capability of just
scooping up and sampling

1022
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
scooping up and sampling
 

1023
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,789
scooping up and sampling
um to dig under the surface of Mars is

1024
00:17:58,789 --> 00:17:58,799
um to dig under the surface of Mars is
 

1025
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,370
um to dig under the surface of Mars is
maybe

1026
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:00,380
maybe
 

1027
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,630
maybe
feasible-ish with you know especially

1028
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
feasible-ish with you know especially
 

1029
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,130
feasible-ish with you know especially
with something like Starship that could

1030
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:04,140
with something like Starship that could
 

1031
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,950
with something like Starship that could
launch you know a huge Digger basically

1032
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
launch you know a huge Digger basically
 

1033
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,390
launch you know a huge Digger basically
to the surface and you could just

1034
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
to the surface and you could just
 

1035
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,669
to the surface and you could just
excavate away at the surface but for

1036
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:10,679
excavate away at the surface but for
 

1037
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,710
excavate away at the surface but for
something like Europa

1038
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
something like Europa
 

1039
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,409
something like Europa
um we really are still unclear about how

1040
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:15,419
um we really are still unclear about how
 

1041
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:17,990
um we really are still unclear about how
thick the ice layer is how you would

1042
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:18,000
thick the ice layer is how you would
 

1043
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,049
thick the ice layer is how you would
melt through that huge thick layer to

1044
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:21,059
melt through that huge thick layer to
 

1045
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,029
melt through that huge thick layer to
get to the ocean and then potentially

1046
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
get to the ocean and then potentially
 

1047
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,730
get to the ocean and then potentially
also discussions about contamination the

1048
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:25,740
also discussions about contamination the
 

1049
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,049
also discussions about contamination the
problem with looking for life in the

1050
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:27,059
problem with looking for life in the
 

1051
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,789
problem with looking for life in the
solar system which is different from

1052
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
solar system which is different from
 

1053
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,130
solar system which is different from
looking for life with exoplasts is that

1054
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,140
looking for life with exoplasts is that
 

1055
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,470
looking for life with exoplasts is that
you always run the risk of especially if

1056
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:33,480
you always run the risk of especially if
 

1057
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,970
you always run the risk of especially if
you visit there of introduced in the

1058
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:34,980
you visit there of introduced in the
 

1059
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,990
you visit there of introduced in the
Life yourself

1060
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
Life yourself
 

1061
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,390
Life yourself
right it's very difficult to completely

1062
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
right it's very difficult to completely
 

1063
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,270
right it's very difficult to completely
exterminate every single microbe and

1064
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
exterminate every single microbe and
 

1065
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,210
exterminate every single microbe and
Spore on the surface of your of your

1066
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,220
Spore on the surface of your of your
 

1067
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,490
Spore on the surface of your of your
Rover or the surface of your Lander and

1068
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:46,500
Rover or the surface of your Lander and
 

1069
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,470
Rover or the surface of your Lander and
so there's always a risk of introducing

1070
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
so there's always a risk of introducing
 

1071
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,730
so there's always a risk of introducing
something I mean

1072
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:49,740
something I mean
 

1073
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,010
something I mean
to some extent there is continuous

1074
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:52,020
to some extent there is continuous
 

1075
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,110
to some extent there is continuous
exchange of material between these

1076
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:54,120
exchange of material between these
 

1077
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,909
exchange of material between these
planets naturally on top of that as well

1078
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
planets naturally on top of that as well
 

1079
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,529
planets naturally on top of that as well
and now we're sort of accelerating that

1080
00:18:57,529 --> 00:18:57,539
and now we're sort of accelerating that
 

1081
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:58,970
and now we're sort of accelerating that
process to some degree

1082
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:58,980
process to some degree
 

1083
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,390
process to some degree
and so if you dig into europa's surface

1084
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
and so if you dig into europa's surface
 

1085
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,070
and so if you dig into europa's surface
which probably is completely pristine

1086
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
which probably is completely pristine
 

1087
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,990
which probably is completely pristine
it's very unlikely there has been much

1088
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,000
it's very unlikely there has been much
 

1089
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,630
it's very unlikely there has been much
exchange with the outside world for its

1092
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:09,900

You Are For the First Time potentially
introducing bacterial spores into that

1096
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:14,700
introducing bacterial spores into that
 

1097
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,909
introducing bacterial spores into that
environment that may compete or may

introduce spurious signatures for the

1100
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:18,600
introduce spurious signatures for the
 

1101
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,950
introduce spurious signatures for the
life you're looking for and so it's it's

1102
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:21,960
life you're looking for and so it's it's
 

1103
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,750
life you're looking for and so it's it's
almost an ethical question as to how to

1104
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,760
almost an ethical question as to how to
 

1105
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,049
almost an ethical question as to how to
proceed with looking for life on those

1106
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:27,059
proceed with looking for life on those
 

1107
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,150
proceed with looking for life on those
subsurface oceans and I don't think

1108
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,160
subsurface oceans and I don't think
 

1109
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,830
subsurface oceans and I don't think
we've really

1110
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:30,840
we've really
 

1111
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,630
we've really
have a good resolution for at this point

1112
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
have a good resolution for at this point
 

1113
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,490
have a good resolution for at this point
that's cool I'll see me as a God in

that's cool I'll see me as a God in

that's cool I'll see me as a God in

00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,970
not like not to murder it as opposed to
Scientific one I mean we always worry

1124
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:43,980
Scientific one I mean we always worry
 

1125
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,770
Scientific one I mean we always worry
about a space virus right coming coming

1126
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:45,780
about a space virus right coming coming
 

1127
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,870
about a space virus right coming coming
here or you know some kind of external

1128
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:47,880
here or you know some kind of external
 

1129
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,430
here or you know some kind of external
source and we would be the source of

1130
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
source and we would be the source of
 

1131
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,350
source and we would be the source of
that potential contamination or the

1132
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
that potential contamination or the
 

1133
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,630
that potential contamination or the
other direction yeah I mean

1134
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:53,640
other direction yeah I mean
 

1135
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,690
other direction yeah I mean
they that you know the whatever whatever

1136
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:56,700
they that you know the whatever whatever
 

1137
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,970
they that you know the whatever whatever
survives in such harsh conditions might

1138
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:58,980
survives in such harsh conditions might
 

1139
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,770
survives in such harsh conditions might
be pretty good at uh

1140
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:00,780
be pretty good at uh
 

1141
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,690
be pretty good at uh
surviving in all conditions it might be

1142
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:02,700
surviving in all conditions it might be
 

1143
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,190
surviving in all conditions it might be
a little bit more resilient and robust

1144
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:04,200
a little bit more resilient and robust
 

1145
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,770
a little bit more resilient and robust
so I might actually take a ride on us

1146
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:06,780
so I might actually take a ride on us
 

1147
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,130
so I might actually take a ride on us
back home possibly I mean I'm sure I'm

1148
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,140
back home possibly I mean I'm sure I'm
 

1149
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,450
back home possibly I mean I'm sure I'm
sure that some people will be concerned

1150
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:11,460
sure that some people will be concerned
 

1151
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,669
sure that some people will be concerned
about that I think we would we would

1152
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
about that I think we would we would
 

1153
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,710
about that I think we would we would
hopefully have some containment uh

1154
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:15,720
hopefully have some containment uh
 

1155
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,930
hopefully have some containment uh
procedures as if we did sample return or

1156
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:17,940
procedures as if we did sample return or
 

1157
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,010
procedures as if we did sample return or
you mean you don't even really need a

1158
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,020
you mean you don't even really need a
 

1159
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,870
you mean you don't even really need a
sample return these days you can pretty

1160
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:20,880
sample return these days you can pretty
 

1161
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,770
sample return these days you can pretty
much sound like a little micro

1162
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:21,780
much sound like a little micro
 

1163
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,810
much sound like a little micro
laboratory to the other planet to deal

1164
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:23,820
laboratory to the other planet to deal
 

1165
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,850
laboratory to the other planet to deal
with experiments you know in situ and

1166
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:25,860
with experiments you know in situ and
 

1167
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,169
with experiments you know in situ and
then just send them back to your planet

1168
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:27,179
then just send them back to your planet
 

1169
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,650
then just send them back to your planet
the data and so I don't think this is

1170
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:29,660
the data and so I don't think this is
 

1171
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,210
the data and so I don't think this is
necessary that especially for a case

1172
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,220
necessary that especially for a case
 

1173
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,230
necessary that especially for a case
like that where you might have

1174
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,240
like that where you might have
 

1175
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,789
like that where you might have
contamination concerns that you have to

1176
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
contamination concerns that you have to
 

1177
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,770
contamination concerns that you have to
bring samples back

1178
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:36,780
bring samples back
 

1179
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,390
bring samples back
um although probably if you brought back

1180
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
um although probably if you brought back
 

1181
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,669
um although probably if you brought back
European Sushi it would probably sell

1182
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:40,679
European Sushi it would probably sell
 

1183
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,710
European Sushi it would probably sell
for quite a bit with the billionaires in

1184
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
for quite a bit with the billionaires in
 

1185
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,289
for quite a bit with the billionaires in
New York City

1186
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:44,299
New York City
 

1187
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:46,250
New York City
Sushi yeah

1188
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:46,260
Sushi yeah
 

1189
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,690
Sushi yeah
um I would love from an engineering

1190
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:47,700
um I would love from an engineering
 

1191
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,330
um I would love from an engineering
perspective just to see all the

1192
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:50,340
perspective just to see all the
 

1193
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,549
perspective just to see all the
different candidates and designs for

1194
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:52,559
different candidates and designs for
 

1195
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,409
different candidates and designs for
like the scooper for Venus and the

1196
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:54,419
like the scooper for Venus and the
 

1197
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,250
like the scooper for Venus and the
scooper for Europa and and Mars I

1198
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:58,260
scooper for Europa and and Mars I
 

1199
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,470
scooper for Europa and and Mars I
haven't really look deeply into how they

1200
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
haven't really look deeply into how they
 

1201
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,210
haven't really look deeply into how they
actually like the actual engineering of

1202
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,220
actually like the actual engineering of
 

1203
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,549
actually like the actual engineering of
collecting samples because that's the

1204
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
collecting samples because that's the
 

1205
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,169
collecting samples because that's the
engineering of that

1206
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:06,179
engineering of that
 

1207
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,630
engineering of that
is probably essential for not either

1208
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
is probably essential for not either
 

1209
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,990
is probably essential for not either
destroying life or or polluting it with

1210
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
destroying life or or polluting it with
 

1211
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,390
destroying life or or polluting it with
our own microbes and so on so that's an

1212
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
our own microbes and so on so that's an
 

1213
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,250
our own microbes and so on so that's an
interesting engineering challenge I

1214
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:16,260
interesting engineering challenge I
 

1215
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,810
interesting engineering challenge I
usually for Rovers and stuff focus on

1216
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:17,820
usually for Rovers and stuff focus on
 

1217
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,730
usually for Rovers and stuff focus on
the on the robot on the

1218
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:19,740
the on the robot on the
 

1219
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,190
the on the robot on the
sort of the mobility aspect of it on the

1220
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,200
sort of the mobility aspect of it on the
 

1221
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,529
sort of the mobility aspect of it on the
robotics the perception and the movement

1222
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:24,539
robotics the perception and the movement
 

1223
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,390
robotics the perception and the movement
and the planning and the control but

1224
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
and the planning and the control but
 

1225
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,710
and the planning and the control but
there's probably the scooper is probably

1226
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:27,720
there's probably the scooper is probably
 

1227
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,190
there's probably the scooper is probably
where the action is the microscopic

1228
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,200
where the action is the microscopic
 

1229
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,990
where the action is the microscopic
sample collection so basically you have

1230
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,000
sample collection so basically you have
 

1231
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,610
sample collection so basically you have
to first clean

1232
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:34,620
to first clean
 

1233
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,770
to first clean
your vehicle make sure it doesn't have

1234
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:36,780
your vehicle make sure it doesn't have
 

1235
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,070
your vehicle make sure it doesn't have
any Earth-like things on it and then you

1236
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
any Earth-like things on it and then you
 

1237
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,049
any Earth-like things on it and then you
have to put it into some kind of thing

1238
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:42,059
have to put it into some kind of thing
 

1239
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,490
have to put it into some kind of thing
that's perfectly sealed from the

1240
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:43,500
that's perfectly sealed from the
 

1241
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,169
that's perfectly sealed from the
environment so if we bring it back or we

1242
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:45,179
environment so if we bring it back or we
 

1243
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,450
environment so if we bring it back or we
analyze it it's not

1244
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:47,460
analyze it it's not
 

1245
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,250
analyze it it's not
um it's not going to bring anything else

1246
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:49,260
um it's not going to bring anything else
 

1247
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,529
um it's not going to bring anything else
uh external and yeah I don't know it

1248
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:51,539
uh external and yeah I don't know it
 

1249
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:52,730
uh external and yeah I don't know it
could be that would be an interesting

1250
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:52,740
could be that would be an interesting
 

1251
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,230
could be that would be an interesting
engineering design there yeah I mean

1252
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
engineering design there yeah I mean
 

1253
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,049
engineering design there yeah I mean
Curiosity has been uh leaving these

1254
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:57,059
Curiosity has been uh leaving these
 

1255
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,270
Curiosity has been uh leaving these
little pods on the surface quite

1256
00:21:59,270 --> 00:21:59,280
little pods on the surface quite
 

1257
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,250
little pods on the surface quite
recently there's some neat photos you

1258
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:01,260
recently there's some neat photos you
 

1259
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,350
recently there's some neat photos you
can find online and it's they kind of

1260
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:03,360
can find online and it's they kind of
 

1261
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,770
can find online and it's they kind of
look like a lightsaber hilts which so

1262
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:06,780
look like a lightsaber hilts which so
 

1263
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,930
look like a lightsaber hilts which so
um that yeah to me I think I tweeted

1264
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:08,940
um that yeah to me I think I tweeted
 

1265
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,490
um that yeah to me I think I tweeted
something like uh you know this weapon

1266
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:10,500
something like uh you know this weapon
 

1267
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,690
something like uh you know this weapon
is your life like don't lose it

1268
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:11,700
is your life like don't lose it
 

1269
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,669
is your life like don't lose it
curiosity because it's just dumping

1270
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679
curiosity because it's just dumping
 

1271
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,409
curiosity because it's just dumping
these little vials everywhere and it's

1272
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:15,419
these little vials everywhere and it's
 

1273
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,149
these little vials everywhere and it's
yeah it is scooping up these things and

1274
00:22:17,149 --> 00:22:17,159
yeah it is scooping up these things and
 

1275
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,430
yeah it is scooping up these things and
the intention is that in the future

1276
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:19,440
the intention is that in the future
 

1277
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,049
the intention is that in the future
um there will be a sample return mission

1278
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:21,059
um there will be a sample return mission
 

1279
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,090
um there will be a sample return mission
that will come and pick these up

1280
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,100
that will come and pick these up
 

1281
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,830
that will come and pick these up
um but it's I mean the engineering

1282
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:24,840
um but it's I mean the engineering
 

1283
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,210
um but it's I mean the engineering
behind those things is so impressive the

1284
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:26,220
behind those things is so impressive the
 

1285
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,250
behind those things is so impressive the
thing that blows me away the most has

1286
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,260
thing that blows me away the most has
 

1287
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,049
thing that blows me away the most has
been The Landings

1288
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:30,059
been The Landings
 

1289
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,789
been The Landings
um especially I'm training to be a pilot

1290
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:31,799
um especially I'm training to be a pilot
 

1291
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,230
um especially I'm training to be a pilot
at the moment so that's the sort of you

1292
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,240
at the moment so that's the sort of you
 

1293
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,430
at the moment so that's the sort of you
know watching Landings has become like

1294
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:34,440
know watching Landings has become like
 

1295
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,470
know watching Landings has become like
my I'll be on YouTube at the moment and

1296
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:36,480
my I'll be on YouTube at the moment and
 

1297
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,270
my I'll be on YouTube at the moment and
how not to do it how to do it with

1298
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:38,280
how not to do it how to do it with
 

1299
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,730
how not to do it how to do it with
different levels of conditions and

1300
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:40,740
different levels of conditions and
 

1301
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,190
different levels of conditions and
things but with the you know when we

1302
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
things but with the you know when we
 

1303
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,230
things but with the you know when we
think about landing on Mars Just the

1304
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:45,240
think about landing on Mars Just the
 

1305
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,970
think about landing on Mars Just the
light travel time effect means that

1306
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:46,980
light travel time effect means that
 

1307
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,070
light travel time effect means that
there's no possibility of a human

1308
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,080
there's no possibility of a human
 

1309
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,830
there's no possibility of a human
controlling that descent and so you have

1310
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
controlling that descent and so you have
 

1311
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,289
controlling that descent and so you have
to put all of your faith and your trust

1312
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:54,299
to put all of your faith and your trust
 

1313
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,289
to put all of your faith and your trust
in the computer code or the AI or

1314
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:57,299
in the computer code or the AI or
 

1315
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,430
in the computer code or the AI or
whatever it is that you've put on board

1316
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:58,440
whatever it is that you've put on board
 

1317
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,930
whatever it is that you've put on board
that thing to to make the correct

1318
00:22:59,930 --> 00:22:59,940
that thing to to make the correct
 

1319
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,430
that thing to to make the correct
descent

1320
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
descent
 

1321
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,430
descent
um and so there's this famous uh period

1322
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,440
um and so there's this famous uh period
 

1323
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,470
um and so there's this famous uh period
called seven minutes of hell where

1324
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:06,480
called seven minutes of hell where
 

1325
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,669
called seven minutes of hell where
you're basically waiting for that light

1326
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:07,679
you're basically waiting for that light
 

1327
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,350
you're basically waiting for that light
travel time to come back to know whether

1328
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
travel time to come back to know whether
 

1329
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,390
travel time to come back to know whether
you're vehicle successfully landed on

1330
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:11,400
you're vehicle successfully landed on
 

1331
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,190
you're vehicle successfully landed on
the surface or not and during that

1332
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,200
the surface or not and during that
 

1333
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,049
the surface or not and during that
period you know in your mind

1334
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:15,059
period you know in your mind
 

1335
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:17,029
period you know in your mind
simultaneously that it is doing these

1336
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,039
simultaneously that it is doing these
 

1337
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,830
simultaneously that it is doing these
multi-stages of

1338
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:18,840
multi-stages of
 

1339
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,690
multi-stages of
um deploying its parachute deploying the

1340
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:20,700
um deploying its parachute deploying the
 

1341
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,590
um deploying its parachute deploying the
crane

1342
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
crane
 

1343
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,230
crane
activating its Jets to come down and

1344
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
activating its Jets to come down and
 

1345
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,850
activating its Jets to come down and
controlling its descent to the surface

1346
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:25,860
controlling its descent to the surface
 

1347
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,250
controlling its descent to the surface
and then the crane has to fly away so it

1348
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:28,260
and then the crane has to fly away so it
 

1349
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,049
and then the crane has to fly away so it
doesn't accidentally hit the Rover and

1350
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:30,059
doesn't accidentally hit the Rover and
 

1351
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:32,930
doesn't accidentally hit the Rover and
so there's a series of multi-stage

1352
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:32,940
so there's a series of multi-stage
 

1353
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,789
so there's a series of multi-stage
points where any any of them go wrong

1354
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
points where any any of them go wrong
 

1355
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,830
points where any any of them go wrong
you know the whole mission could could

1356
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:36,840
you know the whole mission could could
 

1357
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,390
you know the whole mission could could
go awry

1358
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
go awry
 

1359
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,570
go awry
um and so the fact that we are fairly

1360
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:41,580
um and so the fact that we are fairly
 

1361
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,970
um and so the fact that we are fairly
consistently able to build these

1362
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:43,980
consistently able to build these
 

1363
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,789
consistently able to build these
machines that can do this autonomously

1364
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:45,799
machines that can do this autonomously
 

1365
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,250
machines that can do this autonomously
is to me one of the most impressive acts

1366
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:49,260
is to me one of the most impressive acts
 

1367
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,810
is to me one of the most impressive acts
of engineering that NASA have achieved

1368
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:50,820
of engineering that NASA have achieved
 

1369
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,330
of engineering that NASA have achieved
yes the unfortunate fact about physics

1370
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:53,340
yes the unfortunate fact about physics
 

1371
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,010
yes the unfortunate fact about physics
is the takeoff is easier than the

1372
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,020
is the takeoff is easier than the
 

1373
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,830
is the takeoff is easier than the
landing yes yes and you mentioned

1374
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
landing yes yes and you mentioned
 

1375
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,230
landing yes yes and you mentioned
Starship one of the incredible

1376
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,240
Starship one of the incredible
 

1377
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,690
Starship one of the incredible
engineering feeds that you get to see is

1378
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:02,700
engineering feeds that you get to see is
 

1379
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,090
engineering feeds that you get to see is
the reusable rockets that take off but

1380
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,100
the reusable rockets that take off but
 

1381
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,390
the reusable rockets that take off but
they land and they land uh using control

1382
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
they land and they land uh using control
 

1383
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,669
they land and they land uh using control
and they do so perfectly and sometimes

1384
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:10,679
and they do so perfectly and sometimes
 

1385
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,289
and they do so perfectly and sometimes
when it's synchronous it's just it's

1386
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:12,299
when it's synchronous it's just it's
 

1387
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:14,090
when it's synchronous it's just it's
beautiful to see and then with Starship

1388
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,100
beautiful to see and then with Starship
 

1389
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,250
beautiful to see and then with Starship
you see the the Chopsticks that catch

1390
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:16,260
you see the the Chopsticks that catch
 

1391
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,930
you see the the Chopsticks that catch
the ship I mean there's so much

1392
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:17,940
the ship I mean there's so much
 

1393
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,390
the ship I mean there's so much
incredible engineer but you mentioned uh

1394
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:20,400
incredible engineer but you mentioned uh
 

1395
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,330
incredible engineer but you mentioned uh
Starships somehow helpful here so what's

1396
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:23,340
Starships somehow helpful here so what's
 

1397
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,970
Starships somehow helpful here so what's
your hope with Starship what kind of

1398
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:25,980
your hope with Starship what kind of
 

1399
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,570
your hope with Starship what kind of
science might it enable possibly there's

1400
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:29,580
science might it enable possibly there's
 

1401
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,770
science might it enable possibly there's
two things I mean it's the launch cost

1402
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:30,780
two things I mean it's the launch cost
 

1403
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,330
two things I mean it's the launch cost
itself which is hopefully going to mean

1404
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:32,340
itself which is hopefully going to mean
 

1405
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,130
itself which is hopefully going to mean
per kilogram it's going to dramatically

1406
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,140
per kilogram it's going to dramatically
 

1407
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,870
per kilogram it's going to dramatically
reduce the cost of its the sort of the

1408
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:35,880
reduce the cost of its the sort of the
 

1409
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,730
reduce the cost of its the sort of the
level even if it's a factor of 10 higher

1410
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:37,740
level even if it's a factor of 10 higher
 

1411
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,710
level even if it's a factor of 10 higher
than what Elon originally promised this

1412
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,720
than what Elon originally promised this
 

1413
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,510
than what Elon originally promised this
is going to be a revolution for the cost

1414
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
is going to be a revolution for the cost
 

1415
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,549
is going to be a revolution for the cost
to Launch that means you could do all

1416
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:43,559
to Launch that means you could do all
 

1417
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,590
to Launch that means you could do all
sorts of things you could launch

1418
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
sorts of things you could launch
 

1419
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,049
sorts of things you could launch
um large telescopes which could be

1420
00:24:48,049 --> 00:24:48,059
um large telescopes which could be
 

1421
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,450
um large telescopes which could be
basically like jwst but you don't even

1422
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:50,460
basically like jwst but you don't even
 

1423
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,490
basically like jwst but you don't even
have to fold them up jwst had this whole

1424
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:52,500
have to fold them up jwst had this whole
 

1425
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,190
have to fold them up jwst had this whole
issue with a design that it's six and a

1426
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
issue with a design that it's six and a
 

1427
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,870
issue with a design that it's six and a
half meters across and so you have to

1428
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:56,880
half meters across and so you have to
 

1429
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,850
half meters across and so you have to
there's no fuselage which is that large

1430
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:58,860
there's no fuselage which is that large
 

1431
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,409
there's no fuselage which is that large
at the time there is four wasn't large

1432
00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:00,419
at the time there is four wasn't large
 

1433
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,149
at the time there is four wasn't large
enough for that and so they had to fold

1434
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
enough for that and so they had to fold
 

1435
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,470
enough for that and so they had to fold
it up into this kind of complicated

1436

repeated testing and you know there was
 

1445
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,710
repeated testing and you know there was
something like 130 fail points or

must be a fascinating it's process of

trying to collaborate and figure out
 

1609
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,890
trying to collaborate and figure out
what the most important problems are

1610
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:18,900
what the most important problems are
 

1611
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,549
what the most important problems are
and there's an interesting network of

00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:22,559
and there's an interesting network of
 

1613

probably have to somehow optimize over

1616
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:26,700
probably have to somehow optimize over
 

1617
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,149
probably have to somehow optimize over
it's it's a really difficult process I

1618
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:29,159
it's it's a really difficult process I
 

1619
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,710
it's it's a really difficult process I
don't envy the tech that are going to

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:30,720
don't envy the tech that are going to

don't envy the tech that are going to
have to make this decision we call it

00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:33,539
the attack the time allocation committee
 

1625
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,350
the attack the time allocation committee
that the make this decision

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,360
that the make this decision
 

1627
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,789
that the make this decision
um and I've served on these before and

1628
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:37,799
um and I've served on these before and
 

1629
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,470
um and I've served on these before and
it's very difficult I mean typically for

1630
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:39,480
it's very difficult I mean typically for
 

1631
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,810
it's very difficult I mean typically for
Hubble we we were seeing at least 10

1632
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:41,820
Hubble we we were seeing at least 10
 

1633
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,990
Hubble we we were seeing at least 10
sometimes 20 times the number of

1634
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:44,000
sometimes 20 times the number of
 

1635
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,190
sometimes 20 times the number of

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,909
proposals for telescope time versus
available telescope time for jdst there

1638
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:49,919
available telescope time for jdst there
 

1639
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,830
available telescope time for jdst there
has been one call already that has gone

1640
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
has been one call already that has gone
 

1641
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,049
has been one call already that has gone
out we call it cycle one and that was

1642
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:54,059
out we call it cycle one and that was
 

1643
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:56,090
out we call it cycle one and that was
oversubscribed by I think something like

1644
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:56,100
oversubscribed by I think something like
 

1645
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,210
oversubscribed by I think something like
six to one seven to one and uh the cycle

1646
00:28:59,210 --> 00:28:59,220
six to one seven to one and uh the cycle
 

1647
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,149
six to one seven to one and uh the cycle
two which is just been announced uh

1648
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:02,159
two which is just been announced uh
 

1649
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,529
two which is just been announced uh
fairly recently and the deadline is

1650
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:03,539
fairly recently and the deadline is
 

1651
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:04,850
fairly recently and the deadline is
actually the end of this month so my

1652
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:04,860
actually the end of this month so my
 

1653
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,710
actually the end of this month so my
team are totally laser focused on

1654
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
team are totally laser focused on
 

1655
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,350
team are totally laser focused on
running our proposals right now

1656
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,360
running our proposals right now
 

1657
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,450
running our proposals right now
um that is expected to be much more

1658
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:11,460
um that is expected to be much more
 

1659
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,130
um that is expected to be much more
competitive probably more comparable to

1660
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:13,140
competitive probably more comparable to
 

1661
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,490
competitive probably more comparable to
what Hubble saw and so it's hard more

1662
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:16,500
what Hubble saw and so it's hard more
 

1663
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,990
what Hubble saw and so it's hard more
competitive than the second one you said

1664
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
competitive than the second one you said
 

1665
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,269
competitive than the second one you said
already because that's already in the

1666
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:20,279
already because that's already in the
 

1667
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,889
already because that's already in the
first cycle so I said the first cycle of

1668
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:21,899
first cycle so I said the first cycle of
 

1669
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:24,049
first cycle so I said the first cycle of
James Webb was about six to one

1670
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:24,059
James Webb was about six to one
 

1671
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:25,370
James Webb was about six to one
um and this will probably be more like

1672
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:25,380
um and this will probably be more like
 

1673
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,590
um and this will probably be more like
20 to one I would so these are all

1674
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
20 to one I would so these are all
 

1675
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,570
20 to one I would so these are all
proposals by scientists and so on and

1676
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:29,580
proposals by scientists and so on and
 

1677
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,850
proposals by scientists and so on and
it's not like you can schedule at any

1678
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:31,860
it's not like you can schedule at any
 

1679
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,289
it's not like you can schedule at any
time because if you're looking for

1680
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:33,299
time because if you're looking for
 

1681
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:35,510
time because if you're looking for
transit times yeah you have you have a

1682
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,520
transit times yeah you have you have a
 

1683
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,610
transit times yeah you have you have a
time critical element yes time critical

1684
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:37,620
time critical element yes time critical
 

1685
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,590
time critical element yes time critical
development and they're conflicting in

1686
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
development and they're conflicting in
 

1687
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,210
development and they're conflicting in
non-like non-obvious ways because

1688
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:41,220
non-like non-obvious ways because
 

1689
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,529
non-like non-obvious ways because
they're the the frequency is different

1690
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:42,539
they're the the frequency is different
 

1691
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,570
they're the the frequency is different
uh the duration is different right and

1692
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:44,580
uh the duration is different right and
 

1693
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,830
uh the duration is different right and
it's because it's probably computational

1694
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:45,840
it's because it's probably computational
 

1695
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,350
it's because it's probably computational
needs yeah there are different uh that

1696
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,360
needs yeah there are different uh that
 

1697
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,029
needs yeah there are different uh that
there's the type of sensors the

1698
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:50,039
there's the type of sensors the
 

1699
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,250
there's the type of sensors the
direction pointing all that yeah it's

1700
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,260
direction pointing all that yeah it's
 

1701
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,649
direction pointing all that yeah it's
hard and there are certain programs like

1702
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:54,659
hard and there are certain programs like
 

1703
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,990
hard and there are certain programs like
doing a deep field study where you just

1704
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,000
doing a deep field study where you just
 

1705
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,730
doing a deep field study where you just
more or less point the telescope and

1706
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:58,740
more or less point the telescope and
 

1707
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,049
more or less point the telescope and
that's pretty open I mean you're just

1708
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:00,059
that's pretty open I mean you're just
 

1709
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,669
that's pretty open I mean you're just
accumulating photons you can just point

1710
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
accumulating photons you can just point
 

1711
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,950
accumulating photons you can just point
at that at that patch of the sky

1712
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:03,960
at that at that patch of the sky
 

1713
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,090
at that at that patch of the sky
um whenever the task is not doing

1714
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:05,100
um whenever the task is not doing
 

1715
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,830
um whenever the task is not doing
anything else and just get to your month

1716
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:06,840
anything else and just get to your month
 

1717
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,450
anything else and just get to your month
let's say a month of integration time is

1718
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:08,460
let's say a month of integration time is
 

1719
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,950
let's say a month of integration time is
your is your goal over the lifetime of

1720
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:09,960
your is your goal over the lifetime of
 

1721
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,230
your is your goal over the lifetime of
wst so that's maybe a little bit easier

1722
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
wst so that's maybe a little bit easier
 

1723
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,570
wst so that's maybe a little bit easier
to schedule it's harder especially for

1724
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:14,580
to schedule it's harder especially for
 

1725
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,549
to schedule it's harder especially for
us looking at cool worlds

1726
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:16,559
us looking at cool worlds
 

1727
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,529
us looking at cool worlds
um because as I said earlier these these

1728
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:18,539
um because as I said earlier these these
 

1729
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:21,409
um because as I said earlier these these
plants Transit very infrequently

1730
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:21,419
plants Transit very infrequently
 

1731
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,330
plants Transit very infrequently
so we have to wait if you're looking at

1732
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:23,340
so we have to wait if you're looking at
 

1733
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,950
so we have to wait if you're looking at
the Earth translating the Sun an alien

1734
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:24,960
the Earth translating the Sun an alien
 

1735
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,169
the Earth translating the Sun an alien
watching us they they would only get one

1736
00:30:27,169 --> 00:30:27,179
watching us they they would only get one
 

1737
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:28,549
watching us they they would only get one
opportunity per year to do that

1738
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
opportunity per year to do that
 

1739
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,950
opportunity per year to do that
observation the transit lasts for about

1740
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
observation the transit lasts for about
 

1741
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,750
observation the transit lasts for about
12 hours

1742
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:32,760
12 hours
 

1743
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,789
12 hours
um and so if they don't get that time

1744
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:34,799
um and so if they don't get that time
 

1745
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,510
um and so if they don't get that time
it's hard that's it if it conflicted

1746
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:38,520
it's hard that's it if it conflicted
 

1747
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,250
it's hard that's it if it conflicted
with another proposal that wants to do

1748
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:40,260
with another proposal that wants to do
 

1749
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,870
with another proposal that wants to do
use the another time critical element

1750
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:41,880
use the another time critical element
 

1751
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,510
use the another time critical element
it's much easier for plants like uh

1752
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:44,520
it's much easier for plants like uh
 

1753
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,130
it's much easier for plants like uh
these hot these hot plants or these

1754
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:46,140
these hot these hot plants or these
 

1755
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,769
these hot these hot plants or these
close implants because they Transit so

1756
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:48,779
close implants because they Transit so
 

1757
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,630
close implants because they Transit so
frequently there's maybe 100

1758
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
frequently there's maybe 100
 

1759
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,669
frequently there's maybe 100
opportunities and so then the attack can

1760
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:52,679
opportunities and so then the attack can
 

1761
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,830
opportunities and so then the attack can
say okay they want 10 transits there's a

1762
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:54,840
say okay they want 10 transits there's a
 

1763
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,870
say okay they want 10 transits there's a
hundred opportunities here it's easier

1764
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
hundred opportunities here it's easier
 

1765
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,870
hundred opportunities here it's easier
for us to give us time to give them time

1766
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
for us to give us time to give them time
 

1767
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,010
for us to give us time to give them time
we're almost in the worst case scenario

1768
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,020
we're almost in the worst case scenario
 

1769
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,510
we're almost in the worst case scenario
we're proposing until it Rex and means

1770
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:02,520
we're proposing until it Rex and means
 

1771
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,630
we're proposing until it Rex and means
around two cool planets and so we really

1772
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:05,640
around two cool planets and so we really
 

1773
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,510
around two cool planets and so we really
only have one bite of the Cherry for

1774
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:08,520
only have one bite of the Cherry for
 

1775
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,210
only have one bite of the Cherry for
each one and so our sales pitch has been

1776
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:11,220
each one and so our sales pitch has been
 

1777
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,730
each one and so our sales pitch has been
that these are extremely precious events

1778
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:13,740
that these are extremely precious events
 

1779
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:18,169
that these are extremely precious events
and more importantly gwst is the only

1780
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:18,179
and more importantly gwst is the only
 

1781
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,810
and more importantly gwst is the only
telescope the only machine Humanity has

1782
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:20,820
telescope the only machine Humanity has
 

1783
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,970
telescope the only machine Humanity has
ever constructed acid which is capable

1784
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:22,980
ever constructed acid which is capable
 

1785
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,190
ever constructed acid which is capable
of finding moons the kin to the moon's

1786
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,200
of finding moons the kin to the moon's
 

1787
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,110
of finding moons the kin to the moon's
in our solar system Kepler can't do it

1788
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,120
in our solar system Kepler can't do it
 

1789
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,269
in our solar system Kepler can't do it
even Hubble can't do it Judas is the

1790
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
even Hubble can't do it Judas is the
 

1791
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,850
even Hubble can't do it Judas is the
first one and so there is a new window

1792
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:31,860
first one and so there is a new window
 

1793
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,010
first one and so there is a new window
to the universe because we know these

1794
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,020
to the universe because we know these
 

1795
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,049
to the universe because we know these
moons exist they they're all over the

1796
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:36,059
moons exist they they're all over the
 

1797
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,669
moons exist they they're all over the
place in the solar system you have the

1798
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
place in the solar system you have the
 

1799
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,549
place in the solar system you have the
moon you have IO Callisto Europa

1800
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
moon you have IO Callisto Europa
 

1801
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,130
moon you have IO Callisto Europa
Ganymede Titan lots of moons are fairly

1802
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:43,140
Ganymede Titan lots of moons are fairly
 

1803
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,230
Ganymede Titan lots of moons are fairly
similar size sort of 30 the size of the

1804
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:45,240
similar size sort of 30 the size of the

Earth and this telescope is the first

1806
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:47,820
Earth and this telescope is the first
 

1807
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,750
Earth and this telescope is the first
one that can find them and so we're very

1808
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:50,760
one that can find them and so we're very
 

1809
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,310
one that can find them and so we're very
excited about the profound implications

1810
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
excited about the profound implications
 

1811

interesting like from a computational
 

1893
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,169
interesting like from a computational

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,389
um they will make their selections based
off human judgment and

off human judgment and
 

1911
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,190
off human judgment and
um a lot of the telescope is certainly

1912
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,200
um a lot of the telescope is certainly
 

1913
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,750
um a lot of the telescope is certainly
within the field of exoplanets because

1914
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:38,760
within the field of exoplanets because
 

1915
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,950
within the field of exoplanets because
there's different fields of astronomy

1916
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:39,960
there's different fields of astronomy
 

1917
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,930
there's different fields of astronomy
but within the field of exoplanets I

1918
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:41,940
but within the field of exoplanets I
 

1919
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,669
but within the field of exoplanets I
think a good expectation is that most of

1920
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:43,679
think a good expectation is that most of
 

1921
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,529
think a good expectation is that most of
the telescope time that James jersey

1922
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:45,539
the telescope time that James jersey
 

1923
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,350
the telescope time that James jersey
have will go towards atmospheric

1924
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:48,360
have will go towards atmospheric
 

1925
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,870
have will go towards atmospheric
retrieval which is uh sort of alluded to

1926
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
retrieval which is uh sort of alluded to
 

1927
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,070
retrieval which is uh sort of alluded to
earlier you know like detecting

1928
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:52,080
earlier you know like detecting
 

1929
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,830
earlier you know like detecting
molecules in the atmospheres not by

1930
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:54,840
molecules in the atmospheres not by
 

1931
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,330
molecules in the atmospheres not by
signatures because as I said it's really

1932
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:56,340
signatures because as I said it's really
 

1933
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,190
signatures because as I said it's really
not designed to do that it's pushing

1934
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,200
not designed to do that it's pushing
 

1935
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,870
not designed to do that it's pushing
generous T probably too far are to

1936
00:33:59,870 --> 00:33:59,880
generous T probably too far are to
 

1937
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,789
generous T probably too far are to
expect to do that but it could detect

1938
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:01,799
expect to do that but it could detect
 

1939
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,009
expect to do that but it could detect
for example a carbon dioxide Rich

1940
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:04,019
for example a carbon dioxide Rich
 

1941
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,350
for example a carbon dioxide Rich
atmosphere on trappist-1e that's not a

1942
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,360
atmosphere on trappist-1e that's not a
 

1943
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,089
atmosphere on trappist-1e that's not a
biased signature but you could prove

1944
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:08,099
biased signature but you could prove
 

1945
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,829
biased signature but you could prove
it's like a Venus in that case or maybe

1946
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:09,839
it's like a Venus in that case or maybe
 

1947
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,329
it's like a Venus in that case or maybe
like a Mars in that case like both those

1948
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:11,339
like a Mars in that case like both those
 

1949
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:12,770
like a Mars in that case like both those
have carbon dioxide Rich atmospheres

1950
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:12,780
have carbon dioxide Rich atmospheres
 

1951
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,530
have carbon dioxide Rich atmospheres
doesn't prove or disprove the existence

1952
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:15,540
doesn't prove or disprove the existence
 

1953
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,990
doesn't prove or disprove the existence
of life either way but it is our first

1954
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:18,000
of life either way but it is our first
 

1955
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,510
of life either way but it is our first
characterization of the nature of those

1956
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:20,520
characterization of the nature of those
 

1957
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,010
characterization of the nature of those
atmospheres maybe we can even tell the

1958
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,020
atmospheres maybe we can even tell the
 

1959
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,030
atmospheres maybe we can even tell the
pressure level and the temperature of

1960
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
pressure level and the temperature of
 

1961
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,770
pressure level and the temperature of
those atmospheres so that's very

1962
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:24,780
those atmospheres so that's very
 

1963
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,030
those atmospheres so that's very
exciting but um this we are competing

1964
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,040
exciting but um this we are competing
 

1965
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,470
exciting but um this we are competing
with that and that I I think that

1966
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:30,480
with that and that I I think that
 

1967
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,389
with that and that I I think that
science is completely mind-blowing and

1968
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:32,399
science is completely mind-blowing and
 

1969
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,250
science is completely mind-blowing and
fantastic we have a completely different

1970
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:34,260
fantastic we have a completely different
 

1971
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,530
fantastic we have a completely different
objective which is in our case to try

1972
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:36,540
objective which is in our case to try
 

1973
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,089
objective which is in our case to try
and look for the first evidence of these

1974
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:38,099
and look for the first evidence of these
 

1975
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,609
and look for the first evidence of these
small moons around these planets

1976
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:40,619
small moons around these planets
 

1977
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:42,409
small moons around these planets
um potentially even moons which could be

1978
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:42,419
um potentially even moons which could be
 

1979
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:44,270
um potentially even moons which could be
habitable of course so I think it's a

1980
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,280
habitable of course so I think it's a
 

1981
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,030
habitable of course so I think it's a
very exciting goal but

1982
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,040
very exciting goal but
 

1983
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,129
very exciting goal but
um attack has to make a human judgment

1984
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:49,139
um attack has to make a human judgment
 

1985
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,470
um attack has to make a human judgment
essentially about which science are they

1986
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:51,480
essentially about which science are they
 

1987
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,290
essentially about which science are they
most excited by which one has the

1988
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:54,300
most excited by which one has the
 

1989
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,690
most excited by which one has the
highest promise of return the most

1990
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:56,700
highest promise of return the most
 

1991
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,970
highest promise of return the most
highest chance of return and so that's

1992
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:58,980
highest chance of return and so that's
 

1993
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,890
highest chance of return and so that's
hard because if you look at a planetary

1994
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:00,900
hard because if you look at a planetary
 

1995
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,390
hard because if you look at a planetary
atmosphere

1996
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
atmosphere
 

1997
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,430
atmosphere
well you know most time the plant has an

1998
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:04,440
well you know most time the plant has an
 

1999
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,650
well you know most time the plant has an
atmosphere already it and so there's

2000
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:06,660
atmosphere already it and so there's
 

2001
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,270
atmosphere already it and so there's
almost a guaranteed success that you're

2002
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,280
almost a guaranteed success that you're
 

2003
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,230
almost a guaranteed success that you're
going to learn something about the

2004
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,240
going to learn something about the
 

2005
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,230
going to learn something about the
Atmosphere by pointing wst at it whereas

2006
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:12,240
Atmosphere by pointing wst at it whereas
 

2007
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,530
Atmosphere by pointing wst at it whereas
in our case there's a harder cell we are

2008
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:15,540
in our case there's a harder cell we are
 

2009
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,510
in our case there's a harder cell we are
looking for something that we do not

2010
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,520
looking for something that we do not
 

2011
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,210
looking for something that we do not
know for sure exists yet or not and so

2012
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:20,220
know for sure exists yet or not and so
 

2013
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,089
know for sure exists yet or not and so
we are pushing the telescope to do

2014
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:23,099
we are pushing the telescope to do
 

2015
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:25,310
we are pushing the telescope to do
something which is inherently more risky

2016
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:25,320
something which is inherently more risky
 

2017
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,210
something which is inherently more risky
yeah but the existence is shown already

2018
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,220
yeah but the existence is shown already
 

2019
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,829
yeah but the existence is shown already

2029
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,329
in our solar system they have an IO they
have a Europa and so on which means like

2030
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:44,339
have a Europa and so on which means like
 

2031
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:46,430
have a Europa and so on which means like

everything about these planets in terms

2064
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:24,720
everything about these planets in terms
 

2065
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,690
everything about these planets in terms
of the amount of water they have how

2066
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:26,700
of the amount of water they have how
 

2067
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,069
of the amount of water they have how
much atmosphere they have but for now

2068
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,079
much atmosphere they have but for now
 

2069
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,530
much atmosphere they have but for now
it's kind of focused just on the size

2070
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:29,540
it's kind of focused just on the size
 

2071
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,550
it's kind of focused just on the size
and the distance from the Star

2072
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:31,560
and the distance from the Star
 

2073
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,349
and the distance from the Star
essentially how how often do you get

2074
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:33,359
essentially how how often do you get
 

2075
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,270
essentially how how often do you get
similar conditions to that

2076
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
similar conditions to that
 

2077
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,430
similar conditions to that
um that was Kepler's primary Mission and

2078
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
um that was Kepler's primary Mission and
 

2079
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,710
um that was Kepler's primary Mission and
it it really just kind of flirted with

2080
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:39,720
it it really just kind of flirted with
 

2081
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,390
it it really just kind of flirted with
the answer it didn't quite get to a

2082
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:41,400
the answer it didn't quite get to a
 

2083
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,970
the answer it didn't quite get to a
definitive answer but I always say look

2084
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:43,980
definitive answer but I always say look
 

2085
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,890
definitive answer but I always say look
if we're looking if that's our primary

2086
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:45,900
if we're looking if that's our primary
 

2087
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,890
if we're looking if that's our primary
goal to look for Earth-like

2088
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:48,900
goal to look for Earth-like
 

2089
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,130
goal to look for Earth-like
I would say worlds then moons has to be

2090
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:52,140
I would say worlds then moons has to be
 

2091
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,890
I would say worlds then moons has to be
a part of that because we know that um

2092
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:54,900
a part of that because we know that um
 

2093
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,230
a part of that because we know that um
Earth-like and from the capital data to

2094
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,240
Earth-like and from the capital data to
 

2095
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,490
Earth-like and from the capital data to
the preliminary Resort is the Earth-like

2096
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:58,500
the preliminary Resort is the Earth-like
 

2097
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,890
the preliminary Resort is the Earth-like
planets around sunlight stars is not an

2098
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:00,900
planets around sunlight stars is not an
 

2099
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,970
planets around sunlight stars is not an
inevitable outcome it seems to be

2100
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:01,980
inevitable outcome it seems to be
 

2101
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,290
inevitable outcome it seems to be
something like a one to ten percent

2102
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:03,300
something like a one to ten percent
 

2103
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,810
something like a one to ten percent
outcome so it's not particularly

2104
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:05,820
outcome so it's not particularly
 

2105
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,870
outcome so it's not particularly
inevitable that happens but we do often

2106
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:08,880
inevitable that happens but we do often
 

2107
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,970
inevitable that happens but we do often
see about half of awesome like stars

2108
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:10,980
see about half of awesome like stars
 

2109
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,089
see about half of awesome like stars
have either a mini Neptune a Neptune or

2110
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:14,099
have either a mini Neptune a Neptune or
 

2111
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,370
have either a mini Neptune a Neptune or
Jupiter in the hyperzone of Their Stars

2112
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:16,380
Jupiter in the hyperzone of Their Stars
 

2113
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,470
Jupiter in the hyperzone of Their Stars
that's a very very common occurrence

2114
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:18,480
that's a very very common occurrence
 

2115
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,750
that's a very very common occurrence
that we see yet we have no idea how

2116
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:20,760
that we see yet we have no idea how
 

2117
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,089
that we see yet we have no idea how
often they have moons around them which

2118
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:23,099
often they have moons around them which
 

2119
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,730
often they have moons around them which
could also be habitable and so there may

2120
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:25,740
could also be habitable and so there may
 

2121
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,050
could also be habitable and so there may
very well be if even one in five of them

2122
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:29,060
very well be if even one in five of them
 

2123
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,329
very well be if even one in five of them
has an Earth-like moon or even a Mars

2124
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:32,339
has an Earth-like moon or even a Mars
 

2125
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,010
has an Earth-like moon or even a Mars
like Moon around them then there would

2126
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:34,020
like Moon around them then there would
 

2127
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,930
like Moon around them then there would
be more habitable real estate in terms

2128
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:35,940
be more habitable real estate in terms
 

2129
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,870
be more habitable real estate in terms
of exomoons than exoplasts you can

2130
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:38,880
of exomoons than exoplasts you can
 

2131
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,370
of exomoons than exoplasts you can
essentially 2x 3x 5x maybe 10x the

2132
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:43,380
essentially 2x 3x 5x maybe 10x the
 

2133
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,190
essentially 2x 3x 5x maybe 10x the
number of habitable worlds out there in

2134
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:46,200
number of habitable worlds out there in
 

2135
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,470
number of habitable worlds out there in
the universe our current estimate for

2136
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,480
the universe our current estimate for
 

2137
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,569
the universe our current estimate for
like the Drake equation absolutely so

2138
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:50,579
like the Drake equation absolutely so
 

2139
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,210
like the Drake equation absolutely so
this this is a one way to increase the

2140
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:53,220
this this is a one way to increase the
 

2141
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,349
this this is a one way to increase the
confidence

2142
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:54,359
confidence
 

2143
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,750
confidence
and increase the the value of that

2144
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:56,760
and increase the the value of that
 

2145
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,790
and increase the the value of that
parameter and just know where to look I

2146
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
parameter and just know where to look I
 

2147
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,010
parameter and just know where to look I
mean we we would like to know where

2148
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:01,020
mean we we would like to know where
 

2149
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,750
mean we we would like to know where
should we listen for techno signatures

2150
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:02,760
should we listen for techno signatures
 

2151
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,310
should we listen for techno signatures
where should we be looking for buyer

2152
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
where should we be looking for buyer
 

2153
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,630
where should we be looking for buyer
signatures

signatures
 

2155
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,670
signatures
um and not only that but what role does

2156
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:07,680
um and not only that but what role does
 

2157
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,650
um and not only that but what role does
the does the moon have in terms of its

2158
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:09,660
the does the moon have in terms of its
 

2159
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,630
the does the moon have in terms of its
influence on the planet

2160
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:11,640
influence on the planet
 

2161
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,310
influence on the planet
um we talked about these directly image

2162
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:13,320
um we talked about these directly image
 

2163
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,410
um we talked about these directly image
telescopes earlier these missions that

2164
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:15,420
telescopes earlier these missions that
 

2165
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,109
telescopes earlier these missions that
want to take a photo to quote Carl Sagan

2166
00:38:18,109 --> 00:38:18,119
want to take a photo to quote Carl Sagan
 

2167
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,030
want to take a photo to quote Carl Sagan
The Pale Blue Dart of our planet but the

2168
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,040
The Pale Blue Dart of our planet but the
 

2169
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,730
The Pale Blue Dart of our planet but the
pale blue dot of an exoplanet and that's

2170
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:22,740
pale blue dot of an exoplanet and that's
 

2171
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,130
pale blue dot of an exoplanet and that's
the dream to one day capture that but as

2172
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:25,140
the dream to one day capture that but as
 

2173
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,170
the dream to one day capture that but as
impressive as the resolution is that we

2174
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:27,180
impressive as the resolution is that we
 

2175
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,630
impressive as the resolution is that we
are planning and conspiring to design

2176
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:29,640
are planning and conspiring to design
 

2177
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,190
are planning and conspiring to design
for the future generation telescopes to

2178
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,200
for the future generation telescopes to
 

2179
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,069
for the future generation telescopes to
achieve that even those telescopes will

2180
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:34,079
achieve that even those telescopes will
 

2181
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,750
achieve that even those telescopes will
not have the capability of resolving the

2182
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
not have the capability of resolving the
 

2183
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,670
not have the capability of resolving the
Earth and the moon within that it'll be

2184
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
Earth and the moon within that it'll be
 

2185
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,510
Earth and the moon within that it'll be
a pale blue dot pixel but the moon's

2186
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:41,520
a pale blue dot pixel but the moon's
 

2187
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,329
a pale blue dot pixel but the moon's
gray grayness will be intermixed with

2188
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:44,339
gray grayness will be intermixed with
 

2189
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,370
gray grayness will be intermixed with
that pixel and so this is a big problem

2190
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:46,380
that pixel and so this is a big problem
 

2191
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,050
that pixel and so this is a big problem
because one of the ways that we are

2192
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:48,060
because one of the ways that we are
 

2193
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,310
because one of the ways that we are
claiming to look for life in the

2194
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:49,320
claiming to look for life in the
 

2195
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,790
claiming to look for life in the
universe is a chemical disequilibrium

2196
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:52,800
universe is a chemical disequilibrium
 

2197
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,130
universe is a chemical disequilibrium
so you see two molecules that just

2198
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,140
so you see two molecules that just
 

2199
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,930
so you see two molecules that just
shouldn't be there they normally react

2200
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:56,940
shouldn't be there they normally react
 

2201
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,910
shouldn't be there they normally react
with each other or even one molecule

2202
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:58,920
with each other or even one molecule
 

2203
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,230
with each other or even one molecule
that's just too reactive to be hanging

2204
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,240
that's just too reactive to be hanging
 

2205
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,089
that's just too reactive to be hanging
around the Atmosphere by itself so if

2206
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:02,099
around the Atmosphere by itself so if
 

2207
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:04,670
around the Atmosphere by itself so if
you had oxygen and methane hanging out

2208
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:04,680
you had oxygen and methane hanging out
 

2209
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,770
you had oxygen and methane hanging out
together those would normally react

2210
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:06,780
together those would normally react
 

2211
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,950
together those would normally react
fairly easily and so if you detected

2212
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:09,960
fairly easily and so if you detected
 

2213
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,210
fairly easily and so if you detected
those two molecules in your pale blue

2214
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:11,220
those two molecules in your pale blue
 

2215
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,550
those two molecules in your pale blue
dot Spectra you bet okay we have

2216
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:13,560
dot Spectra you bet okay we have
 

2217
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,890
dot Spectra you bet okay we have
evidence for life something's

2218
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:14,900

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,089
we can call that now but we know that
these you know the universe likes to

2378
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:14,099
these you know the universe likes to
 

2379
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,790
these you know the universe likes to
make things in pairs yeah um so you're

2380
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
make things in pairs yeah um so you're
 

2381
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,750
make things in pairs yeah um so you're
saying our sun is an in cell

2382
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
saying our sun is an in cell
 

2383
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,190
saying our sun is an in cell
it's looking so most things are dating

2384
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,200
it's looking so most things are dating
 

2385
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,230
it's looking so most things are dating
they're in relationships and ours is

2386
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,240
they're in relationships and ours is
 

2387
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,650
they're in relationships and ours is
alone it's not a complete freak of the

2388
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:27,660
alone it's not a complete freak of the
 

2389
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,890
alone it's not a complete freak of the
universe to be alone but it is

2390
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:30,900
universe to be alone but it is
 

2391
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,810
universe to be alone but it is
um it's more common for sunlight Stars

2392
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:32,820
um it's more common for sunlight Stars
 

2393
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,310
um it's more common for sunlight Stars
if you count up all the next stars in

2394
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:34,320
if you count up all the next stars in
 

2395
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,569
if you count up all the next stars in
the universe about half of the sunlight

2396
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:35,579
the universe about half of the sunlight
 

2397
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:37,430
the universe about half of the sunlight
star systems are in binary or trinary

2398
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
star systems are in binary or trinary
 

2399
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,589
star systems are in binary or trinary
systems and the other half are single

2400
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:39,599
systems and the other half are single
 

2401
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,630
systems and the other half are single
but because those binaries are two or

2402
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:41,640
but because those binaries are two or
 

2403
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,510
but because those binaries are two or
three stars then cumulatively maybe like

2404
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:44,520
three stars then cumulatively maybe like
 

2405
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,670
three stars then cumulatively maybe like
a third of all so like stars are single

2406
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:46,680
a third of all so like stars are single
 

2407
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,550
a third of all so like stars are single
I'm trying hard to not anthropomorphize

2408
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:49,560
I'm trying hard to not anthropomorphize
 

2409
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,829
I'm trying hard to not anthropomorphize
the relationship

2410
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:50,839
the relationship
 

2411
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:53,710
the relationship
with each other but yeah

2412
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:53,720
with each other but yeah
 

2413
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,690
with each other but yeah
yeah that's yeah I've met those folks

2414
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:56,700
yeah that's yeah I've met those folks
 

2415
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,770
yeah that's yeah I've met those folks
also

2416
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:57,780
also
 

2417
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,750
also
um so is there something interesting to

2418
00:42:59,750 --> 00:42:59,760
um so is there something interesting to
 

2419
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,030
um so is there something interesting to
learn about the habitability the how

2420
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:02,040
learn about the habitability the how
 

2421
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,650
learn about the habitability the how
that affects the probability of

2422
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:03,660
that affects the probability of
 

2423
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,530
that affects the probability of
habitable worlds when they kind of

2424
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:06,540
habitable worlds when they kind of
 

2425
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,849
habitable worlds when they kind of
couple up like that in those different

2426
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:07,859
couple up like that in those different
 

2427
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,069
couple up like that in those different
ways well it depends we're talking about

2428
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
ways well it depends we're talking about
 

2429
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,750
ways well it depends we're talking about
the stars of the planet certainly if

2430
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
the stars of the planet certainly if
 

2431
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,849
the stars of the planet certainly if
Stars couple up that has a big influence

2432
00:43:13,849 --> 00:43:13,859
Stars couple up that has a big influence
 

2433
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:16,069
Stars couple up that has a big influence
on the how to Ability

2434
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:16,079
on the how to Ability
 

2435
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,569
on the how to Ability
um of course this is very famous from

2436
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:17,579
um of course this is very famous from
 

2437
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:19,730
um of course this is very famous from
Star Wars Tatooine in Star Wars there's

2438
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:19,740
Star Wars Tatooine in Star Wars there's
 

2439
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,230
Star Wars Tatooine in Star Wars there's
a binary star system and you have Luke

2440
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:21,240
a binary star system and you have Luke
 

2441
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,790
a binary star system and you have Luke
Skywalker looking at the sunset I'm

2442
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:22,800
Skywalker looking at the sunset I'm
 

2443
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,490
Skywalker looking at the sunset I'm
seeing two stars come down and uh for

2444
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:25,500
seeing two stars come down and uh for
 

2445
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,710
seeing two stars come down and uh for
years we thought that was purely a

2446
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:27,720
years we thought that was purely a
 

2447
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,569
years we thought that was purely a
product of George Lucas's incredibly

2448
00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:29,579
product of George Lucas's incredibly
 

2449
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:33,530
product of George Lucas's incredibly
creative mind and we didn't think that

2450
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:33,540
creative mind and we didn't think that
 

2451
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,510
creative mind and we didn't think that
planets would exist around binary star

2452
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:35,520
planets would exist around binary star
 

2453
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,670
planets would exist around binary star
systems it seems like two tumultuous an

2454
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
systems it seems like two tumultuous an
 

2455
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,970

2458
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:43,619
disk circumstellar disk to form plants
 

2459
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:47,510
disk circumstellar disk to form plants
from and yet uh one of the astounding

2460
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:47,520
from and yet uh one of the astounding
 

2461
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,849
from and yet uh one of the astounding
discoveries from Kepler was that these

2462
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:49,859
discoveries from Kepler was that these
 

2463
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,770
discoveries from Kepler was that these
appear to be quite common in fact as far

2464
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:51,780
appear to be quite common in fact as far
 

2465
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,809
appear to be quite common in fact as far
as we can tell they're just as common

2466
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:53,819
as we can tell they're just as common
 

2467
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:56,329
as we can tell they're just as common
around binary stars as single Stars the

2468
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:56,339
around binary stars as single Stars the
 

2469
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,670
around binary stars as single Stars the
only uh caveat to that is that you don't

2470
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:58,680
only uh caveat to that is that you don't
 

2471
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,890
only uh caveat to that is that you don't
get plants close into binary Stars they

2472
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:00,900
get plants close into binary Stars they
 

2473
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,170
get plants close into binary Stars they
have like a clearance region in on the

2474
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:03,180
have like a clearance region in on the
 

2475
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,450
have like a clearance region in on the
inside where plants maybe they form

2476
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:05,460
inside where plants maybe they form
 

2477
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,430
inside where plants maybe they form
there but they don't last

2478
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:07,440
there but they don't last
 

2479
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,010
there but they don't last
they are dynamically unstable in that

2480
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,020
they are dynamically unstable in that
 

2481
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,470
they are dynamically unstable in that
zone but once you get out to about the

2482
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:12,480
zone but once you get out to about the
 

2483
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,730
zone but once you get out to about the
distance that the Earth orbits the Sun

2484
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:13,740
distance that the Earth orbits the Sun
 

2485
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,829
distance that the Earth orbits the Sun
or even a little bit closer in you start

2486
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
or even a little bit closer in you start
 

2487
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,190
or even a little bit closer in you start
to find plants emerging and so that's

2488
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
to find plants emerging and so that's
 

2489
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,870
to find plants emerging and so that's
the right distance for liquid water so

2490
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:20,880
the right distance for liquid water so
 

2491
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,190
the right distance for liquid water so
at distance for potentially life on

2492
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:22,200
at distance for potentially life on
 

2493
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,230
at distance for potentially life on
those parts and so there may vary will

2494
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,240
those parts and so there may vary will
 

2495
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,970
those parts and so there may vary will
be plenty of Habitual plants around the

2499
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,990

bit different binary plants I don't

2500
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,000
bit different binary plants I don't
 

2501
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,430
bit different binary plants I don't
think we have

2502
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:31,440
think we have
 

2503
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,849
think we have
um any serious connection of plant

2504
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:34,859
um any serious connection of plant
 

2505
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:37,370
um any serious connection of plant
banarity to habitability certainly when

00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:54,599
this uh the star so the formation

mechanism proposed here
 

2525
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,970
mechanism proposed here
um because it is very difficult to form

2526
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:57,980
um because it is very difficult to form
 

2527
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,589

like this they were generally merged

2530
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:01,980
like this they were generally merged
 

2531
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,589
like this they were generally merged
within the disc and so that's why you

2532
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:03,599
within the disc and so that's why you
 

2533
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,390
within the disc and so that's why you
normally get single planets but you

2534
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:05,400
normally get single planets but you
 

2535
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,829
normally get single planets but you
could have something like Jupiter and

2536
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:06,839
could have something like Jupiter and
 

2537
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,589
could have something like Jupiter and
Saturn form at separate distances they

2538
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:09,599
Saturn form at separate distances they
 

2539
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,329
Saturn form at separate distances they
could dynamically be scattered in

2540
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:11,339
could dynamically be scattered in
 

2541
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:13,609
could dynamically be scattered in
towards one another and basically not

2542
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:13,619
towards one another and basically not
 

2543
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:15,410
towards one another and basically not
quite Collide but have a very close on

2544
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:15,420
quite Collide but have a very close on
 

2545
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,010
quite Collide but have a very close on
encounter now because uh tidal forces

2546
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:19,020
encounter now because uh tidal forces
 

2547
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,230
encounter now because uh tidal forces
increase dramatically as the distance

2548
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,240
increase dramatically as the distance
 

2549
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,809
increase dramatically as the distance
decreases between two objects the tides

2550
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:23,819
decreases between two objects the tides
 

2551
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:25,250
decreases between two objects the tides
can actually dissipate the kinetic

2552
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:25,260
can actually dissipate the kinetic
 

2553
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,890
can actually dissipate the kinetic
energy and bring them bound into one

2554
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:27,900
energy and bring them bound into one
 

2555
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,670
energy and bring them bound into one
another so that seemed when we you know

2556
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
another so that seemed when we you know
 

2557
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,990
another so that seemed when we you know
when you first hear that you think that

2558
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:33,000
when you first hear that you think that
 

2559
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,849
when you first hear that you think that
seems fairly contrived that you'd have

2560
00:45:34,849 --> 00:45:34,859
seems fairly contrived that you'd have
 

2561
00:45:34,859 --> 00:45:36,530
seems fairly contrived that you'd have
the conditions just right to get these

2562
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:36,540
the conditions just right to get these
 

2563
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,050
the conditions just right to get these
ties to cause a capture but numerical

2564
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:39,060
ties to cause a capture but numerical
 

2565
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,910
ties to cause a capture but numerical
simulations have shown that about 10 of

2566
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:40,920
simulations have shown that about 10 of
 

2567
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,770
simulations have shown that about 10 of
planet planet encounters

2568
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:42,780
planet planet encounters
 

2569
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,630
planet planet encounters
are shown to produce something like

2570
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
are shown to produce something like
 

2571
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,849
are shown to produce something like
binary planets which is a startling

2572
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:46,859
binary planets which is a startling
 

2573
00:45:46,859 --> 00:45:48,530
binary planets which is a startling
prediction

2574
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:48,540
prediction
 

2575
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,630
prediction
um and so that seems at odds with

2576
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:50,640
um and so that seems at odds with
 

2577
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,730
um and so that seems at odds with
naively the exoplank catalog for which

2578
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:52,740
naively the exoplank catalog for which
 

2579
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,309
naively the exoplank catalog for which
we know of so far are no binary plants

2580
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:55,319
we know of so far are no binary plants
 

2581
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,770
we know of so far are no binary plants
and we propose one of the resolutions to

2582
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:57,780
and we propose one of the resolutions to
 

2583
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,150
and we propose one of the resolutions to
this might be that the binary planets

2584
00:45:59,150 --> 00:45:59,160
this might be that the binary planets
 

2585
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,710
this might be that the binary planets
are just incredibly difficult to detect

2586
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:00,720
are just incredibly difficult to detect
 

2587
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,770
are just incredibly difficult to detect
which is also counter-intuitive because

2588
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:03,780
which is also counter-intuitive because
 

2589
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,630
which is also counter-intuitive because
remember how they form us through this

2590
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:05,640
remember how they form us through this
 

2591
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,309
remember how they form us through this
tidal mechanism and so they form

2592
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:07,319
tidal mechanism and so they form
 

2593
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:09,470
tidal mechanism and so they form
extremely close to each other so the

2594
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:09,480
extremely close to each other so the
 

2595
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,210
extremely close to each other so the
distance that IO is away from Jupiter

2596
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:11,220
distance that IO is away from Jupiter
 

2597
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,069
distance that IO is away from Jupiter
just a few planetary radii they're

2598
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:13,079
just a few planetary radii they're
 

2599
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:15,109
just a few planetary radii they're
almost touching one another and they're

2600
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:15,119
almost touching one another and they're
 

2601
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,849
almost touching one another and they're
just tightly locked facing each other

2602
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:16,859
just tightly locked facing each other
 

2603
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,950
just tightly locked facing each other
for eternity and so in that

2604
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
for eternity and so in that
 

2605
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,410
for eternity and so in that
configuration as it transits across the

2606
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:21,420
configuration as it transits across the
 

2607
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,390
configuration as it transits across the
start it kind of looks like you can't

2608
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:23,400
start it kind of looks like you can't
 

2609
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,069
start it kind of looks like you can't
really resolve those two planets it just

2610
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:25,079
really resolve those two planets it just
 

2611
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:26,510
really resolve those two planets it just
looks like one planet to you that's

2612
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:26,520
looks like one planet to you that's
 

2613
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,430
looks like one planet to you that's
going across the star the temporal

2614
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:28,440
going across the star the temporal
 

2615
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,109
going across the star the temporal
resolution of the data is rarely good

2616
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:30,119
resolution of the data is rarely good
 

2617
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,150
resolution of the data is rarely good
enough to distinguish that and so you'd

2618
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
enough to distinguish that and so you'd
 

2619
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,670
enough to distinguish that and so you'd
see one Transit but in fact it's two

2620
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:34,680
see one Transit but in fact it's two
 

2621
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,530
see one Transit but in fact it's two
players very close together which are

2622
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:36,540
players very close together which are
 

2623
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,930
players very close together which are
transiting at once and so yeah we wrote

2624
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:38,940
transiting at once and so yeah we wrote
 

2625
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,089
transiting at once and so yeah we wrote
a paper just recently where we developed

2626
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:41,099
a paper just recently where we developed
 

2627
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,370
a paper just recently where we developed
some techniques to try and get around

2628
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:43,380
some techniques to try and get around
 

2629
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,230
some techniques to try and get around
this problem and hopefully provide a

2630
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:45,240
this problem and hopefully provide a
 

2631
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,809
this problem and hopefully provide a
tool where we could finally look for

2632
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:47,819
tool where we could finally look for
 

2633
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:49,550
tool where we could finally look for
these plants the problem of detection of

2634
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:49,560
these plants the problem of detection of
 

2635
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,490
these plants the problem of detection of
yes that was our Focus was how do you

2636
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:52,500
yes that was our Focus was how do you
 

2637
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,010
yes that was our Focus was how do you
how do you get around this this merging

2638
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:55,020
how do you get around this this merging
 

2639
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,290
how do you get around this this merging
problem so whether they're out there or

2640
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:57,300
problem so whether they're out there or
 

2641
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,650
problem so whether they're out there or
not uh we don't know we we're planning

2642
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:00,660
not uh we don't know we we're planning
 

2643
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,410
not uh we don't know we we're planning
to do a search for them but um it it

2644
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:03,420
to do a search for them but um it it
 

2645
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,210
to do a search for them but um it it
remains an open question and I think

2646
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:05,220
remains an open question and I think
 

2647
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,430
remains an open question and I think
just one of those fun astrophysics

2648
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
just one of those fun astrophysics
 

2649
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,470
just one of those fun astrophysics
Curiosities questions where the binary

2650
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:09,480
Curiosities questions where the binary
 

2651
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,670
Curiosities questions where the binary
players exist in the universe because

2652
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:10,680
players exist in the universe because
 

2653
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,890
players exist in the universe because
then you know you have binary Earths you

2654
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:12,900
then you know you have binary Earths you
 

2655
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,390
then you know you have binary Earths you
could have binary Neptune all sorts of

2656
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,400
could have binary Neptune all sorts of
 

2657
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,790
could have binary Neptune all sorts of
wild stuff that would you know flow to

2658
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:16,800
wild stuff that would you know flow to
 

2659
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,010
wild stuff that would you know flow to
the Sci-Fi imagination I wonder what the

2660
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:19,020
the Sci-Fi imagination I wonder what the
 

2661
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,730
the Sci-Fi imagination I wonder what the
physics on a binary Planet feels like it

2662
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:22,740
physics on a binary Planet feels like it
 

2663
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,530
physics on a binary Planet feels like it
might be trivial I have to think about

2664
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:24,540
might be trivial I have to think about
 

2665
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,210
might be trivial I have to think about
that I wonder if there's some

2666
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:26,220
that I wonder if there's some
 

2667
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,650
that I wonder if there's some
interesting Dynamics like if you're

2668
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:27,660
interesting Dynamics like if you're
 

2669
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,670
interesting Dynamics like if you're
multiple

2670
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:28,680
multiple
 

2671
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,650
multiple
or would gravity feel different on

2672
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:30,660
or would gravity feel different on
 

2673
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,329
or would gravity feel different on
different parts of the the surface of

2674
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:32,339
different parts of the the surface of
 

2675
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:33,589
different parts of the the surface of
the sphere when there's another large

2676
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:33,599
the sphere when there's another large
 

2677
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,770
the sphere when there's another large
sphere yeah I would think that the force

2678
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:36,780
sphere yeah I would think that the force
 

2679
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,650
sphere yeah I would think that the force
would be uh fairly similar because the

2680
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:39,660
would be uh fairly similar because the
 

2681
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,890
would be uh fairly similar because the
shape of the object would deform to a

2682
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:42,900
shape of the object would deform to a
 

2683
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,870
shape of the object would deform to a
flat Geo potential essentially a uniform

2684
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:44,880
flat Geo potential essentially a uniform
 

2685
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,490
flat Geo potential essentially a uniform
geopotential but it would lead to a

2686
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:46,500
geopotential but it would lead to a
 

2687
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,190
geopotential but it would lead to a
distorted shape for the two objects I

2688
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:49,200
distorted shape for the two objects I
 

2689
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,170
distorted shape for the two objects I
think they've become ellipsoids facing

2690
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:51,180
think they've become ellipsoids facing
 

2691
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,550
think they've become ellipsoids facing
one another

2692
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:52,560
one another
 

2693
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,950
one another
um so it would be pretty wild when you

2694
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,960
um so it would be pretty wild when you
 

2695
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,450
um so it would be pretty wild when you
you know people like Flat Earth or

2696
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:56,460
you know people like Flat Earth or
 

2697
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,190
you know people like Flat Earth or
spherical Earth you fly from space and

2698
00:47:58,190 --> 00:47:58,200
spherical Earth you fly from space and
 

2699
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,569
spherical Earth you fly from space and
you see a football shaped Earth yeah

2700
00:47:59,569 --> 00:47:59,579
you see a football shaped Earth yeah
 

2701
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:02,150
you see a football shaped Earth yeah
it's your own Planet finally there's

2702
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:02,160
it's your own Planet finally there's
 

2703
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,829
it's your own Planet finally there's
proof and I wonder how how difficult it

2704
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:03,839
proof and I wonder how how difficult it
 

2705
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,690
proof and I wonder how how difficult it
would be to travel from one to the other

2706
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:05,700
would be to travel from one to the other
 

2707
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,309
would be to travel from one to the other
because you have to overcome the one

2708
00:48:09,309 --> 00:48:09,319
because you have to overcome the one
 

2709
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,050
because you have to overcome the one
no it might be kind of easy

2710
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:12,060
no it might be kind of easy
 

2711
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,910
no it might be kind of easy
yeah I mean they're so close to each

2712
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:13,920
yeah I mean they're so close to each
 

2713
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,890
yeah I mean they're so close to each
other that helps and I think the most

2714
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:15,900
other that helps and I think the most
 

2715
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,150
other that helps and I think the most
critical Factor would be how massive is

2716
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:17,160
critical Factor would be how massive is
 

2717
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,890
critical Factor would be how massive is
the planet that's always I mean one of

2718
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:18,900
the planet that's always I mean one of
 

2719
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,630
the planet that's always I mean one of
the challenges with escaping plants

2720
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640
the challenges with escaping plants
 

2721
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,609
the challenges with escaping plants
there was a fun paper when my colleagues

2722
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:22,619
there was a fun paper when my colleagues
 

2723
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:24,950
there was a fun paper when my colleagues
wrote that suggested that super Earth

00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
wrote that suggested that super Earth

planets may be inescapable if you're a

00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,730
planets may be inescapable if you're a

2730
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,200
Earth the surface gravity is so high
 

2731
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,670
Earth the surface gravity is so high
that the chemical potential energy of

00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:34,680
that the chemical potential energy of
 

2733
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,309
that the chemical potential energy of
hydrogen or methane whatever fuel you're

2734
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:37,319
hydrogen or methane whatever fuel you're
 

2735
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:41,329
hydrogen or methane whatever fuel you're
using simply is at odds with the with

00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:41,339
using simply is at odds with the with
 

2737
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,490
using simply is at odds with the with
the gravity of the planet itself and so

00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:43,500
the gravity of the planet itself and so
 

2739
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,349
the gravity of the planet itself and so
you would uh you know our current

2743
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,650
Rockets I'm not sure with a fraction but
maybe like 90 of the rocket is fuel or

00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:48,660
maybe like 90 of the rocket is fuel or
 

2745
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,390
maybe like 90 of the rocket is fuel or
something by mass these things would

something by mass these things would
 

2747
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,710
something by mass these things would
have to be

00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:51,720
have to be
 

2749
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,690
have to be
um like the size of the the Giza

00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:53,700
um like the size of the the Giza

Pantry atmosphere and so it has been

2756
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:00,180
Pantry atmosphere and so it has been
 

2757
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,050
Pantry atmosphere and so it has been
argued that if you live on a super Earth

you may be you may be forced to live

00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,109
you may be you may be forced to live
there forever there may be no Escape

unless you invent a space elevator or

2764
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:08,040
unless you invent a space elevator or
 

2765
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,829
unless you invent a space elevator or
something but then how do you even build

2766
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:09,839
something but then how do you even build
 

2767
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,050
something but then how do you even build
the infrastructure and space to to do

00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:12,060
the infrastructure and space to to do
 

2769
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,089
the infrastructure and space to to do
something like that in the absence of a

um and so the more and more we we look

2774
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:18,060
um and so the more and more we we look
 

2775
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,329
um and so the more and more we we look
at our Earth and think about the sorts

2776
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:20,339
at our Earth and think about the sorts
 

2777
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:22,250
at our Earth and think about the sorts
of problems we're facing

2778
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:22,260
of problems we're facing
 

2779
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,290
of problems we're facing
the more you see things about the Earth

2780
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:24,300
the more you see things about the Earth
 

2781
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,990
the more you see things about the Earth
which make it ideally suited in so many

not only live on a planet which has the

2848
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:36,359
given the size of Earth it's not so bad
 

2849
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:38,270
given the size of Earth it's not so bad
that we could still actually construct

2850
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:38,280
that we could still actually construct
 

2851
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,890
that we could still actually construct
propulsion systems that can escape it

2852
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:39,900
propulsion systems that can escape it
 

2853
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,569
propulsion systems that can escape it
yeah and it's time with climate change

2854
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:41,579
yeah and it's time with climate change
 

2855
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:43,430
yeah and it's time with climate change
perhaps I mean climate change is the

2856
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:43,440
perhaps I mean climate change is the
 

2857
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,930
perhaps I mean climate change is the
next major problem facing That

2858
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:44,940
next major problem facing That
 

2859
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,589
next major problem facing That
civilization but we know it is

2860
00:50:48,589 --> 00:50:48,599
civilization but we know it is
 

2861
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:50,450
civilization but we know it is
technically surmountable yeah you know

2862
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:50,460
technically surmountable yeah you know
 

2863
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,390
technically surmountable yeah you know
it's it's a it's it's it does seem

2864
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:53,400
it's it's a it's it's it does seem
 

2865
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,710
it's it's a it's it's it does seem
sometimes like there has been a series

2866
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:54,720
sometimes like there has been a series
 

2867
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,589
sometimes like there has been a series
of challenges laid out to

2868
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:57,599
of challenges laid out to
 

2869
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,150
of challenges laid out to
um progress us towards a mature

2870
00:50:59,150 --> 00:50:59,160
um progress us towards a mature
 

2871
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,549
um progress us towards a mature
civilization that can one day perhaps

2872
00:51:01,549 --> 00:51:01,559
civilization that can one day perhaps
 

2873
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,650
civilization that can one day perhaps
expand to the Stars I'm a little more

2874
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:03,660
expand to the Stars I'm a little more
 

2875
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,170
expand to the Stars I'm a little more
concerned about nuclear weapons uh Ai

2876
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:06,180
concerned about nuclear weapons uh Ai
 

2877
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,530
concerned about nuclear weapons uh Ai
and uh natural or artificial pandemics

2878
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:09,540
and uh natural or artificial pandemics
 

2879
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,650
and uh natural or artificial pandemics
but yes I mean plenty plenty of plenty

2880
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:12,660
but yes I mean plenty plenty of plenty
 

2881
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,390
but yes I mean plenty plenty of plenty
of fun Milestones that we need to cross

2882
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
of fun Milestones that we need to cross
 

2883
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,370
of fun Milestones that we need to cross
and we can argue about the severity of

2884
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:16,380
and we can argue about the severity of
 

2885
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,010
and we can argue about the severity of
each one but there is no doubt that we

2886
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:19,020
each one but there is no doubt that we
 

2887
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:21,290
each one but there is no doubt that we
live in a world that has serious

2888
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:21,300
live in a world that has serious
 

2889
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,510
live in a world that has serious
challenges is that are pushing our

2890
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:23,520
challenges is that are pushing our
 

2891
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,349
challenges is that are pushing our
intellects now will to the limit of

2892
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:27,359
intellects now will to the limit of
 

2893
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,329
intellects now will to the limit of
whether we're really ready to progress

2894
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:29,339
whether we're really ready to progress
 

2895
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:31,609
whether we're really ready to progress
to the next stage of our development so

2896
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:31,619
to the next stage of our development so
 

2897
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:33,109
to the next stage of our development so
thank you for taking the tangent and

2898
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:33,119
thank you for taking the tangent and
 

2899
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,089
thank you for taking the tangent and
there'll be a million more but can we

2900
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:35,099
there'll be a million more but can we
 

2901
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,790
there'll be a million more but can we
step back to Kepler

2902
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:36,800
step back to Kepler
 

2903
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,730
step back to Kepler
1625b what is it and you you've talked

2904
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:40,740
1625b what is it and you you've talked
 

2905
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,130
1625b what is it and you you've talked
about this kind of Journey this

2906
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:43,140
about this kind of Journey this
 

2907
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:48,290
about this kind of Journey this
effort to discover uh EXO moons so moons

2908
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:48,300
effort to discover uh EXO moons so moons
 

2909
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,890
effort to discover uh EXO moons so moons
out there or small cool objects out

2910
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:51,900
out there or small cool objects out
 

2911
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,930
out there or small cool objects out
there uh where does that effort stand

2912
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:53,940
there uh where does that effort stand
 

2913
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:57,170
there uh where does that effort stand
and what is coupler 1625b yeah we I mean

2914
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:57,180
and what is coupler 1625b yeah we I mean
 

2915
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,210
and what is coupler 1625b yeah we I mean
I've been searching from experiments for

2916
00:51:59,210 --> 00:51:59,220
I've been searching from experiments for
 

2917
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,770
I've been searching from experiments for
most of my professional career and I

2918
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:00,780
most of my professional career and I
 

2919
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,870
most of my professional career and I
think a lot of my colleagues think I'm

2920
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:02,880
think a lot of my colleagues think I'm
 

2921
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,410
think a lot of my colleagues think I'm
kind of crazy to to still be doing it

2922
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:06,420
kind of crazy to to still be doing it
 

2923
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,450
kind of crazy to to still be doing it
you know after

2924
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:08,460
you know after
 

2925
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,609
you know after
after five years of not finding anything

2926
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:10,619
after five years of not finding anything
 

2927
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:12,230
after five years of not finding anything
I think most people would probably try

2928
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:12,240
I think most people would probably try
 

2929
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,490
I think most people would probably try
doing something else I even had people

2930
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:13,500
doing something else I even had people
 

2931
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,589
doing something else I even had people
say that to me they said um you know

2932
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:15,599
say that to me they said um you know
 

2933
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,450
say that to me they said um you know
professors and I remember the cocktail

2934
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:17,460
professors and I remember the cocktail
 

2935
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,829
professors and I remember the cocktail
party took me to the side an MIT

2936
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:18,839
party took me to the side an MIT
 

2937
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:20,690
party took me to the side an MIT
Professor he said

2938
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:20,700
Professor he said
 

2939
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,790
Professor he said
um you know you should just look for hot

2940
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:22,800
um you know you should just look for hot
 

2941
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,109
um you know you should just look for hot
Jupiters they're everywhere it's really

2942
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:24,119
Jupiters they're everywhere it's really
 

2943
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:26,690
Jupiters they're everywhere it's really
you can write papers they're so easy to

2944
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:26,700
you can write papers they're so easy to
 

2945
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,990
you can write papers they're so easy to
find and I was like yeah but hardship

2946
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:30,000
find and I was like yeah but hardship
 

2947
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,210
find and I was like yeah but hardship
just just they're not interesting to me

2948
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:32,220
just just they're not interesting to me
 

2949
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,910
just just they're not interesting to me
I want to do something that I feel

2950
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:33,920
I want to do something that I feel
 

2951
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,370
I want to do something that I feel
intellectually pushes me to the edge and

2952
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:37,380
intellectually pushes me to the edge and
 

2953
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,650
intellectually pushes me to the edge and
there's maybe a contribution that not no

2954
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:39,660
there's maybe a contribution that not no
 

2955
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,049
there's maybe a contribution that not no
one else could do but maybe

2956
00:52:42,049 --> 00:52:42,059
one else could do but maybe
 

2957
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,030
one else could do but maybe
um is not certainly the thing that

2958
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:44,040
um is not certainly the thing that
 

2959
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,650
um is not certainly the thing that
anybody could do I don't want to just be

2960
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:45,660
anybody could do I don't want to just be
 

2961
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,450
anybody could do I don't want to just be
the first to something for the sake of

2962
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:47,460
the first to something for the sake of
 

2963
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,770
the first to something for the sake of
being first I want to do something that

2964
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:48,780
being first I want to do something that
 

2965
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,290
being first I want to do something that
feels like a meaningful intellectual

2966
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:51,300
feels like a meaningful intellectual
 

2967
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,349
feels like a meaningful intellectual
contribution to our society and so you

2968
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:54,359
contribution to our society and so you
 

2969
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:55,790
contribution to our society and so you
know this examine problem has been

2970
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:55,800
know this examine problem has been
 

2971
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,710
know this examine problem has been
haunting me for years to try and solve

2972
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:57,720
haunting me for years to try and solve
 

2973
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,049
haunting me for years to try and solve
this now as I said we looked for years

2974
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:00,059
this now as I said we looked for years
 

2975
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:01,730
this now as I said we looked for years
and years using Kepler

2976
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:01,740
and years using Kepler
 

2977
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,650
and years using Kepler
and the closest we ever got was just a

2978
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:03,660
and the closest we ever got was just a
 

2979
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:07,430
and the closest we ever got was just a
hint for this one star Kepler 1625 has a

2980
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:07,440
hint for this one star Kepler 1625 has a
 

2981
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,890
hint for this one star Kepler 1625 has a
jupiter-like planet in orbit of it and

2982
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:09,900
jupiter-like planet in orbit of it and
 

2983
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,530
jupiter-like planet in orbit of it and
that Jupiter planet is on a 287 day

2984
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:12,540
that Jupiter planet is on a 287 day
 

2985
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,870
that Jupiter planet is on a 287 day
period so it's almost the same distance

2986
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:14,880
period so it's almost the same distance
 

2987
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,089
period so it's almost the same distance
as the Earth around the Sun but for a

2988
00:53:17,089 --> 00:53:17,099
as the Earth around the Sun but for a
 

2989
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,349
as the Earth around the Sun but for a
Jupiter

2990
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:18,359
Jupiter
 

2991
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:21,109
Jupiter
um so that was already unusual I don't

2992
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:21,119
um so that was already unusual I don't
 

2993
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,490
um so that was already unusual I don't
think people realize that Jupiter like

2994
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:22,500
think people realize that Jupiter like
 

2995
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,950
think people realize that Jupiter like
planets are quite rare in the universe

2996
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:24,960
planets are quite rare in the universe
 

2997
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,470
planets are quite rare in the universe
certainly many Neptunes and Neptunes are

2998
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:27,480
certainly many Neptunes and Neptunes are
 

2999
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,690
certainly many Neptunes and Neptunes are
extremely common but Jupiter is only

3000
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:29,700
extremely common but Jupiter is only
 

3001
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,210
extremely common but Jupiter is only
about 10 of sun-like stars have Jupiters

3002
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:32,220
about 10 of sun-like stars have Jupiters
 

3003
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,770
about 10 of sun-like stars have Jupiters
around them as far as we can tell when

3004
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:33,780
around them as far as we can tell when
 

3005
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,049
around them as far as we can tell when
you say Jupiter which aspect of Jupiter

3006
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:36,059
you say Jupiter which aspect of Jupiter
 

3007
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:39,049
you say Jupiter which aspect of Jupiter
in terms of its mass and uh it's a major

3008
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:39,059
in terms of its mass and uh it's a major
 

3009
00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:41,809
in terms of its mass and uh it's a major
access so anything beyond about half an

3010
00:53:41,809 --> 00:53:41,819
access so anything beyond about half an
 

3011
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:43,490
access so anything beyond about half an
au so half the distance of the Earth and

3012
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:43,500
au so half the distance of the Earth and
 

3013
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,549
au so half the distance of the Earth and
the Sun and something of order of um a

3014
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:46,559
the Sun and something of order of um a
 

3015
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,109
the Sun and something of order of um a
tenth of a Jupiter Mass that's the mass

3016
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:48,119
tenth of a Jupiter Mass that's the mass
 

3017
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:50,809
tenth of a Jupiter Mass that's the mass
of Saturn up to say 10 Jupiter masses

3018
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:50,819
of Saturn up to say 10 Jupiter masses
 

3019
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:52,190
of Saturn up to say 10 Jupiter masses
which is basically where you start to

3020
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:52,200
which is basically where you start to
 

3021
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,230
which is basically where you start to
get to Brown dwarfs those types of

3022
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,240
get to Brown dwarfs those types of
 

3023
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,270
get to Brown dwarfs those types of
objects appear to be somewhat unusual

3024
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:56,280
objects appear to be somewhat unusual
 

3025
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,849
objects appear to be somewhat unusual
most solar systems do not have Jupiters

3026
00:53:58,849 --> 00:53:58,859
most solar systems do not have Jupiters
 

3027
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:01,329
most solar systems do not have Jupiters
which is really interesting because

3028
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:01,339
which is really interesting because
 

3029
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:03,829
which is really interesting because
Jupiter again like the moon seems to

3030
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:03,839
Jupiter again like the moon seems to
 

3031
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,710
Jupiter again like the moon seems to
have been a pivotal character in the

3032
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:06,720
have been a pivotal character in the
 

3033
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,270
have been a pivotal character in the
story of the development of our solar

3034
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:08,280
story of the development of our solar
 

3035
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,130
story of the development of our solar
system perhaps especially having a large

00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:10,140
system perhaps especially having a large
 

3037
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,109
system perhaps especially having a large
influence of the development of

00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:12,119
influence of the development of
 

3039
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:14,089
influence of the development of
um the late heavy bombardment and the

00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:14,099
um the late heavy bombardment and the
 

3041
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:15,410
um the late heavy bombardment and the
rate of asteroid impacts that we receive

3042
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:15,420
rate of asteroid impacts that we receive
 

3043
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,809
rate of asteroid impacts that we receive
and things like this anyway to come back

3044
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:17,819
and things like this anyway to come back
 

3045
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:20,990
and things like this anyway to come back
to 1625 this this jupiter-like planet

3046
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,000
to 1625 this this jupiter-like planet
 

3047
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,210
to 1625 this this jupiter-like planet
um had a hint of of something in the

3048
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:23,220
um had a hint of of something in the
 

3049
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:24,710
um had a hint of of something in the
data but what I mean by that is when we

3050
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
data but what I mean by that is when we
 

3051
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,630
data but what I mean by that is when we
looked at the transit we got the

3052
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:26,640
looked at the transit we got the
 

3053
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,030
looked at the transit we got the
familiar decrease in light that we

3054
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
familiar decrease in light that we
 

3055
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,230
familiar decrease in light that we
always see when a plant traps in front

3056
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:30,240
always see when a plant traps in front
 

3057
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,970
always see when a plant traps in front
of the star but we saw something extra

3058
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:31,980
of the star but we saw something extra
 

3059
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:35,089
of the star but we saw something extra
just on the edges we saw some extra dips

3060
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:35,099
just on the edges we saw some extra dips
 

3061
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,890
just on the edges we saw some extra dips
around the outside

3062
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:36,900
around the outside
 

3063
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,510
around the outside
it was right at the hairy edge of

3064
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:38,520
it was right at the hairy edge of
 

3065
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,549
it was right at the hairy edge of
detectability we didn't believe it

3066
00:54:40,549 --> 00:54:40,559
detectability we didn't believe it
 

3067
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,049
detectability we didn't believe it
because

3068
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:42,059
because
 

3069
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:44,510
because
um I think one of the challenges of

3070
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:44,520
um I think one of the challenges of
 

3071
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,150
um I think one of the challenges of
looking for something for 10 years is

3072
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,160
looking for something for 10 years is
 

3073
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,710
looking for something for 10 years is
that you become your own greatest

3074
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:48,720
that you become your own greatest
 

3075
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,049
that you become your own greatest
skeptic and no matter what you're shown

3076
00:54:51,049 --> 00:54:51,059
skeptic and no matter what you're shown
 

3077
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:53,510
skeptic and no matter what you're shown
you're always thinking I've been it's

3078
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:53,520
you're always thinking I've been it's
 

3079
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,190
you're always thinking I've been it's
like falling in love so many times and

3080
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:55,200
like falling in love so many times and
 

3081
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,910
like falling in love so many times and
it not working out you you convince

3082
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:58,920
it not working out you you convince
 

3083
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,470
it not working out you you convince
yourself it's never going to be it's

3084
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:00,480
yourself it's never going to be it's
 

3085
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,270
yourself it's never going to be it's
never going to happen not for me you

3086
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:02,280
never going to happen not for me you
 

3087
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,530
never going to happen not for me you
know this just isn't this isn't going to

3088
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:03,540
know this just isn't this isn't going to
 

3089
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,630
know this just isn't this isn't going to
happen and so I saw that and I I didn't

3090
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:05,640
happen and so I saw that and I I didn't
 

3091
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,549
happen and so I saw that and I I didn't
really believe it because I didn't dare

3092
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:07,559
really believe it because I didn't dare
 

3093
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:09,710
really believe it because I didn't dare
let myself believe it

3094
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:09,720
let myself believe it
 

3095
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,770
let myself believe it
but being a good scientist we knew we

3096
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:12,780
but being a good scientist we knew we
 

3097
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,290
but being a good scientist we knew we
had an obligation to publish it to talk

3098
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:15,300
had an obligation to publish it to talk
 

3099
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,329
had an obligation to publish it to talk
about the result and to follow it up and

3100
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:17,339
about the result and to follow it up and
 

3101
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:19,490
about the result and to follow it up and
to try and resolve what was going on

3102
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:19,500
to try and resolve what was going on
 

3103
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,710
to try and resolve what was going on
so we asked for Hubble Space Telescope

3104
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:21,720
so we asked for Hubble Space Telescope
 

3105
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,530
so we asked for Hubble Space Telescope
time which was awarded in that case that

3106
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:24,540
time which was awarded in that case that
 

3107
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,510
time which was awarded in that case that
we were one of those lucky 20 that got

3108
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:26,520
we were one of those lucky 20 that got
 

3109
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,510
we were one of those lucky 20 that got
telescope time and we started it uh for

3110
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:29,520
telescope time and we started it uh for
 

3111
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,109
telescope time and we started it uh for
about 40 hours continuously and

3112
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,119
about 40 hours continuously and
 

3113
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,870
about 40 hours continuously and
um to provide some context the dip that

3114
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:35,880
um to provide some context the dip that
 

3115
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,430
um to provide some context the dip that
we saw in the capital data correspond to

3116
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
we saw in the capital data correspond to
 

3117
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,650
we saw in the capital data correspond to
a neptune-sized moon around a

3118
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:39,660
a neptune-sized moon around a
 

3119
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,329
a neptune-sized moon around a
jupiter-sized planet which was another

3120
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:41,339
jupiter-sized planet which was another
 

3121
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:42,829
jupiter-sized planet which was another
reason why I was skeptical I was like

3122
00:55:42,829 --> 00:55:42,839
reason why I was skeptical I was like
 

3123
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,990
reason why I was skeptical I was like
that we don't have that in the solar

3124
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:45,000
that we don't have that in the solar
 

3125
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,670
that we don't have that in the solar
system that seems so strange

3126
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:46,680
system that seems so strange
 

3127
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,670
system that seems so strange
and then when we got the Hubble data it

3128
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
and then when we got the Hubble data it
 

3129
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,089
and then when we got the Hubble data it
seemed to confirm exactly that there was

3130
00:55:52,089 --> 00:55:52,099
seemed to confirm exactly that there was
 

3131
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,589
seemed to confirm exactly that there was
two really striking pieces of evidence

3132
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:54,599
two really striking pieces of evidence
 

3133
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,930
two really striking pieces of evidence
in the data that suggested this moon was

3134
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:56,940
in the data that suggested this moon was
 

3135
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:59,930
in the data that suggested this moon was
there another was a fairly clear second

3136
00:55:59,930 --> 00:55:59,940
there another was a fairly clear second
 

3137
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,089
there another was a fairly clear second
dip in light pretty clearly resolved by

3138
00:56:02,089 --> 00:56:02,099
dip in light pretty clearly resolved by
 

3139
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,710
dip in light pretty clearly resolved by
Hubble it was about a five Sigma

3140
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:03,720
Hubble it was about a five Sigma
 

3141
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,730
Hubble it was about a five Sigma
detection

3142
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:04,740
detection
 

3143
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:06,950
detection
and on top of that we could see the

3144
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:06,960
and on top of that we could see the
 

3145
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,990
and on top of that we could see the
planet didn't Transit when it should

3146
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:09,000
planet didn't Transit when it should
 

3147
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,970
planet didn't Transit when it should
have done it actually translated earlier

3148
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:10,980
have done it actually translated earlier
 

3149
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,530
have done it actually translated earlier
than we expected it to by about 20

3150
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:12,540
than we expected it to by about 20
 

3151
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,049
than we expected it to by about 20
minutes or so and so that's a Hallmark

3152
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:15,059
minutes or so and so that's a Hallmark
 

3153
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:16,609
minutes or so and so that's a Hallmark
of a gravitational interaction between

3154
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:16,619
of a gravitational interaction between
 

3155
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:17,870
of a gravitational interaction between
the planet and the moon we actually

3156
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:17,880
the planet and the moon we actually
 

3157
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,849
the planet and the moon we actually
expected that you can also expect that

3158
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:19,859
expected that you can also expect that
 

3159
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,829
expected that you can also expect that
if the moon transits after the planet

3160
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:21,839
if the moon transits after the planet
 

3161
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:24,589
if the moon transits after the planet
then the planet should come in earlier

3162
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:24,599
then the planet should come in earlier
 

3163
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:27,290
then the planet should come in earlier
than expected because the Barry Center

3164
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:27,300
than expected because the Barry Center
 

3165
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,910
than expected because the Barry Center
the center of mass lifts between the two

3166
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:28,920
the center of mass lifts between the two
 

3167
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,470
the center of mass lifts between the two
of them they're kind of like on a

3168
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
of them they're kind of like on a
 

3169
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,109
of them they're kind of like on a
balancing arm between them and so we saw

3170
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
balancing arm between them and so we saw
 

3171
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,670
balancing arm between them and so we saw
that as well so the phase signature

3172
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:34,680
that as well so the phase signature
 

3173
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,890
that as well so the phase signature
matched up the mass of the moon was

3174
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:36,900
matched up the mass of the moon was
 

3175
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,870
matched up the mass of the moon was
measured to be Neptune Mass

3176
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:38,880
measured to be Neptune Mass
 

3177
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,790
measured to be Neptune Mass
and the size of the moon was measured to

3178
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:40,800
and the size of the moon was measured to
 

3179
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,549
and the size of the moon was measured to
be Neptune radius and so everything just

3180
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:43,559
be Neptune radius and so everything just
 

3181
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:47,030
be Neptune radius and so everything just
really lined up and

3182
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,040
really lined up and
 

3183
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,549
really lined up and
um we spent months and months trying to

3184
00:56:49,549 --> 00:56:49,559
um we spent months and months trying to
 

3185
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:51,770
um we spent months and months trying to
kill it this is my strategy for anything

3186
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:51,780
kill it this is my strategy for anything
 

3187
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,109
kill it this is my strategy for anything
interesting we just try to throw the

3188
00:56:54,109 --> 00:56:54,119
interesting we just try to throw the
 

3189
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,849
interesting we just try to throw the
kitchen sink it and say we must be

3190
00:56:55,849 --> 00:56:55,859
kitchen sink it and say we must be
 

3191
00:56:55,859 --> 00:56:58,130
kitchen sink it and say we must be
tricked by something and so we tried

3192
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:58,140
tricked by something and so we tried
 

3193
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,750
tricked by something and so we tried
looking at the you know the centroid

3194
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
looking at the you know the centroid
 

3195
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,450
looking at the you know the centroid
motion of the telescope but the um the

3196
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:02,460
motion of the telescope but the um the
 

3197
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,190
motion of the telescope but the um the
different wavelength channels have been

3198
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:04,200
different wavelength channels have been
 

3199
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,470
different wavelength channels have been
observed the pixel level information and

3200
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:06,480
observed the pixel level information and
 

3201
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,849
observed the pixel level information and
no matter what we did we just couldn't

3202
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:07,859
no matter what we did we just couldn't
 

3203
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:11,210
no matter what we did we just couldn't
get rid of it and so uh we submit it to

3204
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:11,220
get rid of it and so uh we submit it to
 

3205
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,130
get rid of it and so uh we submit it to
science and I think at the time science

3206
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:13,140
science and I think at the time science
 

3207
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,750
science and I think at the time science
which is one of the top journals said to

3208
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:14,760
which is one of the top journals said to
 

3209
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,609
which is one of the top journals said to
us um would you mind calling your paper

3210
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:16,619
us um would you mind calling your paper
 

3211
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:18,589
us um would you mind calling your paper
discovery of an exomoon

3212
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:18,599
discovery of an exomoon
 

3213
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,410
discovery of an exomoon
and I had to push back and we said no

3214
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:21,420
and I had to push back and we said no
 

3215
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:24,109
and I had to push back and we said no
we're not calling it that I don't even

3216
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:24,119
we're not calling it that I don't even
 

3217
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:25,370
we're not calling it that I don't even
despite everything we've done we're not

3218
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:25,380
despite everything we've done we're not
 

3219
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,230
despite everything we've done we're not
calling a discovery we're calling it

3220
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:27,240
calling a discovery we're calling it
 

3221
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,230
calling a discovery we're calling it
evidence for an EXO Moon because for me

3222
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:30,240
evidence for an EXO Moon because for me
 

3223
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,690
evidence for an EXO Moon because for me
I'd want to see this repeat two times

3224
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:32,700
I'd want to see this repeat two times
 

3225
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,270
I'd want to see this repeat two times
three times four times before I really

3226
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
three times four times before I really
 

3227
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,970
three times four times before I really
would bet my house that this is the real

3228
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:37,980
would bet my house that this is the real
 

3229
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,430
would bet my house that this is the real
deal maybe and I do worry as I said that

3230
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:40,440
deal maybe and I do worry as I said that
 

3231
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,950
deal maybe and I do worry as I said that
perhaps that's my own skepticism

3232
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:41,960
perhaps that's my own skepticism
 

3233
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,410
perhaps that's my own skepticism
self-septicism going too far but

3234
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:45,420
self-septicism going too far but
 

3235
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,630
self-septicism going too far but
um I think it was the right decision and

3236
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:47,640
um I think it was the right decision and
 

3237
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,329
um I think it was the right decision and
since that paper came out there has been

3238
00:57:50,329 --> 00:57:50,339
since that paper came out there has been
 

3239
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:51,970
since that paper came out there has been
continuous interest in this object

3240
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:51,980
continuous interest in this object
 

3241
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,130
continuous interest in this object
another team independently analyzed that

3242
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:55,140
another team independently analyzed that
 

3243
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,290
another team independently analyzed that
star and recovered actually pretty much

3244
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:57,300
star and recovered actually pretty much
 

3245
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,849
star and recovered actually pretty much
exactly the same resources us the same

3246
00:57:58,849 --> 00:57:58,859
exactly the same resources us the same
 

3247
00:57:58,859 --> 00:58:01,730
exactly the same resources us the same
dip the same the same wobble of the

3248
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:01,740
dip the same the same wobble of the
 

3249
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,010
dip the same the same wobble of the
planet and a third team looked at it and

3250
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:04,020
planet and a third team looked at it and
 

3251
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,910
planet and a third team looked at it and
they actually got something different

3252
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:04,920
they actually got something different
 

3253
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,190
they actually got something different
they saw the dip was diminished compared

3254
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,200
they saw the dip was diminished compared
 

3255
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,930
they saw the dip was diminished compared
to what we saw they saw a little hint of

3256
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:08,940
to what we saw they saw a little hint of
 

3257
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,549
to what we saw they saw a little hint of
a dip but not as pronounced as what we

3258
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:10,559
a dip but not as pronounced as what we
 

3259
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,030
a dip but not as pronounced as what we
saw and they saw the wobble as well so

3260
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:14,040
saw and they saw the wobble as well so
 

3261
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,430
saw and they saw the wobble as well so
there's been a little bit of tension

3262
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:16,440
there's been a little bit of tension
 

3263
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:17,410
there's been a little bit of tension
about

3264
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:17,420
about
 

3265
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,270
about
analyzing the reduction of the Hubble

3266
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:20,280
analyzing the reduction of the Hubble
 

3267
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,650
analyzing the reduction of the Hubble
data

3268
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:21,660
data
 

3269
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,630
data
um and so the only way in my mind to

3270
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:23,640
um and so the only way in my mind to
 

3271
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,390
um and so the only way in my mind to
resolve this is just to look again we

3272
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:26,400
resolve this is just to look again we
 

3273
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,190
resolve this is just to look again we
actually did propose to Hubble straight

3274
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:28,200
actually did propose to Hubble straight
 

3275
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,950
actually did propose to Hubble straight
after that and we said look if our model

3276
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:30,960
after that and we said look if our model
 

3277
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,829
after that and we said look if our model
is right if the moon is there it came in

3278
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:33,839
is right if the moon is there it came in
 

3279
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,010
is right if the moon is there it came in
late last time it transited after the

3280
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:37,020
late last time it transited after the
 

3281
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,930
late last time it transited after the
planet because of the orbit we can

3282
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:38,940
planet because of the orbit we can
 

3283
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,670
planet because of the orbit we can
calculate that it should Transit before

3284
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:40,680
calculate that it should Transit before
 

3285
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,890
calculate that it should Transit before
the planet next time

3286
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:42,900
the planet next time
 

3287
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:44,690
the planet next time
if it's not there if it doesn't Transit

3288
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:44,700
if it's not there if it doesn't Transit
 

3289
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,250
if it's not there if it doesn't Transit
before and if we even if we see a dip

3290
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:46,260
before and if we even if we see a dip
 

3291
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,990
before and if we even if we see a dip
afterwards we know that's not our moon

3292
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,000
afterwards we know that's not our moon
 

3293
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,370
afterwards we know that's not our moon
it's obviously some instrumental effect

3294
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:49,380
it's obviously some instrumental effect
 

3295
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,950
it's obviously some instrumental effect
with the data we had a causal prediction

3296
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:51,960
with the data we had a causal prediction
 

3297
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,069
with the data we had a causal prediction
as to where the moon should be and so I

3298
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:55,079
as to where the moon should be and so I
 

3299
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:56,329
as to where the moon should be and so I
was really excited about that but we

3300
00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:56,339
was really excited about that but we
 

3301
00:58:56,339 --> 00:58:58,309
was really excited about that but we
didn't get the telescope time and

3302
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
didn't get the telescope time and
 

3303
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,230
didn't get the telescope time and
unfortunately if you go further into the

3304
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:00,240
unfortunately if you go further into the
 

3305
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,270
unfortunately if you go further into the
future we no longer have the predictive

3306
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:02,280
future we no longer have the predictive
 

3307
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,010
future we no longer have the predictive
capability because it's like predicting

3308
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:04,020
capability because it's like predicting
 

3309
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,030
capability because it's like predicting
the weather you might be able to predict

3310
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:05,040
the weather you might be able to predict
 

3311
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,069
the weather you might be able to predict
the weather next week to some level of

3312
00:59:07,069 --> 00:59:07,079
the weather next week to some level of
 

3313
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:08,690
the weather next week to some level of
accuracy but predicting the weather next

3314
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:08,700
accuracy but predicting the weather next
 

3315
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,089
accuracy but predicting the weather next
year becomes incredibly hard the

3316
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:11,099
year becomes incredibly hard the
 

3317
00:59:11,099 --> 00:59:13,370
year becomes incredibly hard the
uncertainties just grow and compound as

3318
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:13,380
uncertainties just grow and compound as
 

3319
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,930
uncertainties just grow and compound as
you go forward into the future more and

3320
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:14,940
you go forward into the future more and
 

3321
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,670
you go forward into the future more and
more how are you able to know where

3322
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:16,680
more how are you able to know where
 

3323
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,710
more how are you able to know where
where the move would be positioned so

3324
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:18,720
where the move would be positioned so
 

3325
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,789
where the move would be positioned so
you're able to tell the the

3326
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:21,799
you're able to tell the the
 

3327
00:59:21,799 --> 00:59:25,910
you're able to tell the the
orbiting like geometry and and frequency

3328
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
orbiting like geometry and and frequency
 

3329
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,309
orbiting like geometry and and frequency
yeah so from the uh basically from the

3330
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
yeah so from the uh basically from the
 

3331
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,130
yeah so from the uh basically from the
wobbles of the planet itself that tells

3332
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:31,140
wobbles of the planet itself that tells
 

3333
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,490
wobbles of the planet itself that tells
us the orbital motion of the moon it's

3334
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:34,500
us the orbital motion of the moon it's
 

3335
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,990
us the orbital motion of the moon it's
the reflex motion of the moon but isn't

3336
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,000
the reflex motion of the moon but isn't
 

3337
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,849
the reflex motion of the moon but isn't
the planet isn't it just an estimate to

3338
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:37,859
the planet isn't it just an estimate to
 

3339
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:39,530
the planet isn't it just an estimate to
where

3340
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:39,540
where
 

3341
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,690
where
like I'm concerned about you making a

3342
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:41,700
like I'm concerned about you making a
 

3343
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,309
like I'm concerned about you making a
strong prediction here because like if

3344
00:59:43,309 --> 00:59:43,319
strong prediction here because like if
 

3345
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:44,450
strong prediction here because like if
you don't get

3346
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:44,460
you don't get
 

3347
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:46,670
you don't get
if you don't uh get the moon where the

3348
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:46,680
if you don't uh get the moon where the
 

3349
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,650
if you don't uh get the moon where the
moon leads on the next time around if

3350
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:48,660
moon leads on the next time around if
 

3351
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,329
moon leads on the next time around if
you did get Hubble time couldn't that

3352
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:50,339
you did get Hubble time couldn't that
 

3353
00:59:50,339 --> 00:59:51,589
you did get Hubble time couldn't that
mean something else if you didn't see

3354
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:51,599
mean something else if you didn't see
 

3355
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,990
mean something else if you didn't see
that like because you said it would be

3356
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:54,000
that like because you said it would be
 

3357
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,650
that like because you said it would be
an instrumental I feel I I feel

3358
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:57,660
an instrumental I feel I I feel
 

3359
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:58,730
an instrumental I feel I I feel
um

3360
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:58,740
um
 

3361
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,150
um
the strong urge to disprove your which

3362
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:02,160
the strong urge to disprove your which
 

3363
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,490
the strong urge to disprove your which
is a really good uh imperative it's a

3364
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:04,500
is a really good uh imperative it's a
 

3365
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,890
is a really good uh imperative it's a
good way to do science but like uh this

3366
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:06,900
good way to do science but like uh this
 

3367
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,950
good way to do science but like uh this
is such a noisy signal right or blurry

3368
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:09,960
is such a noisy signal right or blurry
 

3369
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,470
is such a noisy signal right or blurry
signal maybe yeah low resolution signal

3370
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:12,480
signal maybe yeah low resolution signal
 

3371
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,549
signal maybe yeah low resolution signal
maybe that's the but yeah I mean it's

3372
01:00:13,549 --> 01:00:13,559
maybe that's the but yeah I mean it's
 

3373
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,109
maybe that's the but yeah I mean it's
it's a five Sigma signal so that's

3374
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
it's a five Sigma signal so that's
 

3375
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,210
it's a five Sigma signal so that's
that's at the slightly uncomfortable

3376
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:17,220
that's at the slightly uncomfortable
 

3377
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,130
that's at the slightly uncomfortable
Edge I mean it's often said that for any

3378
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:19,140
Edge I mean it's often said that for any
 

3379
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,289
Edge I mean it's often said that for any
detection of a first new phenomena

3380
01:00:21,289 --> 01:00:21,299
detection of a first new phenomena
 

3381
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:23,809
detection of a first new phenomena
you really want like a 20 25 segment

3382
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:23,819
you really want like a 20 25 segment
 

3383
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:25,789
you really want like a 20 25 segment
detection then there's just no doubt

3384
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:25,799
detection then there's just no doubt
 

3385
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:28,250
detection then there's just no doubt
that what you're seeing is Real This was

3386
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:28,260
that what you're seeing is Real This was
 

3387
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:29,569
that what you're seeing is Real This was
at that edge I mean I guess it's

3388
01:00:29,569 --> 01:00:29,579
at that edge I mean I guess it's
 

3389
01:00:29,579 --> 01:00:31,069
at that edge I mean I guess it's
comparable to the Higgs boson but the

3390
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:31,079
comparable to the Higgs boson but the
 

3391
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:32,030
comparable to the Higgs boson but the
Higgs boson was slightly different

3392
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,040
Higgs boson was slightly different
 

3393
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,230
Higgs boson was slightly different
because there was so much theoretical

3394
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:33,240
because there was so much theoretical
 

3395
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,230
because there was so much theoretical
impetuses to expect a signal at that

3396
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:36,240
impetuses to expect a signal at that
 

3397
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,150
impetuses to expect a signal at that
precise location

3398
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
precise location
 

3399
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,589
precise location
um a neptune-sized moon was not

3400
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:39,599
um a neptune-sized moon was not
 

3401
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,750
um a neptune-sized moon was not
predicted by anyone no one there's no

3402
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:41,760
predicted by anyone no one there's no
 

3403
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,150
predicted by anyone no one there's no
papers you can find that expect

3404
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:43,160
papers you can find that expect
 

3405
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,049
papers you can find that expect
neptune-sized moons around Jupiter sized

3406
01:00:45,049 --> 01:00:45,059
neptune-sized moons around Jupiter sized
 

3407
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,490
neptune-sized moons around Jupiter sized
planets so there was I think we were

3408
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:46,500
planets so there was I think we were
 

3409
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,230
planets so there was I think we were
inherently skeptical about its reality

3410
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
inherently skeptical about its reality
 

3411
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,970
inherently skeptical about its reality
for that reason

3412
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:49,980
for that reason
 

3413
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,650
for that reason
um but this is science in action and

3414
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:51,660
um but this is science in action and
 

3415
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,349
um but this is science in action and
when we we you know we fit the wobbles

3416
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:54,359
when we we you know we fit the wobbles
 

3417
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,049
when we we you know we fit the wobbles
we fit the dips and we we have this 3G

3418
01:00:57,049 --> 01:00:57,059
we fit the dips and we we have this 3G
 

3419
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:58,789
we fit the dips and we we have this 3G
geometric model for the motion of the

3420
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
geometric model for the motion of the
 

3421
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,730
geometric model for the motion of the
orbit and projecting that forward we

3422
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:01,740
orbit and projecting that forward we
 

3423
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,650
orbit and projecting that forward we
were we found that about 80 percent of

3424
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:03,660
were we found that about 80 percent of
 

3425
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,450
were we found that about 80 percent of
our projections led to the Moon to be

3426
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:05,460
our projections led to the Moon to be
 

3427
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,609
our projections led to the Moon to be
before so it's not 100 sure there is

3428
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:07,619
before so it's not 100 sure there is
 

3429
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:09,589
before so it's not 100 sure there is
there was maybe 20 of the cases it was

3430
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:09,599
there was maybe 20 of the cases it was
 

3431
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,990
there was maybe 20 of the cases it was
over here but to me that was a hard

3432
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,000
over here but to me that was a hard
 

3433
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,589
over here but to me that was a hard
enough uh a hard enough projection that

3434
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:15,599
enough uh a hard enough projection that
 

3435
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,109
enough uh a hard enough projection that
we felt confident that we could refute

3436
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:18,119
we felt confident that we could refute
 

3437
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:19,730
we felt confident that we could refute
the X which was what I really wanted I

3438
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:19,740
the X which was what I really wanted I
 

3439
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,770
the X which was what I really wanted I
wanted a refutable that's the best of

3440
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:21,780
wanted a refutable that's the best of
 

3441
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,349
wanted a refutable that's the best of
science a falsifiable hypothesis how can

3442
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:24,359
science a falsifiable hypothesis how can
 

3443
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:25,549
science a falsifiable hypothesis how can
you make progress in science if you

3444
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:25,559
you make progress in science if you
 

3445
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:26,750
you make progress in science if you
don't have a phosifiable testable

3446
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:26,760
don't have a phosifiable testable
 

3447
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,609
don't have a phosifiable testable
hypothesis and so that was the the

3448
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:28,619
hypothesis and so that was the the
 

3449
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:31,190
hypothesis and so that was the the
beauty of this particular case so

3450
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
beauty of this particular case so
 

3451
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,870
beauty of this particular case so
there's a numerical simulation with the

3452
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:32,880
there's a numerical simulation with the
 

3453
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,829
there's a numerical simulation with the
Moon

3454
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839
Moon
 

3455
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,750
Moon
uh that fits the data that we observed

3456
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:35,760
uh that fits the data that we observed
 

3457
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,130
uh that fits the data that we observed
and then you can now make predictions

3458
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:37,140
and then you can now make predictions
 

3459
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:39,829
and then you can now make predictions
based on that simulation yeah

3460
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:39,839
based on that simulation yeah
 

3461
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:42,829
based on that simulation yeah
that's so cool okay it's fun these are

3462
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:42,839
that's so cool okay it's fun these are
 

3463
01:01:42,839 --> 01:01:43,970
that's so cool okay it's fun these are
like little

3464
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:43,980
like little
 

3465
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,710
like little
solar systems that we can simulate on

3466
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:45,720
solar systems that we can simulate on
 

3467
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,770
solar systems that we can simulate on
the computer and imagine their motions

3468
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:48,780
the computer and imagine their motions
 

3469
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,030
the computer and imagine their motions
um but

3470
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:50,040
um but
 

3471
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,130
um but
we are we are pushing things to the very

3472
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:52,140
we are we are pushing things to the very
 

3473
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:53,750
we are we are pushing things to the very
limits of what's possible and that's

3474
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:53,760
limits of what's possible and that's
 

3475
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,789
limits of what's possible and that's
double-edged sword it's both incredibly

3476
01:01:55,789 --> 01:01:55,799
double-edged sword it's both incredibly
 

3477
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:58,609
double-edged sword it's both incredibly
exciting intellectually but you're

3478
01:01:58,609 --> 01:01:58,619
exciting intellectually but you're
 

3479
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,250
exciting intellectually but you're
always you're always risking to some

3480
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:01,260
always you're always risking to some
 

3481
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,430
always you're always risking to some
degree the pushing too far so I'd like

3482
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:04,440
degree the pushing too far so I'd like
 

3483
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,530
degree the pushing too far so I'd like
to ask you about the uh the the recent

3484
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:06,540
to ask you about the uh the the recent
 

3485
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,630
to ask you about the uh the the recent
paper you co-authored an excellent

3486
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:08,640
paper you co-authored an excellent
 

3487
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,930
paper you co-authored an excellent
survey of 70 cool giant exoplanets and

3488
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:11,940
survey of 70 cool giant exoplanets and
 

3489
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,530
survey of 70 cool giant exoplanets and
the new candidate coupler 1708 bi I

3490
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:15,540
the new candidate coupler 1708 bi I
 

3491
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,670
the new candidate coupler 1708 bi I
would say this I'd say there's like

3492
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:16,680
would say this I'd say there's like
 

3493
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,170
would say this I'd say there's like
three or four candidates at this point

3494
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:18,180
three or four candidates at this point
 

3495
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,910
three or four candidates at this point
of which we have published two of them

3496
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:19,920
of which we have published two of them
 

3497
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,170
of which we have published two of them
uh and to me uh to a quote uh compelling

3498
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:24,180
uh and to me uh to a quote uh compelling
 

3499
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,170
uh and to me uh to a quote uh compelling
and deserve follow-up observations

3500
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:27,180
and deserve follow-up observations
 

3501
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,589
and deserve follow-up observations
um and so there are to get a confirmed

3502
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:30,599
um and so there are to get a confirmed
 

3503
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:31,849
um and so there are to get a confirmed
detection at least in our case we would

3504
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:31,859
detection at least in our case we would
 

3505
01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:33,829
detection at least in our case we would
need to see it repeat for sure one of

3506
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:33,839
need to see it repeat for sure one of
 

3507
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:34,970
need to see it repeat for sure one of
the problems with the some of the other

3508
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:34,980
the problems with the some of the other
 

3509
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,530
the problems with the some of the other
methods that have been proposed is that

3510
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:36,540
methods that have been proposed is that
 

3511
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,809
methods that have been proposed is that
you don't get that repeatability so for

3512
01:02:38,809 --> 01:02:38,819
you don't get that repeatability so for
 

3513
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:40,670
you don't get that repeatability so for
instance an example of a technique that

3514
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:40,680
instance an example of a technique that
 

3515
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,930
instance an example of a technique that
would lack that would be gravitational

3516
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:41,940
would lack that would be gravitational
 

3517
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,329
would lack that would be gravitational
micro lensing so it is possible with a

3518
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:44,339
micro lensing so it is possible with a
 

3519
01:02:44,339 --> 01:02:46,789
micro lensing so it is possible with a
new telescope coming up in the future

3520
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:46,799
new telescope coming up in the future
 

3521
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,349
new telescope coming up in the future
um called the Roman Space Telescope

3522
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:48,359
um called the Roman Space Telescope
 

3523
01:02:48,359 --> 01:02:50,690
um called the Roman Space Telescope
which is basically a repurposed by a

3524
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:50,700
which is basically a repurposed by a
 

3525
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,670
which is basically a repurposed by a
satellite that's the size of the Hubble

3526
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:52,680
satellite that's the size of the Hubble
 

3527
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:56,089

mirror going up into space it will stare

3528
01:02:56,089 --> 01:02:56,099
mirror going up into space it will stare
 

3529
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:58,849
mirror going up into space it will stare
at millions of stars simultaneously and

3530
01:02:58,849 --> 01:02:58,859
at millions of stars simultaneously and
 

3531
01:02:58,859 --> 01:03:00,349
at millions of stars simultaneously and
it will look to see instead of whether

3532
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:00,359
it will look to see instead of whether
 

3533
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,990
it will look to see instead of whether
any of those stars get dimmer for a

3534
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:03,000
any of those stars get dimmer for a
 

3535
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,549
any of those stars get dimmer for a
short amount of time which would be a

3536
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:04,559
short amount of time which would be a
 

3537
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,410
short amount of time which would be a
Transit it'll look for the opposite

3538
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:06,420
Transit it'll look for the opposite
 

3539
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,609
Transit it'll look for the opposite
it'll look to see if anything can get

3540
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:07,619
it'll look to see if anything can get
 

3541
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:09,829
it'll look to see if anything can get
brighter and that brightness increase is

3542
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:09,839
brighter and that brightness increase is
 

3543
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,510
brighter and that brightness increase is
caused by another planetary system

3544
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:11,520
caused by another planetary system
 

3545
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,609
caused by another planetary system
passing in front and then

3546
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:13,619
passing in front and then
 

3547
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:16,250
passing in front and then
gravitationally lensing light around it

3548
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:16,260
gravitationally lensing light around it
 

3549
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,589
gravitationally lensing light around it
to cause a brightening and so this is a

3550
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:18,599
to cause a brightening and so this is a
 

3551
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:21,349
to cause a brightening and so this is a
method of discovering an entire solar

3552
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
method of discovering an entire solar
 

3553
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,410
method of discovering an entire solar

01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,280
complicated and so there's many many
 

3571
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,430
complicated and so there's many many

01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:07,500
then we could predict its mass its

then we could predict its mass its
particular motion and expect it to be

01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:34,980
the moon will look like this and we can
 

3623
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:36,349
the moon will look like this and we can
actually capture that image and that's

3624
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:36,359
actually capture that image and that's
 

3625
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:37,670
actually capture that image and that's
what we see with of course many EXO

3626
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:37,680
what we see with of course many EXO
 

3627
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,990
what we see with of course many EXO
players so we want to get to that same

3628
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:39,000
players so we want to get to that same
 

3629
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,150
players so we want to get to that same
point of full confidence full

3630
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:41,160
point of full confidence full
 

3631
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,609
point of full confidence full
confirmation the slam dunk detection of

3632
01:04:43,609 --> 01:04:43,619
confirmation the slam dunk detection of
 

3633
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:45,589
confirmation the slam dunk detection of
these EXO moons but

3634
01:04:45,589 --> 01:04:45,599
these EXO moons but
 

3635
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,349
these EXO moons but
um yeah it's it's been a a hell of a

3636
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:48,359
um yeah it's it's been a a hell of a
 

3637
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:52,130
um yeah it's it's been a a hell of a
journey to try and push the field into

3638
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:52,140
journey to try and push the field into
 

3639
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,410
journey to try and push the field into
that direction and

3640
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:54,420
that direction and
 

3641
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,730
that direction and
um there's some resistance to the

3642
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:55,740
um there's some resistance to the
 

3643
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,770
um there's some resistance to the
transit method not to the transmit I

3644
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:57,780
transit method not to the transmit I
 

3645
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,569
transit method not to the transmit I
just say to EXO means so the transit

3646
01:04:59,569 --> 01:04:59,579
just say to EXO means so the transit
 

3647
01:04:59,579 --> 01:05:01,370
just say to EXO means so the transit
method is by far the most what the most

3648
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:01,380
method is by far the most what the most
 

3649
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:02,809
method is by far the most what the most
popular method for looking for EXO

3650
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:02,819
popular method for looking for EXO
 

3651
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,870
popular method for looking for EXO
planets but um yeah as I've alluded to

3652
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:05,880
planets but um yeah as I've alluded to
 

3653
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,109
planets but um yeah as I've alluded to
EXO moons is is kind of a niche topic

3654
01:05:09,109 --> 01:05:09,119
EXO moons is is kind of a niche topic
 

3655
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,569
EXO moons is is kind of a niche topic
within the discipline of exoplanets and

3656
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:11,579
within the discipline of exoplanets and
 

3657
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:14,630
within the discipline of exoplanets and
that's largely because there are people

3658
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:14,640
that's largely because there are people
 

3659
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,069
that's largely because there are people
I think are waiting for those slime

3660
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:16,079
I think are waiting for those slime
 

3661
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,950
I think are waiting for those slime
dunks and it was like the if you go back

3662
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
dunks and it was like the if you go back
 

3663
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,930
dunks and it was like the if you go back
to the first exoplanet discovery that

3664
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:20,940
to the first exoplanet discovery that
 

3665
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,390
to the first exoplanet discovery that
was made in 1995 by Misha mayor and

3666
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:23,400
was made in 1995 by Misha mayor and
 

3667
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,130
was made in 1995 by Misha mayor and
Didier colors

3668
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:25,140
Didier colors
 

3669
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,170
Didier colors
um I think it's true at the time that

3670
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:27,180
um I think it's true at the time that
 

3671
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:29,569
um I think it's true at the time that
they were seen as Mavericks that the

3672
01:05:29,569 --> 01:05:29,579
they were seen as Mavericks that the
 

3673
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:31,309
they were seen as Mavericks that the
idea of looking for plants around Stars

3674
01:05:31,309 --> 01:05:31,319
idea of looking for plants around Stars
 

3675
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:34,250
idea of looking for plants around Stars
was considered fringe science and you

3676
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:34,260
was considered fringe science and you
 

3677
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:35,750
was considered fringe science and you
know I'm sure many colleagues told them

3678
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:35,760
know I'm sure many colleagues told them
 

3679
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,730
know I'm sure many colleagues told them
why don't you do something more safe

3680
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:37,740
why don't you do something more safe
 

3681
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:40,069
why don't you do something more safe
like study eclipsing stars to binary

3682
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:40,079
like study eclipsing stars to binary
 

3683
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,930
like study eclipsing stars to binary
star systems we know those exist so why

3684
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:41,940
star systems we know those exist so why
 

3685
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,130
star systems we know those exist so why
are you wasting your time looking for

3686
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:43,140
are you wasting your time looking for
 

3687
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,410
are you wasting your time looking for
planets you're going to get this

3688
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:45,420
planets you're going to get this
 

3689
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,450
planets you're going to get this
um alien moniker or something thing can

3690
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:47,460
um alien moniker or something thing can
 

3691
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:48,829
um alien moniker or something thing can
you be you'll be seen as a fringe

3692
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:48,839
you be you'll be seen as a fringe
 

3693
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,289
you be you'll be seen as a fringe
Maverick scientist and so I think it was

3694
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:51,299
Maverick scientist and so I think it was
 

3695
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:52,670
Maverick scientist and so I think it was
quite difficult for those early Planet

3696
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:52,680
quite difficult for those early Planet
 

3697
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,849
quite difficult for those early Planet
Hunters to get legitimacy and be taken

3698
01:05:55,849 --> 01:05:55,859
Hunters to get legitimacy and be taken
 

3699
01:05:55,859 --> 01:05:58,130
Hunters to get legitimacy and be taken
seriously and so very few people risked

3700
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:58,140
seriously and so very few people risked
 

3701
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,809
seriously and so very few people risked
their careers to do it except for those

3702
01:05:59,809 --> 01:05:59,819
their careers to do it except for those
 

3703
01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:02,390
their careers to do it except for those
that were either emboldened to try or

3704
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:02,400
that were either emboldened to try or
 

3705
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,109
that were either emboldened to try or
had maybe the career uh maybe like a

3706
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:06,119
had maybe the career uh maybe like a
 

3707
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:07,370
had maybe the career uh maybe like a
tenure or something so they didn't have

3708
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:07,380
tenure or something so they didn't have
 

3709
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,450
tenure or something so they didn't have
to necessarily worry about the

3710
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:08,460
to necessarily worry about the
 

3711
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,150
to necessarily worry about the
implications of failure and so

3712
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:11,160
implications of failure and so
 

3713
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,950
implications of failure and so
once that happened once they made the

3714
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
once that happened once they made the
 

3715
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,470
once that happened once they made the
first discoveries overnight

3716
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:15,480
first discoveries overnight
 

3717
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,390
first discoveries overnight
you know everyone and their dog was

3718
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:17,400
you know everyone and their dog was
 

3719
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,309
you know everyone and their dog was
gunning into exoplas and all of a sudden

3720
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:19,319
gunning into exoplas and all of a sudden
 

3721
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:20,930
gunning into exoplas and all of a sudden
the whole you know the whole astronomy

3722
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:20,940
the whole you know the whole astronomy
 

3723
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,089
the whole you know the whole astronomy
Community shifted and huge numbers of

3724
01:06:23,089 --> 01:06:23,099
Community shifted and huge numbers of
 

3725
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:24,829
Community shifted and huge numbers of
people that were Once Upon a Time

3726
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:24,839
people that were Once Upon a Time
 

3727
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:26,450
people that were Once Upon a Time
studying eclipse and binaries you know

3728
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:26,460
studying eclipse and binaries you know
 

3729
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,490
studying eclipse and binaries you know
changed to becoming exoplat scientists

3730
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:28,500
changed to becoming exoplat scientists
 

3731
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,049
changed to becoming exoplat scientists
and so that was the first wave of

3732
01:06:30,049 --> 01:06:30,059
and so that was the first wave of
 

3733
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:32,210
and so that was the first wave of
exoplanet scientists we're now in a kind

3734
01:06:32,210 --> 01:06:32,220
exoplanet scientists we're now in a kind
 

3735
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:34,069
exoplanet scientists we're now in a kind
of a second wave or in the third wave

3736
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
of a second wave or in the third wave
 

3737
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,309
of a second wave or in the third wave
where people like me to some degree kind

3738
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:37,319
where people like me to some degree kind
 

3739
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:39,049
where people like me to some degree kind
of grew up with the idea of exoplanets

3740
01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:39,059
of grew up with the idea of exoplanets
 

3741
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:41,329
of grew up with the idea of exoplanets
as being normal you know I was 11 years

3742
01:06:41,329 --> 01:06:41,339
as being normal you know I was 11 years
 

3743
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:42,890
as being normal you know I was 11 years
old I guess when the first exploit was

3744
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:42,900
old I guess when the first exploit was
 

3745
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,430
old I guess when the first exploit was
discovered and so to me it was a fairly

3746
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:45,440
discovered and so to me it was a fairly
 

3747
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,190
discovered and so to me it was a fairly
uh normal idea to grow up with and so

3748
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
uh normal idea to grow up with and so
 

3749
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,549
uh normal idea to grow up with and so
we've been trained in the exoplanets

3750
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:52,559
we've been trained in the exoplanets
 

3751
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,470
we've been trained in the exoplanets
from the very beginning and so that

3752
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:54,480
from the very beginning and so that
 

3753
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,370
from the very beginning and so that
brings

3754
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:55,380
brings
 

3755
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,010
brings
a different perspective to those who

3756
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:58,020
a different perspective to those who
 

3757
01:06:58,020 --> 01:06:59,990
a different perspective to those who
have maybe transitioned from a different

3758
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:00,000
have maybe transitioned from a different
 

3759
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,670
have maybe transitioned from a different
career path

3760
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:01,680
career path
 

3761
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,970
career path
um and so I suspect with EXO moons and

3762
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:04,980
um and so I suspect with EXO moons and
 

3763
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:07,670
um and so I suspect with EXO moons and
probably techno signatures uh

3764
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,680
probably techno signatures uh
 

3765
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,069
probably techno signatures uh
astrobiology many of the topics which

3766
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:10,079
astrobiology many of the topics which
 

3767
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,069
astrobiology many of the topics which
are seen at the the fringes of what's

3768
01:07:13,069 --> 01:07:13,079
are seen at the the fringes of what's
 

3769
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:14,510
are seen at the the fringes of what's
possible

3770
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:14,520
possible
 

3771
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,250
possible
they will all open up into becoming

3772
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:16,260
they will all open up into becoming
 

3773
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,589
they will all open up into becoming
mainstream one day but every there's a

3774
01:07:18,589 --> 01:07:18,599
mainstream one day but every there's a
 

3775
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:20,750
mainstream one day but every there's a
lot of people who are just waiting uh

3776
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:20,760
lot of people who are just waiting uh
 

3777
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,809
lot of people who are just waiting uh
waiting for that that assuredness that

3778
01:07:23,809 --> 01:07:23,819
waiting for that that assuredness that
 

3779
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:26,809
waiting for that that assuredness that
there is a secure career net ahead of

3780
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:26,819
there is a secure career net ahead of
 

3781
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:29,390
there is a secure career net ahead of
them before they commit yeah it does

3782
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:29,400
them before they commit yeah it does
 

3783
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,510
them before they commit yeah it does
seem to me that Exxon moons open

3784
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:32,520
seem to me that Exxon moons open
 

3785
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,970
seem to me that Exxon moons open
wider or open for the first time the

3786
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:34,980
wider or open for the first time the
 

3787
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:38,390
wider or open for the first time the
door to to aliens so more seriously

3788
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:38,400
door to to aliens so more seriously
 

3789
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,069
door to to aliens so more seriously
academically studying all right let's

3790
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:40,079
academically studying all right let's
 

3791
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,370
academically studying all right let's
let's look at like alien worlds like so

3792
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:43,380
let's look at like alien worlds like so
 

3793
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,349
let's look at like alien worlds like so
um I think it's still pretty fringe to

3794
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:45,359
um I think it's still pretty fringe to
 

3795
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,150
um I think it's still pretty fringe to
talk about alien life even though like

3796
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:47,160
talk about alien life even though like
 

3797
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,829
talk about alien life even though like
on Mars and the moons and so on you're

3798
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:48,839
on Mars and the moons and so on you're
 

3799
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,089
on Mars and the moons and so on you're
kind of like

3800
01:07:50,089 --> 01:07:50,099
kind of like
 

3801
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:52,190
kind of like
you know you'll be nice but imagine the

3802
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:52,200
you know you'll be nice but imagine the
 

3803
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,410
you know you'll be nice but imagine the
first time to discover a living organism

3804
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:54,420
first time to discover a living organism
 

3805
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:56,390
first time to discover a living organism
that's going to change

3806
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:56,400
that's going to change
 

3807
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,490
that's going to change
then everybody would look like an idiot

3808
01:07:58,490 --> 01:07:58,500
then everybody would look like an idiot
 

3809
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,950
then everybody would look like an idiot
for not focusing everything on this

3810
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:00,960
for not focusing everything on this
 

3811
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,809
for not focusing everything on this
because the the possibility of the

3812
01:08:02,809 --> 01:08:02,819
because the the possibility of the
 

3813
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:04,670
because the the possibility of the
things will it's possible it might it

3814
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:04,680
things will it's possible it might it
 

3815
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,890
things will it's possible it might it
might be super boring it might be very

3816
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:06,900
might be super boring it might be very
 

3817
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,049
might be super boring it might be very
boring bacteria but even the existence

3818
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:09,059
boring bacteria but even the existence
 

3819
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,109
boring bacteria but even the existence
of life elsewhere yeah some I mean that

3820
01:08:12,109 --> 01:08:12,119
of life elsewhere yeah some I mean that
 

3821
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:13,490
of life elsewhere yeah some I mean that
changes everything that means life is

3822
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:13,500
changes everything that means life is
 

3823
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,650
changes everything that means life is
everywhere yeah if you knew now that in

3824
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:15,660
everywhere yeah if you knew now that in
 

3825
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,289
everywhere yeah if you knew now that in
five years ten years the first life

3826
01:08:18,289 --> 01:08:18,299
five years ten years the first life
 

3827
01:08:18,299 --> 01:08:20,150
five years ten years the first life
would be discovered elsewhere you need

3828
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:20,160
would be discovered elsewhere you need
 

3829
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,090
would be discovered elsewhere you need
that in advance it would surely affect

3830
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:23,100
that in advance it would surely affect
 

3831
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,829
that in advance it would surely affect
the way you approach your entire career

3832
01:08:24,829 --> 01:08:24,839
the way you approach your entire career
 

3833
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:26,329
the way you approach your entire career
as a especially someone Junior and

3834
01:08:26,329 --> 01:08:26,339
as a especially someone Junior and
 

3835
01:08:26,339 --> 01:08:27,890
as a especially someone Junior and
astronomy you would surely be like well

3836
01:08:27,890 --> 01:08:27,900
astronomy you would surely be like well
 

3837
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,150
astronomy you would surely be like well
this is clearly going to be the

3838
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:29,160
this is clearly going to be the
 

3839
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,010
this is clearly going to be the
direction we have to dedicate my classes

3840
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:31,020
direction we have to dedicate my classes
 

3841
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,530
direction we have to dedicate my classes
and my training and my education towards

3842
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:33,540
and my training and my education towards
 

3843
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,630
and my training and my education towards
that direction all the new textbooks all

3844
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:35,640
that direction all the new textbooks all
 

3845
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,390
that direction all the new textbooks all
the yeah that's right written I mean uh

3846
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400
the yeah that's right written I mean uh
 

3847
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,309
the yeah that's right written I mean uh
and I think there's a lot of value to

3848
01:08:40,309 --> 01:08:40,319
and I think there's a lot of value to
 

3849
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,809
and I think there's a lot of value to
hedging like allocating some of the time

3850
01:08:43,809 --> 01:08:43,819
hedging like allocating some of the time
 

3851
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,610
hedging like allocating some of the time
to that possibility because the kind of

3852
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:46,620
to that possibility because the kind of
 

3853
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,530
to that possibility because the kind of
Discovery will the kind of discoveries

3854
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:48,540
Discovery will the kind of discoveries
 

3855
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,769
Discovery will the kind of discoveries
we might get in the next few decades

3856
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:51,779
we might get in the next few decades
 

3857
01:08:51,779 --> 01:08:53,329
we might get in the next few decades
um it feels what like we're on the verge

3858
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:53,339
um it feels what like we're on the verge
 

3859
01:08:53,339 --> 01:08:56,510
um it feels what like we're on the verge
of a lot of getting a lot of really good

3860
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:56,520
of a lot of getting a lot of really good
 

3861
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,390
of a lot of getting a lot of really good
data and having better and better tools

3862
01:08:59,390 --> 01:08:59,400
data and having better and better tools
 

3863
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,829
data and having better and better tools
that can process that data so there's

3864
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:00,839
that can process that data so there's
 

3865
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:02,570
that can process that data so there's
just going to be a continuous increase

3866
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:02,580
just going to be a continuous increase
 

3867
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,189
just going to be a continuous increase
of the kind of discoveries that will

3868
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:04,199
of the kind of discoveries that will
 

3869
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:07,070
of the kind of discoveries that will
open like but a slam dunk

3870
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:07,080
open like but a slam dunk
 

3871
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,590
open like but a slam dunk
that's hard to come by yeah I think a

3872
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
that's hard to come by yeah I think a
 

3873
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,930
that's hard to come by yeah I think a
lot of us are anticipating I mean we're

3874
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:11,940
lot of us are anticipating I mean we're
 

3875
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,189
lot of us are anticipating I mean we're
already seeing it to some degree with

3876
01:09:13,189 --> 01:09:13,199
already seeing it to some degree with
 

3877
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,470
already seeing it to some degree with
Venus and the phosphine incident

3878
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:15,480
Venus and the phosphine incident
 

3879
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:16,729
Venus and the phosphine incident
um but we've seen it before with Bill

3880
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:16,739
um but we've seen it before with Bill
 

3881
01:09:16,739 --> 01:09:18,169
um but we've seen it before with Bill
Clinton it's in the White House lawn

3882
01:09:18,169 --> 01:09:18,179
Clinton it's in the White House lawn
 

3883
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:20,809
Clinton it's in the White House lawn
announcing life from Mars and they're

3884
01:09:20,809 --> 01:09:20,819
announcing life from Mars and they're
 

3885
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:22,610
announcing life from Mars and they're
they're inevitably going to be spurious

3886
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:22,620
they're inevitably going to be spurious
 

3887
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,430
they're inevitably going to be spurious
claims or at least claims which are

3888
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
claims or at least claims which are
 

3889
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,430
claims or at least claims which are
um ambiguous to some degree there will

3890
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:28,440
um ambiguous to some degree there will
 

3891
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,329
um ambiguous to some degree there will
be for sure a high profile Journal like

3892
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:32,339
be for sure a high profile Journal like
 

3893
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:33,950
be for sure a high profile Journal like
nature or science that will one day

3894
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:33,960
nature or science that will one day
 

3895
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,650
nature or science that will one day
publish a paper saying buy a signature

3896
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:36,660
publish a paper saying buy a signature
 

3897
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,269
publish a paper saying buy a signature
Discover it or something like that on

3898
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:38,279
Discover it or something like that on
 

3899
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:40,309
Discover it or something like that on
Trappist one or some other planet and

3900
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:40,319
Trappist one or some other planet and
 

3901
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:42,410
Trappist one or some other planet and
then there will be years of back and

3902
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:42,420
then there will be years of back and
 

3903
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,930
then there will be years of back and
forth in the in the literature and that

3904
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:44,940
forth in the in the literature and that
 

3905
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:46,249
forth in the in the literature and that
might seem frustrating but that's how

3906
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:46,259
might seem frustrating but that's how
 

3907
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:48,050
might seem frustrating but that's how
science works it's in it that's the

3908
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:48,060
science works it's in it that's the
 

3909
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:50,530
science works it's in it that's the
mechanism of science at play of people

3910
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:50,540
mechanism of science at play of people
 

3911
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,910
mechanism of science at play of people
scrutinizing the results to intense

3912
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:52,920
scrutinizing the results to intense
 

3913
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,930
scrutinizing the results to intense
skepticism and it's like a crucible you

3914
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:56,940
skepticism and it's like a crucible you
 

3915
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:58,550
skepticism and it's like a crucible you
know you burn away all the relevances

3916
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:58,560
know you burn away all the relevances
 

3917
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,010
know you burn away all the relevances
until whatever is left is the truth and

3918
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:01,020
until whatever is left is the truth and
 

3919
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:02,930
until whatever is left is the truth and
so you're left with this this product

3920
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:02,940
so you're left with this this product
 

3921
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,630
so you're left with this this product
which is that okay we either believe or

3922
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:05,640
which is that okay we either believe or
 

3923
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,890
which is that okay we either believe or
don't believe that by signatures are

3924
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:06,900
don't believe that by signatures are
 

3925
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,570
don't believe that by signatures are
there so there's inevitably going to be

3926
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:08,580
there so there's inevitably going to be
 

3927
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:11,090
there so there's inevitably going to be
a lot of controversy and debate and

3928
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:11,100
a lot of controversy and debate and
 

3929
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,290
a lot of controversy and debate and
argument about it we just have to

3930
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:12,300
argument about it we just have to
 

3931
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,689
argument about it we just have to
anticipate that and so I think

3932
01:10:14,689 --> 01:10:14,699
anticipate that and so I think
 

3933
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:16,490
anticipate that and so I think
you have to basically have a thick skin

3934
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:16,500
you have to basically have a thick skin
 

3935
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,130
you have to basically have a thick skin
to some degree academically to dive into

3936
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:19,140
to some degree academically to dive into
 

3937
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,709
to some degree academically to dive into
that world and you're seeing that with

3938
01:10:21,709 --> 01:10:21,719
that world and you're seeing that with
 

3939
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:26,090
that world and you're seeing that with
um with phosphine it's been uh it's it's

3940
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:26,100
um with phosphine it's been uh it's it's
 

3941
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:28,370
um with phosphine it's been uh it's it's
been uncomfortable to watch from the

3942
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:28,380
been uncomfortable to watch from the
 

3943
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,430
been uncomfortable to watch from the
outside the kind of dialogue that some

3944
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:31,440
outside the kind of dialogue that some
 

3945
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,510
outside the kind of dialogue that some
of the scientists have been having with

3946
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:32,520
of the scientists have been having with
 

3947
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,450
of the scientists have been having with
each other about that because

3948
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:35,460
each other about that because
 

3949
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,550
each other about that because
um they get a little aggressive yeah and

3950
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:37,560
um they get a little aggressive yeah and
 

3951
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:39,590
um they get a little aggressive yeah and
you can understand you can understand

you can understand you can understand
 

3953
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,070
you can understand you can understand
why because jealousy I don't know I

3954
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:43,080
why because jealousy I don't know I
 

3955

3965
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,350
behalf of those who are not part of the
original Discovery sure but there's also

3966
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:57,360
original Discovery sure but there's also
 

3967
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,090
original Discovery sure but there's also
in any case just leave you know the

3968
01:10:59,090 --> 01:10:59,100
in any case just leave you know the
 

3969
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,130
in any case just leave you know the
particular people involved in Venus

3970
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:01,140
particular people involved in Venus
 

3971
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:04,070
particular people involved in Venus
alone in any case of making a claim of

01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
alone in any case of making a claim of
 

3973
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,709
alone in any case of making a claim of
that magnitude yeah especially life

3974
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:06,719
that magnitude yeah especially life
 

3975
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,530
that magnitude yeah especially life
because life is pretty much one of the

3976
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:09,540
because life is pretty much one of the
 

3977
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,510
because life is pretty much one of the
biggest discoveries of all time you can

3978
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:11,520
biggest discoveries of all time you can
 

3979
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,550

imagine scientifically
 

3981
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,910

01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:48,169
um he he felt assured that this planet
was that he was actually using the

was that he was actually using the

01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,470
um and even to the day he died which was
I think like nine in the early 90s he

4092
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:21,480
I think like nine in the early 90s he
 

4093
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,850
I think like nine in the early 90s he
was still insisting this planet was that

4094
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:22,860
was still insisting this planet was that
 

4095
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,470
was still insisting this planet was that
even when we were starting to make the

4096
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:24,480
even when we were starting to make the
 

4097
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,050
even when we were starting to make the
first genuine exoplank discoveries and

4098
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:27,060
first genuine exoplank discoveries and
 

4099
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,550
first genuine exoplank discoveries and
even at that point I think Hubble had

4100
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
even at that point I think Hubble had
 

4101
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,490
even at that point I think Hubble had
even looked at that star and had totally

4102
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:31,500
even looked at that star and had totally
 

4103
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,950
even looked at that star and had totally
ruled out any possibility of what he was

4104
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:33,960
ruled out any possibility of what he was
 

4105
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,350
ruled out any possibility of what he was
talking about and so that's a problem

4106
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:36,360
talking about and so that's a problem
 

4107
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,850
talking about and so that's a problem
how do you get to a point as a scientist

4108
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:37,860
how do you get to a point as a scientist
 

4109
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:40,490
how do you get to a point as a scientist
where you just can't accept

4110
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:40,500
where you just can't accept
 

4111
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,530
where you just can't accept
anything that comes otherwise because

4112
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:42,540
anything that comes otherwise because
 

4113
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,830
anything that comes otherwise because
you're it starts out with the the dream

4114
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:45,840
you're it starts out with the the dream
 

4115
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,010
you're it starts out with the the dream
of Fame and then it ends in a stubborn

4116
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,020
of Fame and then it ends in a stubborn
 

4117
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,229
of Fame and then it ends in a stubborn
refusal to ever back down of course the

4118
01:13:51,229 --> 01:13:51,239
refusal to ever back down of course the
 

4119
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:52,669
refusal to ever back down of course the
flip side of that

4120
01:13:52,669 --> 01:13:52,679
flip side of that
 

4121
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:56,149
flip side of that
is sometimes you need that to have the

4122
01:13:56,149 --> 01:13:56,159
is sometimes you need that to have the
 

4123
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:59,270
is sometimes you need that to have the
strength to carry a belief against the

4124
01:13:59,270 --> 01:13:59,280
strength to carry a belief against the
 

4125
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,490
strength to carry a belief against the
entire scientific community that resists

4126
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:01,500
entire scientific community that resists
 

4127
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,750
entire scientific community that resists
your beliefs

4128
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:02,760
your beliefs
 

4129
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,209
your beliefs
and so it's it's a double-edged sword

4130
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:05,219
and so it's it's a double-edged sword
 

4131
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:07,550
and so it's it's a double-edged sword
that can happen but I guess the

4132
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:07,560
that can happen but I guess the
 

4133
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,890
that can happen but I guess the
distinction here is evidence yes so in

4134
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:09,900
distinction here is evidence yes so in
 

4135
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,149
distinction here is evidence yes so in
this case

4136
01:14:11,149 --> 01:14:11,159
this case
 

4137
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,550
this case
the evidence was so overwhelming it

4138
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:13,560
the evidence was so overwhelming it
 

4139
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,050
the evidence was so overwhelming it
wasn't really a matter of um

4140
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:15,060
wasn't really a matter of um
 

4141
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,870
wasn't really a matter of um
interpretation it was it was you had to

4142
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:17,880
interpretation it was it was you had to
 

4143
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,669
interpretation it was it was you had to
collect you'd observe this star with the

4144
01:14:19,669 --> 01:14:19,679
collect you'd observe this star with the
 

4145
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:20,630
collect you'd observe this star with the
same

4146
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:20,640
same
 

4147
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,610
same
um the same star but with maybe 10 even

4148
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:22,620
um the same star but with maybe 10 even
 

4149
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:24,770
um the same star but with maybe 10 even
100 times greater Precision the

4150
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:24,780
100 times greater Precision the
 

4151
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,689
100 times greater Precision the
prolonged much longer periods of time

4152
01:14:26,689 --> 01:14:26,699
prolonged much longer periods of time
 

4153
01:14:26,699 --> 01:14:28,189
prolonged much longer periods of time
and there was just no doubt at this

4154
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:28,199
and there was just no doubt at this
 

4155
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:31,130
and there was just no doubt at this
point this planet was was a mirage

4156
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:31,140
point this planet was was a mirage
 

4157
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:32,450
point this planet was was a mirage
um and so that's why you have to be very

4158
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:32,460
um and so that's why you have to be very
 

4159
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:33,950
um and so that's why you have to be very
careful I always say don't have a name

4160
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:33,960
careful I always say don't have a name
 

4161
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,050
careful I always say don't have a name
you know my my wife my daughter like

4162
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:36,060
you know my my wife my daughter like
 

4163
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:37,669
you know my my wife my daughter like
name this planet after me that you

4164
01:14:37,669 --> 01:14:37,679
name this planet after me that you
 

4165
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,669
name this planet after me that you
discover and I can't I can't ever name a

4166
01:14:40,669 --> 01:14:40,679
discover and I can't I can't ever name a
 

4167
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:43,250
discover and I can't I can't ever name a
planet after you because I'll be I won't

4168
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:43,260
planet after you because I'll be I won't
 

4169
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:45,290
planet after you because I'll be I won't
be objective anymore how could I ever

4170
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:45,300
be objective anymore how could I ever
 

4171
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,669
be objective anymore how could I ever
how could ever turn around to you and

4172
01:14:46,669 --> 01:14:46,679
how could ever turn around to you and
 

4173
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:48,649
how could ever turn around to you and
say that client wasn't real that I named

4174
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:48,659
say that client wasn't real that I named
 

4175
01:14:48,659 --> 01:14:50,810
say that client wasn't real that I named
after you so you're somebody that talks

4176
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:50,820
after you so you're somebody that talks
 

4177
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,090
after you so you're somebody that talks
about and is clear in your eyes and in

4178
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:53,100
about and is clear in your eyes and in
 

4179
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,310
about and is clear in your eyes and in
your way of being that you love the

4180
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:55,320
your way of being that you love the
 

4181
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,410
your way of being that you love the
process of discovery their Joy the magic

4182
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:57,420
process of discovery their Joy the magic
 

4183
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:01,850
process of discovery their Joy the magic
of just uh you know uh seeing something

4184
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:01,860
of just uh you know uh seeing something
 

4185
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:05,630
of just uh you know uh seeing something
a new observation a new idea right

4186
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:05,640
a new observation a new idea right
 

4187
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:08,209
a new observation a new idea right
um but I guess the point is when you

4188
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:08,219
um but I guess the point is when you
 

4189
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:10,610
um but I guess the point is when you
have that great feeling is to then

4190
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:10,620
have that great feeling is to then
 

4191
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:12,430
have that great feeling is to then
switch on the skepticism

4192
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:12,440
switch on the skepticism
 

4193
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,709
switch on the skepticism
like to start like testing

4194
01:15:15,709 --> 01:15:15,719
like to start like testing
 

4195
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:17,810
like to start like testing
um what does this actually mean is is

4196
01:15:17,810 --> 01:15:17,820
um what does this actually mean is is
 

4197
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,390
um what does this actually mean is is
this real what are the possible uh

4198
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
this real what are the possible uh
 

4199
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,950
this real what are the possible uh
different interpretations that could

4200
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:21,960
different interpretations that could
 

4201
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,870
different interpretations that could
make this a lot less Grand than I first

4202
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:23,880
make this a lot less Grand than I first
 

4203
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,209
make this a lot less Grand than I first
imagined and yeah all so both have the

4204
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:26,219
imagined and yeah all so both have the
 

4205
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:28,189
imagined and yeah all so both have the
wander and the skepticism all in one

4206
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:28,199
wander and the skepticism all in one
 

4207
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:31,189
wander and the skepticism all in one
brain oh yeah I think the generally the

4208
01:15:31,189 --> 01:15:31,199
brain oh yeah I think the generally the
 

4209
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,350
brain oh yeah I think the generally the
more I want something to be true the

4210
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:33,360
more I want something to be true the
 

4211
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,810
more I want something to be true the
more I inherently doubt it and I think

4212
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:35,820
more I inherently doubt it and I think
 

4213
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,850
more I inherently doubt it and I think
that just comes from you know I I grew

4214
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:37,860
that just comes from you know I I grew
 

4215
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:39,050
that just comes from you know I I grew
up

4216
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:39,060
up
 

4217
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:42,290
up
um with a religious family and was just

4218
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:42,300
um with a religious family and was just
 

4219
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,030
um with a religious family and was just
sort of indoctrinated to some degree

4220
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:44,040
sort of indoctrinated to some degree
 

4221
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:45,890
sort of indoctrinated to some degree
like many children are okay that's just

4222
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:45,900
like many children are okay that's just
 

4223
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,030
like many children are okay that's just
normal that you know there's a garden

4224
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:47,040
normal that you know there's a garden
 

4225
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,430
normal that you know there's a garden
this is the way the world is uh God

4226
01:15:49,430 --> 01:15:49,440
this is the way the world is uh God
 

4227
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,350
this is the way the world is uh God
created the Earth and then as I became

4228
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
created the Earth and then as I became
 

4229
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,189
created the Earth and then as I became
more

4230
01:15:52,189 --> 01:15:52,199
more
 

4231
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:54,890
more
you know well-read and illiterate of

4232
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:54,900
you know well-read and illiterate of
 

4233
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:56,030
you know well-read and illiterate of
what was happening in the world

4234
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:56,040
what was happening in the world
 

4235
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,970
what was happening in the world
scientifically I started to doubt and it

4236
01:15:58,970 --> 01:15:58,980
scientifically I started to doubt and it
 

4237
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:00,890
scientifically I started to doubt and it
really just struck me that the hardest

4238
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:00,900
really just struck me that the hardest
 

4239
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,350
really just struck me that the hardest
thing to let go of when you when you do

4240
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,360
thing to let go of when you when you do
 

4241
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,630
thing to let go of when you when you do
decide not to be religious anymore and

4242
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:05,640
decide not to be religious anymore and
 

4243
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,189
decide not to be religious anymore and
it's not really a like a light bulb

4244
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
it's not really a like a light bulb
 

4245
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:08,630
it's not really a like a light bulb
moment but it just kind of happens over

4246
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:08,640
moment but it just kind of happens over
 

4247
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,030
moment but it just kind of happens over
my over sort of 11 to 13 I think for me

4248
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:11,040
my over sort of 11 to 13 I think for me
 

4249
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,790
my over sort of 11 to 13 I think for me
it was happening but it's that sadness

4250
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:13,800
it was happening but it's that sadness
 

4251
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:16,850
it was happening but it's that sadness
of letting go of this beautiful dream

4252
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:16,860
of letting go of this beautiful dream
 

4253
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:18,770
of letting go of this beautiful dream
which you had in your mind of eternal

4254
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:18,780
which you had in your mind of eternal
 

4255
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,990
which you had in your mind of eternal
life for you know for for behaving

4256
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:21,000
life for you know for for behaving
 

4257
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,209
life for you know for for behaving
yourself on Earth you would have this

4258
01:16:23,209 --> 01:16:23,219
yourself on Earth you would have this
 

4259
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:24,649
yourself on Earth you would have this
beautiful Heaven that you could go to

4260
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:24,659
beautiful Heaven that you could go to
 

4261
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:26,510
beautiful Heaven that you could go to
and live forever and that's very

4262
01:16:26,510 --> 01:16:26,520
and live forever and that's very
 

4263
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,930
and live forever and that's very
attractive and for me personally

4264
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:29,940
attractive and for me personally
 

4265
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:32,270
attractive and for me personally
um that was one of the things that

4266
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:32,280
um that was one of the things that
 

4267
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,669
um that was one of the things that
pulled me against it was this it's it's

4268
01:16:34,669 --> 01:16:34,679
pulled me against it was this it's it's
 

4269
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:36,890
pulled me against it was this it's it's
like it's too good to be true and that

4270
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:36,900
like it's too good to be true and that
 

4271
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:40,250
like it's too good to be true and that
it's very convenient that this could be

4272
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:40,260
it's very convenient that this could be
 

4273
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,590
it's very convenient that this could be
um this could be so and I have no

4274
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:42,600
um this could be so and I have no
 

4275
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,750
um this could be so and I have no
evidence directly in terms of a

4276
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:44,760
evidence directly in terms of a
 

4277
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:45,950
evidence directly in terms of a
scientific sense to support this

4278
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:45,960
scientific sense to support this
 

4279
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,430
scientific sense to support this
hypothesis and it just became uh really

4280
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:49,440
hypothesis and it just became uh really
 

4281
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,090
hypothesis and it just became uh really
difficult to reconcile my growth as a

4282
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:53,100
difficult to reconcile my growth as a
 

4283
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,890
difficult to reconcile my growth as a
scientist and I know some people find

4284
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:54,900
scientist and I know some people find
 

4285
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,790
scientist and I know some people find
that reconciliation I I have not maybe I

4286
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:58,800
that reconciliation I I have not maybe I
 

4287
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,470
that reconciliation I I have not maybe I
will one day

4288
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
will one day
 

4289
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,830
will one day
um but as a general guiding principle

4290
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:03,840
um but as a general guiding principle
 

4291
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,470
um but as a general guiding principle
which I think I I obtained from that

4292
01:17:06,470 --> 01:17:06,480
which I think I I obtained from that
 

4293
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,570
which I think I I obtained from that
experience was that I have to be

4294
01:17:08,570 --> 01:17:08,580
experience was that I have to be
 

4295
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:10,790
experience was that I have to be
extremely guarded about what I want to

4296
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:10,800
extremely guarded about what I want to
 

4297
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,689
extremely guarded about what I want to
be true because it's going to sway me to

4298
01:17:14,689 --> 01:17:14,699
be true because it's going to sway me to
 

4299
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:17,450
be true because it's going to sway me to
say things which which are not true if

4300
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:17,460
say things which which are not true if
 

4301
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,610
say things which which are not true if
I'm not careful and that's the that's

4302
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:19,620
I'm not careful and that's the that's
 

4303
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:20,630
I'm not careful and that's the that's
not what we're trying to do as

4304
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
not what we're trying to do as
 

4305
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,910
not what we're trying to do as
scientists so you felt from a religious

4306
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:22,920
scientists so you felt from a religious
 

4307
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,790
scientists so you felt from a religious
perspective that there was um a little

4308
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:25,800
perspective that there was um a little
 

4309
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,189
perspective that there was um a little
bit of a gravitational field in terms of

4310
01:17:28,189 --> 01:17:28,199
bit of a gravitational field in terms of
 

4311
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:30,110
bit of a gravitational field in terms of
your opinions like it was affecting how

4312
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:30,120
your opinions like it was affecting how
 

4313
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,510
your opinions like it was affecting how
you could be as a scientist like as a

4314
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:32,520
you could be as a scientist like as a
 

4315
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,030
you could be as a scientist like as a
scientific thinker obviously we're young

4316
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:35,040
scientific thinker obviously we're young
 

4317
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,850
scientific thinker obviously we're young
yeah I I think um

4318
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:37,860
yeah I I think um
 

4319
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,530
yeah I I think um
I I think that's that's true that

4320
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:39,540
I I think that's that's true that
 

4321
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:40,850
I I think that's that's true that
whenever you're

4322
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:40,860
whenever you're
 

4323
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,709
whenever you're
whenever there's something you want to

4324
01:17:42,709 --> 01:17:42,719
whenever there's something you want to
 

4325
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,310
whenever there's something you want to
be true it's it's the ultimate seduction

4326
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:46,320
be true it's it's the ultimate seduction
 

4327
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,070
be true it's it's the ultimate seduction
intellectually and I worry about this a

4328
01:17:49,070 --> 01:17:49,080
intellectually and I worry about this a
 

4329
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,850
intellectually and I worry about this a
lot with um with you know UFOs and with

4330
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:52,860
lot with um with you know UFOs and with
 

4331
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:55,070
lot with um with you know UFOs and with
um it's it's true already with things

4332
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:55,080
um it's it's true already with things
 

4333
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,770
um it's it's true already with things
like Venus phosphine and uh searching

4334
01:17:57,770 --> 01:17:57,780
like Venus phosphine and uh searching
 

4335
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,870
like Venus phosphine and uh searching
for astrological signals

4336
01:17:59,870 --> 01:17:59,880
for astrological signals
 

4337
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,149
for astrological signals
we have to guard against this all the

4338
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:02,159
we have to guard against this all the
 

4339
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,590
we have to guard against this all the
way through from however we're looking

4340
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:03,600
way through from however we're looking
 

4341
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,090
way through from however we're looking
for life however we're looking for

4342
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:05,100
for life however we're looking for
 

4343
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,669
for life however we're looking for
whatever this big question is there is a

4344
01:18:07,669 --> 01:18:07,679
whatever this big question is there is a
 

4345
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,770
whatever this big question is there is a
part of us I think I would love that to

4346
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:09,780
part of us I think I would love that to
 

4347
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:11,750
part of us I think I would love that to
be life in the universe

4348
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:11,760
be life in the universe
 

4349
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,490
be life in the universe
um I hope there is life in the universe

4350
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:13,500
um I hope there is life in the universe
 

4351
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:14,750
um I hope there is life in the universe
but

4352
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:14,760
but
 

4353
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,290
but
um I'm somewhat uh been on record

4354
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:18,300
um I'm somewhat uh been on record
 

4355
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,229
um I'm somewhat uh been on record
several times as being fairly firm about

4356
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:21,239
several times as being fairly firm about
 

4357
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:23,870
several times as being fairly firm about
trying to remain consciously agnostic

4358
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:23,880
trying to remain consciously agnostic
 

4359
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,630
trying to remain consciously agnostic
about that question I don't want to make

4360
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:26,640
about that question I don't want to make
 

4361
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,430
about that question I don't want to make
up my mind about what the answer is

4362
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:28,440
up my mind about what the answer is
 

4363
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,310
up my mind about what the answer is
before I've collected evidence to inform

4364
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:31,320
before I've collected evidence to inform
 

4365
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,169
before I've collected evidence to inform
that decision that's how science should

4366
01:18:33,169 --> 01:18:33,179
that decision that's how science should
 

4367
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:35,330
that decision that's how science should
work if I already know what the answer

4368
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:35,340
work if I already know what the answer
 

4369
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,970
work if I already know what the answer
is then what am I doing and that's not a

4370
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:37,980
is then what am I doing and that's not a
 

4371
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,590
is then what am I doing and that's not a
scientific experiment anymore you've

4372
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:39,600
scientific experiment anymore you've
 

4373
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,390
scientific experiment anymore you've
already decided so what are you trying

4374
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:41,400
already decided so what are you trying
 

4375
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,189
already decided so what are you trying
to learn what's the point of doing the

4376
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:43,199
to learn what's the point of doing the
 

4377
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,030
to learn what's the point of doing the
experiment if you already know what the

4378
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:44,040
experiment if you already know what the
 

4379
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,530
experiment if you already know what the
answer is there's no point it's still

4380
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:45,540
answer is there's no point it's still
 

4381
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,209
answer is there's no point it's still
complicated because so if I'm being

4382
01:18:47,209 --> 01:18:47,219
complicated because so if I'm being
 

4383
01:18:47,219 --> 01:18:49,430
complicated because so if I'm being
honest with myself

4384
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:49,440
honest with myself
 

4385
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,030
honest with myself
foreign

4386
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:52,040
foreign
 

4387
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:55,490
foreign
first thing I imagine uh about our world

4388
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:55,500
first thing I imagine uh about our world
 

4389
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,490
first thing I imagine uh about our world
is that we humans and me certainly is

4390
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:58,500
is that we humans and me certainly is
 

4391
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,610
is that we humans and me certainly is
one particular human

4392
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:01,620
one particular human
 

4393
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:04,189
one particular human
uh no very

4394
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:04,199
uh no very
 

4395
01:19:04,199 --> 01:19:06,530
uh no very
my first assumption is I know almost

4396
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:06,540
my first assumption is I know almost
 

4397
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:09,890
my first assumption is I know almost
nothing about how anything works

4398
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:09,900
nothing about how anything works
 

4399
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:11,810
nothing about how anything works
so first off that actually applies for

4400
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:11,820
so first off that actually applies for
 

4401
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:15,050
so first off that actually applies for
for things that humans do know like uh

4402
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:15,060
for things that humans do know like uh
 

4403
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,390
for things that humans do know like uh
there are quantum mechanics and all the

4404
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:17,400
there are quantum mechanics and all the
 

4405
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,010
there are quantum mechanics and all the
things that there's different expertises

4406
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:19,020
things that there's different expertises
 

4407
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,630
things that there's different expertises
that I just have not dedicated to so

4408
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:20,640
that I just have not dedicated to so
 

4409
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,550
that I just have not dedicated to so
even even that starting point but if we

4410
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:22,560
even even that starting point but if we
 

4411
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,350
even even that starting point but if we
take all of knowledge as human

4412
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:24,360
take all of knowledge as human
 

4413
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,090
take all of knowledge as human
civilization we know almost nothing

4414
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:26,100
civilization we know almost nothing
 

4415
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:28,130
civilization we know almost nothing
that's kind of an assumption I have

4416
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:28,140
that's kind of an assumption I have
 

4417
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,050
that's kind of an assumption I have
because it seems like we keep

4418
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:30,060
because it seems like we keep
 

4419
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,570
because it seems like we keep
discovering Mysteries and it seems like

4420
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:32,580
discovering Mysteries and it seems like
 

4421
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,390
discovering Mysteries and it seems like
history human history is defined by

4422
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:35,400
history human history is defined by
 

4423
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,490
history human history is defined by
moments when we said okay we pretty much

4424
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:37,500
moments when we said okay we pretty much
 

4425
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:38,930
moments when we said okay we pretty much
figured it all out and then you realize

4426
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:38,940
figured it all out and then you realize
 

4427
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:42,110
figured it all out and then you realize
a century later you've when you said

4428
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:42,120
a century later you've when you said
 

4429
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,030
a century later you've when you said
that you didn't figure out anything okay

4430
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:44,040
that you didn't figure out anything okay
 

4431
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,130
that you didn't figure out anything okay
so that's like a starting point the

4432
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:46,140
so that's like a starting point the
 

4433
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:50,810
so that's like a starting point the
second thing I have is I feel like the

4434
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:50,820
second thing I have is I feel like the
 

4435
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,850
second thing I have is I feel like the
entirety of the universe is just filled

4436
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:52,860
entirety of the universe is just filled
 

4437
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:56,209
entirety of the universe is just filled
with alien civilizations

4438
01:19:56,209 --> 01:19:56,219

 

4439
01:19:56,219 --> 01:19:58,550

statistically

4440
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
statistically
 

4441
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,930
statistically
there's

4442
01:19:59,930 --> 01:19:59,940
there's
 

4443
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:02,750
there's
the important thing that enables that

4444
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:02,760
the important thing that enables that
 

4445
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,330
the important thing that enables that
belief for me is that they don't have to

4446
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:05,340
belief for me is that they don't have to
 

4447
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:08,689
belief for me is that they don't have to
be human-like they can be anything and

4448
01:20:08,689 --> 01:20:08,699
be human-like they can be anything and
 

4449
01:20:08,699 --> 01:20:11,030
be human-like they can be anything and
it's just the fact that life exists and

4450
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:11,040
it's just the fact that life exists and
 

4451
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,709
it's just the fact that life exists and
just seeing the way life is on Earth

4452
01:20:12,709 --> 01:20:12,719
just seeing the way life is on Earth
 

4453
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,430
just seeing the way life is on Earth
that it just finds a way it finds a way

4454
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:16,440
that it just finds a way it finds a way
 

4455
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,229
that it just finds a way it finds a way
in so many different complicated

4456
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:18,239
in so many different complicated
 

4457
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,450
in so many different complicated
environments it finds a way whatever

4458
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:20,460
environments it finds a way whatever
 

4459
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:23,510
environments it finds a way whatever
that force is that same Force has to

4460
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:23,520
that force is that same Force has to
 

4461
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,430
that force is that same Force has to
find a way elsewhere also

4462
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:25,440
find a way elsewhere also
 

4463
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,709
find a way elsewhere also
but but then if I'm also being honest

4464
01:20:27,709 --> 01:20:27,719
but but then if I'm also being honest
 

4465
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,229
but but then if I'm also being honest
and I I don't know how many hours in a

4466
01:20:30,229 --> 01:20:30,239
and I I don't know how many hours in a
 

4467
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:31,850
and I I don't know how many hours in a
day I spend

4468
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:31,860
day I spend
 

4469
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,770
day I spend
seriously considering the possibility

4470
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:33,780
seriously considering the possibility
 

4471
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,930
seriously considering the possibility
that we're alone

4472
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:35,940
that we're alone
 

4473
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:39,290
that we're alone
I don't know when I'm when I when my

4474
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:39,300
I don't know when I'm when I when my
 

4475
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,570
I don't know when I'm when I when my
heart is in mind or filled with wander I

4476
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:41,580
heart is in mind or filled with wander I
 

4477
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:43,250
heart is in mind or filled with wander I
think about all the different life

4478
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:43,260
think about all the different life
 

4479
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,689
think about all the different life
that's out there

4480
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:44,699
that's out there
 

4481
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:46,850
that's out there
but to really imagine that we're alone

4482
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:46,860
but to really imagine that we're alone
 

4483
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:49,669
but to really imagine that we're alone
like really imagine all the vastness

4484
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:49,679
like really imagine all the vastness
 

4485
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,010
like really imagine all the vastness
that's out there were alone that not

4486
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:52,020
that's out there were alone that not
 

4487
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,810
that's out there were alone that not
even bacteria

4488
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:53,820
even bacteria
 

4489
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,970
even bacteria
I would say you don't have to believe

4490
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:55,980
I would say you don't have to believe
 

4491
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:57,830
I would say you don't have to believe
that we are alone

4492
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
that we are alone
 

4493
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,169
that we are alone
um but you have to admit it's a

4494
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:00,179
um but you have to admit it's a
 

4495
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:02,149
um but you have to admit it's a
possibility of our ignorance of the

4496
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:02,159
possibility of our ignorance of the
 

4497
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,010
possibility of our ignorance of the
universe so far

4498
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:04,020
universe so far
 

4499
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:04,970
universe so far
um

4500
01:21:04,970 --> 01:21:04,980
um
 

4501
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,010
um
you can have a belief about something

4502
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:07,020
you can have a belief about something
 

4503
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,110
you can have a belief about something
and absence of evidence

4504
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120
and absence of evidence
 

4505
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,510
and absence of evidence
and Carl Sagan famously described as the

4506
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
and Carl Sagan famously described as the
 

4507
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,189
and Carl Sagan famously described as the
definition of faith if you believe

4508
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
definition of faith if you believe
 

4509
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,709
definition of faith if you believe
something when there's no evidence you

4510
01:21:15,709 --> 01:21:15,719
something when there's no evidence you
 

4511
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:16,910
something when there's no evidence you
have faith that there's life in the

4512
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:16,920
have faith that there's life in the
 

4513
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,010
have faith that there's life in the
universe but you can't

4514
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:19,020
universe but you can't
 

4515
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,810
universe but you can't
you can't demonstrate you can't prove it

4516
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:20,820
you can't demonstrate you can't prove it
 

4517
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:22,250
you can't demonstrate you can't prove it
mathematically you can't show me

4518
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:22,260
mathematically you can't show me
 

4519
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,930
mathematically you can't show me
evidence of that

4520
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:23,940
evidence of that
 

4521
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:26,510
evidence of that
um but is there some some mathematically

4522
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:26,520
um but is there some some mathematically
 

4523
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:28,550
um but is there some some mathematically
math is a funny thing is there I mean

4524
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:28,560
math is a funny thing is there I mean
 

4525
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,229
math is a funny thing is there I mean
the way physicists think like intuition

4526
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:30,239
the way physicists think like intuition
 

4527
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:32,830
the way physicists think like intuition
so it's like basic reasoning

4528
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:32,840
so it's like basic reasoning
 

4529
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:36,790
so it's like basic reasoning
is there some value to that well I'd say

4530
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:36,800
is there some value to that well I'd say
 

4531
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,930
is there some value to that well I'd say
there's certainly you can certainly make

4532
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:38,940
there's certainly you can certainly make
 

4533
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,910
there's certainly you can certainly make
a very good argument I think you've kind

4534
01:21:40,910 --> 01:21:40,920
a very good argument I think you've kind
 

4535
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,189
a very good argument I think you've kind
of already made one just the vastness of

4536
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:43,199
of already made one just the vastness of
 

4537
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,290
of already made one just the vastness of
the universe is is the is the default

4538
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:45,300
the universe is is the is the default
 

4539
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,450
the universe is is the is the default
argument people often turn to that

4540
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:47,460
argument people often turn to that
 

4541
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,490
argument people often turn to that
surely there should be others out that's

4542
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:49,500
surely there should be others out that's
 

4543
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,229
surely there should be others out that's
hard to imagine

4544
01:21:51,229 --> 01:21:51,239
hard to imagine
 

4545
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,990
hard to imagine
um there are order of 10 to the 22 stars

4546
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
um there are order of 10 to the 22 stars
 

4547
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,110
um there are order of 10 to the 22 stars
in our observable universe and so really

4548
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,120
in our observable universe and so really
 

4549
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,490
in our observable universe and so really
the question comes down to what's the

4550
01:21:58,490 --> 01:21:58,500
the question comes down to what's the
 

4551
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,250
the question comes down to what's the
probability of one of those 10 to 22

4552
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:01,260
probability of one of those 10 to 22
 

4553
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:03,229
probability of one of those 10 to 22
planets let's say earth like planets if

4554
01:22:03,229 --> 01:22:03,239
planets let's say earth like planets if
 

4555
01:22:03,239 --> 01:22:05,090
planets let's say earth like planets if
they all have Earthly planets

4556
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:05,100
they all have Earthly planets
 

4557
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,750
they all have Earthly planets
um going on to form life

4558
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:07,760
um going on to form life
 

4559
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,370
um going on to form life
spontaneously that's the process of

4560
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:10,380
spontaneously that's the process of
 

4561
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:13,070
spontaneously that's the process of
abiogenesis the spontaneous emergence of

4562
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:13,080
abiogenesis the spontaneous emergence of
 

4563
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:13,850
abiogenesis the spontaneous emergence of
life

4564
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:13,860
life
 

4565
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:15,890
life
also the word spontaneous is the funny

4566
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:15,900
also the word spontaneous is the funny
 

4567
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,689
also the word spontaneous is the funny
okay maybe when you spontaneous but um

4568
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:19,699
okay maybe when you spontaneous but um
 

4569
01:22:19,699 --> 01:22:24,470
okay maybe when you spontaneous but um
not not being say uh seeded by say some

4570
01:22:24,470 --> 01:22:24,480
not not being say uh seeded by say some
 

4571
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,850
not not being say uh seeded by say some
some other civilization or something

4572
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:25,860
some other civilization or something
 

4573
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:27,770
some other civilization or something
like this it naturally emerges because

4574
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:27,780
like this it naturally emerges because
 

4575
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,570
like this it naturally emerges because
even the word spontaneous

4576
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:29,580
even the word spontaneous
 

4577
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,330
even the word spontaneous
makes it seem less likely yeah like

4578
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:32,340
makes it seem less likely yeah like
 

4579
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:33,950
makes it seem less likely yeah like
there's there's just this chemistry and

4580
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:33,960
there's there's just this chemistry and
 

4581
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,450
there's there's just this chemistry and
extremely random process it could be a

4582
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:35,460
extremely random process it could be a
 

4583
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,430
extremely random process it could be a
very gradual process over millions of

01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:37,440
very gradual process over millions of

01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,050
very gradual process over millions of

4586
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:39,060
years have grown complexity in in
 

4587
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,090
years have grown complexity in in
chemical networks maybe there's a force

4588
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:41,100
chemical networks maybe there's a force
 

4589
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,550
chemical networks maybe there's a force
in the universe that pushes it towards

01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:43,560
in the universe that pushes it towards
 

4591
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,050
in the universe that pushes it towards
interesting complexity pockets of

4592
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:45,060
interesting complexity pockets of
 

4593
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,930
interesting complexity pockets of
complexity that ultimately creates

01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:47,940
complexity that ultimately creates
 

4595
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,250
complexity that ultimately creates
something like life which we can't

4596
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:49,260
something like life which we can't
 

4597
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,350
something like life which we can't
possibly Define yet and sometimes it

4598
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:51,360
possibly Define yet and sometimes it
 

4599
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,090
possibly Define yet and sometimes it
manifests itself into something that

4600
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:53,100
manifests itself into something that
 

4601
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,130
manifests itself into something that
looks like humans but it can be a

4602
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:55,140
looks like humans but it can be a

01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:56,510
looks like humans but it can be a
totally different kind of computational

01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:56,520
totally different kind of computational
 

4605
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,910
totally different kind of computational
information processing system that we're

4606
01:22:58,910 --> 01:22:58,920
information processing system that we're
 

4607
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,189
information processing system that we're
too dumb to even visualize yeah I mean

4608
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
too dumb to even visualize yeah I mean
 

4609
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:02,870
too dumb to even visualize yeah I mean
certainly I mean it's kind of weird that

4610
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:02,880
certainly I mean it's kind of weird that
 

4611
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,390
certainly I mean it's kind of weird that
complexity develops at all right because

4612
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:05,400
complexity develops at all right because
 

4613
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,209
complexity develops at all right because
um it seems like the opposite to our

4614
01:23:08,209 --> 01:23:08,219
um it seems like the opposite to our
 

4615
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:10,070
um it seems like the opposite to our
physical intuition returning a physics

4616
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
physical intuition returning a physics
 

4617
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,229
physical intuition returning a physics
of entropy that things should you know

4618
01:23:12,229 --> 01:23:12,239
of entropy that things should you know
 

4619
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:13,970
of entropy that things should you know
complexity is hard to spontaneously

4620
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:13,980
complexity is hard to spontaneously
 

4621
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:15,470
complexity is hard to spontaneously
emote I shouldn't say spontaneously but

4622
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:15,480
emote I shouldn't say spontaneously but
 

4623
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,510
emote I shouldn't say spontaneously but
hard to emerge in general

4624
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,520
hard to emerge in general
 

4625
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,970
hard to emerge in general
um and so that's an interesting problem

4626
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:19,980
um and so that's an interesting problem
 

4627
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:21,890
um and so that's an interesting problem
I think there's been certainly from an

4628
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:21,900
I think there's been certainly from an
 

4629
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,450
I think there's been certainly from an
evolutionary perspective you do see

4630
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:23,460
evolutionary perspective you do see
 

4631
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:26,030
evolutionary perspective you do see
growing complexity and there's a nice

4632
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:26,040
growing complexity and there's a nice
 

4633
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,490
growing complexity and there's a nice
argument I think it's by gold who who

4634
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:28,500
argument I think it's by gold who who
 

4635
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,169
argument I think it's by gold who who
shows that if you have a a certain

4636
01:23:30,169 --> 01:23:30,179
shows that if you have a a certain
 

4637
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:31,689
shows that if you have a a certain
amount of complexity

4638
01:23:31,689 --> 01:23:31,699
amount of complexity
 

4639
01:23:31,699 --> 01:23:34,250
amount of complexity
it can either become less complex or

4640
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:34,260
it can either become less complex or
 

4641
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,590
it can either become less complex or
more complex through random mutation and

4642
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:36,600
more complex through random mutation and
 

4643
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,270
more complex through random mutation and
the less complex things are stripping

4644
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:38,280
the less complex things are stripping
 

4645
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,830
the less complex things are stripping
away something something that was

4646
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:39,840
away something something that was
 

4647
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,570
away something something that was
necessary potentially to their survival

4648
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:41,580
necessary potentially to their survival
 

4649
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:44,030
necessary potentially to their survival
and so in general that's that's going to

4650
01:23:44,030 --> 01:23:44,040
and so in general that's that's going to
 

4651
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,250
and so in general that's that's going to
be not particularly useful in its

4652
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:46,260
be not particularly useful in its
 

4653
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:47,209
be not particularly useful in its
survival and so it's going to be

4654
01:23:47,209 --> 01:23:47,219
survival and so it's going to be
 

4655
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:49,310
survival and so it's going to be
detrimental to strip away a significant

4656
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:49,320
detrimental to strip away a significant
 

4657
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,590
detrimental to strip away a significant
amount of its useful traits whereas if

4658
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:51,600
amount of its useful traits whereas if
 

4659
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,250
amount of its useful traits whereas if
you add something the most typical thing

4660
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:55,260
you add something the most typical thing
 

4661
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,750
you add something the most typical thing
that you add is probably not useful at

4662
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:56,760
that you add is probably not useful at
 

4663
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,510
that you add is probably not useful at
all it's probably just it doesn't really

4664
01:23:59,510 --> 01:23:59,520
all it's probably just it doesn't really
 

4665
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,250
all it's probably just it doesn't really
affect its survival negatively but it

4666
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:01,260
affect its survival negatively but it
 

4667
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,930
affect its survival negatively but it
neither does it provide any significant

4668
01:24:02,930 --> 01:24:02,940
neither does it provide any significant
 

4669
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:03,669
neither does it provide any significant
benefit

4670
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
benefit
 

4671
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:06,290

but sometimes on rare occasions of

01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:06,300
but sometimes on rare occasions of
 

4673
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,450
but sometimes on rare occasions of
course it will be of benefit and so if

4674
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:08,460
course it will be of benefit and so if
 

4675
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:09,590
course it will be of benefit and so if
you're I have a certain level of

01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:09,600
you're I have a certain level of
 

4677
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,450
you're I have a certain level of
complexity it's hard to go back in

4678
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:11,460
complexity it's hard to go back in
 

4679
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:14,090
complexity it's hard to go back in
complexity but it's fairly easy to go

4680
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:14,100
complexity but it's fairly easy to go
 

4681
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,130
complexity but it's fairly easy to go
forward with enough bytes at the charity

4682
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:16,140
forward with enough bytes at the charity
 

4683
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:17,870
forward with enough bytes at the charity
you will eventually build up and complex

4684
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:17,880
you will eventually build up and complex
 

4685
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,490
you will eventually build up and complex
in that so it tends to be why we see

4686
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:19,500
in that so it tends to be why we see
 

4687
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,490
in that so it tends to be why we see
complexity growing in in certainly in an

complexity growing in in certainly in an

01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,890
complexity growing in in certainly in an
evolutionary sense but also perhaps it's

01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:24,900
evolutionary sense but also perhaps it's
 

4691
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:26,930
evolutionary sense but also perhaps it's
operating in chemical networks that led

01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:26,940
operating in chemical networks that led

operating in chemical networks that led
to the emergence of life I guess the

game just come back to that is that we

01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800
game just come back to that is that we

01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,470

01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:55,500
maybe we could Define as life the
 

4719
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,229
maybe we could Define as life the
probability of that is maybe one percent

4720
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:57,239
probability of that is maybe one percent
 

4721
01:24:57,239 --> 01:24:58,910
probability of that is maybe one percent
one percent of the time that happens in

4722
01:24:58,910 --> 01:24:58,920
one percent of the time that happens in
 

4723
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,229
one percent of the time that happens in
which case you're right the universe

4724
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:00,239
which case you're right the universe
 

4725
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,330
which case you're right the universe
will be absolutely teeming with life but

4726
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:02,340
will be absolutely teeming with life but
 

4727
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,610
will be absolutely teeming with life but
it could also be 10 to the power minus

4728
01:25:04,610 --> 01:25:04,620
it could also be 10 to the power minus
 

4729
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:06,950
it could also be 10 to the power minus
10 in which case it's one per Galaxy or

4730
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:06,960
10 in which case it's one per Galaxy or
 

4731
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,870
10 in which case it's one per Galaxy or
10 to the power of minus 100 in which

4732
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:08,880
10 to the power of minus 100 in which
 

4733
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,570
10 to the power of minus 100 in which
case the vast majority of universes even

4734
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:11,580
case the vast majority of universes even
 

4735
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:16,310
case the vast majority of universes even
do not have life within it or 90 or 90

4736
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,320
do not have life within it or 90 or 90
 

4737
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,810
do not have life within it or 90 or 90
said one percent you said one percent

4738
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:17,820
said one percent you said one percent
 

4739
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:20,510
said one percent you said one percent
but it could be 90 if the conditions the

4740
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:20,520
but it could be 90 if the conditions the
 

4741
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,950
but it could be 90 if the conditions the
chemical conditions of a planet are

4742
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:21,960
chemical conditions of a planet are
 

4743
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:24,050
chemical conditions of a planet are
correct or a moon are correct I admit

4744
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:24,060
correct or a moon are correct I admit
 

4745
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:25,390
correct or a moon are correct I admit
that it could be any of those numbers

4746
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:25,400
that it could be any of those numbers
 

4747
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:29,270
that it could be any of those numbers
and the challenges we just have no

4748
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:29,280
and the challenges we just have no
 

4749
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:34,189
and the challenges we just have no
rigorous reason to expect why 90 is any

4750
01:25:34,189 --> 01:25:34,199
rigorous reason to expect why 90 is any
 

4751
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:35,030
rigorous reason to expect why 90 is any
because we're talking about a

4752
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:35,040
because we're talking about a
 

4753
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,030
because we're talking about a
probability for probability what is is

4754
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:38,040
probability for probability what is is
 

4755
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:42,530
probability for probability what is is
90 more a priori likely than 10 to the

4756
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:42,540
90 more a priori likely than 10 to the
 

4757
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:44,750
90 more a priori likely than 10 to the
power minus 20. well the thing is we do

4758
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:44,760
power minus 20. well the thing is we do
 

4759
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,130
power minus 20. well the thing is we do
have an observation n of one of Earth

4760
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:48,140
have an observation n of one of Earth
 

4761
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:51,290
have an observation n of one of Earth
and uh it's difficult to know what to do

4762
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:51,300
and uh it's difficult to know what to do
 

4763
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:52,729
and uh it's difficult to know what to do
with that what kind of intuition you

4764
01:25:52,729 --> 01:25:52,739
with that what kind of intuition you
 

4765
01:25:52,739 --> 01:25:56,030
with that what kind of intuition you
build build on top of that because on

4766
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:56,040
build build on top of that because on
 

4767
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,729
build build on top of that because on
Earth it seems like life finds a way

4768
01:25:58,729 --> 01:25:58,739
Earth it seems like life finds a way
 

4769
01:25:58,739 --> 01:26:02,209
Earth it seems like life finds a way
okay in all kinds of conditions in all

4770
01:26:02,209 --> 01:26:02,219
okay in all kinds of conditions in all
 

4771
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:04,910
okay in all kinds of conditions in all
kinds of crazy conditions good and it's

4772
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:04,920
kinds of crazy conditions good and it's
 

4773
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,649
kinds of crazy conditions good and it's
able to like build up from the basic

4774
01:26:06,649 --> 01:26:06,659
able to like build up from the basic
 

4775
01:26:06,659 --> 01:26:09,530
able to like build up from the basic
chemistry you could say okay

4776
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:09,540
chemistry you could say okay
 

4777
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,870
chemistry you could say okay
uh maybe it takes a little bit of time

4778
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:11,880
uh maybe it takes a little bit of time
 

4779
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,430
uh maybe it takes a little bit of time
to develop some complicated technology

4780
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:13,440
to develop some complicated technology
 

4781
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,050
to develop some complicated technology
like mitochondria I don't know like

4782
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:15,060
like mitochondria I don't know like
 

4783
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,370
like mitochondria I don't know like
photosynthesis

4784
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:16,380
photosynthesis
 

4785
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:18,709
photosynthesis
fine but it seems to figure it out

4786
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:18,719
fine but it seems to figure it out
 

4787
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,110
fine but it seems to figure it out
figure it out and like do it extremely

4788
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,120
figure it out and like do it extremely
 

4789
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,610
figure it out and like do it extremely
well yeah but I would say you're

4790
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:22,620
well yeah but I would say you're
 

4791
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:25,129
well yeah but I would say you're
describing a different process I mean

4792
01:26:25,129 --> 01:26:25,139
describing a different process I mean
 

4793
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:27,470
describing a different process I mean
um maybe I'm I'm at fault for separating

4794
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:27,480
um maybe I'm I'm at fault for separating
 

4795
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,689
um maybe I'm I'm at fault for separating
these two processes but to me you're

4796
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:29,699
these two processes but to me you're
 

4797
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:31,370
these two processes but to me you're
describing basically natural selection

4798
01:26:31,370 --> 01:26:31,380
describing basically natural selection
 

4799
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:33,110
describing basically natural selection
Evolution at that point

4800
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:33,120
Evolution at that point
 

4801
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,250
Evolution at that point
um whereas I'm really describing

4802
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:34,260
um whereas I'm really describing
 

4803
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,830
um whereas I'm really describing
abogenesis which is to me a separate

4804
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:36,840
abogenesis which is to me a separate
 

4805
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,930
abogenesis which is to me a separate
distinct process do you limit it to

4806
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:38,940
distinct process do you limit it to
 

4807
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:41,209
distinct process do you limit it to
human scientists yes but why would it be

4808
01:26:41,209 --> 01:26:41,219
human scientists yes but why would it be
 

4809
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:44,570
human scientists yes but why would it be
a separate process why why is the birth

4810
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:44,580
a separate process why why is the birth
 

4811
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:46,129
a separate process why why is the birth
of Life a separate process from the

4812
01:26:46,129 --> 01:26:46,139
of Life a separate process from the
 

4813
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:49,850
of Life a separate process from the
process of Life hey uh like why is the

4814
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:49,860
process of Life hey uh like why is the
 

4815
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:52,189
process of Life hey uh like why is the
I mean we're uncomfortable with the fir

4816
01:26:52,189 --> 01:26:52,199
I mean we're uncomfortable with the fir
 

4817
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:54,410
I mean we're uncomfortable with the fir
we are comfortable with a big bang we're

4818
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:54,420
we are comfortable with a big bang we're
 

4819
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,149
we are comfortable with a big bang we're
uncomfortable with the first thing I

4820
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:56,159
uncomfortable with the first thing I
 

4821
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:57,530
uncomfortable with the first thing I
think like where did this come from

4822
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:57,540
think like where did this come from
 

4823
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,390
think like where did this come from
right so I think I would say I just

4824
01:26:59,390 --> 01:26:59,400
right so I think I would say I just
 

4825
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,709
right so I think I would say I just
twist that question around and say what

4826
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:00,719
twist that question around and say what
 

4827
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,570
twist that question around and say what
you're saying why is it a different

4828
01:27:02,570 --> 01:27:02,580
you're saying why is it a different
 

4829
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,189
you're saying why is it a different
process

4830
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:04,199
process
 

4831
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:05,689
process
um why and I would say why shouldn't it

4832
01:27:05,689 --> 01:27:05,699
um why and I would say why shouldn't it
 

4833
01:27:05,699 --> 01:27:07,129
um why and I would say why shouldn't it
be a different process which isn't

4834
01:27:07,129 --> 01:27:07,139
be a different process which isn't
 

4835
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:08,570
be a different process which isn't
really a good defense except to say that

4836
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:08,580
really a good defense except to say that
 

4837
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,010
really a good defense except to say that
we we have

about the earlier stages of how life

about the earlier stages of how life
emerged on our planet it may be that

you're right and it is a part of a

I'm just trying to be open-minded to

01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:37,500
I'm just trying to be open-minded to
 

4863
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,490
I'm just trying to be open-minded to
both possibilities if I assert that life

01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:40,500
both possibilities if I assert that life
 

4865
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,350
both possibilities if I assert that life
must be everywhere

4866

to me you run the risk of experimenters

01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:44,520
to me you run the risk of experimenters

um if you think you know what the answer

4872
01:27:47,510 --> 01:27:47,520
um if you think you know what the answer
 

4873
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,950
um if you think you know what the answer
is if you look at an Earth-like planet

4874
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:48,960
is if you look at an Earth-like planet
 

4875
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:51,770
is if you look at an Earth-like planet
and you're a new a preconditioned to

4876
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:51,780
and you're a new a preconditioned to
 

4877
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,570
and you're a new a preconditioned to
think there's a 90 chance of Life on

4878
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:53,580
think there's a 90 chance of Life on
 

4879
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:56,689
think there's a 90 chance of Life on
this planet it's going to at some level

4880
01:27:56,689 --> 01:27:56,699
this planet it's going to at some level
 

4881
01:27:56,699 --> 01:27:59,450
this planet it's going to at some level
affect your interpretation of that data

4882
01:27:59,450 --> 01:27:59,460
affect your interpretation of that data
 

4883
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:02,810
affect your interpretation of that data
whereas if I however critical you might

4884
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:02,820
whereas if I however critical you might
 

4885
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:06,050
whereas if I however critical you might
be of the agnosticism that I impose upon

4886
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:06,060
be of the agnosticism that I impose upon
 

4887
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:07,070
be of the agnosticism that I impose upon
myself

4888
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:07,080
myself
 

4889
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:11,209
myself
remain open to both possibilities then I

4890
01:28:11,209 --> 01:28:11,219
remain open to both possibilities then I
 

4891
01:28:11,219 --> 01:28:12,709
remain open to both possibilities then I
trust in myself to make a fairer

4892
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
trust in myself to make a fairer
 

4893
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,050
trust in myself to make a fairer
assessment as to the reality of that

4894
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:15,060
assessment as to the reality of that
 

4895
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:17,030
assessment as to the reality of that
evidence for life

4896
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:17,040
evidence for life
 

4897
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,310
evidence for life
yeah but I I wonder sort of

4898
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:19,320
yeah but I I wonder sort of
 

4899
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,649
yeah but I I wonder sort of
scientifically and and that's really

4900
01:28:21,649 --> 01:28:21,659
scientifically and and that's really
 

4901
01:28:21,659 --> 01:28:24,250
scientifically and and that's really
beautiful to hear and inspiring to hear

4902
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:24,260
beautiful to hear and inspiring to hear
 

4903
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:28,189
beautiful to hear and inspiring to hear
uh I I wonder scientifically how many

4904
01:28:28,189 --> 01:28:28,199
uh I I wonder scientifically how many
 

4905
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:29,629
uh I I wonder scientifically how many
firsts

4906
01:28:29,629 --> 01:28:29,639
firsts
 

4907
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:31,910
firsts
we truly know of

4908
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:31,920
we truly know of
 

4909
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,950
we truly know of
like and then we don't eventually

4910
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:33,960
like and then we don't eventually
 

4911
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:37,370
like and then we don't eventually
explain as as actually

4912
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:37,380
explain as as actually
 

4913
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:41,450
explain as as actually
a a step number one million in a long

4914
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:41,460
a a step number one million in a long
 

4915
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,450
a a step number one million in a long
process so I think that's a really

4916
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:44,460
process so I think that's a really
 

4917
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,669
process so I think that's a really
interesting thing if there's truly first

4918
01:28:46,669 --> 01:28:46,679
interesting thing if there's truly first
 

4919
01:28:46,679 --> 01:28:48,890
interesting thing if there's truly first
in this universe like you know for us

4920
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:48,900
in this universe like you know for us
 

4921
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,810
in this universe like you know for us
the whatever happened at the Big Bang is

4922
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:50,820
the whatever happened at the Big Bang is
 

4923
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:53,570
the whatever happened at the Big Bang is
is a kind of first the origin of stuff

4924
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:53,580
is a kind of first the origin of stuff
 

4925
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,310
is a kind of first the origin of stuff
but it's just again

4926
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:55,320
but it's just again
 

4927
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,390
but it's just again
um

4928
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:56,400
um
 

4929
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,729
um
it seems like history shows that we'll

4930
01:28:58,729 --> 01:28:58,739
it seems like history shows that we'll
 

4931
01:28:58,739 --> 01:28:59,930
it seems like history shows that we'll
figure out that it's actually a

4932
01:28:59,930 --> 01:28:59,940
figure out that it's actually a
 

4933
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,129
figure out that it's actually a
continuation of something but then

4934
01:29:01,129 --> 01:29:01,139
continuation of something but then
 

4935
01:29:01,139 --> 01:29:03,350
continuation of something but then
physicists say that time is emergent and

4936
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:03,360
physicists say that time is emergent and
 

4937
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:06,110
physicists say that time is emergent and
then our causality and time is is a very

4938
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:06,120
then our causality and time is is a very
 

4939
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:07,610
then our causality and time is is a very
human kind of construct that's very

4940
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:07,620
human kind of construct that's very
 

4941
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:09,590
human kind of construct that's very
possible that all of this so there could

4942
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:09,600
possible that all of this so there could
 

4943
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,530
possible that all of this so there could
be really firsts of a thing to which we

4944
01:29:12,530 --> 01:29:12,540
be really firsts of a thing to which we
 

4945
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:14,450
be really firsts of a thing to which we
attach a name

4946
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:14,460
attach a name
 

4947
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:16,669
attach a name
so whatever we call life

4948
01:29:16,669 --> 01:29:16,679
so whatever we call life
 

4949
01:29:16,679 --> 01:29:19,310
so whatever we call life
maybe there is an origin of it yeah and

4950
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:19,320
maybe there is an origin of it yeah and
 

4951
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:20,870
maybe there is an origin of it yeah and
I would also say I'm open to the idea of

4952
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:20,880
I would also say I'm open to the idea of
 

4953
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:23,450
I would also say I'm open to the idea of
it being part of a continuation but the

4954
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:23,460
it being part of a continuation but the
 

4955
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,310
it being part of a continuation but the
continuation maybe is more broader and

4956
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:25,320
continuation maybe is more broader and
 

4957
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,229
continuation maybe is more broader and
it's a continuation of chemical systems

4958
01:29:27,229 --> 01:29:27,239
it's a continuation of chemical systems
 

4959
01:29:27,239 --> 01:29:29,750
it's a continuation of chemical systems
and chemical networks and what we we

4960
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:29,760
and chemical networks and what we we
 

4961
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,669
and chemical networks and what we we
call this one particular type of

4962
01:29:31,669 --> 01:29:31,679
call this one particular type of
 

4963
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,530
call this one particular type of
chemistry and this behavior of chemistry

4964
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:33,540
chemistry and this behavior of chemistry
 

4965
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,850
chemistry and this behavior of chemistry
life

4966
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:34,860
life
 

4967
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,310
life
um but it is just one manifestation of

4968
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:37,320
um but it is just one manifestation of
 

4969
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,530
um but it is just one manifestation of
all the trillions of possible

4970
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:39,540
all the trillions of possible
 

4971
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,870
all the trillions of possible
permutations in which chemical reactions

4972
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:41,880
permutations in which chemical reactions
 

4973
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:45,350
permutations in which chemical reactions
can occur and we we assert specialness

4974
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
can occur and we we assert specialness
 

4975
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,110
can occur and we we assert specialness
to it because that's what we are and so

4976
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:48,120
to it because that's what we are and so
 

4977
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,910
to it because that's what we are and so
this is also true of intelligence you

4978
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:49,920
this is also true of intelligence you
 

4979
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:51,169
this is also true of intelligence you
could extend the same thing and say you

4980
01:29:51,169 --> 01:29:51,179
could extend the same thing and say you
 

4981
01:29:51,179 --> 01:29:53,510
could extend the same thing and say you
know we're we're looking for intelligent

4982
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:53,520
know we're we're looking for intelligent
 

4983
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,830
know we're we're looking for intelligent
life in the universe and then you

4984
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:54,840
life in the universe and then you
 

4985
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,810
life in the universe and then you
started where does where do you define

4986
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:56,820
started where does where do you define
 

4987
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:58,610
started where does where do you define
intelligence where where's that

4988
01:29:58,610 --> 01:29:58,620
intelligence where where's that
 

4989
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:00,410
intelligence where where's that
Continuum of something that's really

4990
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:00,420
Continuum of something that's really
 

4991
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,169
Continuum of something that's really
like us are we alone there may be a

4992
01:30:03,169 --> 01:30:03,179
like us are we alone there may be a
 

4993
01:30:03,179 --> 01:30:04,729
like us are we alone there may be a
Continuum of chemical systems a

4994
01:30:04,729 --> 01:30:04,739
Continuum of chemical systems a
 

4995
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:08,990
Continuum of chemical systems a
Continuum of intelligences out there and

4996
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:09,000
Continuum of intelligences out there and
 

4997
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,570
Continuum of intelligences out there and
um we have to be careful of our own

4998
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:11,580
um we have to be careful of our own
 

4999
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,910
um we have to be careful of our own
arrogance of as of assuming specialness

5000
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920
arrogance of as of assuming specialness
 

5001
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,950
arrogance of as of assuming specialness
about what we are that we are some

5002
01:30:15,950 --> 01:30:15,960
about what we are that we are some
 

5003
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:20,149
about what we are that we are some
distinct category of phenomena whereas

5004
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:20,159
distinct category of phenomena whereas
 

5005
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:21,770
distinct category of phenomena whereas
the universe doesn't really care about

5006
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:21,780
the universe doesn't really care about
 

5007
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:24,050
the universe doesn't really care about
what category we are it's just doing

5008
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:24,060
what category we are it's just doing
 

5009
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:26,629
what category we are it's just doing
what it's doing and doing everything in

5010
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:26,639
what it's doing and doing everything in
 

5011
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:28,669
what it's doing and doing everything in
you know infinite infinite diversity and

5012
01:30:28,669 --> 01:30:28,679
you know infinite infinite diversity and
 

5013
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:30,050
you know infinite infinite diversity and
infinite combinations essentially what

5014
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,060
infinite combinations essentially what
 

5015
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:32,030
infinite combinations essentially what
it's doing and so we are we are taking

5016
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:32,040
it's doing and so we are we are taking
 

5017
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,270
it's doing and so we are we are taking
this one slice and saying No this has to

5018
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:35,280
this one slice and saying No this has to
 

5019
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,570
this one slice and saying No this has to
be treated separately and um I I'm open

5020
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:38,580
be treated separately and um I I'm open
 

5021
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,910
be treated separately and um I I'm open
to the idea that it could be a truly

5022
01:30:40,910 --> 01:30:40,920
to the idea that it could be a truly
 

5023
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,070
to the idea that it could be a truly
separate phenomena but it may just be

5024
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:43,080
separate phenomena but it may just be
 

5025
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,410
separate phenomena but it may just be
like uh like a snowflake every

5026
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:45,420
like uh like a snowflake every
 

5027
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:47,510
like uh like a snowflake every
snowflake's different it may just be

5028
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:47,520
snowflake's different it may just be
 

5029
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,310
snowflake's different it may just be
that this one particular

Continuum yeah maybe the algorithm of

5034
01:30:55,010 --> 01:30:55,020
Continuum yeah maybe the algorithm of
 

5035
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,229
Continuum yeah maybe the algorithm of
natural selection itself is an invention

5036
01:30:57,229 --> 01:30:57,239
natural selection itself is an invention
 

5037
01:30:57,239 --> 01:30:58,370
natural selection itself is an invention
of Earth

5038
01:30:58,370 --> 01:30:58,380
of Earth
 

5039
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,669
of Earth
I kind of also tend to suspect that this

5040
01:31:01,669 --> 01:31:01,679
I kind of also tend to suspect that this
 

5041
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,770
I kind of also tend to suspect that this
this whatever the algorithm is it kind

5042
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:03,780
this whatever the algorithm is it kind
 

5043
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:06,169
this whatever the algorithm is it kind
of operates at all levels throughout the

5044
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:06,179
of operates at all levels throughout the
 

5045
01:31:06,179 --> 01:31:09,050
of operates at all levels throughout the
Universe but maybe this is a very kind

5046
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:09,060
Universe but maybe this is a very kind
 

5047
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:12,530
Universe but maybe this is a very kind
of peculiar thing that

5048
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:12,540
of peculiar thing that
 

5049
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:13,310
of peculiar thing that
um

5050
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:13,320
um
 

5051
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,850
um
where there's a bunch of chemical

5052
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:15,860
where there's a bunch of chemical
 

5053
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:19,370
where there's a bunch of chemical
systems that compete against each other

5054
01:31:19,370 --> 01:31:19,380
systems that compete against each other
 

5055
01:31:19,380 --> 01:31:21,470
systems that compete against each other
somehow for survival under limited

01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:21,480
somehow for survival under limited
 

5057
01:31:21,480 --> 01:31:23,629
somehow for survival under limited
resources and that's a very Earth-like

5058
01:31:23,629 --> 01:31:23,639
resources and that's a very Earth-like
 

5059
01:31:23,639 --> 01:31:26,649
resources and that's a very Earth-like
thing we have a nice balance of there's

5060
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:26,659
thing we have a nice balance of there's
 

5061
01:31:26,659 --> 01:31:29,689
thing we have a nice balance of there's
a large number of resources enough to

5062
01:31:29,689 --> 01:31:29,699
a large number of resources enough to
 

5063
01:31:29,699 --> 01:31:30,830
a large number of resources enough to
have a bunch of different kinds of

5064
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:30,840
have a bunch of different kinds of
 

5065
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,169
have a bunch of different kinds of
systems competing but not so many that

5066
01:31:33,169 --> 01:31:33,179
systems competing but not so many that
 

5067
01:31:33,179 --> 01:31:34,729
systems competing but not so many that
uh

5068
01:31:34,729 --> 01:31:34,739
uh
 

5069
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:37,669
uh
they they get lazy yeah and maybe that's

5070
01:31:37,669 --> 01:31:37,679
they they get lazy yeah and maybe that's
 

5071
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,410
they they get lazy yeah and maybe that's
why bacteria were very lazy for a long

5072
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:39,420
why bacteria were very lazy for a long
 

5073
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:41,090
why bacteria were very lazy for a long
time maybe they had they didn't have

5074
01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:41,100
time maybe they had they didn't have
 

5075
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:43,910
time maybe they had they didn't have
much competition quite possibly I mean I

5076
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:43,920
much competition quite possibly I mean I
 

5077
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:47,030
much competition quite possibly I mean I
I tried to as as fun as it is to get

5078
01:31:47,030 --> 01:31:47,040
I tried to as as fun as it is to get
 

5079
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,310
I tried to as as fun as it is to get
into the speculation about

5080
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:49,320
into the speculation about
 

5081
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:52,250
into the speculation about
um the definitions of of life and what

5082
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:52,260
um the definitions of of life and what
 

5083
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:55,070
um the definitions of of life and what
life does and this gross network of

5084
01:31:55,070 --> 01:31:55,080
life does and this gross network of
 

5085
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,390
life does and this gross network of
possibilities

5086
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:56,400
possibilities
 

5087
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,970
possibilities
honestly for me the strongest argument

5088
01:31:58,970 --> 01:31:58,980
honestly for me the strongest argument
 

5089
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:03,050
honestly for me the strongest argument
for remaining agnostic is is to avoid

5090
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:03,060
for remaining agnostic is is to avoid
 

5091
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:05,750
for remaining agnostic is is to avoid
that that bias in assessing data and

5092
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:05,760
that that bias in assessing data and
 

5093
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,970
that that bias in assessing data and
we've seen we've seen it I mean first of

5094
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:07,980
we've seen we've seen it I mean first of
 

5095
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:10,310
we've seen we've seen it I mean first of
all I talked about my channel

5096
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:10,320
all I talked about my channel
 

5097
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,050
all I talked about my channel
um and uh maybe last year or two years

5098
01:32:12,050 --> 01:32:12,060
um and uh maybe last year or two years

01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:13,189
um and uh maybe last year or two years
ago you know he's a very famous

5100
01:32:13,189 --> 01:32:13,199
ago you know he's a very famous
 

5101
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,830

astronomer who in the 19th century was

5102
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:15,840
astronomer who in the 19th century was
 

5103
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:18,490
astronomer who in the 19th century was
claiming the evidence of canals on Mars

5104
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:18,500
claiming the evidence of canals on Mars
 

5105
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:21,830
claiming the evidence of canals on Mars
and from him from his perspective and

5106
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:21,840
and from him from his perspective and
 

5107
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,810
and from him from his perspective and
even at the time culturally it was

5108
01:32:23,810 --> 01:32:23,820
even at the time culturally it was
 

5109
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:25,669
even at the time culturally it was
widely accepted that Mars would of

5110
01:32:25,669 --> 01:32:25,679
widely accepted that Mars would of
 

5111
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,530
widely accepted that Mars would of
course have life I mean I think it's uh

5112
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:27,540
course have life I mean I think it's uh
 

5113
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,149
course have life I mean I think it's uh
seems silly to us but it was kind of

5114
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:29,159
seems silly to us but it was kind of
 

5115
01:32:29,159 --> 01:32:30,169
seems silly to us but it was kind of
similar arguments to what we're using

5116
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:30,179
similar arguments to what we're using
 

5117
01:32:30,179 --> 01:32:31,850
similar arguments to what we're using
now about exoplanets that well of course

5118
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:31,860
now about exoplanets that well of course
 

5119
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:34,129
now about exoplanets that well of course
there must be life in the universe how

5120
01:32:34,129 --> 01:32:34,139
there must be life in the universe how
 

5121
01:32:34,139 --> 01:32:35,629
there must be life in the universe how
could it just be here and so it seemed

5122
01:32:35,629 --> 01:32:35,639
could it just be here and so it seemed
 

5123
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:36,890
could it just be here and so it seemed
obvious to people that when you looked

5124
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:36,900
obvious to people that when you looked
 

5125
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,350
obvious to people that when you looked
at Mars with its polar caps even you

5126
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:39,360
at Mars with its polar caps even you
 

5127
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:42,290
at Mars with its polar caps even you
know its atmosphere had Seasons it

5128
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:42,300
know its atmosphere had Seasons it
 

5129
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:44,510
know its atmosphere had Seasons it
seemed obvious to them that that too

5130
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:44,520
seemed obvious to them that that too
 

5131
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,370
seemed obvious to them that that too
would be a place where life Not only was

5132
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:46,380
would be a place where life Not only was
 

5133
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:47,930
would be a place where life Not only was
present but had emerged to a

5134
01:32:47,930 --> 01:32:47,940
present but had emerged to a
 

5135
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,550
present but had emerged to a
civilization which actually was fairly

5136
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:49,560
civilization which actually was fairly
 

5137
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,410
civilization which actually was fairly
compromable in technology to our own

5138
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:51,420
compromable in technology to our own
 

5139
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:53,990
compromable in technology to our own
because it was building Canal systems

5140
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:54,000
because it was building Canal systems
 

5141
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,550
because it was building Canal systems
um of course a canal system seems a

5142
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:55,560
um of course a canal system seems a
 

5143
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:57,770
um of course a canal system seems a
bizarre tennis signature to us but it

5144
01:32:57,770 --> 01:32:57,780
bizarre tennis signature to us but it
 

5145
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:59,930
bizarre tennis signature to us but it
was a product of their time to them that

5146
01:32:59,930 --> 01:32:59,940
was a product of their time to them that
 

5147
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:02,209
was a product of their time to them that
was The Cutting Edge in technology it

5148
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:02,219
was The Cutting Edge in technology it
 

5149
01:33:02,219 --> 01:33:04,129
was The Cutting Edge in technology it
should be a warning shot actually a

01:33:04,129 --> 01:33:04,139
should be a warning shot actually a
 

5151
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:05,990
should be a warning shot actually a
little bit for us that if we think you

5152
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:06,000
little bit for us that if we think you
 

5153
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,270
little bit for us that if we think you
know solar panels or building star links

5154
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:08,280
know solar panels or building star links
 

5155

5188
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:43,980
him that in Boston that his eyesight was
 

5189
01:33:43,980 --> 01:33:45,649
him that in Boston that his eyesight was
you know absolutely spectacular so he

5190
01:33:45,649 --> 01:33:45,659
you know absolutely spectacular so he
 

5191
01:33:45,659 --> 01:33:47,450
you know absolutely spectacular so he
just was convinced everything he saw was

5192
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:47,460
just was convinced everything he saw was
 

5193
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,010
just was convinced everything he saw was
was real

5194
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:49,020
was real
 

5195
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,169
was real
um and secondly he was convinced there

5196
01:33:51,169 --> 01:33:51,179
um and secondly he was convinced there
 

5197
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:53,570
um and secondly he was convinced there
was life there and so it to him it just

5198
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:53,580
was life there and so it to him it just
 

5199
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:55,669
was life there and so it to him it just
added up and then that kind of wasted

5200
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:55,679
added up and then that kind of wasted
 

5201
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:58,070
added up and then that kind of wasted
you know Decades of research of of

5202
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:58,080
you know Decades of research of of
 

5203
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,709
you know Decades of research of of
treating the idea of Mars being

5204
01:34:00,709 --> 01:34:00,719
treating the idea of Mars being
 

5205
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,770
treating the idea of Mars being
inhabited by this canal civilization

5206
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:03,780
inhabited by this canal civilization
 

5207
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:04,970
inhabited by this canal civilization
um but on the other hand it's maybe not

5208
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:04,980
um but on the other hand it's maybe not
 

5209
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,470
um but on the other hand it's maybe not
a waste because it is a lesson in

5210
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:06,480
a waste because it is a lesson in
 

5211
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,870
a waste because it is a lesson in
history of how we should be always on

5212
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:08,880
history of how we should be always on
 

5213
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,510
history of how we should be always on
guard against our own preconceptions and

5214
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:11,520
guard against our own preconceptions and
 

5215
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:13,910
guard against our own preconceptions and
biases about what yeah whether life is

5216
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:13,920
biases about what yeah whether life is
 

5217
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,070
biases about what yeah whether life is
out there and furthermore what types of

5218
01:34:16,070 --> 01:34:16,080
out there and furthermore what types of
 

5219
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,649
out there and furthermore what types of
things life might do if it is there

5220
01:34:18,649 --> 01:34:18,659
things life might do if it is there
 

5221
01:34:18,659 --> 01:34:20,810
things life might do if it is there
if I were running this simulation which

5222
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:20,820
if I were running this simulation which
 

5223
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,189
if I were running this simulation which
we'll also talk about because you make

5224
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:22,199
we'll also talk about because you make
 

5225
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:24,229
we'll also talk about because you make
the case against it but if I'm running a

5226
01:34:24,229 --> 01:34:24,239
the case against it but if I'm running a
 

5227
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:25,790
the case against it but if I'm running a
simulation I would definitely put you in

5228
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:25,800
simulation I would definitely put you in
 

5229
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,890
simulation I would definitely put you in
a room with an alien it's just to see

5230
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:27,900
a room with an alien it's just to see
 

5231
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,689
a room with an alien it's just to see
you mentally freak out for hours at a

5232
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:29,699
you mentally freak out for hours at a
 

5233
01:34:29,699 --> 01:34:32,090
you mentally freak out for hours at a
time oh you for sure would have thought

5234
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:32,100
time oh you for sure would have thought
 

5235
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,149
time oh you for sure would have thought
you will be convinced that you've lost

5236
01:34:35,149 --> 01:34:35,159
you will be convinced that you've lost
 

5237
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:38,330
you will be convinced that you've lost
your mind I mean no not not that but I

5238
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:38,340
your mind I mean no not not that but I
 

5239
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,610
your mind I mean no not not that but I
mean like if we discover Life we

5240
01:34:40,610 --> 01:34:40,620
mean like if we discover Life we
 

5241
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,050
mean like if we discover Life we
discovered interesting new physical

5242
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:42,060
discovered interesting new physical
 

5243
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:43,910
discovered interesting new physical
phenomena I think the right approach is

5244
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:43,920
phenomena I think the right approach is
 

5245
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:45,770
phenomena I think the right approach is
definitely to be extremely skeptical and

5246
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:45,780
definitely to be extremely skeptical and
 

5247
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:47,750
definitely to be extremely skeptical and
be very very careful about things you

5248
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:47,760
be very very careful about things you
 

5249
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,970
be very very careful about things you
want to be true that's that's yeah I

5250
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:49,980
want to be true that's that's yeah I
 

5251
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:51,590
want to be true that's that's yeah I
would say I'm not like some extreme

5252
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:51,600
would say I'm not like some extreme
 

5253
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,110
would say I'm not like some extreme
denialist of evidence if there was if

5254
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:54,120
denialist of evidence if there was if
 

5255
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:55,970
denialist of evidence if there was if
there was compelling evidence for life

5256
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:55,980
there was compelling evidence for life
 

5257
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:58,310
there was compelling evidence for life
on another planet I would be the first

5258
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:58,320
on another planet I would be the first
 

5259
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,169
on another planet I would be the first
one to be celebrating that and be

5260
01:35:00,169 --> 01:35:00,179
one to be celebrating that and be
 

5261
01:35:00,179 --> 01:35:01,550
one to be celebrating that and be
shaking hands with the alien on the

5262
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:01,560
shaking hands with the alien on the
 

5263
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,870
shaking hands with the alien on the
White House alone whatever that would be

5264
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:02,880
White House alone whatever that would be
 

5265
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:05,330
White House alone whatever that would be
you know I grew up with Star Trek and

5266
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:05,340
you know I grew up with Star Trek and
 

5267
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:07,850
you know I grew up with Star Trek and
that was my fantasy was to you know be

5268
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:07,860
that was my fantasy was to you know be
 

5269
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,410
that was my fantasy was to you know be
Captain Kirk and fly across the Stars

5270
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:09,420
Captain Kirk and fly across the Stars
 

5271
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,149
Captain Kirk and fly across the Stars
meaning of the civilization so there's

5272
01:35:11,149 --> 01:35:11,159
meaning of the civilization so there's
 

5273
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:12,950
meaning of the civilization so there's
nothing more I'd want to be true as I've

5274
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:12,960
nothing more I'd want to be true as I've
 

5275
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,510
nothing more I'd want to be true as I've
said but um

5276
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:14,520
said but um
 

5277
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,689
said but um
we we just have to guard against it when

5278
01:35:17,689 --> 01:35:17,699
we we just have to guard against it when
 

5279
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:19,610
we we just have to guard against it when
we're we're assessing data

5280
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:19,620
we're we're assessing data
 

5281
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:22,910
we're we're assessing data
um but uh I'm I have to say I'm very

5282
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:22,920
um but uh I'm I have to say I'm very
 

5283
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,970
um but uh I'm I have to say I'm very
skeptical that we will ever have that uh

5284
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:25,980
skeptical that we will ever have that uh
 

5285
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:28,250
skeptical that we will ever have that uh
Star Trek moment even if even if there

5286
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:28,260
Star Trek moment even if even if there
 

5287
01:35:28,260 --> 01:35:30,649
Star Trek moment even if even if there
are other civilizations out there

5288
01:35:30,649 --> 01:35:30,659
are other civilizations out there
 

5289
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:32,930
are other civilizations out there
they're never going to be at a point

5290
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:32,940
they're never going to be at a point
 

5291
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,729
they're never going to be at a point
which is in technological lock step with

5292
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:34,739
which is in technological lock step with
 

5293
01:35:34,739 --> 01:35:38,470
which is in technological lock step with
us similar level development even uh

5294
01:35:38,470 --> 01:35:38,480
us similar level development even uh
 

5295
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,930
us similar level development even uh
intellectually the idea that they could

5296
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:40,940
intellectually the idea that they could
 

5297
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:43,490
intellectually the idea that they could
uh have a conversation with us even

5298
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:43,500
uh have a conversation with us even
 

5299
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,770
uh have a conversation with us even
through a translator I mean we can't

5300
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:45,780
through a translator I mean we can't
 

5301
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:47,810
through a translator I mean we can't
communicate with humpback whales we

5302
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:47,820
communicate with humpback whales we
 

5303
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:48,950
communicate with humpback whales we
can't get rid of dolphins in a

5304
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:48,960
can't get rid of dolphins in a
 

5305
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,330
can't get rid of dolphins in a
meaningful way we can sort of bark

5306
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:50,340
meaningful way we can sort of bark
 

5307
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:52,970
meaningful way we can sort of bark
orders at them but we can't uh have

5308
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:52,980
orders at them but we can't uh have
 

5309
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,890
orders at them but we can't uh have
abstract conversations with them about

5310
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:54,900
abstract conversations with them about
 

5311
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:56,209
abstract conversations with them about
things

5312
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:56,219
things
 

5313
01:35:56,219 --> 01:35:58,610
things
um and so the idea that we will ever

5314
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:58,620
um and so the idea that we will ever
 

5315
01:35:58,620 --> 01:36:02,030
um and so the idea that we will ever
have that fulfilling conversation I'm

5316
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:02,040
have that fulfilling conversation I'm
 

5317
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:04,310
have that fulfilling conversation I'm
deeply skeptical of and I think a lot of

5318
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,320
deeply skeptical of and I think a lot of
 

5319
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:05,750
deeply skeptical of and I think a lot of
us are drawn to that it is maybe a

5320
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:05,760
us are drawn to that it is maybe a
 

5321
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,970
us are drawn to that it is maybe a
replacement for God to some degree that

5322
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:07,980
replacement for God to some degree that
 

5323
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:09,890
replacement for God to some degree that
that Father Figure civilization that

5324
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:09,900
that Father Figure civilization that
 

5325
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,530
that Father Figure civilization that
might step in teach us there of our ways

5326
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:12,540
might step in teach us there of our ways
 

5327
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,950
might step in teach us there of our ways
and bestow wisdom Upon Our civilization

5328
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:14,960
and bestow wisdom Upon Our civilization
 

5329
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,570
and bestow wisdom Upon Our civilization
but they could equally be a giant fungus

5330
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:17,580
but they could equally be a giant fungus
 

5331
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:20,090
but they could equally be a giant fungus
that has doesn't even understand the

5332
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:20,100
that has doesn't even understand the
 

5333
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:22,250
that has doesn't even understand the
idea of social socialization because

5334
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:22,260
idea of social socialization because
 

5335
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,530
idea of social socialization because
it's the only entity on its Planet it

5336
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:24,540
it's the only entity on its Planet it
 

5337
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:28,250
it's the only entity on its Planet it
just swells over the entire surface and

5338
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:28,260
just swells over the entire surface and
 

5339
01:36:28,260 --> 01:36:30,350
just swells over the entire surface and
it doesn't it's incredibly intelligent

5340
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:30,360
it doesn't it's incredibly intelligent
 

5341
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,030
it doesn't it's incredibly intelligent
because maybe each node communicates

5342
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:32,040
because maybe each node communicates

01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,470
because maybe each node communicates
with each other to create essentially a

5344
01:36:33,470 --> 01:36:33,480
with each other to create essentially a
 

5345
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:37,189
with each other to create essentially a
giant neural net but it has no sense of

01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:37,199
giant neural net but it has no sense of
 

5347
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:39,590
giant neural net but it has no sense of
what communication even is and so

5348
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:39,600
what communication even is and so
 

5349
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,510
what communication even is and so
alien life is out there is surely going

5350
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:41,520
alien life is out there is surely going
 

5351
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,189
alien life is out there is surely going
to be extremely diverse I'm pretty

5352
01:36:43,189 --> 01:36:43,199
to be extremely diverse I'm pretty
 

5353
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:45,709
to be extremely diverse I'm pretty
skeptical that we'll ever get that that

5354
01:36:45,709 --> 01:36:45,719
skeptical that we'll ever get that that
 

5355
01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:48,169
skeptical that we'll ever get that that
fantasy moment I always had as a kid of

5356
01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:48,179
fantasy moment I always had as a kid of
 

5357
01:36:48,179 --> 01:36:49,970
fantasy moment I always had as a kid of
having a dialogue within the

5358
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:49,980
having a dialogue within the
 

5359
01:36:49,980 --> 01:36:53,030
having a dialogue within the
civilization so dialogue uh yes what

5360
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,040
civilization so dialogue uh yes what
 

5361
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,830
civilization so dialogue uh yes what
about noticing them what about noticing

signals do you hope so one thing we've

5364
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:58,380
signals do you hope so one thing we've
 

5365
01:36:58,380 --> 01:36:59,990
signals do you hope so one thing we've
been talking about is getting signatures

5366
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:00,000
been talking about is getting signatures
 

5367
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,610
been talking about is getting signatures
biosignature techno signatures about

biosignature techno signatures about
 

5369
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:04,850
biosignature techno signatures about
other planets maybe if we're extremely

5370
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:04,860
other planets maybe if we're extremely
 

5371
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:06,830
other planets maybe if we're extremely

life forms
 

5375
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:11,750
life forms
uh get evidence of living or dead life

5376
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:11,760
uh get evidence of living or dead life
 

5377
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,209
uh get evidence of living or dead life

01:37:15,950 --> 01:37:15,960
and Saturn what about getting signals
 

5381
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:18,530
and Saturn what about getting signals
from outer space Interstellar signals uh

5382
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:18,540
from outer space Interstellar signals uh
 

5383
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:20,090
from outer space Interstellar signals uh
what kind of what would those signals

5384
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:20,100
what kind of what would those signals
 

5385
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:21,669
what kind of what would those signals
potentially look like

5386
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:21,679
potentially look like
 

5387
01:37:21,679 --> 01:37:23,810
potentially look like
that's a hard question to answer because

5388
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:23,820
that's a hard question to answer because
 

5389
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:26,209
that's a hard question to answer because
we are we essentially engaging in Xeno

5390
01:37:26,209 --> 01:37:26,219
we are we essentially engaging in Xeno
 

5391
01:37:26,219 --> 01:37:27,950
we are we essentially engaging in Xeno
psychology to some degree what are the

5392
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:27,960
psychology to some degree what are the
 

5393
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:31,010
psychology to some degree what are the
activities of another civilization

5394
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:31,020
activities of another civilization
 

5395
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:32,689
activities of another civilization
but a lot of that is in other words

5396
01:37:32,689 --> 01:37:32,699
but a lot of that is in other words

01:37:34,669 --> 01:37:34,679
xenopsychology I apologize to interrupt
 

5399
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:37,129
xenopsychology I apologize to interrupt
mean maybe I'm just fabricating that

5400
01:37:37,129 --> 01:37:37,139
mean maybe I'm just fabricating that
 

5401
01:37:37,139 --> 01:37:39,110
mean maybe I'm just fabricating that
word really but they're trying to guess

5402
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:39,120
word really but they're trying to guess
 

5403
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,250
word really but they're trying to guess
at the

5404
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:40,260
at the
 

5405
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,070
at the
um the machinations and motivations of

5406
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:43,080
um the machinations and motivations of
 

5407
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,770
um the machinations and motivations of
another intelligent being that was

5408
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:45,780
another intelligent being that was
 

5409
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:48,350
another intelligent being that was
completely evolutionary divorced from us

5410
01:37:48,350 --> 01:37:48,360
completely evolutionary divorced from us
 

5411
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:50,570
completely evolutionary divorced from us
so it's like like you said EXO moons

5412
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:50,580
so it's like like you said EXO moons
 

5413
01:37:50,580 --> 01:37:52,729
so it's like like you said EXO moons
it's exop psychology extrasolar yeah

5414
01:37:52,729 --> 01:37:52,739
it's exop psychology extrasolar yeah
 

5415
01:37:52,739 --> 01:37:55,490
it's exop psychology extrasolar yeah
psychology yeah uh Alien psychology is

5416
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:55,500
psychology yeah uh Alien psychology is
 

5417
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,750
psychology yeah uh Alien psychology is
another way of maybe making it more

5418
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:56,760
another way of maybe making it more
 

5419
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,189
another way of maybe making it more
grounded but

5420
01:37:58,189 --> 01:37:58,199
grounded but
 

5421
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:01,430
grounded but
um the it we we can't really guess at

5422
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:01,440
um the it we we can't really guess at
 

5423
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,350
um the it we we can't really guess at
their their motivations too well but we

5424
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
their their motivations too well but we
 

5425
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,970
their their motivations too well but we
can look at the sorts of behaviors we

5426
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:04,980
can look at the sorts of behaviors we
 

5427
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:07,910
can look at the sorts of behaviors we
engage in and at least look for them

5428
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:07,920
engage in and at least look for them
 

5429
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,410
engage in and at least look for them
um we're always guilty that when we look

5430
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:09,420
um we're always guilty that when we look
 

5431
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:10,970
um we're always guilty that when we look
for buyer signatures we're really

5432
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:10,980
for buyer signatures we're really
 

5433
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:12,830
for buyer signatures we're really
looking for and even when we look for

5434
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:12,840
looking for and even when we look for
 

5435
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,209
looking for and even when we look for
planets we're looking for templates of

5436
01:38:14,209 --> 01:38:14,219
planets we're looking for templates of
 

5437
01:38:14,219 --> 01:38:15,950
planets we're looking for templates of
earth when we look for bias signatures

5438
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:15,960
earth when we look for bias signatures
 

5439
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:16,970
earth when we look for bias signatures
we're looking for templates of

5440
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:16,980
we're looking for templates of
 

5441
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:18,709
we're looking for templates of
earth-based life when we look for

5442
01:38:18,709 --> 01:38:18,719
earth-based life when we look for
 

5443
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:20,030
earth-based life when we look for
tetanus signatures we tend to be looking

5444
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:20,040
tetanus signatures we tend to be looking
 

5445
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:22,370
tetanus signatures we tend to be looking
for templates of our own behaviors or

5446
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:22,380
for templates of our own behaviors or
 

5447
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:24,890
for templates of our own behaviors or
extrapolations of our behaviors

5448
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:24,900
extrapolations of our behaviors
 

5449
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:27,830
extrapolations of our behaviors
um so exactly there's a very long list

5450
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:27,840
um so exactly there's a very long list
 

5451
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,750
um so exactly there's a very long list
of tender signatures that people have

5452
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:29,760
of tender signatures that people have
 

5453
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,550
of tender signatures that people have
suggested we could look for the the

5454
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:31,560
suggested we could look for the the
 

5455
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,169
suggested we could look for the the
earliest ones were of course radio

5456
01:38:33,169 --> 01:38:33,179
earliest ones were of course radio
 

5457
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:35,810
earliest ones were of course radio
beacons that were sort of project osma

5458
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:35,820

5459
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,149

01:38:38,149 --> 01:38:38,159
that Frank Drake was involved in I'm
 

5461
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:39,530
that Frank Drake was involved in I'm
trying to look for radio signatures

5462
01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:39,540
trying to look for radio signatures
 

5463
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:42,050
trying to look for radio signatures
which could either be

5464
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:42,060
which could either be
 

5465
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:44,390
which could either be
um just like blurting out high power

5466
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:44,400
um just like blurting out high power
 

5467
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,070
um just like blurting out high power
radio thing I was saying hey we're here

5468
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
radio thing I was saying hey we're here
 

5469
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,530
radio thing I was saying hey we're here
or could even have encoded within um

5470
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:48,540
or could even have encoded within um
 

5471
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:50,689
or could even have encoded within um

01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:56,760
um but there could also be unintentional
 

5479
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,610

5481
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:00,290
signatures
um for example you could have something

5482
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:00,300
um for example you could have something
 

5483
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:01,729
um for example you could have something
like the satellite system that we've

5484
01:39:01,729 --> 01:39:01,739
like the satellite system that we've
 

5485
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:02,810
like the satellite system that we've
produced around the earth artificial

we mentioned you could detect the glint

5490
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:07,620
we mentioned you could detect the glint
 

5491
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,770
we mentioned you could detect the glint
of lights across those satellites as

of lights across those satellites as
 

5493
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:11,709
of lights across those satellites as
they orbit around the planet

5494
01:39:11,709 --> 01:39:11,719
they orbit around the planet
 

5495
01:39:11,719 --> 01:39:14,629
they orbit around the planet
you could set to geostationary satellite

5496
01:39:14,629 --> 01:39:14,639
you could set to geostationary satellite
 

5497
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,550
you could set to geostationary satellite

you could detect solar panels

5502
01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:20,340
you could detect solar panels
 

5503
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:22,430
you could detect solar panels
potentially spectrally on the surface of

5504
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:22,440
potentially spectrally on the surface of
 

5505
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,649
potentially spectrally on the surface of
the planet heat island effects New York

5506
01:39:24,649 --> 01:39:24,659
the planet heat island effects New York
 

5507
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:26,629
the planet heat island effects New York
is hotter than New York state by a

5508
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:26,639
is hotter than New York state by a
 

5509
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:27,709
is hotter than New York state by a
couple of degrees because the heat

5510
01:39:27,709 --> 01:39:27,719
couple of degrees because the heat
 

5511
01:39:27,719 --> 01:39:29,390
couple of degrees because the heat
island are fair to the city and so you

5512
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:29,400
island are fair to the city and so you
 

5513
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:31,790
island are fair to the city and so you
could thermally map different planets

5514
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:31,800
could thermally map different planets
 

5515
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:34,070
could thermally map different planets
and detect these so there's a large

5516
01:39:34,070 --> 01:39:34,080
and detect these so there's a large
 

5517
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:38,090
and detect these so there's a large
array of things that we do that we can

5518
01:39:38,090 --> 01:39:38,100
array of things that we do that we can
 

5519
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:40,430
array of things that we do that we can
go out and hypothesize we could look for

5520
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:40,440
go out and hypothesize we could look for
 

5521
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:42,649
go out and hypothesize we could look for
and then on the furthest end of the

5522
01:39:42,649 --> 01:39:42,659
and then on the furthest end of the
 

5523
01:39:42,659 --> 01:39:44,209
and then on the furthest end of the
scale you have things which go far

5524
01:39:44,209 --> 01:39:44,219
scale you have things which go far
 

5525
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:47,450
scale you have things which go far
beyond their capabilities such as warp

5526
01:39:47,450 --> 01:39:47,460
beyond their capabilities such as warp
 

5527
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:48,950
beyond their capabilities such as warp
drive signatures which have been

5528
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:48,960
drive signatures which have been
 

5529
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,629
drive signatures which have been
proposed you get these bright flashes of

5530
01:39:50,629 --> 01:39:50,639
proposed you get these bright flashes of
 

5531
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:51,950
proposed you get these bright flashes of
light or even gravitational wave

5532
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:51,960
light or even gravitational wave
 

5533
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,890
light or even gravitational wave
detections from ligo could be detected

5534
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:54,900
detections from ligo could be detected
 

5535
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:57,649
detections from ligo could be detected
um you could have Dyson spheres the idea

5536
01:39:57,649 --> 01:39:57,659
um you could have Dyson spheres the idea
 

5537
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:59,930
um you could have Dyson spheres the idea
of covering it basically a star is

5538
01:39:59,930 --> 01:39:59,940
of covering it basically a star is
 

5539
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:01,550
of covering it basically a star is
completely covered by some kind of

5540
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:01,560
completely covered by some kind of
 

5541
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,930
completely covered by some kind of
structure which collects all this all

5542
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:02,940
structure which collects all this all
 

5543
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:04,370
structure which collects all this all
the light from the Star to power the

5544
01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:04,380
the light from the Star to power the
 

5545
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:07,129
the light from the Star to power the
civilization and that would be pretty

5546
01:40:07,129 --> 01:40:07,139
civilization and that would be pretty
 

5547
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:09,229
civilization and that would be pretty
easily detectable to some degree because

5548
01:40:09,229 --> 01:40:09,239
easily detectable to some degree because
 

5549
01:40:09,239 --> 01:40:11,810
easily detectable to some degree because
you're you're transferring all of the

5550
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:11,820
you're you're transferring all of the
 

5551
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:14,689
you're you're transferring all of the
visible light thermodynamically it has

5552
01:40:14,689 --> 01:40:14,699
visible light thermodynamically it has
 

5553
01:40:14,699 --> 01:40:16,129
visible light thermodynamically it has
to be re-emitted so it come out as

5554
01:40:16,129 --> 01:40:16,139
to be re-emitted so it come out as
 

5555
01:40:16,139 --> 01:40:18,169
to be re-emitted so it come out as
infrared light so you have an incredibly

5556
01:40:18,169 --> 01:40:18,179
infrared light so you have an incredibly
 

5557
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:21,050
infrared light so you have an incredibly
bright infrared star yet one that was

5558
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:21,060
bright infrared star yet one that was
 

5559
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:24,110
bright infrared star yet one that was
visibly not present at all and so there

5560
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:24,120
visibly not present at all and so there
 

5561
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,450
visibly not present at all and so there
would be a pretty intriguing signature

5562
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:26,460
would be a pretty intriguing signature
 

5563
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:29,090
would be a pretty intriguing signature
to look for but is there effort to look

5564
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:29,100
to look for but is there effort to look
 

5565
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:30,110
to look for but is there effort to look
for something like that for for

5566
01:40:30,110 --> 01:40:30,120
for something like that for for
 

5567
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,850
for something like that for for
different experience out there for with

5568
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:31,860
different experience out there for with
 

5569
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:34,010
different experience out there for with
the strong infrared signal there has

5570
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:34,020
the strong infrared signal there has
 

5571
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:35,870
the strong infrared signal there has
been yeah that has been and there's been

5572
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:35,880
been yeah that has been and there's been
 

5573
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,250
been yeah that has been and there's been
uh I think in the literature there was

5574
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:37,260
uh I think in the literature there was
 

5575
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:38,810
uh I think in the literature there was
one with the IRA satellite which is an

5576
01:40:38,810 --> 01:40:38,820
one with the IRA satellite which is an
 

5577
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:40,970
one with the IRA satellite which is an
infrared satellite they targeted I think

5578
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:40,980
infrared satellite they targeted I think
 

5579
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:43,729
infrared satellite they targeted I think
I've ordered 100 000 Stars uh nearby

5580
01:40:43,729 --> 01:40:43,739
I've ordered 100 000 Stars uh nearby
 

5581
01:40:43,739 --> 01:40:47,209
I've ordered 100 000 Stars uh nearby
stars and found no convincing examples

5582
01:40:47,209 --> 01:40:47,219
stars and found no convincing examples
 

5583
01:40:47,219 --> 01:40:48,830
stars and found no convincing examples
of what looked like a Dyson Sphere star

5584
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:48,840
of what looked like a Dyson Sphere star
 

5585
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,470
of what looked like a Dyson Sphere star
and then Jason Wright and his team um

5586
01:40:51,470 --> 01:40:51,480
and then Jason Wright and his team um
 

5587
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,870
and then Jason Wright and his team um
Extended this I think using wise which

5588
01:40:53,870 --> 01:40:53,880
Extended this I think using wise which
 

5589
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,790
Extended this I think using wise which
is another info satellite

5590
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:55,800
is another info satellite
 

5591
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,370
is another info satellite
um to look around galaxies so could an

5592
01:40:58,370 --> 01:40:58,380
um to look around galaxies so could an
 

5593
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:00,350
um to look around galaxies so could an
entire galaxy have been converted into

5594
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:00,360
entire galaxy have been converted into
 

5595
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,810
entire galaxy have been converted into
Dyson spheres or a significant fraction

5596
01:41:02,810 --> 01:41:02,820
Dyson spheres or a significant fraction
 

5597
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:04,910
Dyson spheres or a significant fraction
of the Galaxy which is basically the uh

5598
01:41:04,910 --> 01:41:04,920
of the Galaxy which is basically the uh
 

5599
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:07,129
of the Galaxy which is basically the uh
the kardashev type three right this is

5600
01:41:07,129 --> 01:41:07,139
the kardashev type three right this is
 

5601
01:41:07,139 --> 01:41:09,169
the kardashev type three right this is
the when you've basically mastered the

5602
01:41:09,169 --> 01:41:09,179
the when you've basically mastered the
 

5603
01:41:09,179 --> 01:41:12,530
the when you've basically mastered the
entire Galactic pool of resources and uh

5604
01:41:12,530 --> 01:41:12,540
entire Galactic pool of resources and uh
 

5605
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:14,450

again out of a hundred thousand nearby

5606
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:14,460
again out of a hundred thousand nearby
 

5607
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:16,310
again out of a hundred thousand nearby
galaxies there appears to be no

5608
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:16,320
galaxies there appears to be no
 

5609
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,649

compelling examples of what looks like a

5610
01:41:18,649 --> 01:41:18,659
compelling examples of what looks like a
 

5611
01:41:18,659 --> 01:41:21,290
compelling examples of what looks like a
Dyson Galaxy if you want to call it that

5612
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:21,300
Dyson Galaxy if you want to call it that
 

5613
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,890
Dyson Galaxy if you want to call it that
um so that by no means uh proves that

5614
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:24,900
um so that by no means uh proves that
 

5615
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:27,890
um so that by no means uh proves that
they don't exist or don't happen but it

5616
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:27,900
they don't exist or don't happen but it
 

5617
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:30,350
they don't exist or don't happen but it
seems like it's an unusual behavior for

01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:30,360
seems like it's an unusual behavior for
 

5619
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:32,270
seems like it's an unusual behavior for
civilization mission to get to that

civilization mission to get to that
 

5621
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:33,709
civilization mission to get to that
stage of development and start

01:41:33,709 --> 01:41:33,719
stage of development and start
 

5623
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:36,410

harvesting the entire Stellar output
 

5625
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:39,709

unusual yes and I mean ligo is super

5626
01:41:39,709 --> 01:41:39,719
unusual yes and I mean ligo is super
 

5627
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:42,709
unusual yes and I mean ligo is super
interesting with gravitational waves if

5628
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:42,719
interesting with gravitational waves if
 

5629
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:44,090
interesting with gravitational waves if
that kind of experiment could start

5630
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:44,100
that kind of experiment could start
 

5631
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,870
that kind of experiment could start
seeing some weirdness some weird signals

01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:53,750
some that compare to the to the power of
the cosmic phenomena yeah yeah I mean

5636
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
the cosmic phenomena yeah yeah I mean
 

5637
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,490
the cosmic phenomena yeah yeah I mean
it's a whole new window to the universe

5638
01:41:55,490 --> 01:41:55,500
it's a whole new window to the universe
 

5639
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,410
it's a whole new window to the universe
not just in terms of astrophysics but

01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:01,020
well I have to say with the with the
 

5645
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:03,229
well I have to say with the with the
warp drives I am skeptical that warp

5646
01:42:03,229 --> 01:42:03,239
warp drives I am skeptical that warp

those three things you really can't have
 

5659
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:17,510
those three things you really can't have
all three in a coherent Universe if you

5660
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:17,520
all three in a coherent Universe if you
 

5661
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,250
all three in a coherent Universe if you
have all three you basically end up with

5662
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:19,260
have all three you basically end up with
 

5663
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:20,390
have all three you basically end up with
the possibility of these kind of

5664
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:20,400
the possibility of these kind of
 

5665
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,250
the possibility of these kind of
temporal paradoxes and time loops and

5666
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:22,260
temporal paradoxes and time loops and
 

5667
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:24,229
temporal paradoxes and time loops and
grandfather paradoxes working therapy

5668
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:24,239
grandfather paradoxes working therapy
 

5669
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:26,149

pockets of causality something like that

5670
01:42:26,149 --> 01:42:26,159
pockets of causality something like that
 

5671
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:29,030
pockets of causality something like that
like where there's uh like pockets of

5672
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:29,040
like where there's uh like pockets of
 

5673
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,890
like where there's uh like pockets of
consistent causality you could design it

5674
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:30,900
consistent causality you could design it
 

5675
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:32,810
consistent causality you could design it
in that way you could be you know if you

5676
01:42:32,810 --> 01:42:32,820
in that way you could be you know if you
 

5677
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:34,250
in that way you could be you know if you
had a warp drive or a time machine

5678
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:34,260
had a warp drive or a time machine
 

5679
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,050
had a warp drive or a time machine
essentially you could be

5680
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:36,060
essentially you could be
 

5681
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:37,850
essentially you could be
um you know you can be very conscious

5682
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:37,860
um you know you can be very conscious
 

5683
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:40,550
um you know you can be very conscious
and careful of the way you use it so as

5684
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:40,560
and careful of the way you use it so as
 

5685
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,890
and careful of the way you use it so as
to not to cause paradoxes or just do it

5686
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:42,900
to not to cause paradoxes or just do it
 

5687
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:45,290
to not to cause paradoxes or just do it
in a local area or something but the

5688
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:45,300
in a local area or something but the
 

5689
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,910
in a local area or something but the
real fundamental problem is you always

5690
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:46,920
real fundamental problem is you always
 

5691
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,510
real fundamental problem is you always
have the ability to do it and so in a in

5692
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:50,520
have the ability to do it and so in a in
 

5693
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,149
have the ability to do it and so in a in
a vast Cosmic Universe if time machines

5694
01:42:53,149 --> 01:42:53,159
a vast Cosmic Universe if time machines
 

5695
01:42:53,159 --> 01:42:56,330
a vast Cosmic Universe if time machines
were all over the place uh that there's

5696
01:42:56,330 --> 01:42:56,340
were all over the place uh that there's
 

5697
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:58,250
were all over the place uh that there's
too much risk of someone doing it right

5698
01:42:58,250 --> 01:42:58,260
too much risk of someone doing it right
 

5699
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,350
too much risk of someone doing it right
of somebody having the option of

5700
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:00,360
of somebody having the option of
 

5701
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,510
of somebody having the option of
essentially breaking the universe with

01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:02,520
essentially breaking the universe with
 

5703
01:43:02,520 --> 01:43:04,609
essentially breaking the universe with
it with this so there's a fundamental

5704
01:43:04,609 --> 01:43:04,619
it with this so there's a fundamental
 

5705
01:43:04,619 --> 01:43:06,530
it with this so there's a fundamental

01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:08,520
protection conjecture where he said that
 

5709
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:11,750
protection conjecture where he said that
essentially that it's this just can't be

essentially that it's this just can't be
 

5711
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,490
essentially that it's this just can't be
allowed because it breaks it breaks all

5712
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:13,500
allowed because it breaks it breaks all

our laws of physics if time travel is

5714
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:15,360
our laws of physics if time travel is
 

5715
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,270
our laws of physics if time travel is
possible current laws of physics yes

5716
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:17,280
possible current laws of physics yes
 

5717
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:20,689
possible current laws of physics yes
correct yeah um and so we need to rip at

5718
01:43:20,689 --> 01:43:20,699
correct yeah um and so we need to rip at
 

5719
01:43:20,699 --> 01:43:21,890
correct yeah um and so we need to rip at
relativity I mean that's the point is

5720
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:21,900
relativity I mean that's the point is
 

5721
01:43:21,900 --> 01:43:23,030
relativity I mean that's the point is
the current law is physics so you'd have

5722
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:23,040
the current law is physics so you'd have
 

5723
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,770
the current law is physics so you'd have
to rip up our current law of relativity

5724
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:24,780
to rip up our current law of relativity
 

5725
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:27,590
to rip up our current law of relativity
to make sense of how FDL could live in

5726
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:27,600
to make sense of how FDL could live in
 

5727
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,850
to make sense of how FDL could live in
that Universe because you can't have

5728
01:43:28,850 --> 01:43:28,860
that Universe because you can't have
 

5729
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:31,729
that Universe because you can't have
relativity FTL and causality sit nice

5730
01:43:31,729 --> 01:43:31,739
relativity FTL and causality sit nice
 

5731
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:34,250
relativity FTL and causality sit nice
and play nicely together

5732
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:34,260
and play nicely together
 

5733
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,950
and play nicely together
but we're currently don't have quantum

5734
01:43:36,950 --> 01:43:36,960
but we're currently don't have quantum
 

5735
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,390
but we're currently don't have quantum
mechanics and relativity playing nice

5736
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,400
mechanics and relativity playing nice
 

5737
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,709
mechanics and relativity playing nice
together anyway so it's not like

5738
01:43:39,709 --> 01:43:39,719
together anyway so it's not like
 

5739
01:43:39,719 --> 01:43:41,629
together anyway so it's not like
everything is all a nice little fact

5740
01:43:41,629 --> 01:43:41,639
everything is all a nice little fact
 

5741
01:43:41,639 --> 01:43:42,649
everything is all a nice little fact
it's certainly not the full picture

5742
01:43:42,649 --> 01:43:42,659
it's certainly not the full picture
 

5743
01:43:42,659 --> 01:43:45,830
it's certainly not the full picture
there must be more to go yeah but

5744
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:45,840
there must be more to go yeah but
 

5745
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,810
there must be more to go yeah but
um so it's already ripped up so might as

5746
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:47,820
um so it's already ripped up so might as
 

5747
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:49,550
um so it's already ripped up so might as
well rip it up a little more

5748
01:43:49,550 --> 01:43:49,560
well rip it up a little more
 

5749
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:52,129
well rip it up a little more
and then in the process actually try to

5750
01:43:52,129 --> 01:43:52,139
and then in the process actually try to
 

5751
01:43:52,139 --> 01:43:54,169
and then in the process actually try to
connect the two things because maybe in

5752
01:43:54,169 --> 01:43:54,179
connect the two things because maybe in
 

5753
01:43:54,179 --> 01:43:57,229
connect the two things because maybe in
the unification of uh of the standard

5754
01:43:57,229 --> 01:43:57,239
the unification of uh of the standard

01:43:57,239 --> 01:43:59,750
the unification of uh of the standard

01:43:59,750 --> 01:43:59,760

5757
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,010

their lies some kind of new wisdom about

5758
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:03,020
their lies some kind of new wisdom about
 

5759
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:05,629
their lies some kind of new wisdom about
of of about warp drive so by the way

5760
01:44:05,629 --> 01:44:05,639
of of about warp drive so by the way
 

5761
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:08,090
of of about warp drive so by the way
warp drives is somehow messing with the

5762
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:08,100
warp drives is somehow messing with the
 

5763
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:09,649
warp drives is somehow messing with the
fabric

5764
01:44:09,649 --> 01:44:09,659
fabric
 

5765
01:44:09,659 --> 01:44:11,270

of the universe to be able to travel

5766
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:11,280
of the universe to be able to travel
 

5767
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,090
of the universe to be able to travel
faster than the speed of light yeah

5768
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:13,100
faster than the speed of light yeah
 

5769
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:15,530
faster than the speed of light yeah
you're basically bending space-time you

5770
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:15,540
you're basically bending space-time you
 

5771
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,629
you're basically bending space-time you
could also do it with a wormhole or

5772
01:44:17,629 --> 01:44:17,639
could also do it with a wormhole or
 

5773
01:44:17,639 --> 01:44:20,330
could also do it with a wormhole or
attack you know some of the hypothetical

5778
01:44:24,530 --> 01:44:24,540
uh the Alki bear Drive the warp drive it
 

5779
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:26,270
uh the Alki bear Drive the warp drive it
could be any faster than my system as

5780
01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:26,280
could be any faster than my system as
 

5781
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:29,149
could be any faster than my system as
long as it travels super lumily it will

5782
01:44:29,149 --> 01:44:29,159
long as it travels super lumily it will
 

5783
01:44:29,159 --> 01:44:31,310
long as it travels super lumily it will
violate causality and presumably that

5784
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:31,320
violate causality and presumably that
 

5785
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:33,530
violate causality and presumably that

um I mean one problem with warp drives

5794
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:41,699
um I mean one problem with warp drives
 

5795
01:44:41,699 --> 01:44:43,129
um I mean one problem with warp drives
is there's all sorts of problems with

5796
01:44:43,129 --> 01:44:43,139
is there's all sorts of problems with
 

5797
01:44:43,139 --> 01:44:45,890
is there's all sorts of problems with
rock types but we're like the start of

5798
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:45,900
rock types but we're like the start of
 

5799
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,950
rock types but we're like the start of
that sentence one problem there's just

5800
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:48,960
that sentence one problem there's just
 

5801
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,810
that sentence one problem there's just
this one minor problem that we have to

5802
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:50,820
this one minor problem that we have to
 

5803
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:53,990
this one minor problem that we have to
get around but uh when it arrives at its

5804
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,000
get around but uh when it arrives at its
 

5805
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,510
get around but uh when it arrives at its
destination it basically collects this

5806
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:56,520
destination it basically collects this
 

5807
01:44:56,520 --> 01:44:59,149
destination it basically collects this
vast uh this has like an event horizon

5808
01:44:59,149 --> 01:44:59,159
vast uh this has like an event horizon
 

5809
01:44:59,159 --> 01:45:00,470
vast uh this has like an event horizon
almost at the front of it and so it

5810
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480
almost at the front of it and so it
 

5811
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:01,609
almost at the front of it and so it
collects all the collects all this

5812
01:45:01,609 --> 01:45:01,619
collects all the collects all this
 

5813
01:45:01,619 --> 01:45:03,770
collects all the collects all this
radiation at the front as it goes and

5814
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:03,780
radiation at the front as it goes and
 

5815
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:05,390
radiation at the front as it goes and
when it arrives all that radiation gets

5816
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:05,400
when it arrives all that radiation gets
 

5817
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,850
when it arrives all that radiation gets
dumped on its destination basically

5818
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:07,860
dumped on its destination basically
 

5819
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:10,550
dumped on its destination basically
completely exterminate the planet it

5820
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:10,560
completely exterminate the planet it
 

5821
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,810
completely exterminate the planet it
arrives at

5822
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:11,820
arrives at
 

5823
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:13,609
arrives at
um that radiation is also incident

5824
01:45:13,609 --> 01:45:13,619
um that radiation is also incident
 

5825
01:45:13,619 --> 01:45:15,470
um that radiation is also incident
within the shell itself there's Hawking

5826
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:15,480
within the shell itself there's Hawking
 

5827
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:17,209
within the shell itself there's Hawking
radiation occurring within the shell

5828
01:45:17,209 --> 01:45:17,219
radiation occurring within the shell
 

5829
01:45:17,219 --> 01:45:19,370
radiation occurring within the shell
which is pretty dangerous

5830
01:45:19,370 --> 01:45:19,380
which is pretty dangerous
 

5831
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,810
which is pretty dangerous
um and then you know it also has it

5832
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:20,820
um and then you know it also has it
 

5833
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:23,270
um and then you know it also has it
raises all sorts of exacerbations of the

01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:23,280
raises all sorts of exacerbations of the
 

5835
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,070
raises all sorts of exacerbations of the
Fermi Paradox of course as well so you

5836
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:25,080
Fermi Paradox of course as well so you
 

5837
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:27,530
Fermi Paradox of course as well so you
might be able to explain why we don't

5838
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:27,540
might be able to explain why we don't
 

5839
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:28,790
might be able to explain why we don't
see

5840
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:28,800
see
 

5841
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,310
see
um a Galactic Empire I mean even here

5842
01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:31,320
um a Galactic Empire I mean even here
 

5843
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,390
um a Galactic Empire I mean even here
it's hard you might be able to explain

5844
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:32,400
it's hard you might be able to explain
 

5845
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:33,890
it's hard you might be able to explain
why we don't see a Galactic Empire if

5846
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:33,900
why we don't see a Galactic Empire if
 

5847
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:37,010
why we don't see a Galactic Empire if
everybody's limited to Voyager 2 rocket

5848
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:37,020
everybody's limited to Voyager 2 rocket
 

5849
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:38,689
everybody's limited to Voyager 2 rocket
speeds of like 20 kilometers per second

5850
01:45:38,689 --> 01:45:38,699
speeds of like 20 kilometers per second
 

5851
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:41,030
speeds of like 20 kilometers per second
or something but it's a lot harder to

5852
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:41,040
or something but it's a lot harder to
 

5853
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:44,270
or something but it's a lot harder to
explain why we don't see the stars

5854
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:44,280
explain why we don't see the stars
 

5855
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:46,910
explain why we don't see the stars

when warp drive is imminently possible
 

5859
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:52,310
when warp drive is imminently possible
because it makes expansion so much more

01:46:10,729 --> 01:46:10,739
let it spread out at sublight speeds and
 

5877
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,890
let it spread out at sublight speeds and
actually the very mixing of the Stars

5878
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:12,900
actually the very mixing of the Stars
 

5879
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,149
actually the very mixing of the Stars
themselves because the stars are not

5880
01:46:14,149 --> 01:46:14,159
themselves because the stars are not
 

5881
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:15,890
themselves because the stars are not
static they're in orbit of the galactic

01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:15,900
static they're in orbit of the galactic
 

5883
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,050
static they're in orbit of the galactic
center and they have crossing paths with

5884
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:18,060
center and they have crossing paths with
 

5885
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:20,930
center and they have crossing paths with
each other if you just have a range of

5886
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:20,940
each other if you just have a range of
 

5887
01:46:20,940 --> 01:46:23,030
each other if you just have a range of
even like five light years and your

5888
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:23,040
even like five light years and your
 

5889
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,649
even like five light years and your
speed is of order of a few percent the

5890
01:46:24,649 --> 01:46:24,659
speed is of order of a few percent the
 

5891
01:46:24,659 --> 01:46:26,090
speed is of order of a few percent the
speed of light is the maximum you can

5892
01:46:26,090 --> 01:46:26,100
speed of light is the maximum you can
 

5893
01:46:26,100 --> 01:46:28,250
speed of light is the maximum you can
muster you can populate the entire

5894
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:28,260
muster you can populate the entire
 

5895
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:30,109
muster you can populate the entire
galaxy within something like a hundred

5896
01:46:30,109 --> 01:46:30,119
galaxy within something like a hundred
 

5897
01:46:30,119 --> 01:46:32,209
galaxy within something like a hundred
thousand to it about a million years or

5898
01:46:32,209 --> 01:46:32,219
thousand to it about a million years or
 

5899
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,490
thousand to it about a million years or
so so in order a fraction of the

5900
01:46:34,490 --> 01:46:34,500
so so in order a fraction of the
 

5901
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:37,189
so so in order a fraction of the
lifetime of the Galaxy itself and so

5902
01:46:37,189 --> 01:46:37,199
lifetime of the Galaxy itself and so
 

5903
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:40,669
lifetime of the Galaxy itself and so
this raises some uh fairly serious

5904
01:46:40,669 --> 01:46:40,679
this raises some uh fairly serious
 

5905
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:43,729
this raises some uh fairly serious
problems because if any civilization in

5906
01:46:43,729 --> 01:46:43,739
problems because if any civilization in
 

5907
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:45,830
problems because if any civilization in
the entire history of the uni of the

5908
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:45,840
the entire history of the uni of the
 

5909
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,470
the entire history of the uni of the
Galaxy decide to do that then you know

5910
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:48,480
Galaxy decide to do that then you know
 

5911
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,030
Galaxy decide to do that then you know
either we shouldn't be here or we happen

5912
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:50,040
either we shouldn't be here or we happen
 

5913
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,590
either we shouldn't be here or we happen
to live in this kind of rare pocket

5914
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:51,600
to live in this kind of rare pocket
 

5915
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,830
to live in this kind of rare pocket
where they chose not to populate to and

5916
01:46:54,830 --> 01:46:54,840
where they chose not to populate to and
 

5917
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,689
where they chose not to populate to and
so this is sometimes called fact a

5918
01:46:56,689 --> 01:46:56,699
so this is sometimes called fact a
 

5919
01:46:56,699 --> 01:46:58,550
so this is sometimes called fact a
heart's fact day

5920
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:58,560
heart's fact day
 

5921
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,250
heart's fact day
um as you know the fact a is that a

5922
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:01,260
um as you know the fact a is that a
 

5923
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,770
um as you know the fact a is that a
civilization is not here now an alien

5924
01:47:03,770 --> 01:47:03,780
civilization is not here now an alien
 

5925
01:47:03,780 --> 01:47:06,109
civilization is not here now an alien
civilization has not is not in present

5926
01:47:06,109 --> 01:47:06,119
civilization has not is not in present
 

5927
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:08,030
civilization has not is not in present
occupation of the earth and that's

5928
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:08,040
occupation of the earth and that's
 

5929
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,890
occupation of the earth and that's
difficult to

5930
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:09,900
difficult to
 

5931
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:13,010
difficult to
resolve with the apparent ease at which

5933
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:13,910
resolve with the apparent ease at which
even

01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:13,920
even

even
a small extrapolation of our own

a small extrapolation of our own
 

5937
01:47:15,659 --> 01:47:18,530
a small extrapolation of our own
technology could potentially populate a

01:47:22,619 --> 01:47:26,209

so to me by the way yeah the firmer

5944
01:47:26,209 --> 01:47:26,219
so to me by the way yeah the firmer
 

5945

so to me by the way yeah the firmer
Paradox is truly a paradox for me but

5946
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:29,760
Paradox is truly a paradox for me but
 

5947
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,410
Paradox is truly a paradox for me but
I suspect that if alien visited Earth

5948
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:33,420
I suspect that if alien visited Earth
 

5949
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:36,470
I suspect that if alien visited Earth
I suspect if they do

5950
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:36,480
I suspect if they do
 

5951
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,629
I suspect if they do
um if they are everywhere I think

5952
01:47:38,629 --> 01:47:38,639
um if they are everywhere I think
 

5953
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:40,250
um if they are everywhere I think
they're already here and we're too dumb

5954
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:40,260
they're already here and we're too dumb
 

5955
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,629
they're already here and we're too dumb
to see it

5956
01:47:41,629 --> 01:47:41,639
to see it
 

5957
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:44,390
to see it
but leaving that aside

5958
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:44,400
but leaving that aside
 

5959
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,490
but leaving that aside
I think we should be able to in that

5960
01:47:46,490 --> 01:47:46,500
I think we should be able to in that
 

5961
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:49,850
I think we should be able to in that
case have very strong

5962
01:47:49,850 --> 01:47:49,860
case have very strong
 

5963
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:52,790
case have very strong
obvious signals when we look up at the

5964
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800
obvious signals when we look up at the
 

5965
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,430
obvious signals when we look up at the

5966
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,440
stars at the emanation of energy
 

5967
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:58,669
stars at the emanation of energy
required we would see we will see we'll

5968
01:47:58,669 --> 01:47:58,679
required we would see we will see we'll
 

5969
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:01,490
required we would see we will see we'll
see some weirdness that like where these

5970
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:01,500
see some weirdness that like where these
 

5971
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:03,109
see some weirdness that like where these
are these kinds of stars and these are

01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:03,119
are these kinds of stars and these are

01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:04,430
are these kinds of stars and these are
these kinds of stars that are being

01:48:04,430 --> 01:48:04,440
these kinds of stars that are being
 

5975
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:06,590
these kinds of stars that are being
messed with like leveraging the nuclear

5976
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:06,600
messed with like leveraging the nuclear
 

5977
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:09,109
messed with like leveraging the nuclear
fusion of stars to do something useful

5978
01:48:09,109 --> 01:48:09,119
fusion of stars to do something useful
 

5979
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,090
fusion of stars to do something useful
right the fact that we don't really see

5980
01:48:11,090 --> 01:48:11,100
right the fact that we don't really see
 

5981
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:13,189
right the fact that we don't really see
that like maybe you can correct me

5982
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:13,199
that like maybe you can correct me
 

5983
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:15,109
that like maybe you can correct me
wouldn't we be able to if if there is

5984
01:48:15,109 --> 01:48:15,119
wouldn't we be able to if if there is
 

5985
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:16,550
wouldn't we be able to if if there is
like alien civilizations running

5986
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:16,560
like alien civilizations running
 

5987
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,550
like alien civilizations running
galaxies wouldn't we see weirdnesses uh

5988
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:19,560
galaxies wouldn't we see weirdnesses uh
 

5989
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,470
galaxies wouldn't we see weirdnesses uh
from an astronomy perspective with the

5990
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:21,480
from an astronomy perspective with the
 

5991
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:23,570
from an astronomy perspective with the
with the way the stars are behaving yeah

5992
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:23,580
with the way the stars are behaving yeah
 

5993
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,129
with the way the stars are behaving yeah
I mean it depends exactly what they're

5994
01:48:25,129 --> 01:48:25,139
I mean it depends exactly what they're
 

5995
01:48:25,139 --> 01:48:26,510
I mean it depends exactly what they're
doing but I mean the Dyson Sphere

5996
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:26,520
doing but I mean the Dyson Sphere
 

5997
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:28,550
doing but I mean the Dyson Sphere
example is one that we already discussed

5998
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:28,560
example is one that we already discussed
 

5999
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,950
example is one that we already discussed
where a set of 100 000 nearby galaxies

6000
01:48:30,950 --> 01:48:30,960
where a set of 100 000 nearby galaxies
 

6001
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,930
where a set of 100 000 nearby galaxies
find that they are not have all been

um you could also Imagine them doing

6006
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:37,860
um you could also Imagine them doing
 

6007
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:39,410
um you could also Imagine them doing
things like we write a paper like this

6008
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:39,420
things like we write a paper like this
 

6009
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:41,090
things like we write a paper like this
recently of starlifting where you can

6010
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:41,100
recently of starlifting where you can
 

6011
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:43,070
recently of starlifting where you can
extend the life of your Star by scooping

6012
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:43,080
extend the life of your Star by scooping
 

6013
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:45,050
extend the life of your Star by scooping
Mass off the star so you'd be you know

6014
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:45,060
Mass off the star so you'd be you know
 

6015
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:47,870
Mass off the star so you'd be you know
doing Stellar engineering essentially

6016
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:47,880
doing Stellar engineering essentially
 

6017
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:49,910
doing Stellar engineering essentially
um space if you're doing a huge amount

6018
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:49,920
um space if you're doing a huge amount
 

6019
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:52,550
um space if you're doing a huge amount
of asteroid mining uh you would have a

6020
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:52,560
of asteroid mining uh you would have a
 

6021
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:53,570
of asteroid mining uh you would have a
special signature because you're

6022
01:48:53,570 --> 01:48:53,580
special signature because you're
 

6023
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:55,189
special signature because you're
basically filling the solar system with

6024
01:48:55,189 --> 01:48:55,199
basically filling the solar system with
 

6025
01:48:55,199 --> 01:48:57,169
basically filling the solar system with
dust by doing that there'd be debris

6026
01:48:57,169 --> 01:48:57,179
dust by doing that there'd be debris
 

6027
01:48:57,179 --> 01:49:00,430
dust by doing that there'd be debris
from that activity and so there are

6028
01:49:00,430 --> 01:49:00,440
from that activity and so there are
 

6029
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:03,530
from that activity and so there are
some limits on this

6030
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:03,540
some limits on this
 

6031
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:05,629
some limits on this
um certainly we don't see

6032
01:49:05,629 --> 01:49:05,639
um certainly we don't see
 

6033
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:08,209
um certainly we don't see
uh you know bright flashes which would

6034
01:49:08,209 --> 01:49:08,219
uh you know bright flashes which would
 

6035
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:09,410
uh you know bright flashes which would
be you know one of these consequences

6036
01:49:09,410 --> 01:49:09,420
be you know one of these consequences
 

6037
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:10,490
be you know one of these consequences
warp drives as I said is as they

01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:10,500
warp drives as I said is as they
 

6039
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,109
warp drives as I said is as they
decelerate they'd produce these bright

6040
01:49:12,109 --> 01:49:12,119
decelerate they'd produce these bright
 

6041
01:49:12,119 --> 01:49:14,750
decelerate they'd produce these bright

6045
01:49:17,219 --> 01:49:19,790
evidence of those kind of things
um we don't see anything obvious around

6046
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:19,800
um we don't see anything obvious around
 

6047
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,590
um we don't see anything obvious around
the nearby stars or the stars that we've

01:49:45,530 --> 01:49:45,540
kind of dyson-like structure so maybe a
 

6067
01:49:45,540 --> 01:49:48,770
kind of dyson-like structure so maybe a
Dyson Sphere that's half built and so as

01:49:55,139 --> 01:49:58,250
difficult to explain it really with
um any kind of planet model at the time

6076
01:49:58,250 --> 01:49:58,260
um any kind of planet model at the time
 

6077
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,410
um any kind of planet model at the time
um but an easier hypothesis that was

6078
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:00,420
um but an easier hypothesis that was
 

6079
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:02,090
um but an easier hypothesis that was
proposed was it could just be a large

um that the the dips were chromatic

6098
01:50:21,950 --> 01:50:21,960
um that the the dips were chromatic
 

6099
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:24,709
um that the the dips were chromatic
which was a a real important clue that

6100
01:50:24,709 --> 01:50:24,719
which was a a real important clue that
 

6101
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:26,870
which was a a real important clue that
that probably wasn't a solid structure

6102
01:50:26,870 --> 01:50:26,880
that probably wasn't a solid structure
 

6103
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,609
that probably wasn't a solid structure
then that was going around it it was

6104
01:50:28,609 --> 01:50:28,619
then that was going around it it was
 

6105
01:50:28,619 --> 01:50:30,709
then that was going around it it was
more likely to be dust dust is chromatic

6106
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:30,719
more likely to be dust dust is chromatic
 

6107
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,870
more likely to be dust dust is chromatic
but chromatic I mean it looks different

6108
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:32,880
but chromatic I mean it looks different
 

6109
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,970
but chromatic I mean it looks different
in different colors so it blocks out

6110
01:50:34,970 --> 01:50:34,980
in different colors so it blocks out
 

6111
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:36,950
in different colors so it blocks out
more red light than blue light if it was

6112
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:36,960
more red light than blue light if it was
 

6113
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,689
more red light than blue light if it was
a solid structure

a solid structure
 

6115
01:50:38,699 --> 01:50:41,030
a solid structure
shouldn't do that it's it shouldn't be

6117
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,950
shouldn't do that it's it shouldn't be
it should be opaque right a solid metal

6118
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:42,960
it should be opaque right a solid metal
 

6119
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,750
it should be opaque right a solid metal

of the clear indications and the the
 

6123
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:49,669
of the clear indications and the the

behavior of in the way the light changed
 

6125
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,350
behavior of in the way the light changed
or the dips changed across wavelengths

or the dips changed across wavelengths
 

6127
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,790

01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:52,800
was fully consistent with the
 

6129
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,470
was fully consistent with the
expectations of what small particulates

6130
01:50:54,470 --> 01:50:54,480
expectations of what small particulates
 

6131
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,209
expectations of what small particulates
would do

6132
01:50:56,209 --> 01:50:56,219
would do
 

6133
01:50:56,219 --> 01:50:58,070
would do
um and so that's that's very hard I mean

6134
01:50:58,070 --> 01:50:58,080
um and so that's that's very hard I mean
 

6135
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,870
um and so that's that's very hard I mean
the real problem with

6136
01:50:59,870 --> 01:50:59,880
the real problem with
 

6137
01:50:59,880 --> 01:51:03,250
the real problem with
alien hunting

6138
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:03,260

 

6139
01:51:03,260 --> 01:51:05,510

technical term this is this is the real

6140
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:05,520
technical term this is this is the real
 

6141
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,070
technical term this is this is the real
one problem yeah one problem with the

6142
01:51:07,070 --> 01:51:07,080
one problem yeah one problem with the
 

6143
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:08,570
one problem yeah one problem with the
warp drive and the one problem with the

6144
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:08,580
warp drive and the one problem with the
 

6145
01:51:08,580 --> 01:51:10,850
warp drive and the one problem with the
alien hunting yes but well actually I'd

6146
01:51:10,850 --> 01:51:10,860
alien hunting yes but well actually I'd
 

6147
01:51:10,860 --> 01:51:12,590
alien hunting yes but well actually I'd
say there's three big problems for me

6148
01:51:12,590 --> 01:51:12,600
say there's three big problems for me
 

6149
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,450
say there's three big problems for me
with any search for life which includes

6150
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:14,460
with any search for life which includes
 

6151
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:18,590
with any search for life which includes
UFOs or the way to fossils on Mars is

6152
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:18,600
UFOs or the way to fossils on Mars is
 

6153
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:21,350
UFOs or the way to fossils on Mars is
that aliens have three unique properties

6154
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:21,360
that aliens have three unique properties
 

6155
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,689
that aliens have three unique properties
as a hypothesis one is they have

6156
01:51:23,689 --> 01:51:23,699
as a hypothesis one is they have
 

6157
01:51:23,699 --> 01:51:25,550
as a hypothesis one is they have
essentially unbounded explanatory

6158
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:25,560
essentially unbounded explanatory
 

6159
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:28,250
essentially unbounded explanatory
capability so there's almost no

6160
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:28,260
capability so there's almost no
 

6161
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:29,689
capability so there's almost no
phenomena I can show you that you

6162
01:51:29,689 --> 01:51:29,699
phenomena I can show you that you
 

6163
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:31,790
phenomena I can show you that you
couldn't explain with aliens to some

6164
01:51:31,790 --> 01:51:31,800
couldn't explain with aliens to some
 

6165
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,109
couldn't explain with aliens to some
degree you could say well the aliens

6166
01:51:33,109 --> 01:51:33,119
degree you could say well the aliens
 

6167
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,510
degree you could say well the aliens
just have some super high tech uh way of

6168
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:35,520
just have some super high tech uh way of
 

6169
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,609
just have some super high tech uh way of
creating that illusion

6170
01:51:37,609 --> 01:51:37,619
creating that illusion
 

6171
01:51:37,619 --> 01:51:40,490
creating that illusion
um the second one would be unbounded

6172
01:51:40,490 --> 01:51:40,500
um the second one would be unbounded
 

6173
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:44,330
um the second one would be unbounded
avoidance capacity so I might see a UFO

6174
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:44,340
avoidance capacity so I might see a UFO
 

6175
01:51:44,340 --> 01:51:46,010
avoidance capacity so I might see a UFO
tomorrow or and then the next day and

6176
01:51:46,010 --> 01:51:46,020
tomorrow or and then the next day and
 

6177
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:47,510
tomorrow or and then the next day and
then the next day and then predict I

6178
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
then the next day and then predict I
 

6179
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,430
then the next day and then predict I
should see it on Thursday at the end of

6180
01:51:49,430 --> 01:51:49,440
should see it on Thursday at the end of
 

6181
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,530
should see it on Thursday at the end of
the week but then I don't see it but I

6182
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:51,540
the week but then I don't see it but I
 

6183
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:53,209
the week but then I don't see it but I
could always get out of that and say

6184
01:51:53,209 --> 01:51:53,219
could always get out of that and say
 

6185
01:51:53,219 --> 01:51:55,129
could always get out of that and say
well that's just because they chose not

6186
01:51:55,129 --> 01:51:55,139
well that's just because they chose not
 

6187
01:51:55,139 --> 01:51:56,870
well that's just because they chose not
to come here you know they have this

6188
01:51:56,870 --> 01:51:56,880
to come here you know they have this
 

6189
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,910
to come here you know they have this
they can always avoid future

6190
01:51:58,910 --> 01:51:58,920
they can always avoid future
 

6191
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:01,790
they can always avoid future
observations fairly easily

6192
01:52:01,790 --> 01:52:01,800
observations fairly easily
 

6193
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,970
observations fairly easily
um if you survey an exoplanet for

6194
01:52:04,970 --> 01:52:04,980
um if you survey an exoplanet for
 

6195
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:06,709
um if you survey an exoplanet for
biosignatures and you don't see oxygen

6196
01:52:06,709 --> 01:52:06,719
biosignatures and you don't see oxygen
 

6197
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:07,970
biosignatures and you don't see oxygen
you don't see methane that doesn't mean

6198
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:07,980
you don't see methane that doesn't mean
 

6199
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:09,890
you don't see methane that doesn't mean
there's no one living there they could

6200
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:09,900
there's no one living there they could
 

6201
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:11,750
there's no one living there they could
always be either tricking their

6202
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:11,760
always be either tricking their

01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,310
always be either tricking their
atmosphere engineering it we actually

6204
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:13,320
atmosphere engineering it we actually
 

6205
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,229
atmosphere engineering it we actually
wrote a paper about that how you can use

6206
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:15,239
wrote a paper about that how you can use
 

6207
01:52:15,239 --> 01:52:18,290
wrote a paper about that how you can use
lasers to hide your biosignatures as in

6208
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:18,300
lasers to hide your biosignatures as in
 

6209
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:20,450
lasers to hide your biosignatures as in
fact civilization

6210
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:20,460
fact civilization
 

6211
01:52:20,460 --> 01:52:21,709
fact civilization
um or you could just be living

6212
01:52:21,709 --> 01:52:21,719
um or you could just be living
 

6213
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:23,330
um or you could just be living
underground or underwater or something

6214
01:52:23,330 --> 01:52:23,340
underground or underwater or something
 

6215
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:25,729
underground or underwater or something
where there's no bio signatures so you

6216
01:52:25,729 --> 01:52:25,739
where there's no bio signatures so you
 

6217
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:28,609
where there's no bio signatures so you
can never really disprove this life on

6218
01:52:28,609 --> 01:52:28,619
can never really disprove this life on
 

6219
01:52:28,619 --> 01:52:30,950
can never really disprove this life on
another planet or another star it has

6220
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:30,960
another planet or another star it has
 

6221
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:33,410
another planet or another star it has
infinite avoidance and then finally the

6222
01:52:33,410 --> 01:52:33,420
infinite avoidance and then finally the
 

6223
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:34,910
infinite avoidance and then finally the
third one is that that we have

6224
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:34,920
third one is that that we have
 

6225
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,950
third one is that that we have
incomplete physical understanding of the

6226
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:36,960
incomplete physical understanding of the
 

6227
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:39,950
incomplete physical understanding of the
universe so if I see a new phenomena

6228
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:39,960
universe so if I see a new phenomena
 

6229
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,570
universe so if I see a new phenomena
which boyajian style is a good example

6230
01:52:41,570 --> 01:52:41,580
which boyajian style is a good example
 

6231
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:42,950
which boyajian style is a good example
of that we saw this new phenomena of

6232
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:42,960
of that we saw this new phenomena of
 

6233
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,209
of that we saw this new phenomena of
these strange dips we've never seen

6234
01:52:44,209 --> 01:52:44,219
these strange dips we've never seen
 

6235
01:52:44,219 --> 01:52:44,990
these strange dips we've never seen
before

6236
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:45,000
before
 

6237
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,270
before
it was hypothesized immediately this

6238
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:47,280
it was hypothesized immediately this
 

6239
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,770
it was hypothesized immediately this
could be aliens it's like a god of the

6240
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:48,780
could be aliens it's like a god of the
 

6241
01:52:48,780 --> 01:52:51,050
could be aliens it's like a god of the
gaps but it turned out to be incomplete

6242
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:51,060
gaps but it turned out to be incomplete
 

6243
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:52,970
gaps but it turned out to be incomplete
physical understanding and so that that

6244
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:52,980
physical understanding and so that that
 

6245
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:55,129
physical understanding and so that that
happens all the time in the first Pulsar

6246
01:52:55,129 --> 01:52:55,139
happens all the time in the first Pulsar
 

6247
01:52:55,139 --> 01:52:58,010
happens all the time in the first Pulsar
that was discovered same story

6248
01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:58,020
that was discovered same story
 

6249
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:00,890
that was discovered same story
um Jocelyn Bell kind of somewhat uh

6250
01:53:00,890 --> 01:53:00,900
um Jocelyn Bell kind of somewhat uh
 

6251
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,330
um Jocelyn Bell kind of somewhat uh
tongue-in-cheek called it little green

6252
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:02,340
tongue-in-cheek called it little green
 

6253
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:04,850
tongue-in-cheek called it little green
man one because it looked a lot like the

6254
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:04,860
man one because it looked a lot like the
 

6255
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:07,370
man one because it looked a lot like the
radio signature that was expected from a

6256
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:07,380
radio signature that was expected from a
 

6257
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:09,649
radio signature that was expected from a
civilization but of course it turned out

6258
01:53:09,649 --> 01:53:09,659
civilization but of course it turned out
 

6259
01:53:09,659 --> 01:53:11,629
civilization but of course it turned out
to be a completely new type of star that

6260
01:53:11,629 --> 01:53:11,639
to be a completely new type of star that
 

6261
01:53:11,639 --> 01:53:13,490
to be a completely new type of star that
we had never seen before which was a

6262
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:13,500
we had never seen before which was a
 

6263
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:14,870
we had never seen before which was a
neutron star

6264
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:14,880
neutron star

um with these two Jets coming out the

6266
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:16,560
um with these two Jets coming out the
 

6267
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:18,410
um with these two Jets coming out the
top of it and so

6268
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:18,420
top of it and so
 

6269
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:20,990
top of it and so
um that's a challenge those three things

6270
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:21,000
um that's a challenge those three things
 

6271
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,890
um that's a challenge those three things
are really really difficult in terms of

6272
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:24,900
are really really difficult in terms of
 

6273
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:27,050
are really really difficult in terms of
experimental design for a scientist to

01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:27,060
experimental design for a scientist to
 

6275
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:28,669
experimental design for a scientist to
work around something that can explain

6276
01:53:28,669 --> 01:53:28,679
work around something that can explain
 

6277
01:53:28,679 --> 01:53:31,129
work around something that can explain
anything can avoid anything so it's

6278
01:53:31,129 --> 01:53:31,139
anything can avoid anything so it's
 

6279
01:53:31,139 --> 01:53:33,890
anything can avoid anything so it's
almost unforcifiable and could always

6280
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:33,900
almost unforcifiable and could always
 

6281
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:35,990
almost unforcifiable and could always
just be to some degree as you said we

6282
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:36,000
just be to some degree as you said we
 

6283
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,270
just be to some degree as you said we
have this very limited knowledge of the

6284
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:38,280
have this very limited knowledge of the
 

6285
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,310
have this very limited knowledge of the
infinite possibilities of physical law

01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:40,320
infinite possibilities of physical law
 

6287
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:41,930
infinite possibilities of physical law
and we're probably only scratching the

6288
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:41,940
and we're probably only scratching the
 

6289
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:42,890
and we're probably only scratching the
surface

6290
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:42,900
surface
 

6291
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:45,169
surface
each time and we've seen it so often in

6292
01:53:45,169 --> 01:53:45,179
each time and we've seen it so often in
 

6293
01:53:45,179 --> 01:53:48,229
each time and we've seen it so often in
history we may just be detecting some

6294
01:53:48,229 --> 01:53:48,239
history we may just be detecting some
 

6295
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:51,649
history we may just be detecting some
new phenomena well that last one

6296
01:53:51,649 --> 01:53:51,659
new phenomena well that last one
 

6297
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:53,870
new phenomena well that last one
I think I'm a little more okay with

6298
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:53,880
I think I'm a little more okay with
 

6299
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:56,030
I think I'm a little more okay with
making mistakes on yeah which is because

6300
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:56,040
making mistakes on yeah which is because
 

6301
01:53:56,040 --> 01:53:57,890
making mistakes on yeah which is because
it's exciting still but because no

6302
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:57,900
it's exciting still but because no
 

6303
01:53:57,900 --> 01:54:00,229
it's exciting still but because no
matter so you might exaggerate the

6304
01:54:00,229 --> 01:54:00,239
matter so you might exaggerate the
 

6305
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:01,609
matter so you might exaggerate the
importance of the discovery but the

6306
01:54:01,609 --> 01:54:01,619
importance of the discovery but the
 

6307
01:54:01,619 --> 01:54:02,570
importance of the discovery but the
whole point

6308
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:02,580
whole point
 

6309
01:54:02,580 --> 01:54:04,970
whole point
is to try to find stuff in this world

6310
01:54:04,970 --> 01:54:04,980
is to try to find stuff in this world
 

6311
01:54:04,980 --> 01:54:07,129
is to try to find stuff in this world
that's weird and try to characterize

6312
01:54:07,129 --> 01:54:07,139
that's weird and try to characterize
 

6313
01:54:07,139 --> 01:54:08,629
that's weird and try to characterize
that weirdness sure you can throw a

6314
01:54:08,629 --> 01:54:08,639
that weirdness sure you can throw a
 

6315
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,390
that weirdness sure you can throw a
little green man as a label on it but

6316
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:11,400
little green man as a label on it but
 

6317
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,770
little green man as a label on it but
eventually

6318
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:12,780
eventually
 

6319
01:54:12,780 --> 01:54:16,010
eventually
it like it's as mysterious and as

6320
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:16,020
it like it's as mysterious and as
 

6321
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,930
it like it's as mysterious and as
beautiful as interesting as little

6322
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:17,940
beautiful as interesting as little
 

6323
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,669
beautiful as interesting as little
agreement like we we tend to think that

6324
01:54:19,669 --> 01:54:19,679
agreement like we we tend to think that
 

6325
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:21,890
agreement like we we tend to think that
there's some kind of threshold but like

6326
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:21,900
there's some kind of threshold but like
 

6327
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:23,870
there's some kind of threshold but like
there's all kinds of weird organisms on

6328
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:23,880
there's all kinds of weird organisms on
 

6329
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:25,370
there's all kinds of weird organisms on
this Earth that operate very differently

6330
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:25,380
this Earth that operate very differently
 

6331
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:27,109
this Earth that operate very differently
than humans that are super interesting

6332
01:54:27,109 --> 01:54:27,119
than humans that are super interesting
 

6333
01:54:27,119 --> 01:54:29,629
than humans that are super interesting
uh the human mind is super interesting I

6334
01:54:29,629 --> 01:54:29,639
uh the human mind is super interesting I
 

6335
01:54:29,639 --> 01:54:33,709
uh the human mind is super interesting I
mean like uh weirdness and complexity

6336
01:54:33,709 --> 01:54:33,719
mean like uh weirdness and complexity
 

6337
01:54:33,719 --> 01:54:35,450
mean like uh weirdness and complexity
is

6338
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:35,460
is
 

6339
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:38,330
is
is as interesting in any of its forms as

6340
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:38,340
is as interesting in any of its forms as
 

6341

is as interesting in any of its forms as
what we might think from Hollywood what

6342
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:40,440
what we might think from Hollywood what
 

6343
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,530
what we might think from Hollywood what
aliens are so like that that's that's

6344
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:42,540
aliens are so like that that's that's
 

6345
01:54:42,540 --> 01:54:44,950
aliens are so like that that's that's
okay looking for weirdness is on Mars

6346
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:44,960
okay looking for weirdness is on Mars
 

6347
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,209
okay looking for weirdness is on Mars
that's one of the best sales pitchers to

6348
01:54:47,209 --> 01:54:47,219
that's one of the best sales pitchers to
 

6349
01:54:47,219 --> 01:54:49,310
that's one of the best sales pitchers to
do tennis signature work is that you

6350
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:49,320
do tennis signature work is that you
 

6351
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:50,870
do tennis signature work is that you
know we always have that as our fullback

6352
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:50,880
know we always have that as our fullback
 

6353
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,790
know we always have that as our fullback
that that we're going to look for alien

6354
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:52,800
that that we're going to look for alien
 

6355
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:54,830
that that we're going to look for alien
signatures if we fail we're gonna

6356
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:54,840
signatures if we fail we're gonna
 

6357
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:57,350
signatures if we fail we're gonna
discover some awesome new physics along

6358
01:54:57,350 --> 01:54:57,360
discover some awesome new physics along
 

6359
01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:01,250
discover some awesome new physics along
the way and so even a uh any kind of

6360
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:01,260
the way and so even a uh any kind of
 

6361
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:03,169
the way and so even a uh any kind of
signature that we detect is always going

6362
01:55:03,169 --> 01:55:03,179
signature that we detect is always going
 

6363
01:55:03,179 --> 01:55:04,850
signature that we detect is always going
to be interesting

6364
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:04,860
to be interesting
 

6365
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:08,030
to be interesting
um and so that that compels us to

6366
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:08,040
um and so that that compels us to
 

6367
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:10,490
um and so that that compels us to
um have not only the question of looking

6368
01:55:10,490 --> 01:55:10,500
um have not only the question of looking
 

6369
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:12,229
um have not only the question of looking
for life in the universe but it can it

6370
01:55:12,229 --> 01:55:12,239
for life in the universe but it can it
 

6371
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:14,629
for life in the universe but it can it
gives us a strong scientific grounding

6372
01:55:14,629 --> 01:55:14,639
gives us a strong scientific grounding
 

6373
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:16,609
gives us a strong scientific grounding
as to why this sort of research should

6374
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:16,619
as to why this sort of research should
 

6375
01:55:16,619 --> 01:55:17,990
as to why this sort of research should
be funded and should be executed because

6376
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:18,000
be funded and should be executed because
 

6377
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,609
be funded and should be executed because
it always pushes the Frontiers knowledge

6378
01:55:19,609 --> 01:55:19,619
it always pushes the Frontiers knowledge
 

6379
01:55:19,619 --> 01:55:21,470
it always pushes the Frontiers knowledge
I wonder if we'll be able to discover

6380
01:55:21,470 --> 01:55:21,480
I wonder if we'll be able to discover
 

6381
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:23,990
I wonder if we'll be able to discover
and be open enough

6382
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:24,000
and be open enough
 

6383
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,629
and be open enough
to a broad definition of aliens where we

6384
01:55:26,629 --> 01:55:26,639
to a broad definition of aliens where we
 

6385
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,689
to a broad definition of aliens where we
see some kind of techno signature

6386
01:55:28,689 --> 01:55:28,699
see some kind of techno signature
 

6387
01:55:28,699 --> 01:55:31,129
see some kind of techno signature
basically like a touring test like this

6388
01:55:31,129 --> 01:55:31,139
basically like a touring test like this
 

6389
01:55:31,139 --> 01:55:33,590
basically like a touring test like this
thing is intelligent like it's

6390
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:33,600
thing is intelligent like it's
 

6391
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:35,030
thing is intelligent like it's
processing information in a very

6392
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:35,040
processing information in a very
 

6393
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,609
processing information in a very
interesting way but but you can say that

6394
01:55:37,609 --> 01:55:37,619
interesting way but but you can say that
 

6395
01:55:37,619 --> 01:55:38,930
interesting way but but you can say that
about chemistry you could say that about

6396
01:55:38,930 --> 01:55:38,940
about chemistry you could say that about
 

6397
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:40,189
about chemistry you could say that about
physics

6398
01:55:40,189 --> 01:55:40,199
physics
 

6399
01:55:40,199 --> 01:55:42,290
physics
maybe not physics chemistry like

6400
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:42,300
maybe not physics chemistry like
 

6401
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:44,990
maybe not physics chemistry like
interesting complex chemistry you could

6402
01:55:44,990 --> 01:55:45,000
interesting complex chemistry you could
 

6403
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,090
interesting complex chemistry you could
say that this is processing this is

6404
01:55:47,090 --> 01:55:47,100
say that this is processing this is
 

6405
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:49,729
say that this is processing this is
storing information this is propagating

6406
01:55:49,729 --> 01:55:49,739
storing information this is propagating
 

6407
01:55:49,739 --> 01:55:54,590
storing information this is propagating
information over time so I mean I want I

6408
01:55:54,590 --> 01:55:54,600
information over time so I mean I want I
 

6409
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:56,390
information over time so I mean I want I
it's a gray area between a living

6410
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:56,400
it's a gray area between a living
 

6411
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,729
it's a gray area between a living
organism that we would call an alien and

6412
01:55:58,729 --> 01:55:58,739
organism that we would call an alien and
 

6413
01:55:58,739 --> 01:56:00,350
organism that we would call an alien and
a thing that's super interesting is able

6414
01:56:00,350 --> 01:56:00,360
a thing that's super interesting is able
 

6415
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:02,390
a thing that's super interesting is able
to carry some kind of intelligence yeah

6416
01:56:02,390 --> 01:56:02,400
to carry some kind of intelligence yeah
 

6417
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:06,410
to carry some kind of intelligence yeah
information is a really useful way to

6418
01:56:06,410 --> 01:56:06,420
information is a really useful way to
 

6419
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:07,790
information is a really useful way to
frame what we're looking for though

6420
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:07,800
frame what we're looking for though
 

6421
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:09,590
frame what we're looking for though
because it then you'll then you're

6422
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:09,600
because it then you'll then you're
 

6423
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:12,109
because it then you'll then you're
divorced from making assumptions about

6424
01:56:12,109 --> 01:56:12,119
divorced from making assumptions about
 

6425
01:56:12,119 --> 01:56:14,629
divorced from making assumptions about
even a civilization necessarily or

6426
01:56:14,629 --> 01:56:14,639
even a civilization necessarily or
 

6427
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:16,550
even a civilization necessarily or
anything like that so any kind of

6428
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:16,560
anything like that so any kind of
 

6429
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,070
anything like that so any kind of
information signature indeed you can

6430
01:56:19,070 --> 01:56:19,080
information signature indeed you can
 

6431
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,930
information signature indeed you can
take things like the light curve from

6432
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:20,940
take things like the light curve from
 

6433
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:23,030
take things like the light curve from
boyaging star and ask what is the

6434
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:23,040
boyaging star and ask what is the
 

6435
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:25,609
boyaging star and ask what is the
minimum number of free parameters or the

6436
01:56:25,609 --> 01:56:25,619
minimum number of free parameters or the
 

6437
01:56:25,619 --> 01:56:27,410
minimum number of free parameters or the
minimum information content that must be

6438
01:56:27,410 --> 01:56:27,420
minimum information content that must be
 

6439
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:30,530
minimum information content that must be
encoded within the slide curve and the

6440
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:30,540
encoded within the slide curve and the
 

6441
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:32,270
encoded within the slide curve and the
hope is that maybe from you know a good

6442
01:56:32,270 --> 01:56:32,280
hope is that maybe from you know a good
 

6443
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:33,950
hope is that maybe from you know a good
example be from a radio signature you

example be from a radio signature you
just text something that has you know a

just text something that has you know a

just text something that has you know a
thousand megabytes of of parameters

6448
01:56:39,649 --> 01:56:39,659
thousand megabytes of of parameters

essentially contained within it that's
 

6451
01:56:42,119 --> 01:56:44,030

pretty clearly at that point not the

pretty clearly at that point not the
 

6453
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:45,770
pretty clearly at that point not the
product of a natural process but it's

6454
01:56:45,770 --> 01:56:45,780
product of a natural process but it's
 

6455
01:56:45,780 --> 01:56:46,910
product of a natural process but it's
any natural process that we could

6456
01:56:46,910 --> 01:56:46,920
any natural process that we could
 

6457
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,649

possibly imagine with our current
 

6459
01:56:48,659 --> 01:56:50,570
possibly imagine with our current
understanding the universe and so

6460
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:50,580
understanding the universe and so
 

6461
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:53,270
understanding the universe and so
thinking even if we can't decode which

01:56:53,270 --> 01:56:53,280
thinking even if we can't decode which
 

6463
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,070
thinking even if we can't decode which
actually I'm skeptical would be able to

01:56:55,070 --> 01:56:55,080
actually I'm skeptical would be able to
 

6465
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:56,750
actually I'm skeptical would be able to
ever decode it in our lifetimes it would

6466
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:56,760
ever decode it in our lifetimes it would
 

6467
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,910
ever decode it in our lifetimes it would
probably take decades to fully ever

01:56:58,910 --> 01:56:58,920
probably take decades to fully ever
 

6469
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,169
probably take decades to fully ever

01:57:00,179 --> 01:57:02,330
figure out what they're trying to tell
us but if there was a message there we

us but if there was a message there we
 

6473
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:04,669

really really appreciate that
um but what kind of signal in our

6496
01:57:29,149 --> 01:57:29,159
um but what kind of signal in our
 

6497
01:57:29,159 --> 01:57:31,370
um but what kind of signal in our
lifetime what kind of thing do you think

6498
01:57:31,370 --> 01:57:31,380
lifetime what kind of thing do you think
 

6499
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:32,570
lifetime what kind of thing do you think
might happen

6500
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:32,580
might happen
 

6501
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:35,270
might happen
could possibly happen

6502
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:35,280
could possibly happen
 

6503
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,370
could possibly happen
where the scientific Community would be

6504
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:37,380
where the scientific Community would be
 

6505
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:39,709
where the scientific Community would be
convinced that there's alien

6506
01:57:39,709 --> 01:57:39,719
convinced that there's alien
 

6507
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:42,589
convinced that there's alien
civilizations out there like what uh she

6508
01:57:42,589 --> 01:57:42,599
civilizations out there like what uh she
 

6509
01:57:42,599 --> 01:57:44,270
civilizations out there like what uh she
already said maybe a strong infrared

6510
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:44,280
already said maybe a strong infrared

signature for something like a Dyson

6512
01:57:46,189 --> 01:57:46,199
signature for something like a Dyson
 

6513
01:57:46,199 --> 01:57:48,410
signature for something like a Dyson
Sphere yeah that's possibly that that's

6514
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:48,420
Sphere yeah that's possibly that that's
 

6515
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:49,609
Sphere yeah that's possibly that that's
always something to be a little bit

6516
01:57:49,609 --> 01:57:49,619
always something to be a little bit
 

6517
01:57:49,619 --> 01:57:50,629
always something to be a little bit
ambiguous

6518
01:57:50,629 --> 01:57:50,639
ambiguous
 

6519
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:52,310
ambiguous
um because right that's the challenge

6520
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:52,320
um because right that's the challenge
 

6521
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:55,370
um because right that's the challenge
starting to interrupt is where

6522
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:55,380
starting to interrupt is where
 

6523
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:58,310
starting to interrupt is where
your brain would be like you as a

6524
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:58,320
your brain would be like you as a
 

6525
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,350
your brain would be like you as a
scientist would be like I know it's

6526
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:00,360
scientist would be like I know it's
 

6527
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:03,470
scientist would be like I know it's
ambiguous but this is really weird yeah

6528
01:58:03,470 --> 01:58:03,480
ambiguous but this is really weird yeah
 

6529
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,790
ambiguous but this is really weird yeah
I think

6530
01:58:04,790 --> 01:58:04,800
I think
 

6531
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,530
I think
if he had some I can imagine something

6532
01:58:06,530 --> 01:58:06,540
if he had some I can imagine something
 

6533
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:08,330
if he had some I can imagine something
like a prime number sequence

6534
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:08,340
like a prime number sequence
 

6535
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:09,830
like a prime number sequence
or a mathematical sequence like the

6536
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:09,840
or a mathematical sequence like the
 

6537
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,270
or a mathematical sequence like the
Fibonacci series something being

6538
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,280
Fibonacci series something being
 

6539
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,729
Fibonacci series something being
broadcast radically provable that this

6540
01:58:13,729 --> 01:58:13,739
broadcast radically provable that this
 

6541
01:58:13,739 --> 01:58:15,830
broadcast radically provable that this
is not a physical phenomenon right I

6542
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:15,840
is not a physical phenomenon right I
 

6543
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,330
is not a physical phenomenon right I
mean yeah prime numbers is a pretty good

6544
01:58:17,330 --> 01:58:17,340
mean yeah prime numbers is a pretty good
 

6545
01:58:17,340 --> 01:58:18,890
mean yeah prime numbers is a pretty good
case because there's no natural

6546
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:18,900
case because there's no natural
 

6547
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:20,450
case because there's no natural
phenomena that produces prime number

6548
01:58:20,450 --> 01:58:20,460
phenomena that produces prime number
 

6549
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:22,070
phenomena that produces prime number
sequences it seems to be a purely an

6550
01:58:22,070 --> 01:58:22,080
sequences it seems to be a purely an
 

6551
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,750
sequences it seems to be a purely an
abstract mathematical concept as far as

6552
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:23,760
abstract mathematical concept as far as
 

6553
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:27,350
abstract mathematical concept as far as
I'm aware and so if we detected uh you

6554
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:27,360
I'm aware and so if we detected uh you
 

6555
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:29,570
I'm aware and so if we detected uh you
know if she was a radio Blitz that were

6556
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:29,580
know if she was a radio Blitz that were
 

6557
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:31,370
know if she was a radio Blitz that were
following that sequence it would be

6558
01:58:31,370 --> 01:58:31,380
following that sequence it would be
 

6559
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:33,169
following that sequence it would be
pretty clear to me or it could even be

6560
01:58:33,169 --> 01:58:33,179
pretty clear to me or it could even be
 

6561
01:58:33,179 --> 01:58:35,330
pretty clear to me or it could even be
uh you know cast that you can suggested

6562
01:58:35,330 --> 01:58:35,340
uh you know cast that you can suggested
 

6563
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,250
uh you know cast that you can suggested
that Pi could be encoded in that or you

6564
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:37,260
that Pi could be encoded in that or you
 

6565
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:39,050
that Pi could be encoded in that or you
might use the hydrogen line but multiply

6566
01:58:39,050 --> 01:58:39,060
might use the hydrogen line but multiply
 

6567
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:41,750
might use the hydrogen line but multiply
by pi like some very specific uh

6568
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:41,760
by pi like some very specific uh
 

6569
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,310
by pi like some very specific uh
frequency of the universe like a

6570
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:43,320
frequency of the universe like a
 

6571
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:45,830
frequency of the universe like a
hydrogen line but multiply it by a

6572
01:58:45,830 --> 01:58:45,840
hydrogen line but multiply it by a
 

6573
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:47,510
hydrogen line but multiply it by a
abstract mathematical constant that

6574
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:47,520
abstract mathematical constant that
 

6575
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,609
abstract mathematical constant that
would imply strongly that there was

6576
01:58:49,609 --> 01:58:49,619
would imply strongly that there was
 

6577
01:58:49,619 --> 01:58:52,490
would imply strongly that there was
someone behind the scenes operating that

6578
01:58:52,490 --> 01:58:52,500
someone behind the scenes operating that
 

6579
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:54,950
someone behind the scenes operating that
um as sorry stored in which phenomena

6580
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:54,960
um as sorry stored in which phenomena
 

6581
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,229
um as sorry stored in which phenomena
though there's a thing of a radio wave

6582
01:58:57,229 --> 01:58:57,239
though there's a thing of a radio wave
 

6583
01:58:57,239 --> 01:58:58,970
though there's a thing of a radio wave
but the information I mean we kind of

6584
01:58:58,970 --> 01:58:58,980
but the information I mean we kind of
 

6585
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:00,770
but the information I mean we kind of
toyed with this um

6586
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:00,780
toyed with this um
 

6587
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:02,750
toyed with this um
uh idea in a video I did about

6588
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:02,760
uh idea in a video I did about
 

6589
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,910
uh idea in a video I did about
hypothetical civilization on my channel

6590
01:59:04,910 --> 01:59:04,920
hypothetical civilization on my channel
 

6591
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:07,729
hypothetical civilization on my channel
but one kind of fun way I do want to

6592
01:59:07,729 --> 01:59:07,739
but one kind of fun way I do want to
 

6593
01:59:07,739 --> 01:59:10,490
but one kind of fun way I do want to
bring the this conversation towards time

6594
01:59:10,490 --> 01:59:10,500
bring the this conversation towards time
 

6595
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:12,470
bring the this conversation towards time
a little bit and thinking about

6596
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:12,480
a little bit and thinking about
 

6597
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,330
a little bit and thinking about
um not just looking for life and

6598
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:14,340
um not just looking for life and
 

6599
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:16,370
um not just looking for life and
intelligence around us right now but

6600
01:59:16,370 --> 01:59:16,380
intelligence around us right now but
 

6601
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:18,350
intelligence around us right now but
looking into the past and even into the

6602
01:59:18,350 --> 01:59:18,360
looking into the past and even into the
 

6603
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,390
looking into the past and even into the
future to some degree or communicating

6604
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:20,400
future to some degree or communicating
 

6605
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,490
future to some degree or communicating
with the future and so we had this fun

6606
01:59:22,490 --> 01:59:22,500
with the future and so we had this fun
 

6607
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:24,290
with the future and so we had this fun
experiment of imagining a civilization

6608
01:59:24,290 --> 01:59:24,300
experiment of imagining a civilization
 

6609
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:26,450
experiment of imagining a civilization
that was born at the beginning of the

6610
01:59:26,450 --> 01:59:26,460
that was born at the beginning of the
 

6611
01:59:26,460 --> 01:59:28,490
that was born at the beginning of the
history of the Galaxy and being the

6612
01:59:28,490 --> 01:59:28,500
history of the Galaxy and being the
 

6613
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:29,870
history of the Galaxy and being the
first and what it would be like for them

6614
01:59:29,870 --> 01:59:29,880
first and what it would be like for them
 

6615
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:31,970
first and what it would be like for them
and they were desperately searching for

6616
01:59:31,970 --> 01:59:31,980
and they were desperately searching for
 

6617
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:33,589
and they were desperately searching for
evidence of life but couldn't find it

6618
01:59:33,589 --> 01:59:33,599
evidence of life but couldn't find it
 

6619
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:35,390
evidence of life but couldn't find it
and so they decided to try and leave

6620
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:35,400
and so they decided to try and leave
 

6621
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:37,370
and so they decided to try and leave
something behind for future

6622
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:37,380
something behind for future
 

6623
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:39,470
something behind for future
civilizations to discover to tell them

6624
01:59:39,470 --> 01:59:39,480
civilizations to discover to tell them
 

6625
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:41,570
civilizations to discover to tell them
about themselves but of course a radio

6626
01:59:41,570 --> 01:59:41,580
about themselves but of course a radio
 

6627
01:59:41,580 --> 01:59:43,010
about themselves but of course a radio
signage is not going to work there

6628
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:43,020
signage is not going to work there
 

6629
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:45,229
signage is not going to work there
because it has have a power source and

6630
01:59:45,229 --> 01:59:45,239
because it has have a power source and
 

6631
01:59:45,239 --> 01:59:46,669
because it has have a power source and
that's a piece of Machinery it's going

6632
01:59:46,669 --> 01:59:46,679
that's a piece of Machinery it's going
 

6633
01:59:46,679 --> 01:59:47,810
that's a piece of Machinery it's going
to eventually break down it's gonna be

6634
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:47,820
to eventually break down it's gonna be
 

6635
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:50,209
to eventually break down it's gonna be
hard to maintain that for billions of

6636
01:59:50,209 --> 01:59:50,219
hard to maintain that for billions of
 

6637
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:52,010
hard to maintain that for billions of
years time scale and so you wanted

6638
01:59:52,010 --> 01:59:52,020
years time scale and so you wanted
 

6639
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:54,109
years time scale and so you wanted
something that was kind of passive that

6640
01:59:54,109 --> 01:59:54,119
something that was kind of passive that
 

6641
01:59:54,119 --> 01:59:55,970
something that was kind of passive that
doesn't require an energy source but can

6642
01:59:55,970 --> 01:59:55,980
doesn't require an energy source but can
 

6643
01:59:55,980 --> 01:59:58,910
doesn't require an energy source but can
somehow transmit information which is

6644
01:59:58,910 --> 01:59:58,920
somehow transmit information which is
 

6645
01:59:58,920 --> 02:00:00,470
somehow transmit information which is
hard to think about something that

6646
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:00,480
hard to think about something that
 

6647
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:03,050
hard to think about something that
satisfies those criteria but there was a

6648
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:03,060
satisfies those criteria but there was a
 

6649
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:05,770
satisfies those criteria but there was a
proposal by one of my colleagues Connor

6650
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:05,780
proposal by one of my colleagues Connor
 

6651
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:08,270
proposal by one of my colleagues Connor
which inspired a lot of us in techno

6652
02:00:08,270 --> 02:00:08,280
which inspired a lot of us in techno
 

6653
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:10,430
which inspired a lot of us in techno
signatures and he suggested that you

6654
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:10,440
signatures and he suggested that you
 

6655
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,830
signatures and he suggested that you
could build artificial transiters so you

6656
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:12,840
could build artificial transiters so you
 

6657
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:15,410
could build artificial transiters so you
could be build sheets of material that

6658
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:15,420
could be build sheets of material that
 

6659
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:18,189
could be build sheets of material that
transit in front of the star maybe one

6660
02:00:18,189 --> 02:00:18,199
transit in front of the star maybe one
 

6661
02:00:18,199 --> 02:00:20,930
transit in front of the star maybe one
thin sheet passes across first then two

6662
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:20,940
thin sheet passes across first then two
 

6663
02:00:20,940 --> 02:00:22,790
thin sheet passes across first then two
then three then five and seven so you

6664
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:22,800
then three then five and seven so you
 

6665
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:24,050
then three then five and seven so you
could follow the prime number sequence

6666
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:24,060
could follow the prime number sequence
 

6667
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:25,669
could follow the prime number sequence
of these and so there'd be a clear

6668
02:00:25,669 --> 02:00:25,679
of these and so there'd be a clear
 

6669
02:00:25,679 --> 02:00:27,950
of these and so there'd be a clear
indication that someone had manufactured

6670
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:27,960
indication that someone had manufactured
 

6671
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:30,229
indication that someone had manufactured
those but they don't require any energy

6672
02:00:30,229 --> 02:00:30,239
those but they don't require any energy
 

6673
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:32,209
those but they don't require any energy
source because they're just sheets of

6674
02:00:32,209 --> 02:00:32,219
source because they're just sheets of
 

6675
02:00:32,219 --> 02:00:33,950
source because they're just sheets of
material in orbit of the star they would

6676
02:00:33,950 --> 02:00:33,960
material in orbit of the star they would
 

6677
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:35,810
material in orbit of the star they would
eventually degrade from micrometeorites

6678
02:00:35,810 --> 02:00:35,820
eventually degrade from micrometeorites
 

6679
02:00:35,820 --> 02:00:36,830
eventually degrade from micrometeorites
so maybe their orbits would become

6680
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:36,840
so maybe their orbits would become
 

6681
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:38,510
so maybe their orbits would become
destabilized but they should have

6682
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:38,520
destabilized but they should have
 

6683
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:41,510
destabilized but they should have
lifetimes far exceeding the lifetime of

6684
02:00:41,510 --> 02:00:41,520
lifetimes far exceeding the lifetime of
 

6685
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:44,149
lifetimes far exceeding the lifetime of
any uh battery or mechanical electronic

6686
02:00:44,149 --> 02:00:44,159
any uh battery or mechanical electronic
 

6687
02:00:44,159 --> 02:00:45,709
any uh battery or mechanical electronic
system that we could at least without

6688
02:00:45,709 --> 02:00:45,719
system that we could at least without
 

6689
02:00:45,719 --> 02:00:48,050
system that we could at least without
energy conceive of building and so you

6690
02:00:48,050 --> 02:00:48,060
energy conceive of building and so you
 

6691
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:49,550
energy conceive of building and so you
can imagine an extending that and how

6692
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:49,560
can imagine an extending that and how
 

6693
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:51,649
can imagine an extending that and how
could you encode not just a prime number

6694
02:00:51,649 --> 02:00:51,659
could you encode not just a prime number
 

6695
02:00:51,659 --> 02:00:53,149
could you encode not just a prime number
sequence but maybe in the spatial

6696
02:00:53,149 --> 02:00:53,159
sequence but maybe in the spatial
 

6697
02:00:53,159 --> 02:00:56,149
sequence but maybe in the spatial
pattern of this very complex light curve

6698
02:00:56,149 --> 02:00:56,159
pattern of this very complex light curve
 

6699
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:58,490
pattern of this very complex light curve
we see you could encode more and more

6700
02:00:58,490 --> 02:00:58,500
we see you could encode more and more
 

6701
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:01,370
we see you could encode more and more
information through 2D shapes and the

6702
02:01:01,370 --> 02:01:01,380
information through 2D shapes and the
 

6703
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:04,430
information through 2D shapes and the
way those occupations happen and maybe

6704
02:01:04,430 --> 02:01:04,440
way those occupations happen and maybe
 

6705
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:08,149
way those occupations happen and maybe
uh you could even encode uh messages and

6706
02:01:08,149 --> 02:01:08,159
uh you could even encode uh messages and
 

6707
02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:10,490
uh you could even encode uh messages and
and in-depth information from you know

6708
02:01:10,490 --> 02:01:10,500
and in-depth information from you know
 

6709
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:12,770
and in-depth information from you know
you could even imagine it being like a a

6710
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:12,780
you could even imagine it being like a a
 

6711
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:14,570
you could even imagine it being like a a
lower layer of information which is just

6712
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:14,580
lower layer of information which is just
 

6713
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:15,950
lower layer of information which is just
the prime number sequence but then you

6714
02:01:15,950 --> 02:01:15,960
the prime number sequence but then you
 

6715
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:18,290
the prime number sequence but then you
look closely and you see the smaller

6716
02:01:18,290 --> 02:01:18,300
look closely and you see the smaller
 

6717
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:20,930
look closely and you see the smaller
divots embedded within those that have a

6718
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:20,940
divots embedded within those that have a
 

6719
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:24,229
divots embedded within those that have a
deeper layer of information to extract

6720
02:01:24,229 --> 02:01:24,239
deeper layer of information to extract
 

6721
02:01:24,239 --> 02:01:25,729
deeper layer of information to extract
um and so to me something like that

6722
02:01:25,729 --> 02:01:25,739
um and so to me something like that
 

6723
02:01:25,739 --> 02:01:28,370
um and so to me something like that
would be pretty compelling that that was

6724
02:01:28,370 --> 02:01:28,380
would be pretty compelling that that was
 

6725
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:29,990
would be pretty compelling that that was
somebody who would mind if unless it's

6726
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:30,000
somebody who would mind if unless it's
 

6727
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,530
somebody who would mind if unless it's
just a a very impressive hoax that would

6728
02:01:33,530 --> 02:01:33,540
just a a very impressive hoax that would
 

6729
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,030
just a a very impressive hoax that would
be a pretty compelling evidence in this

6730
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:35,040
be a pretty compelling evidence in this
 

6731
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:38,450
be a pretty compelling evidence in this
civilization and actually the methods of

6732
02:01:38,450 --> 02:01:38,460
civilization and actually the methods of
 

6733
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:41,510
civilization and actually the methods of
um astronomy right now are kind of

6734
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:41,520
um astronomy right now are kind of
 

6735
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:43,189
um astronomy right now are kind of
marching towards

6736
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
marching towards
 

6737
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,410
marching towards
being able to better and better detect a

6738
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:45,420
being able to better and better detect a
 

6739
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:47,930
being able to better and better detect a
signal like that yeah I mean to some

6740
02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:47,940
signal like that yeah I mean to some
 

6741
02:01:47,940 --> 02:01:49,250
signal like that yeah I mean to some
degree it's just building bigger

6742
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:49,260
degree it's just building bigger
 

6743
02:01:49,260 --> 02:01:50,870
degree it's just building bigger
aperture in Space the bigger the

6744
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:50,880
aperture in Space the bigger the
 

6745
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,870
aperture in Space the bigger the
telescope the the finer ability to

6746
02:01:53,870 --> 02:01:53,880
telescope the the finer ability to
 

6747
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:55,669
telescope the the finer ability to
detach those minute signals do you think

6748
02:01:55,669 --> 02:01:55,679
detach those minute signals do you think
 

6749
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:56,810
detach those minute signals do you think
the current sort of the scientific

6750
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:56,820
the current sort of the scientific
 

6751
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:58,850
the current sort of the scientific
Community another weird question but

6752
02:01:58,850 --> 02:01:58,860
Community another weird question but
 

6753
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:00,350
Community another weird question but
just the observations that are happening

6754
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:00,360
just the observations that are happening
 

6755
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:03,290
just the observations that are happening
now do you think they're ready for a

6756
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:03,300
now do you think they're ready for a
 

6757
02:02:03,300 --> 02:02:07,370
now do you think they're ready for a
prime number sequence in in the um so if

6758
02:02:07,370 --> 02:02:07,380
prime number sequence in in the um so if
 

6759
02:02:07,380 --> 02:02:09,470
prime number sequence in in the um so if
if we're using the current method the

6760
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:09,480
if we're using the current method the
 

6761
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:13,070
if we're using the current method the
transit timing variation method like do

6762
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:13,080
transit timing variation method like do
 

6763
02:02:13,080 --> 02:02:13,970
transit timing variation method like do
you think

6764
02:02:13,970 --> 02:02:13,980
you think
 

6765
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:16,729
you think
you're ready do you have the tools to

6766
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:16,739
you're ready do you have the tools to
 

6767
02:02:16,739 --> 02:02:18,830
you're ready do you have the tools to
detect the prime number sequence

6768
02:02:18,830 --> 02:02:18,840
detect the prime number sequence
 

6769
02:02:18,840 --> 02:02:21,589
detect the prime number sequence
yeah for sure I mean there's

6770
02:02:21,589 --> 02:02:21,599
yeah for sure I mean there's
 

6771
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:23,330
yeah for sure I mean there's
two hundred thousand stars that kept

6772
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:23,340
two hundred thousand stars that kept
 

6773
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:24,770
two hundred thousand stars that kept
them monitored and it monitored them all

6774
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:24,780
them monitored and it monitored them all
 

6775
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:26,510
them monitored and it monitored them all
the time it took a photo of each one of

6776
02:02:26,510 --> 02:02:26,520
the time it took a photo of each one of
 

6777
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:28,070
the time it took a photo of each one of
them every 30 minutes to measure their

6778
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:28,080
them every 30 minutes to measure their
 

6779
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:31,370
them every 30 minutes to measure their
brightness and it did that for four and

6780
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:31,380
brightness and it did that for four and
 

6781
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:33,709
brightness and it did that for four and
a half years and so you have already and

6782
02:02:33,709 --> 02:02:33,719
a half years and so you have already and
 

6783
02:02:33,719 --> 02:02:34,970
a half years and so you have already and
Tess is doing it right now another

6784
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:34,980
Tess is doing it right now another
 

6785
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:37,310
Tess is doing it right now another
mission and so you have already an

6786
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:37,320
mission and so you have already an
 

6787
02:02:37,320 --> 02:02:40,250
mission and so you have already an
existing catalog and people are uh

6788
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:40,260
existing catalog and people are uh
 

6789
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:42,290
existing catalog and people are uh
genuinely scouring through each of those

6790
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:42,300
genuinely scouring through each of those

some on our own team that can look for
weird Behavior we wrote a code called

6798
02:02:49,729 --> 02:02:49,739
weird Behavior we wrote a code called
 

6799
02:02:49,739 --> 02:02:51,950
weird Behavior we wrote a code called
the weird detector for instance that of

anything about the signal shape just

6806
02:02:58,129 --> 02:02:58,139
anything about the signal shape just
 

6807
02:02:58,139 --> 02:02:59,629
anything about the signal shape just
look for anything that repeats the

6808
02:02:59,629 --> 02:02:59,639
look for anything that repeats the

look for anything that repeats the
distinguish rate can be anything can we

6810
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:01,020
distinguish rate can be anything can we
 

6811
02:03:01,020 --> 02:03:03,290
distinguish rate can be anything can we
kind of learn the template of the signal

6812
02:03:03,290 --> 02:03:03,300
kind of learn the template of the signal
 

6813
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:05,270
kind of learn the template of the signal
from the data itself and then we it's

6814
02:03:05,270 --> 02:03:05,280
from the data itself and then we it's
 

6815
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:07,010
from the data itself and then we it's
like a template matching filter to see

6816
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:07,020
like a template matching filter to see
 

6817
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:08,750
like a template matching filter to see
if that repeats many many times in the

6818
02:03:08,750 --> 02:03:08,760
if that repeats many many times in the
 

6819
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:10,850
if that repeats many many times in the
data and so we actually applied that and

6820
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:10,860
data and so we actually applied that and
 

6821
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:13,129
data and so we actually applied that and
found a bunch of interesting stuff but

6822
02:03:13,129 --> 02:03:13,139
found a bunch of interesting stuff but
 

6823
02:03:13,139 --> 02:03:15,410
found a bunch of interesting stuff but
we didn't see anything that was the

6824
02:03:15,410 --> 02:03:15,420
we didn't see anything that was the
 

6825
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:16,970
we didn't see anything that was the
prime number sequence at least on the

6826
02:03:16,970 --> 02:03:16,980
prime number sequence at least on the

Kepler data about 200 000 Stars which

6828
02:03:19,729 --> 02:03:19,739
Kepler data about 200 000 Stars which
 

6829
02:03:19,739 --> 02:03:22,430
Kepler data about 200 000 Stars which
sounds like a lot but compared to 200

6830
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:22,440
sounds like a lot but compared to 200
 

6831
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:24,770
sounds like a lot but compared to 200
billion stars in the Milky Way it's

6832
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:24,780
billion stars in the Milky Way it's
 

6833
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:26,930
billion stars in the Milky Way it's
really just scratching the surface so

6834
02:03:26,930 --> 02:03:26,940
really just scratching the surface so
 

6835
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:28,310
really just scratching the surface so
one because there could be something

6836
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:28,320
one because there could be something
 

6837
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:29,870
one because there could be something
much more generalizable than the prime

6838
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:29,880
much more generalizable than the prime
 

6839
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:31,970
much more generalizable than the prime
number sequence it's ultimately the

6840
02:03:31,970 --> 02:03:31,980
number sequence it's ultimately the
 

6841
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:33,950
number sequence it's ultimately the
question of a signal that's very

6842
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:33,960
question of a signal that's very
 

6843
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:35,270
question of a signal that's very
difficult to compress

6844
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:35,280
difficult to compress
 

6845
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:36,830
difficult to compress
in the general

6846
02:03:36,830 --> 02:03:36,840
in the general
 

6847
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:38,870
in the general
sensible compressed means so maybe as we

6848
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:38,880
sensible compressed means so maybe as we
 

6849
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:40,010
sensible compressed means so maybe as we
get better and better machine learning

6850
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:40,020
get better and better machine learning
 

6851
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:43,030
get better and better machine learning
methods that automatically figure out

6852
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:43,040
methods that automatically figure out
 

6853
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:45,589
methods that automatically figure out
analyze the data to to understand how to

6854
02:03:45,589 --> 02:03:45,599
analyze the data to to understand how to
 

6855
02:03:45,599 --> 02:03:47,570
analyze the data to to understand how to
compress it just you'll be able to

6856
02:03:47,570 --> 02:03:47,580
compress it just you'll be able to
 

6857
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:49,070
compress it just you'll be able to
discover data that's for some reason

6858
02:03:49,070 --> 02:03:49,080
discover data that's for some reason
 

6859
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:50,570
discover data that's for some reason
it's not compressible

6860
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:50,580
it's not compressible
 

6861
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:53,990
it's not compressible
but then you know compression really is

6862
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:54,000
but then you know compression really is
 

6863
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,850
but then you know compression really is
a bottomless pit because like that's

6864
02:03:55,850 --> 02:03:55,860
a bottomless pit because like that's
 

6865
02:03:55,860 --> 02:03:57,530
a bottomless pit because like that's
really what intelligence is is being

6866
02:03:57,530 --> 02:03:57,540
really what intelligence is is being
 

6867
02:03:57,540 --> 02:03:59,750
really what intelligence is is being
able to compress information yeah and to

6868
02:03:59,750 --> 02:03:59,760
able to compress information yeah and to
 

6869
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,850
able to compress information yeah and to
some degree the more you I would imagine

6870
02:04:01,850 --> 02:04:01,860
some degree the more you I would imagine
 

6871
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:03,470
some degree the more you I would imagine
I don't work in compression algorithms

6872
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:03,480
I don't work in compression algorithms
 

6873
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,430
I don't work in compression algorithms
but I would imagine the more you

6874
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:04,440
but I would imagine the more you
 

6875
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:06,830
but I would imagine the more you
compress your signal

6876
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:06,840
compress your signal
 

6877
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:10,370
compress your signal
um the the more assumptions that kind of

6878
02:04:10,370 --> 02:04:10,380
um the the more assumptions that kind of
 

6879
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:12,229
um the the more assumptions that kind of
go on behalf of the decoder the more

6880
02:04:12,229 --> 02:04:12,239
go on behalf of the decoder the more
 

6881
02:04:12,239 --> 02:04:14,570
go on behalf of the decoder the more
skilled they really have to be you know

6882
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:14,580
skilled they really have to be you know
 

6883
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:16,729
skilled they really have to be you know
some of the a prime number sequence is

6884
02:04:16,729 --> 02:04:16,739
some of the a prime number sequence is

completely unencoded information
 

6887
02:04:18,900 --> 02:04:21,589
completely unencoded information
essentially but um if you look at the

6888
02:04:21,589 --> 02:04:21,599
essentially but um if you look at the
 

6889
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:23,330
essentially but um if you look at the
Arecibo message

reverse engineer it and figure it out
but you're you're making it harder for

6920
02:05:01,189 --> 02:05:01,199
but you're you're making it harder for
 

6921
02:05:01,199 --> 02:05:03,950
but you're you're making it harder for
them to get to that point so maybe I

6922
02:05:03,950 --> 02:05:03,960
them to get to that point so maybe I
 

6923
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:05,270
them to get to that point so maybe I
always think you probably would have a

6924
02:05:05,270 --> 02:05:05,280
always think you probably would have a
 

6925
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:06,470
always think you probably would have a
two-tier system right you'd probably

6926
02:05:06,470 --> 02:05:06,480
two-tier system right you'd probably
 

6927
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,990
two-tier system right you'd probably
have some lower tier key system and then

6928
02:05:08,990 --> 02:05:09,000
have some lower tier key system and then
 

6929
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,850
have some lower tier key system and then
maybe beneath that you'd have a deeper

6930
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:10,860
maybe beneath that you'd have a deeper
 

6931
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:12,770
maybe beneath that you'd have a deeper
compressed layer of more in-depth

6932
02:05:12,770 --> 02:05:12,780
compressed layer of more in-depth
 

6933
02:05:12,780 --> 02:05:13,910
compressed layer of more in-depth

6934
02:05:13,910 --> 02:05:13,920
information
 

6935
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,490
information
what about maybe

6936
02:05:15,490 --> 02:05:15,500
what about maybe
 

6937
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:18,350
what about maybe
observing physical actual physical

6938

observing physical actual physical
 

6939
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:20,570
observing physical actual physical
objects so first let me go to your Tweet

02:05:22,850 --> 02:05:22,860
as a source of inspiration uh you
 

6943
02:05:22,860 --> 02:05:24,709
as a source of inspiration uh you
tweeted that it's interesting to ponder

6944
02:05:24,709 --> 02:05:24,719
tweeted that it's interesting to ponder
 

6945
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:28,430
tweeted that it's interesting to ponder
that if Oort clouds are ever mined by

6946
02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:28,440
that if Oort clouds are ever mined by
 

6947
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:30,530
that if Oort clouds are ever mined by
the systems of alien civilizations

6948
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:30,540
the systems of alien civilizations

mining equipment from billions of years

6950
02:05:32,689 --> 02:05:32,699
mining equipment from billions of years
 

6951
02:05:32,699 --> 02:05:35,390
mining equipment from billions of years
ago could be in our org Cloud since the

6952
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:35,400
ago could be in our org Cloud since the
 

6953
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:38,930
ago could be in our org Cloud since the
Oort clouds are they they extend really

6954
02:05:38,930 --> 02:05:38,940
Oort clouds are they they extend really
 

6955
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:41,089
Oort clouds are they they extend really
really really really far outside the the

6956
02:05:41,089 --> 02:05:41,099
really really really far outside the the
 

6957
02:05:41,099 --> 02:05:44,510
really really really far outside the the
actual star yeah that so you know mining

6958
02:05:44,510 --> 02:05:44,520
actual star yeah that so you know mining
 

6959
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:47,270
actual star yeah that so you know mining
equipment just like basic boring mining

6960
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:47,280
equipment just like basic boring mining
 

6961
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,410
equipment just like basic boring mining
equipment out there I don't know if

6962
02:05:48,410 --> 02:05:48,420
equipment out there I don't know if
 

6963
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:49,490
equipment out there I don't know if
there's something interesting to say

6964
02:05:49,490 --> 02:05:49,500
there's something interesting to say
 

6965
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:51,589
there's something interesting to say
about or claws themselves that that are

02:05:51,589 --> 02:05:51,599
about or claws themselves that that are
 

6967
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:54,609
about or claws themselves that that are
interesting to you and about possible

non-shiny uh light emitting mining

6970
02:05:58,310 --> 02:05:58,320
non-shiny uh light emitting mining
 

6971
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,050
non-shiny uh light emitting mining
equipment from Alien civilization yeah I

6972
02:06:00,050 --> 02:06:00,060
equipment from Alien civilization yeah I
 

6973
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:01,790
equipment from Alien civilization yeah I
mean that's all I mean that's kind of

6974
02:06:01,790 --> 02:06:01,800
mean that's all I mean that's kind of
 

6975
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:03,709
mean that's all I mean that's kind of
the beauty of the field of techno

6976
02:06:03,709 --> 02:06:03,719
the beauty of the field of techno
 

6977
02:06:03,719 --> 02:06:06,709
the beauty of the field of techno
signatures and looking for life is

6978
02:06:06,709 --> 02:06:06,719
signatures and looking for life is
 

6979
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:09,109
signatures and looking for life is
you can find inspiration and

6980
02:06:09,109 --> 02:06:09,119
you can find inspiration and
 

6981
02:06:09,119 --> 02:06:11,570
you can find inspiration and
intellectual joy in just the smallest

little thing that starts a whole thread

6984
02:06:13,609 --> 02:06:13,619
little thing that starts a whole thread
 

6985
02:06:13,619 --> 02:06:16,129
little thing that starts a whole thread
of building upon it and wondering about

6986
02:06:16,129 --> 02:06:16,139
of building upon it and wondering about
 

6987
02:06:16,139 --> 02:06:19,189
of building upon it and wondering about
the implications and so in this case I

6988
02:06:19,189 --> 02:06:19,199
the implications and so in this case I
 

6989
02:06:19,199 --> 02:06:22,129
the implications and so in this case I
was just really struck by we couldn't

6990
02:06:22,129 --> 02:06:22,139
was just really struck by we couldn't
 

6991
02:06:22,139 --> 02:06:23,689
was just really struck by we couldn't
mentioned this a little bit earlier the

6992
02:06:23,689 --> 02:06:23,699
mentioned this a little bit earlier the
 

6993
02:06:23,699 --> 02:06:26,330
mentioned this a little bit earlier the
idea that stars are not static we tend

6994
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:26,340
idea that stars are not static we tend
 

6995
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:29,270
idea that stars are not static we tend
to think of the Galaxy as having stars

6996
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:29,280
to think of the Galaxy as having stars
 

6997
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:31,010
to think of the Galaxy as having stars
in a certain location from the center of

6998
02:06:31,010 --> 02:06:31,020
in a certain location from the center of
 

6999
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:32,629
in a certain location from the center of
the Galaxy and they kind of live there

7000
02:06:32,629 --> 02:06:32,639
the Galaxy and they kind of live there
 

7001
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:34,910
the Galaxy and they kind of live there
but in truth the stars are not only

7002
02:06:34,910 --> 02:06:34,920
but in truth the stars are not only
 

7003
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:38,270
but in truth the stars are not only
orbiting around the center of the Galaxy

7004
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:38,280
orbiting around the center of the Galaxy
 

7005
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:39,890
orbiting around the center of the Galaxy
um but those orbits are themselves

7006
02:06:39,890 --> 02:06:39,900
um but those orbits are themselves
 

7007
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:42,050
um but those orbits are themselves
changing over time they're processing

7008
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:42,060
changing over time they're processing
 

7009
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:44,390
changing over time they're processing
and so in fact the orbits look more like

7010
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:44,400
and so in fact the orbits look more like
 

7011
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,070
and so in fact the orbits look more like
a spirograph if you've ever done those

7012
02:06:46,070 --> 02:06:46,080
a spirograph if you've ever done those
 

7013
02:06:46,080 --> 02:06:48,709
a spirograph if you've ever done those
as a kid it kind of whirl around and

7014
02:06:48,709 --> 02:06:48,719
as a kid it kind of whirl around and
 

7015
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:50,570
as a kid it kind of whirl around and
Trace out all sorts of strange patterns

7016
02:06:50,570 --> 02:06:50,580
Trace out all sorts of strange patterns
 

7017
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:53,330
Trace out all sorts of strange patterns
and so the Stars intersect with one

7018
02:06:53,330 --> 02:06:53,340
and so the Stars intersect with one
 

7019
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:56,270
and so the Stars intersect with one
another and so the current closest star

7020
02:06:56,270 --> 02:06:56,280
another and so the current closest star
 

7021
02:06:56,280 --> 02:06:58,669
another and so the current closest star
to us is Proxima Centauri which is about

7022
02:06:58,669 --> 02:06:58,679
to us is Proxima Centauri which is about
 

7023
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:00,830
to us is Proxima Centauri which is about
4.2 light years away but it will not

7024
02:07:00,830 --> 02:07:00,840
4.2 light years away but it will not
 

7025
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:02,510
4.2 light years away but it will not
always be the closest star and over

7026
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:02,520
always be the closest star and over
 

7027
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:04,790
always be the closest star and over
millions of years it will be supplanted

7028
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:04,800
millions of years it will be supplanted
 

7029
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:07,550
millions of years it will be supplanted
by other stars in fact data will come

7030
02:07:07,550 --> 02:07:07,560
by other stars in fact data will come
 

7031
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:09,350
by other stars in fact data will come
even closer than proximo within just a

7032
02:07:09,350 --> 02:07:09,360
even closer than proximo within just a
 

7033
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:10,910
even closer than proximo within just a
couple of light years and that's been

7034
02:07:10,910 --> 02:07:10,920
couple of light years and that's been
 

7035
02:07:10,920 --> 02:07:13,010
couple of light years and that's been
happening not just we can project that

7036
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:13,020
happening not just we can project that
 

7037
02:07:13,020 --> 02:07:14,510
happening not just we can project that
will happen over the next few million

7038
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:14,520
will happen over the next few million
 

7039
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,070
will happen over the next few million
years but that's been happening

7040
02:07:16,070 --> 02:07:16,080
years but that's been happening
 

7041
02:07:16,080 --> 02:07:17,870
years but that's been happening
presumably throughout the entire history

7042
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:17,880
presumably throughout the entire history
 

7043
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:20,629
presumably throughout the entire history
of the Galaxy for billions of years and

7044
02:07:20,629 --> 02:07:20,639
of the Galaxy for billions of years and
 

7045
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:22,370
of the Galaxy for billions of years and
so if you went back in time it you know

7046
02:07:22,370 --> 02:07:22,380
so if you went back in time it you know
 

7047
02:07:22,380 --> 02:07:23,450
so if you went back in time it you know
there would have been all sorts of

7048
02:07:23,450 --> 02:07:23,460
there would have been all sorts of
 

7049
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:25,070
there would have been all sorts of
different nearest Stars right different

7050
02:07:25,070 --> 02:07:25,080
different nearest Stars right different
 

7051
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:27,350
different nearest Stars right different
stages of the Earth's history and those

7052
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:27,360
stages of the Earth's history and those
 

7053
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:29,750
stages of the Earth's history and those
stars are so close that they're all

7054
02:07:29,750 --> 02:07:29,760
stars are so close that they're all
 

7055
02:07:29,760 --> 02:07:32,810
stars are so close that they're all
clouds do intermix with one another so

7056
02:07:32,810 --> 02:07:32,820
clouds do intermix with one another so
 

7057
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:34,790
clouds do intermix with one another so
the orc card can extend out to even a

7058
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:34,800
the orc card can extend out to even a
 

7059
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,109
the orc card can extend out to even a
light year or two around the earth

7060
02:07:36,109 --> 02:07:36,119
light year or two around the earth
 

7061
02:07:36,119 --> 02:07:38,629
light year or two around the earth
there's some debate about exactly where

7062
02:07:38,629 --> 02:07:38,639
there's some debate about exactly where
 

7063
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:40,129
there's some debate about exactly where
it ends it probably doesn't really have

7064
02:07:40,129 --> 02:07:40,139
it ends it probably doesn't really have
 

7065
02:07:40,139 --> 02:07:41,930
it ends it probably doesn't really have
a definitive end but kind of more just

7066
02:07:41,930 --> 02:07:41,940
a definitive end but kind of more just
 

7067
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:43,370
a definitive end but kind of more just
kind of Peters out more and more and

7068
02:07:43,370 --> 02:07:43,380
kind of Peters out more and more and
 

7069
02:07:43,380 --> 02:07:45,589
kind of Peters out more and more and
more as you go further away whether for

7070
02:07:45,589 --> 02:07:45,599
more as you go further away whether for
 

7071
02:07:45,599 --> 02:07:47,270
more as you go further away whether for
people who don't know nor Cloud I don't

7072
02:07:47,270 --> 02:07:47,280
people who don't know nor Cloud I don't
 

7073
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:48,470
people who don't know nor Cloud I don't
know what the technical definition is

7074
02:07:48,470 --> 02:07:48,480
know what the technical definition is
 

7075
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,410
know what the technical definition is
but a bunch of rocks are kind of no

7076
02:07:50,410 --> 02:07:50,420
but a bunch of rocks are kind of no
 

7077
02:07:50,420 --> 02:07:55,189
but a bunch of rocks are kind of no
objects that orbit the the the star and

7078
02:07:55,189 --> 02:07:55,199
objects that orbit the the the star and
 

7079
02:07:55,199 --> 02:07:56,270
objects that orbit the the the star and
they can extend really really great

7080
02:07:56,270 --> 02:07:56,280
they can extend really really great
 

7081
02:07:56,280 --> 02:07:58,010
they can extend really really great
because these are objects that probably

7082
02:07:58,010 --> 02:07:58,020
because these are objects that probably
 

7083
02:07:58,020 --> 02:08:01,370
because these are objects that probably
are mostly icy Rich they were probably

7084
02:08:01,370 --> 02:08:01,380
are mostly icy Rich they were probably
 

7085
02:08:01,380 --> 02:08:03,950
are mostly icy Rich they were probably
formed fairly similar distances to

7086
02:08:03,950 --> 02:08:03,960
formed fairly similar distances to
 

7087
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:06,350
formed fairly similar distances to
Jupiter and Saturn but we're scattered

7088
02:08:06,350 --> 02:08:06,360
Jupiter and Saturn but we're scattered
 

7089
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:08,629
Jupiter and Saturn but we're scattered
out through the interactions of those

7090
02:08:08,629 --> 02:08:08,639
out through the interactions of those
 

7091
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:12,229
out through the interactions of those
giant planets we see a circular disk of

7092
02:08:12,229 --> 02:08:12,239
giant planets we see a circular disk of
 

7093
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:14,030
giant planets we see a circular disk of
objects around us which kind of looks

7094
02:08:14,030 --> 02:08:14,040
objects around us which kind of looks
 

7095
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:15,530
objects around us which kind of looks
like the asteroid belt but just for the

7096
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:15,540
like the asteroid belt but just for the
 

7097
02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:17,149
like the asteroid belt but just for the
way called the Kuiper belt and then

7098
02:08:17,149 --> 02:08:17,159
way called the Kuiper belt and then
 

7099
02:08:17,159 --> 02:08:18,649
way called the Kuiper belt and then
further beyond that you get the all

7100
02:08:18,649 --> 02:08:18,659
further beyond that you get the all
 

7101
02:08:18,659 --> 02:08:20,870
further beyond that you get the all
clout and the all cloud is not in a disk

7102
02:08:20,870 --> 02:08:20,880
clout and the all cloud is not in a disk
 

7103
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:22,669
clout and the all cloud is not in a disk
it's just a sphere it kind of surrounds

7104
02:08:22,669 --> 02:08:22,679
it's just a sphere it kind of surrounds
 

7105
02:08:22,679 --> 02:08:24,290
it's just a sphere it kind of surrounds
Us in all directions

7106
02:08:24,290 --> 02:08:24,300
Us in all directions
 

7107
02:08:24,300 --> 02:08:25,910
Us in all directions
so these are objects that were scattered

7108
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:25,920
so these are objects that were scattered
 

7109
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:28,370
so these are objects that were scattered
out through three-dimensionally in all

7110
02:08:28,370 --> 02:08:28,380
out through three-dimensionally in all
 

7111
02:08:28,380 --> 02:08:29,770
out through three-dimensionally in all
different directions

7112
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:29,780
different directions
 

7113
02:08:29,780 --> 02:08:32,890
different directions
and so those objects are potentially

7114
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:32,900
and so those objects are potentially
 

7115
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:35,330
and so those objects are potentially
resources first especially if you were

7116
02:08:35,330 --> 02:08:35,340
resources first especially if you were
 

7117
02:08:35,340 --> 02:08:37,850
resources first especially if you were
planning to do an Interstellar mission

7118
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:37,860
planning to do an Interstellar mission
 

7119
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:40,790
planning to do an Interstellar mission
one day you might want to mine the water

7120
02:08:40,790 --> 02:08:40,800
one day you might want to mine the water
 

7121
02:08:40,800 --> 02:08:42,589
one day you might want to mine the water
that's embedded within those and use

7122
02:08:42,589 --> 02:08:42,599
that's embedded within those and use
 

7123
02:08:42,599 --> 02:08:44,510
that's embedded within those and use
that as either oxygen or a fuel for your

7124
02:08:44,510 --> 02:08:44,520
that as either oxygen or a fuel for your
 

7125
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:47,450
that as either oxygen or a fuel for your
rocket and so it's quite possible and

7126
02:08:47,450 --> 02:08:47,460
rocket and so it's quite possible and
 

7127
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:49,070
rocket and so it's quite possible and
there's also some rare earth metals and

7128
02:08:49,070 --> 02:08:49,080
there's also some rare earth metals and
 

7129
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:50,270
there's also some rare earth metals and
things like that as well but it's quite

7130
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:50,280
things like that as well but it's quite
 

7131
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:51,770
things like that as well but it's quite
possible that a civilization might use

7132
02:08:51,770 --> 02:08:51,780
possible that a civilization might use
 

7133
02:08:51,780 --> 02:08:54,770
possible that a civilization might use
all Cloud objects as a jumping off point

7134
02:08:54,770 --> 02:08:54,780
all Cloud objects as a jumping off point
 

7135
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:57,290
all Cloud objects as a jumping off point
um or or in the Kuiper belt you have

7136
02:08:57,290 --> 02:08:57,300
um or or in the Kuiper belt you have
 

7137
02:08:57,300 --> 02:08:58,910
um or or in the Kuiper belt you have
things like planet nine evens that's

7138
02:08:58,910 --> 02:08:58,920
things like planet nine evens that's
 

7139
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:00,830
things like planet nine evens that's
there might even be objects Beyond in

7140
02:09:00,830 --> 02:09:00,840
there might even be objects Beyond in
 

7141
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:01,910
there might even be objects Beyond in
the Oort cloud which are actually

7142
02:09:01,910 --> 02:09:01,920
the Oort cloud which are actually
 

7143
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:03,709
the Oort cloud which are actually
planet-like that we just cannot detect

7144
02:09:03,709 --> 02:09:03,719
planet-like that we just cannot detect
 

7145
02:09:03,719 --> 02:09:05,870
planet-like that we just cannot detect
these objects are very very faint so

7146
02:09:05,870 --> 02:09:05,880
these objects are very very faint so
 

7147
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:06,950
these objects are very very faint so
that's why they're so hard to see I mean

7148
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:06,960
that's why they're so hard to see I mean
 

7149
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:09,709
that's why they're so hard to see I mean
even planet nine is hypothesized to

7150
02:09:09,709 --> 02:09:09,719
even planet nine is hypothesized to
 

7151
02:09:09,719 --> 02:09:11,689
even planet nine is hypothesized to
exist but we've not been able to confirm

7152
02:09:11,689 --> 02:09:11,699
exist but we've not been able to confirm
 

7153
02:09:11,699 --> 02:09:13,790
exist but we've not been able to confirm
its existence because it's at something

7154
02:09:13,790 --> 02:09:13,800
its existence because it's at something
 

7155
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:15,770
its existence because it's at something
like a thousand a u away from us a

7156
02:09:15,770 --> 02:09:15,780
like a thousand a u away from us a
 

7157
02:09:15,780 --> 02:09:16,910
like a thousand a u away from us a
thousand times the distance of the Earth

7158
02:09:16,910 --> 02:09:16,920
thousand times the distance of the Earth
 

7159
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:18,530
thousand times the distance of the Earth
from the Sun and so even though it's

7160
02:09:18,530 --> 02:09:18,540
from the Sun and so even though it's
 

7161
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:20,450
from the Sun and so even though it's
probably larger than the earth the

7162
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:20,460
probably larger than the earth the
 

7163
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:22,129
probably larger than the earth the
amount of light it reflects from the sun

7164
02:09:22,129 --> 02:09:22,139
amount of light it reflects from the sun
 

7165
02:09:22,139 --> 02:09:23,450
amount of light it reflects from the sun
the sun is what just looks like a star

7166
02:09:23,450 --> 02:09:23,460
the sun is what just looks like a star
 

7167
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:26,030
the sun is what just looks like a star
at that point so far away from it that

7168
02:09:26,030 --> 02:09:26,040
at that point so far away from it that
 

7169
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:27,830
at that point so far away from it that
it barely reflects anything back it's

7170
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:27,840
it barely reflects anything back it's
 

7171
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,050
it barely reflects anything back it's
extremely difficult to detect so there's

7172
02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:30,060
extremely difficult to detect so there's
 

7173
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:31,970
extremely difficult to detect so there's
all sorts of Wonders that may be lurking

7174
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:31,980
all sorts of Wonders that may be lurking
 

7175
02:09:31,980 --> 02:09:34,070
all sorts of Wonders that may be lurking
out in the outer solar system

7176
02:09:34,070 --> 02:09:34,080
out in the outer solar system
 

7177
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:37,070
out in the outer solar system
and so this has leads you to wonder

7178
02:09:37,070 --> 02:09:37,080
and so this has leads you to wonder
 

7179
02:09:37,080 --> 02:09:37,850
and so this has leads you to wonder
um

7180
02:09:37,850 --> 02:09:37,860
um
 

7181
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:39,649
um
you know in the orc cloud

7182
02:09:39,649 --> 02:09:39,659
you know in the orc cloud
 

7183
02:09:39,659 --> 02:09:41,810
you know in the orc cloud
that old Cloud must have intermixed with

7184
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:41,820
that old Cloud must have intermixed with
 

7185
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:44,990
that old Cloud must have intermixed with
other raw clouds in the past and so what

7186
02:09:44,990 --> 02:09:45,000
other raw clouds in the past and so what
 

7187
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,250
other raw clouds in the past and so what
fraction of the hook cloud is truly

7188
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:48,260
fraction of the hook cloud is truly
 

7189
02:09:48,260 --> 02:09:50,810
fraction of the hook cloud is truly
belongs to us belongs to the what was

7190
02:09:50,810 --> 02:09:50,820
belongs to us belongs to the what was
 

7191
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:53,149
belongs to us belongs to the what was
scattered from Jupiter and Saturn what

7192
02:09:53,149 --> 02:09:53,159
scattered from Jupiter and Saturn what
 

7193
02:09:53,159 --> 02:09:56,089
scattered from Jupiter and Saturn what
fraction of it could in fact be uh

7194
02:09:56,089 --> 02:09:56,099
fraction of it could in fact be uh
 

7195
02:09:56,099 --> 02:09:57,950
fraction of it could in fact be uh
Interstellar visitors and of course

7196
02:09:57,950 --> 02:09:57,960
Interstellar visitors and of course
 

7197
02:09:57,960 --> 02:09:59,330
Interstellar visitors and of course
we've got excited about this recently

7198
02:09:59,330 --> 02:09:59,340
we've got excited about this recently
 

7199
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:01,490
we've got excited about this recently
because of omuamua this into cell

the first evidence of an Interstellar
 

7205
02:10:05,580 --> 02:10:08,689
the first evidence of an Interstellar

Cloud intermixing
 

7209
02:10:10,380 --> 02:10:12,109
Cloud intermixing
um it may be that a large fraction of

02:10:12,109 --> 02:10:12,119
um it may be that a large fraction of
 

7211
02:10:12,119 --> 02:10:13,850
um it may be that a large fraction of

special signature that has been
hypothesized to have actually been an

7232
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:31,920
hypothesized to have actually been an
 

7233
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,189
hypothesized to have actually been an
Interstellar visitor but one that was

7234
02:10:34,189 --> 02:10:34,199
Interstellar visitor but one that was
 

7235
02:10:34,199 --> 02:10:36,290
Interstellar visitor but one that was
essentially sourced through this awk

7236
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:36,300
essentially sourced through this awk
 

7237
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:38,750
essentially sourced through this awk
Cloud mixing and so this is kind of

7238
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:38,760
Cloud mixing and so this is kind of
 

7239
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:40,189
Cloud mixing and so this is kind of
intriguing

7240
02:10:40,189 --> 02:10:40,199
intriguing
 

7241
02:10:40,199 --> 02:10:42,649
intriguing
um and also you know the outer solar

7242
02:10:42,649 --> 02:10:42,659
um and also you know the outer solar
 

7243
02:10:42,659 --> 02:10:44,570
um and also you know the outer solar
system is just such a it's like at the

7244
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:44,580
system is just such a it's like at the
 

7245
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:46,129
system is just such a it's like at the
bottom of the ocean we know so little

7246
02:10:46,129 --> 02:10:46,139
bottom of the ocean we know so little
 

7247
02:10:46,139 --> 02:10:47,810
bottom of the ocean we know so little
about what's on the bottom of our own

7248
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:47,820
about what's on the bottom of our own
 

7249
02:10:47,820 --> 02:10:50,750
about what's on the bottom of our own
plants ocean and we know next to nothing

7250
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:50,760
plants ocean and we know next to nothing
 

7251
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,609
plants ocean and we know next to nothing
about watching the outskirts of our own

7252
02:10:52,609 --> 02:10:52,619
about watching the outskirts of our own
 

7253
02:10:52,619 --> 02:10:55,250
about watching the outskirts of our own
solar system it's all Darkness yeah so

7254
02:10:55,250 --> 02:10:55,260
solar system it's all Darkness yeah so
 

7255
02:10:55,260 --> 02:10:56,330
solar system it's all Darkness yeah so
like

7256
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:56,340
like
 

7257
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:58,850
like
that that's one of the things is to

7258
02:10:58,850 --> 02:10:58,860
that that's one of the things is to
 

7259
02:10:58,860 --> 02:11:01,370
that that's one of the things is to
understand the phenomena we need light

7260
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:01,380
understand the phenomena we need light
 

7261
02:11:01,380 --> 02:11:03,649
understand the phenomena we need light
and we need to see how light interacts

7262
02:11:03,649 --> 02:11:03,659
and we need to see how light interacts
 

7263
02:11:03,659 --> 02:11:07,010
and we need to see how light interacts
with it or what light M A's from it

7264
02:11:07,010 --> 02:11:07,020
with it or what light M A's from it
 

7265
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:09,229
with it or what light M A's from it
but most of our universe is Darkness so

7266
02:11:09,229 --> 02:11:09,239
but most of our universe is Darkness so
 

7267
02:11:09,239 --> 02:11:10,010
but most of our universe is Darkness so
it's

7268
02:11:10,010 --> 02:11:10,020
it's
 

7269
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:11,390
it's
there could be a lot of interesting

7270
02:11:11,390 --> 02:11:11,400
there could be a lot of interesting
 

7271
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:12,649
there could be a lot of interesting
stuff I mean this is where your interest

7272
02:11:12,649 --> 02:11:12,659
stuff I mean this is where your interest
 

7273
02:11:12,659 --> 02:11:15,050
stuff I mean this is where your interest
is with the with the cool worlds and the

7274
02:11:15,050 --> 02:11:15,060
is with the with the cool worlds and the
 

7275
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:17,089
is with the with the cool worlds and the
interesting stuff lurks in the darkness

7276
02:11:17,089 --> 02:11:17,099
interesting stuff lurks in the darkness
 

7277
02:11:17,099 --> 02:11:19,490
interesting stuff lurks in the darkness
right basically all of us you know 400

7278
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:19,500
right basically all of us you know 400
 

7279
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:21,649
right basically all of us you know 400
years of astronomy are only window into

7280
02:11:21,649 --> 02:11:21,659
years of astronomy are only window into
 

7281
02:11:21,659 --> 02:11:24,109
years of astronomy are only window into
the universe has been light and that has

7282
02:11:24,109 --> 02:11:24,119
the universe has been light and that has
 

7283
02:11:24,119 --> 02:11:25,970
the universe has been light and that has
only changed quite recently with the

7284
02:11:25,970 --> 02:11:25,980
only changed quite recently with the
 

7285
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:28,070
only changed quite recently with the
discovery of gravitational waves that's

7286
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:28,080
discovery of gravitational waves that's
 

7287
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:31,669
discovery of gravitational waves that's
now a new window and hopefully uh well

7288
02:11:31,669 --> 02:11:31,679
now a new window and hopefully uh well
 

7289
02:11:31,679 --> 02:11:33,410
now a new window and hopefully uh well
to some degree I guess solar neutrinos

7290
02:11:33,410 --> 02:11:33,420
to some degree I guess solar neutrinos
 

7291
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:34,669
to some degree I guess solar neutrinos
we've been detecting from art but they

7292
02:11:34,669 --> 02:11:34,679
we've been detecting from art but they
 

7293
02:11:34,679 --> 02:11:36,109
we've been detecting from art but they
come from the certain Interstellar space

7294
02:11:36,109 --> 02:11:36,119
come from the certain Interstellar space
 

7295
02:11:36,119 --> 02:11:38,149
come from the certain Interstellar space
but we may be able to soon detect

7296
02:11:38,149 --> 02:11:38,159
but we may be able to soon detect
 

7297
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:40,189
but we may be able to soon detect
neutrino messages as even hypothesized

7298
02:11:40,189 --> 02:11:40,199
neutrino messages as even hypothesized
 

7299
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:41,270
neutrino messages as even hypothesized
as a way of communicating between

7300
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:41,280
as a way of communicating between
 

7301
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:43,010
as a way of communicating between
civilizations as well or just do

7302
02:11:43,010 --> 02:11:43,020
civilizations as well or just do
 

7303
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:45,890
civilizations as well or just do
neutrino telescopes to study the

7304
02:11:45,890 --> 02:11:45,900
neutrino telescopes to study the
 

7305
02:11:45,900 --> 02:11:47,450
neutrino telescopes to study the
universe and so there's a growing

7306
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:47,460
universe and so there's a growing
 

7307
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:48,490
universe and so there's a growing
interest in what we'd call

7308
02:11:48,490 --> 02:11:48,500
interest in what we'd call
 

7309
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:51,589
interest in what we'd call
multi-messenger astronomy now so not

7310
02:11:51,589 --> 02:11:51,599
multi-messenger astronomy now so not
 

7311
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:53,209
multi-messenger astronomy now so not
just messages from light but messages

7312
02:11:53,209 --> 02:11:53,219
just messages from light but messages
 

7313
02:11:53,219 --> 02:11:57,070
just messages from light but messages
from these but the physical

7314
02:11:57,070 --> 02:11:57,080
from these but the physical
 

7315
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:59,089
from these but the physical
packets of information that are coming

7316
02:11:59,089 --> 02:11:59,099
packets of information that are coming
 

7317
02:11:59,099 --> 02:12:01,609
packets of information that are coming
our way but when it comes to the outer

7318
02:12:01,609 --> 02:12:01,619
our way but when it comes to the outer
 

7319
02:12:01,619 --> 02:12:02,750
our way but when it comes to the outer
solar system

7320
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:02,760
solar system
 

7321
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:05,149
solar system
light really is our only window there's

7322
02:12:05,149 --> 02:12:05,159
light really is our only window there's
 

7323
02:12:05,159 --> 02:12:06,890
light really is our only window there's
two there's two ways of doing that one

7324
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:06,900
two there's two ways of doing that one
 

7325
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:08,209
two there's two ways of doing that one
is you detect the light from the all

7326
02:12:08,209 --> 02:12:08,219
is you detect the light from the all
 

7327
02:12:08,219 --> 02:12:10,189
is you detect the light from the all
Cloud object itself which as I just said

7328
02:12:10,189 --> 02:12:10,199
Cloud object itself which as I just said
 

7329
02:12:10,199 --> 02:12:12,109
Cloud object itself which as I just said
is very very difficult there's another

7330
02:12:12,109 --> 02:12:12,119
is very very difficult there's another
 

7331
02:12:12,119 --> 02:12:14,330
is very very difficult there's another
trick which we do in the Kuiper belt

7332
02:12:14,330 --> 02:12:14,340
trick which we do in the Kuiper belt
 

7333
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:17,149
trick which we do in the Kuiper belt
especially and that's called um an

7334
02:12:17,149 --> 02:12:17,159
especially and that's called um an
 

7335
02:12:17,159 --> 02:12:19,370
especially and that's called um an
occultation and so sometimes those

7336
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:19,380
occultation and so sometimes those
 

7337
02:12:19,380 --> 02:12:21,950
occultation and so sometimes those
objects will just pass in front of a

7338
02:12:21,950 --> 02:12:21,960
objects will just pass in front of a
 

7339
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:24,410
objects will just pass in front of a
distant star just coincidentally these

7340
02:12:24,410 --> 02:12:24,420
distant star just coincidentally these
 

7341
02:12:24,420 --> 02:12:26,149
distant star just coincidentally these
are very very brief moments they last

7342
02:12:26,149 --> 02:12:26,159
are very very brief moments they last
 

7343
02:12:26,159 --> 02:12:28,550
are very very brief moments they last
for less than a second and so you have

7344
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:28,560
for less than a second and so you have
 

7345
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:30,410
for less than a second and so you have
to have a very fast camera to detect

7346
02:12:30,410 --> 02:12:30,420
to have a very fast camera to detect
 

7347
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:32,089
to have a very fast camera to detect
them which conventionally astronomers

7348
02:12:32,089 --> 02:12:32,099
them which conventionally astronomers
 

7349
02:12:32,099 --> 02:12:33,950
them which conventionally astronomers
don't usually build fast cameras most of

7350
02:12:33,950 --> 02:12:33,960
don't usually build fast cameras most of
 

7351
02:12:33,960 --> 02:12:35,570
don't usually build fast cameras most of
the phenomena we observe occurs on hours

7352
02:12:35,570 --> 02:12:35,580
the phenomena we observe occurs on hours
 

7353
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:37,970
the phenomena we observe occurs on hours
minutes stays even but now we're

7354
02:12:37,970 --> 02:12:37,980
minutes stays even but now we're
 

7355
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:39,709
minutes stays even but now we're
developing cameras which can take you

7356
02:12:39,709 --> 02:12:39,719
developing cameras which can take you
 

7357
02:12:39,719 --> 02:12:42,470
developing cameras which can take you
know thousands of images per second and

7358
02:12:42,470 --> 02:12:42,480
know thousands of images per second and
 

7359
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:44,030
know thousands of images per second and
yet do it at the kind of astronomical

7360
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:44,040
yet do it at the kind of astronomical
 

7361
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:46,070
yet do it at the kind of astronomical
Fidelity that we that we need for this

7362
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:46,080
Fidelity that we that we need for this
 

7363
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,990
Fidelity that we that we need for this
kind of precise measurement and so you

7364
02:12:47,990 --> 02:12:48,000
kind of precise measurement and so you
 

7365
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,990
kind of precise measurement and so you
can see these these very fast dips you

7366
02:12:50,990 --> 02:12:51,000
can see these these very fast dips you
 

7367
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,129
can see these these very fast dips you
even get these kind of diffraction

7368
02:12:52,129 --> 02:12:52,139
even get these kind of diffraction
 

7369
02:12:52,139 --> 02:12:54,290
even get these kind of diffraction
patterns that come around which are

7370
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:54,300
patterns that come around which are
 

7371
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:56,930
patterns that come around which are
really cool to look at and that's I kind

7372
02:12:56,930 --> 02:12:56,940
really cool to look at and that's I kind
 

7373
02:12:56,940 --> 02:12:57,770
really cool to look at and that's I kind
of love it because it's almost like

7374
02:12:57,770 --> 02:12:57,780
of love it because it's almost like
 

7375
02:12:57,780 --> 02:13:00,470
of love it because it's almost like
passive radar your you have these

7376
02:13:00,470 --> 02:13:00,480
passive radar your you have these
 

7377
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:03,350
passive radar your you have these
pinpricks of light imagine that you live

7378
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:03,360
pinpricks of light imagine that you live
 

7379
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,629
pinpricks of light imagine that you live
in a giant black sphere but there's

7380
02:13:05,629 --> 02:13:05,639
in a giant black sphere but there's
 

7381
02:13:05,639 --> 02:13:07,129
in a giant black sphere but there's
these little pinholes that have been

7382
02:13:07,129 --> 02:13:07,139
these little pinholes that have been
 

7383
02:13:07,139 --> 02:13:09,350
these little pinholes that have been
poked and through those pinholes almost

7384
02:13:09,350 --> 02:13:09,360
poked and through those pinholes almost
 

7385
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:11,810
poked and through those pinholes almost
laser light is shining through and

7386
02:13:11,810 --> 02:13:11,820
laser light is shining through and
 

7387
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:14,450
laser light is shining through and
inside this black sphere there are

7388
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:14,460
inside this black sphere there are
 

7389
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:16,970
inside this black sphere there are
unknown things wandering around drifting

7390
02:13:16,970 --> 02:13:16,980
unknown things wandering around drifting
 

7391
02:13:16,980 --> 02:13:18,169
unknown things wandering around drifting
around that we are trying to discover

7392
02:13:18,169 --> 02:13:18,179
around that we are trying to discover
 

7393
02:13:18,179 --> 02:13:20,510
around that we are trying to discover
and sometimes they will pass in front of

7394
02:13:20,510 --> 02:13:20,520
and sometimes they will pass in front of
 

7395
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:23,089
and sometimes they will pass in front of
those little Pencil Thin laser beams and

7396
02:13:23,089 --> 02:13:23,099
those little Pencil Thin laser beams and
 

7397
02:13:23,099 --> 02:13:24,649
those little Pencil Thin laser beams and
block something out and so we can tell

7398
02:13:24,649 --> 02:13:24,659
block something out and so we can tell
 

7399
02:13:24,659 --> 02:13:26,569
block something out and so we can tell
that it's there and it's not an active

7400
02:13:26,569 --> 02:13:26,579
that it's there and it's not an active
 

7401
02:13:26,579 --> 02:13:28,189
that it's there and it's not an active
radar because we didn't actually you

7402
02:13:28,189 --> 02:13:28,199
radar because we didn't actually you
 

7403
02:13:28,199 --> 02:13:29,450
radar because we didn't actually you
know beam anything out and get a

7404
02:13:29,450 --> 02:13:29,460
know beam anything out and get a
 

7405
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:31,010
know beam anything out and get a
reflection off which is what the sun

7406
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:31,020
reflection off which is what the sun
 

7407
02:13:31,020 --> 02:13:32,750
reflection off which is what the sun
does the Sun's light comes off and it

7408
02:13:32,750 --> 02:13:32,760
does the Sun's light comes off and it
 

7409
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:33,830
does the Sun's light comes off and it
comes back that's more like an active

7410
02:13:33,830 --> 02:13:33,840
comes back that's more like an active
 

7411
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,569
comes back that's more like an active
radar system there's more like a passive

7412
02:13:35,569 --> 02:13:35,579
radar system there's more like a passive
 

7413
02:13:35,579 --> 02:13:37,970
radar system there's more like a passive
radar system where we are just listening

7414
02:13:37,970 --> 02:13:37,980
radar system where we are just listening
 

7415
02:13:37,980 --> 02:13:40,609
radar system where we are just listening
very intently and so

7416
02:13:40,609 --> 02:13:40,619
very intently and so
 

7417
02:13:40,619 --> 02:13:42,830
very intently and so
um I'm kind of so fascinated by that the

7418
02:13:42,830 --> 02:13:42,840
um I'm kind of so fascinated by that the
 

7419
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:47,089
um I'm kind of so fascinated by that the
idea that we could map out the rich

7420
02:13:47,089 --> 02:13:47,099
idea that we could map out the rich
 

7421
02:13:47,099 --> 02:13:49,330
idea that we could map out the rich
architecture of the outer solar system

7422
02:13:49,330 --> 02:13:49,340
architecture of the outer solar system
 

7423
02:13:49,340 --> 02:13:51,410
architecture of the outer solar system
just by doing something that we could

7424
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:51,420
just by doing something that we could
 

7425
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:52,910
just by doing something that we could
have done potentially for a long time

7426
02:13:52,910 --> 02:13:52,920
have done potentially for a long time
 

7427
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:54,470
have done potentially for a long time
okay which is just listening in the

7428
02:13:54,470 --> 02:13:54,480
okay which is just listening in the
 

7429
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:56,810
okay which is just listening in the
right way just just tuning Our

7430
02:13:56,810 --> 02:13:56,820
right way just just tuning Our
 

7431
02:13:56,820 --> 02:14:00,229
right way just just tuning Our
instrumentation to the correct way of of

7432
02:14:00,229 --> 02:14:00,239
instrumentation to the correct way of of
 

7433
02:14:00,239 --> 02:14:02,629
instrumentation to the correct way of of
not listening but viewing the universe

7434
02:14:02,629 --> 02:14:02,639
not listening but viewing the universe
 

7435
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:05,149
not listening but viewing the universe
to catch those objects yeah I mean it's

7436
02:14:05,149 --> 02:14:05,159
to catch those objects yeah I mean it's
 

7437
02:14:05,159 --> 02:14:06,890
to catch those objects yeah I mean it's
really fascinating it seems almost

7438
02:14:06,890 --> 02:14:06,900
really fascinating it seems almost
 

7439
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:09,589
really fascinating it seems almost
obvious that your efforts when projected

7440
02:14:09,589 --> 02:14:09,599
obvious that your efforts when projected
 

7441
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:12,649
obvious that your efforts when projected
out and over like 100 200 years will

7442
02:14:12,649 --> 02:14:12,659
out and over like 100 200 years will
 

7443
02:14:12,659 --> 02:14:14,810
out and over like 100 200 years will
have a really good map three even

7444
02:14:14,810 --> 02:14:14,820
have a really good map three even
 

7445
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:16,729
have a really good map three even
methods that basically Transit timing

7446
02:14:16,729 --> 02:14:16,739
methods that basically Transit timing
 

7447
02:14:16,739 --> 02:14:18,890
methods that basically Transit timing
high resolution Transit timing but

7448
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:18,900
high resolution Transit timing but
 

7449
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:21,530
high resolution Transit timing but
basically the planetary and the uh the

7450
02:14:21,530 --> 02:14:21,540
basically the planetary and the uh the
 

7451
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:25,010
basically the planetary and the uh the
planet satellite movements that of all

7452
02:14:25,010 --> 02:14:25,020
planet satellite movements that of all
 

7453
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:25,970
planet satellite movements that of all
the different

7454
02:14:25,970 --> 02:14:25,980
the different
 

7455
02:14:25,980 --> 02:14:28,370
the different
star systems out there yeah and it could

7456
02:14:28,370 --> 02:14:28,380
star systems out there yeah and it could
 

7457
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:29,629
star systems out there yeah and it could
revolutionize the way we think about the

7458
02:14:29,629 --> 02:14:29,639
revolutionize the way we think about the
 

7459
02:14:29,639 --> 02:14:32,330
revolutionize the way we think about the
solar system I mean that revolution has

7460
02:14:32,330 --> 02:14:32,340
solar system I mean that revolution has
 

7461
02:14:32,340 --> 02:14:33,950
solar system I mean that revolution has
happened several times in the past when

7462
02:14:33,950 --> 02:14:33,960
happened several times in the past when
 

7463
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:37,550
happened several times in the past when
we discovered Vesta in the 19th century

7464
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:37,560
we discovered Vesta in the 19th century
 

7465
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,890
we discovered Vesta in the 19th century
um that was I think the the seventh

7466
02:14:39,890 --> 02:14:39,900
um that was I think the the seventh
 

7467
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:41,270
um that was I think the the seventh
planet for a while or the eighth planet

7468
02:14:41,270 --> 02:14:41,280
planet for a while or the eighth planet
 

7469
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:42,770
planet for a while or the eighth planet
when it was first discovered and then we

7470
02:14:42,770 --> 02:14:42,780
when it was first discovered and then we
 

7471
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:44,930
when it was first discovered and then we
discovered Ceres and there was a bunch

7472
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:44,940
discovered Ceres and there was a bunch
 

7473
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:47,450
discovered Ceres and there was a bunch
of asteroid objects Janus and so for a

7474
02:14:47,450 --> 02:14:47,460
of asteroid objects Janus and so for a
 

7475
02:14:47,460 --> 02:14:49,430
of asteroid objects Janus and so for a
while the textbooks had

7476
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:49,440
while the textbooks had
 

7477
02:14:49,440 --> 02:14:50,990
while the textbooks had
um there was something like 13 planets

7478
02:14:50,990 --> 02:14:51,000
um there was something like 13 planets
 

7479
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,669
um there was something like 13 planets
in the solar system and then they and

7480
02:14:52,669 --> 02:14:52,679
in the solar system and then they and
 

7481
02:14:52,679 --> 02:14:54,109
in the solar system and then they and
then that was just a new capability that

7482
02:14:54,109 --> 02:14:54,119
then that was just a new capability that
 

7483
02:14:54,119 --> 02:14:55,550
then that was just a new capability that
was emerging to detach those small

7484
02:14:55,550 --> 02:14:55,560
was emerging to detach those small
 

7485
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:57,410
was emerging to detach those small
objects and then we ripped that up and

7486
02:14:57,410 --> 02:14:57,420
objects and then we ripped that up and
 

7487
02:14:57,420 --> 02:14:58,910
objects and then we ripped that up and
said no no we're going to change the

7488
02:14:58,910 --> 02:14:58,920
said no no we're going to change the
 

7489
02:14:58,920 --> 02:15:00,950
said no no we're going to change the
definition of a planet and then the same

7490
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:00,960
definition of a planet and then the same
 

7491
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:02,030
definition of a planet and then the same
thing happened when we started looking

7492
02:15:02,030 --> 02:15:02,040
thing happened when we started looking
 

7493
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:03,770
thing happened when we started looking
the outer skirts of the solar system

7494
02:15:03,770 --> 02:15:03,780
the outer skirts of the solar system
 

7495
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:06,050
the outer skirts of the solar system
again we found Eris we found cedner

7496
02:15:06,050 --> 02:15:06,060
again we found Eris we found cedner
 

7497
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:09,589
again we found Eris we found cedner
these objects which resembled Pluto and

7498
02:15:09,589 --> 02:15:09,599
these objects which resembled Pluto and
 

7499
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:11,209
these objects which resembled Pluto and
the more and more of them we found make

7500
02:15:11,209 --> 02:15:11,219
the more and more of them we found make
 

7501
02:15:11,219 --> 02:15:14,270
the more and more of them we found make
make and eventually we again had to

7502
02:15:14,270 --> 02:15:14,280
make and eventually we again had to
 

7503
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:17,750
make and eventually we again had to
rethink the way we even contextualize

7504
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:17,760
rethink the way we even contextualize
 

7505
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:20,209
rethink the way we even contextualize
what a planet is and what the nature of

7506
02:15:20,209 --> 02:15:20,219
what a planet is and what the nature of
 

7507
02:15:20,219 --> 02:15:22,729
what a planet is and what the nature of
the outer solar system is so regardless

7508
02:15:22,729 --> 02:15:22,739
the outer solar system is so regardless
 

7509
02:15:22,739 --> 02:15:24,109
the outer solar system is so regardless
as to what you think about the debate

7510
02:15:24,109 --> 02:15:24,119
as to what you think about the debate
 

7511
02:15:24,119 --> 02:15:26,390
as to what you think about the debate
about whether Pluto should be demoted or

7512
02:15:26,390 --> 02:15:26,400
about whether Pluto should be demoted or
 

7513
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:27,950
about whether Pluto should be demoted or
not which I know often invokes a lot of

7514
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:27,960
not which I know often invokes a lot of
 

7515
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:29,870
not which I know often invokes a lot of
strong feelings it is an incredible

7516
02:15:29,870 --> 02:15:29,880
strong feelings it is an incredible
 

7517
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:34,390
strong feelings it is an incredible
achievement that we were able to

7518
02:15:34,390 --> 02:15:34,400
achievement that we were able to
 

7519
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:37,250
achievement that we were able to
transform our view of the solar system

7520
02:15:37,250 --> 02:15:37,260
transform our view of the solar system
 

7521
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:39,290
transform our view of the solar system
in a matter of years just by basically

7522
02:15:39,290 --> 02:15:39,300
in a matter of years just by basically
 

7523
02:15:39,300 --> 02:15:41,689
in a matter of years just by basically
you know charge coupled devices the

7524
02:15:41,689 --> 02:15:41,699
you know charge coupled devices the
 

7525
02:15:41,699 --> 02:15:44,030
you know charge coupled devices the
things that's in in cameras

7526
02:15:44,030 --> 02:15:44,040
things that's in in cameras
 

7527
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:45,589
things that's in in cameras
um though the invention of that device

7528
02:15:45,589 --> 02:15:45,599
um though the invention of that device
 

7529
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:48,229
um though the invention of that device
allowed us to detect objects which were

7530
02:15:48,229 --> 02:15:48,239
allowed us to detect objects which were
 

7531
02:15:48,239 --> 02:15:50,330
allowed us to detect objects which were
much further away much fainter and

7532
02:15:50,330 --> 02:15:50,340
much further away much fainter and
 

7533
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:51,709
much further away much fainter and
revealed all of this stuff that was

7534
02:15:51,709 --> 02:15:51,719
revealed all of this stuff that was
 

7535
02:15:51,719 --> 02:15:54,350
revealed all of this stuff that was
there all along and so it that's the

7536
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:54,360
there all along and so it that's the
 

7537
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:57,410
there all along and so it that's the
beauty of astronomy that's just uh so

7538
02:15:57,410 --> 02:15:57,420
beauty of astronomy that's just uh so
 

7539
02:15:57,420 --> 02:15:59,750
beauty of astronomy that's just uh so
much to discover and even in our own

7540
02:15:59,750 --> 02:15:59,760
much to discover and even in our own
 

7541
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:02,030
much to discover and even in our own
backyard do you ever think about this do

7542
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:02,040
backyard do you ever think about this do
 

7543
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:04,370
backyard do you ever think about this do
you imagine what are the things that

7544
02:16:04,370 --> 02:16:04,380
you imagine what are the things that
 

7545
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:05,750
you imagine what are the things that
will completely change astronomy over

7546
02:16:05,750 --> 02:16:05,760
will completely change astronomy over
 

7547
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:07,370
will completely change astronomy over
the next hundred years like if you

7548
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:07,380
the next hundred years like if you
 

7549
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:09,770
the next hundred years like if you
transport yourself forward 100 years

7550
02:16:09,770 --> 02:16:09,780
transport yourself forward 100 years
 

7551
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:12,050
transport yourself forward 100 years
what are the things that will blow your

7552
02:16:12,050 --> 02:16:12,060
what are the things that will blow your
 

7553
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:15,169
what are the things that will blow your
mind when you look at wait what would it

7554
02:16:15,169 --> 02:16:15,179
mind when you look at wait what would it
 

7555
02:16:15,179 --> 02:16:17,629
mind when you look at wait what would it
be just a very high resolution mapping

7556
02:16:17,629 --> 02:16:17,639
be just a very high resolution mapping
 

7557
02:16:17,639 --> 02:16:19,970
be just a very high resolution mapping
of things like holy crap like one

7558
02:16:19,970 --> 02:16:19,980
of things like holy crap like one
 

7559
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:22,069
of things like holy crap like one
surprising thing might be holy crap

7560
02:16:22,069 --> 02:16:22,079
surprising thing might be holy crap
 

7561
02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:23,089
surprising thing might be holy crap
there's

7562
02:16:23,089 --> 02:16:23,099
there's
 

7563
02:16:23,099 --> 02:16:26,890
there's
like Earth-like moons everywhere yeah

7564
02:16:26,890 --> 02:16:26,900
like Earth-like moons everywhere yeah
 

7565
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:28,910
like Earth-like moons everywhere yeah
another one could be just totally

7566
02:16:28,910 --> 02:16:28,920
another one could be just totally
 

7567
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:31,310
another one could be just totally
different devices for sensing

7568
02:16:31,310 --> 02:16:31,320
different devices for sensing
 

7569
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:33,889
different devices for sensing
yeah I think you usually astronomy moves

7570
02:16:33,889 --> 02:16:33,899
yeah I think you usually astronomy moves
 

7571
02:16:33,899 --> 02:16:36,110
yeah I think you usually astronomy moves
forward dramatically and Science in

7572
02:16:36,110 --> 02:16:36,120
forward dramatically and Science in
 

7573
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:37,790
forward dramatically and Science in
general when you have a new

7574
02:16:37,790 --> 02:16:37,800
general when you have a new
 

7575
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:39,589
general when you have a new
technological capability come online for

7576
02:16:39,589 --> 02:16:39,599
technological capability come online for
 

7577
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:41,270
technological capability come online for
the first time

7578
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:41,280
the first time
 

7579
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,129
the first time
um and we kind of just gave examples of

7580
02:16:43,129 --> 02:16:43,139
um and we kind of just gave examples of
 

7581
02:16:43,139 --> 02:16:46,129
um and we kind of just gave examples of
that there with the solar system so what

7582
02:16:46,129 --> 02:16:46,139
that there with the solar system so what
 

7583
02:16:46,139 --> 02:16:48,049
that there with the solar system so what
kind of new capabilities might emerge in

7584
02:16:48,049 --> 02:16:48,059
kind of new capabilities might emerge in
 

7585
02:16:48,059 --> 02:16:50,209
kind of new capabilities might emerge in
the next 100 years the capability I

7586
02:16:50,209 --> 02:16:50,219
the next 100 years the capability I
 

7587
02:16:50,219 --> 02:16:53,030
the next 100 years the capability I
would love to see is not just I mean we

7588
02:16:53,030 --> 02:16:53,040
would love to see is not just I mean we
 

7589
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:54,889
would love to see is not just I mean we
in the next 10 20 years we're hoping to

7590
02:16:54,889 --> 02:16:54,899
in the next 10 20 years we're hoping to
 

7591
02:16:54,899 --> 02:16:56,750
in the next 10 20 years we're hoping to
take these pale blue dot images we spoke

7592
02:16:56,750 --> 02:16:56,760
take these pale blue dot images we spoke
 

7593
02:16:56,760 --> 02:16:58,370
take these pale blue dot images we spoke
about so that requires building

7594
02:16:58,370 --> 02:16:58,380
about so that requires building
 

7595
02:16:58,380 --> 02:17:01,070
about so that requires building
something like jwst but on even larger

7596
02:17:01,070 --> 02:17:01,080
something like jwst but on even larger
 

7597
02:17:01,080 --> 02:17:03,230
something like jwst but on even larger
scale and optimize for direct Imaging

7598
02:17:03,230 --> 02:17:03,240
scale and optimize for direct Imaging
 

7599
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:05,330
scale and optimize for direct Imaging
and have to have either coronagraph or a

7600
02:17:05,330 --> 02:17:05,340
and have to have either coronagraph or a
 

7601
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:06,889
and have to have either coronagraph or a
star shade or something to block out the

7602
02:17:06,889 --> 02:17:06,899
star shade or something to block out the
 

7603
02:17:06,899 --> 02:17:08,810
star shade or something to block out the
Starlight and reveal those pale blue

7604
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:08,820
Starlight and reveal those pale blue
 

7605
02:17:08,820 --> 02:17:11,810
Starlight and reveal those pale blue
dots so in the next sort of decades I

7606
02:17:11,810 --> 02:17:11,820
dots so in the next sort of decades I
 

7607
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:14,150
dots so in the next sort of decades I
think that's the achievement that we can

7608
02:17:14,150 --> 02:17:14,160
think that's the achievement that we can
 

7609
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:16,190
think that's the achievement that we can
look forward to in our lifetimes is to

7610
02:17:16,190 --> 02:17:16,200
look forward to in our lifetimes is to
 

7611
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:19,730
look forward to in our lifetimes is to
see photos of other Earths going beyond

7612
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:19,740
see photos of other Earths going beyond
 

7613
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:21,589
see photos of other Earths going beyond
that maybe in our lifetimes towards the

7614
02:17:21,589 --> 02:17:21,599
that maybe in our lifetimes towards the
 

7615
02:17:21,599 --> 02:17:23,270
that maybe in our lifetimes towards the
end of our lifetimes perhaps I'd love it

7616
02:17:23,270 --> 02:17:23,280
end of our lifetimes perhaps I'd love it
 

7617
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:24,889
end of our lifetimes perhaps I'd love it
if we yeah I think it's technically

7618
02:17:24,889 --> 02:17:24,899
if we yeah I think it's technically
 

7619
02:17:24,899 --> 02:17:26,570
if we yeah I think it's technically
possible as breakthrough stars are

7620
02:17:26,570 --> 02:17:26,580
possible as breakthrough stars are
 

7621
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:29,089
possible as breakthrough stars are
giving us a lot of encouragement with to

7622
02:17:29,089 --> 02:17:29,099
giving us a lot of encouragement with to
 

7623
02:17:29,099 --> 02:17:31,190
giving us a lot of encouragement with to
maybe send a small probe to the nearest

7624
02:17:31,190 --> 02:17:31,200
maybe send a small probe to the nearest
 

7625
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:33,589
maybe send a small probe to the nearest
stars and start actually taking high

7626
02:17:33,589 --> 02:17:33,599
stars and start actually taking high
 

7627
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:35,150
stars and start actually taking high
resolution images of these objects

7628
02:17:35,150 --> 02:17:35,160
resolution images of these objects
 

7629
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:37,429
resolution images of these objects
there's only so much you can do from far

7630
02:17:37,429 --> 02:17:37,439
there's only so much you can do from far
 

7631
02:17:37,439 --> 02:17:38,330
there's only so much you can do from far
away

7632
02:17:38,330 --> 02:17:38,340
away
 

7633
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:40,429
away
if you want to have and we can see it in

7634
02:17:40,429 --> 02:17:40,439
if you want to have and we can see it in
 

7635
02:17:40,439 --> 02:17:42,110
if you want to have and we can see it in
the solar system I mean there's only so

7636
02:17:42,110 --> 02:17:42,120
the solar system I mean there's only so
 

7637
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:43,310
the solar system I mean there's only so
much you can learn about Europa by

7638
02:17:43,310 --> 02:17:43,320
much you can learn about Europa by
 

7639
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:44,750
much you can learn about Europa by
pointing Hubble Space Telescope at it

7640
02:17:44,750 --> 02:17:44,760
pointing Hubble Space Telescope at it
 

7641
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:45,830
pointing Hubble Space Telescope at it
but if you really want to understand

7642
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:45,840
but if you really want to understand
 

7643
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:47,629
but if you really want to understand
that that Moon you're going to have to

7644
02:17:47,629 --> 02:17:47,639
that that Moon you're going to have to
 

7645
02:17:47,639 --> 02:17:49,969
that that Moon you're going to have to
send something to orbit it to hopefully

7646
02:17:49,969 --> 02:17:49,979
send something to orbit it to hopefully
 

7647
02:17:49,979 --> 02:17:51,770
send something to orbit it to hopefully
land on it and drill down to the surface

7648
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:51,780
land on it and drill down to the surface
 

7649
02:17:51,780 --> 02:17:55,370
land on it and drill down to the surface
and so the idea of even taking a flyby

7650
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:55,380
and so the idea of even taking a flyby
 

7651
02:17:55,380 --> 02:17:57,410
and so the idea of even taking a flyby
and doing a snapshot photo that gets

7652
02:17:57,410 --> 02:17:57,420
and doing a snapshot photo that gets
 

7653
02:17:57,420 --> 02:17:59,929
and doing a snapshot photo that gets
beamed back that could be doesn't even

7654
02:17:59,929 --> 02:17:59,939
beamed back that could be doesn't even
 

7655
02:17:59,939 --> 02:18:01,610
beamed back that could be doesn't even
have to be more than 100 pixels by 100

7656
02:18:01,610 --> 02:18:01,620
have to be more than 100 pixels by 100
 

7657
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:03,889
have to be more than 100 pixels by 100
pixels that even that would be a

7658
02:18:03,889 --> 02:18:03,899
pixels that even that would be a
 

7659
02:18:03,899 --> 02:18:06,290
pixels that even that would be a
completely game-changing capability to

7660
02:18:06,290 --> 02:18:06,300
completely game-changing capability to
 

7661
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:10,190
completely game-changing capability to
be able to truly image these objects and

7662
02:18:10,190 --> 02:18:10,200
be able to truly image these objects and
 

7663
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:13,330
be able to truly image these objects and
um maybe at home in our own solar system

7664
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:13,340
um maybe at home in our own solar system
 

7665
02:18:13,340 --> 02:18:16,070
um maybe at home in our own solar system
we can certainly get to a point where we

7666
02:18:16,070 --> 02:18:16,080
we can certainly get to a point where we
 

7667
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:19,070
we can certainly get to a point where we
produce crude maps of exoplanets

7668
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:19,080
produce crude maps of exoplanets
 

7669
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:21,049
produce crude maps of exoplanets
um one of the kind of the ultimate limit

7670
02:18:21,049 --> 02:18:21,059
um one of the kind of the ultimate limit
 

7671
02:18:21,059 --> 02:18:23,870
um one of the kind of the ultimate limit
of what a telescope could do is governed

7672
02:18:23,870 --> 02:18:23,880
of what a telescope could do is governed
 

7673
02:18:23,880 --> 02:18:26,570
of what a telescope could do is governed
by its size and so the largest telescope

7674
02:18:26,570 --> 02:18:26,580
by its size and so the largest telescope
 

7675
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:27,830
by its size and so the largest telescope
you could probably ever build would be

7676
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:27,840
you could probably ever build would be
 

7677
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,629
you could probably ever build would be
one that was the size of the sun

7678
02:18:29,629 --> 02:18:29,639
one that was the size of the sun
 

7679
02:18:29,639 --> 02:18:31,610
one that was the size of the sun
there's a clever trick for doing this

7680
02:18:31,610 --> 02:18:31,620
there's a clever trick for doing this
 

7681
02:18:31,620 --> 02:18:33,290
there's a clever trick for doing this
without physically building a telescope

7682
02:18:33,290 --> 02:18:33,300
without physically building a telescope
 

7683
02:18:33,300 --> 02:18:35,030
without physically building a telescope
that's the size of the sun and that's to

7684
02:18:35,030 --> 02:18:35,040
that's the size of the sun and that's to
 

7685
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:37,549
that's the size of the sun and that's to
use the Sun as a gravitational lens this

7686
02:18:37,549 --> 02:18:37,559
use the Sun as a gravitational lens this
 

7687
02:18:37,559 --> 02:18:40,549
use the Sun as a gravitational lens this
was proposed I think by vaneshleman in

7688
02:18:40,549 --> 02:18:40,559
was proposed I think by vaneshleman in
 

7689
02:18:40,559 --> 02:18:43,250
was proposed I think by vaneshleman in
like 1979 but it builds upon Einstein's

7690
02:18:43,250 --> 02:18:43,260
like 1979 but it builds upon Einstein's
 

7691
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:44,690
like 1979 but it builds upon Einstein's
theory of General activity of course

7692
02:18:44,690 --> 02:18:44,700
theory of General activity of course
 

7693
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:47,570
theory of General activity of course
that there is a warping of light a

7694
02:18:47,570 --> 02:18:47,580
that there is a warping of light a
 

7695
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:49,009
that there is a warping of light a
bending of light from the sun's

7696
02:18:49,009 --> 02:18:49,019
bending of light from the sun's
 

7697
02:18:49,019 --> 02:18:51,290
bending of light from the sun's
gravitational field and so a distant

02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:51,300
gravitational field and so a distant

Starlight is like a magnifying glass

7700
02:18:52,669 --> 02:18:52,679
Starlight is like a magnifying glass
 

7701
02:18:52,679 --> 02:18:55,009
Starlight is like a magnifying glass
anything that bends light is is

7702
02:18:55,009 --> 02:18:55,019
anything that bends light is is
 

7703
02:18:55,019 --> 02:18:56,990
anything that bends light is is
basically can be used as a telescope

7704
02:18:56,990 --> 02:18:57,000
basically can be used as a telescope
 

7705
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,509
basically can be used as a telescope
it's going to bend light to a point now

7706
02:18:59,509 --> 02:18:59,519
it's going to bend light to a point now
 

7707
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:01,250
it's going to bend light to a point now
it turns out the Sun's gravity is not

7708
02:19:01,250 --> 02:19:01,260
it turns out the Sun's gravity is not
 

7709
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:03,650
it turns out the Sun's gravity is not
strong enough to create a you know a

7710
02:19:03,650 --> 02:19:03,660
strong enough to create a you know a
 

7711
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:04,790
strong enough to create a you know a
particularly great telescope here

7712
02:19:04,790 --> 02:19:04,800
particularly great telescope here
 

7713
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:07,549
particularly great telescope here
because the focus point is really out in

7714
02:19:07,549 --> 02:19:07,559
because the focus point is really out in
 

7715
02:19:07,559 --> 02:19:10,610
because the focus point is really out in
the Kuiper belt it's at 550 astronomical

7716
02:19:10,610 --> 02:19:10,620
the Kuiper belt it's at 550 astronomical
 

7717
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:13,610
the Kuiper belt it's at 550 astronomical
units away from the earth so 550 times

7718
02:19:13,610 --> 02:19:13,620
units away from the earth so 550 times
 

7719
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:15,049
units away from the earth so 550 times
further away from the Sun than we are

7720
02:19:15,049 --> 02:19:15,059
further away from the Sun than we are
 

7721
02:19:15,059 --> 02:19:16,730
further away from the Sun than we are
and we've you know that's beyond any of

7722
02:19:16,730 --> 02:19:16,740
and we've you know that's beyond any of
 

7723
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:18,650
and we've you know that's beyond any of
our spacecraft we've ever gone so you

7724
02:19:18,650 --> 02:19:18,660
our spacecraft we've ever gone so you
 

7725
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:20,270
our spacecraft we've ever gone so you
have to send a spacecraft to that

7726
02:19:20,270 --> 02:19:20,280
have to send a spacecraft to that
 

7727
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:21,950
have to send a spacecraft to that
distance which would take

7728
02:19:21,950 --> 02:19:21,960
distance which would take
 

7729
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:24,889
distance which would take
30 40 years even optimistically

7730
02:19:24,889 --> 02:19:24,899
30 40 years even optimistically
 

7731
02:19:24,899 --> 02:19:26,450
30 40 years even optimistically
improving our chemical propulsion system

7732
02:19:26,450 --> 02:19:26,460
improving our chemical propulsion system
 

7733
02:19:26,460 --> 02:19:28,790
improving our chemical propulsion system
significantly you'd have to bound it

7734
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:28,800
significantly you'd have to bound it
 

7735
02:19:28,800 --> 02:19:31,669
significantly you'd have to bound it
into that orbit but then you could use

7736
02:19:31,669 --> 02:19:31,679
into that orbit but then you could use
 

7737
02:19:31,679 --> 02:19:33,889
into that orbit but then you could use
the entire Sun as your telescope and

7738
02:19:33,889 --> 02:19:33,899
the entire Sun as your telescope and
 

7739
02:19:33,899 --> 02:19:35,929
the entire Sun as your telescope and
with that kind of capability you could

7740
02:19:35,929 --> 02:19:35,939
with that kind of capability you could
 

7741
02:19:35,939 --> 02:19:39,230
with that kind of capability you could
image planets to kilometer scale or

7742
02:19:39,230 --> 02:19:39,240
image planets to kilometer scale or
 

7743
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:41,750
image planets to kilometer scale or
resolution from afar and that that

7744
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:41,760
resolution from afar and that that
 

7745
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:44,870
resolution from afar and that that
really makes you wonder I mean if we can

7746
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:44,880
really makes you wonder I mean if we can
 

7747
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:47,150
really makes you wonder I mean if we can
conceive maybe we can't engineer it but

7748
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:47,160
conceive maybe we can't engineer it but
 

7749
02:19:47,160 --> 02:19:49,550
conceive maybe we can't engineer it but
if we can conceive of such a device

7750
02:19:49,550 --> 02:19:49,560
if we can conceive of such a device
 

7751
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:52,130
if we can conceive of such a device
what might other civilizations be

7752
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:52,140
what might other civilizations be
 

7753
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:55,429
what might other civilizations be
currently observing about our own planet

7754
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:55,439
currently observing about our own planet
 

7755
02:19:55,439 --> 02:19:57,050
currently observing about our own planet
um and

7756
02:19:57,050 --> 02:19:57,060
um and
 

7757
02:19:57,060 --> 02:20:00,349
um and
perhaps that is uh why nobody is is

7758
02:20:00,349 --> 02:20:00,359
perhaps that is uh why nobody is is
 

7759
02:20:00,359 --> 02:20:02,750
perhaps that is uh why nobody is is
visiting us because there is so much you

7760
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:02,760
visiting us because there is so much you
 

7761
02:20:02,760 --> 02:20:05,570
visiting us because there is so much you
can do from afar that to them that's

7762
02:20:05,570 --> 02:20:05,580
can do from afar that to them that's
 

7763
02:20:05,580 --> 02:20:07,310
can do from afar that to them that's
enough they you know maybe they can get

7764
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:07,320
enough they you know maybe they can get
 

7765
02:20:07,320 --> 02:20:08,510
enough they you know maybe they can get
to the point where they can set our

7766
02:20:08,510 --> 02:20:08,520
to the point where they can set our
 

7767
02:20:08,520 --> 02:20:09,889
to the point where they can set our
radio leakage

7768
02:20:09,889 --> 02:20:09,899
radio leakage
 

7769
02:20:09,899 --> 02:20:11,870
radio leakage
um they can drift out to restaurant in

7770
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:11,880
um they can drift out to restaurant in
 

7771
02:20:11,880 --> 02:20:14,090
um they can drift out to restaurant in
you know television signals

7772
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:14,100
you know television signals
 

7773
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:16,490
you know television signals
um they can map out our surfaces they

7774
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:16,500
um they can map out our surfaces they
 

7775
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,349
um they can map out our surfaces they
can tell we have cities they can even do

7776
02:20:18,349 --> 02:20:18,359
can tell we have cities they can even do
 

7777
02:20:18,359 --> 02:20:19,790
can tell we have cities they can even do
infrared mapping of the heat island

7778
02:20:19,790 --> 02:20:19,800
infrared mapping of the heat island
 

7779
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:21,170
infrared mapping of the heat island
effects and all this kind of stuff they

7780
02:20:21,170 --> 02:20:21,180
effects and all this kind of stuff they
 

7781
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:22,969
effects and all this kind of stuff they
can tell the chemical composition of our

7782
02:20:22,969 --> 02:20:22,979
can tell the chemical composition of our
 

7783
02:20:22,979 --> 02:20:25,130
can tell the chemical composition of our
planet and so that might be enough maybe

7784
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:25,140
planet and so that might be enough maybe
 

7785
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:26,690
planet and so that might be enough maybe
they don't need to come down to the

7786
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:26,700
they don't need to come down to the
 

7787
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:29,090
they don't need to come down to the
surface and study atopla you know do

7788
02:20:29,090 --> 02:20:29,100
surface and study atopla you know do
 

7789
02:20:29,100 --> 02:20:30,349
surface and study atopla you know do
anthropology and see what our

7790
02:20:30,349 --> 02:20:30,359
anthropology and see what our
 

7791
02:20:30,359 --> 02:20:32,150
anthropology and see what our
civilization is like

7792
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:32,160
civilization is like
 

7793
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,490
civilization is like
um but there's certainly a huge amount

7794
02:20:34,490 --> 02:20:34,500
um but there's certainly a huge amount
 

7795
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:36,050
um but there's certainly a huge amount
you can do which is significantly

7796
02:20:36,050 --> 02:20:36,060
you can do which is significantly
 

7797
02:20:36,060 --> 02:20:37,790
you can do which is significantly
cheaper to some degree than flying there

7798
02:20:37,790 --> 02:20:37,800
cheaper to some degree than flying there
 

7799
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:40,849
cheaper to some degree than flying there
just by exploiting cleverly the physics

7800
02:20:40,849 --> 02:20:40,859
just by exploiting cleverly the physics
 

7801
02:20:40,859 --> 02:20:42,770
just by exploiting cleverly the physics
of the universe itself

7802
02:20:42,770 --> 02:20:42,780
of the universe itself
 

7803
02:20:42,780 --> 02:20:45,590
of the universe itself
so your intuition is this very well may

7804
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:45,600
so your intuition is this very well may
 

7805
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,010
so your intuition is this very well may
be true the observation might be way

7806
02:20:49,010 --> 02:20:49,020
be true the observation might be way
 

7807
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:50,630
be true the observation might be way
easier than travel

7808
02:20:50,630 --> 02:20:50,640
easier than travel
 

7809
02:20:50,640 --> 02:20:52,550
easier than travel
from uh from our perspective from an

7810
02:20:52,550 --> 02:20:52,560
from uh from our perspective from an
 

7811
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:54,590
from uh from our perspective from an
alien perspective like we could get very

7812
02:20:54,590 --> 02:20:54,600
alien perspective like we could get very
 

7813
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:56,750
alien perspective like we could get very
high resolution

7814
02:20:56,750 --> 02:20:56,760
high resolution

02:20:59,690 --> 02:20:59,700
Imaging before we can ever get there it
 

7817
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:01,370
Imaging before we can ever get there it
depends on what what information you

7818
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:01,380
depends on what what information you
 

7819
02:21:01,380 --> 02:21:04,190
depends on what what information you
want if you want um to know the chemical

7820
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:04,200
want if you want um to know the chemical
 

7821
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,690
want if you want um to know the chemical
composition

7822
02:21:05,690 --> 02:21:05,700
composition
 

7823
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:07,309
composition
um and and you want to know kilometer

7824
02:21:07,309 --> 02:21:07,319
um and and you want to know kilometer
 

7825
02:21:07,319 --> 02:21:09,230
um and and you want to know kilometer
scale maps of the planet then you could

7826
02:21:09,230 --> 02:21:09,240
scale maps of the planet then you could
 

7827
02:21:09,240 --> 02:21:12,290
scale maps of the planet then you could
do that from afar with some uh version

7828
02:21:12,290 --> 02:21:12,300
do that from afar with some uh version
 

7829
02:21:12,300 --> 02:21:14,630
do that from afar with some uh version
of these kind of gravitational lenses if

7830
02:21:14,630 --> 02:21:14,640
of these kind of gravitational lenses if
 

7831
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:16,250
of these kind of gravitational lenses if
you want to do better than that if you

7832
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:16,260
you want to do better than that if you
 

7833
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:19,010
you want to do better than that if you
want to image a newspaper sat on the

7834
02:21:19,010 --> 02:21:19,020
want to image a newspaper sat on the
 

7835
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:20,750
want to image a newspaper sat on the
porch of somebody's house you're gonna

7836
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:20,760
porch of somebody's house you're gonna
 

7837
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:23,090
porch of somebody's house you're gonna
have to fly there there's no way unless

7838
02:21:23,090 --> 02:21:23,100
have to fly there there's no way unless
 

7839
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:25,190
have to fly there there's no way unless
you had you know a task at the size of

7840
02:21:25,190 --> 02:21:25,200
you had you know a task at the size of
 

7841
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:26,750
you had you know a task at the size of
such serious a star or something you

7842
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:26,760
such serious a star or something you
 

7843
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:29,210
such serious a star or something you
just simply cannot collect enough light

7844
02:21:29,210 --> 02:21:29,220
just simply cannot collect enough light
 

7845
02:21:29,220 --> 02:21:32,210
just simply cannot collect enough light
to do that from many light years away

7846
02:21:32,210 --> 02:21:32,220
to do that from many light years away
 

7847
02:21:32,220 --> 02:21:35,469
to do that from many light years away
um so there is certainly uh

7848
02:21:35,469 --> 02:21:35,479
um so there is certainly uh
 

7849
02:21:35,479 --> 02:21:38,929
um so there is certainly uh
reasons why visiting will always have

7850
02:21:38,929 --> 02:21:38,939
reasons why visiting will always have
 

7851
02:21:38,939 --> 02:21:40,190
reasons why visiting will always have
its place depending what kind of

7852
02:21:40,190 --> 02:21:40,200
its place depending what kind of
 

7853
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:42,110
its place depending what kind of
information you want

7854
02:21:42,110 --> 02:21:42,120
information you want
 

7855
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:43,730
information you want
um we've proposed in my team actually

7856
02:21:43,730 --> 02:21:43,740
um we've proposed in my team actually
 

7857
02:21:43,740 --> 02:21:47,450
um we've proposed in my team actually
that the sun is is a is the ultimate

7858
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:47,460
that the sun is is a is the ultimate
 

7859
02:21:47,460 --> 02:21:50,270
that the sun is is a is the ultimate
Pinnacle of telescope design but flying

7860
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:50,280
Pinnacle of telescope design but flying
 

7861
02:21:50,280 --> 02:21:52,130
Pinnacle of telescope design but flying
to a thousand Au is a real pain in the

7862
02:21:52,130 --> 02:21:52,140
to a thousand Au is a real pain in the
 

7863
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:53,510
to a thousand Au is a real pain in the
butt because it's just going to take so

7864
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:53,520
butt because it's just going to take so
 

7865
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:56,929
butt because it's just going to take so
long and so a more practical way of

7866
02:21:56,929 --> 02:21:56,939
long and so a more practical way of
 

7867
02:21:56,939 --> 02:21:59,030
long and so a more practical way of
achieving this maybe to use the Earth

7868
02:21:59,030 --> 02:21:59,040
achieving this maybe to use the Earth
 

7869
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:01,190
achieving this maybe to use the Earth
now the Earth doesn't have anywhere near

7870
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:01,200
now the Earth doesn't have anywhere near
 

7871
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:03,469
now the Earth doesn't have anywhere near
enough gravity to create a substantial

7872
02:22:03,469 --> 02:22:03,479
enough gravity to create a substantial
 

7873
02:22:03,479 --> 02:22:06,170
enough gravity to create a substantial
gravitational lens but it has an

7874
02:22:06,170 --> 02:22:06,180
gravitational lens but it has an
 

7875
02:22:06,180 --> 02:22:09,170
gravitational lens but it has an
atmosphere and an atmosphere refracts

7876
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:09,180
atmosphere and an atmosphere refracts
 

7877
02:22:09,180 --> 02:22:12,110
atmosphere and an atmosphere refracts
light it bends light so whenever you see

7878
02:22:12,110 --> 02:22:12,120
light it bends light so whenever you see
 

7879
02:22:12,120 --> 02:22:14,870
light it bends light so whenever you see
a sunset just as the sun standing below

7880
02:22:14,870 --> 02:22:14,880
a sunset just as the sun standing below
 

7881
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,870
a sunset just as the sun standing below
the Horizon it's actually already

7882
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:16,880
the Horizon it's actually already
 

7883
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:19,550
the Horizon it's actually already
Beneath The Horizon it's just the light

7884
02:22:19,550 --> 02:22:19,560
Beneath The Horizon it's just the light
 

7885
02:22:19,560 --> 02:22:22,250
Beneath The Horizon it's just the light
is bending through the atmosphere it's

7886
02:22:22,250 --> 02:22:22,260
is bending through the atmosphere it's
 

7887
02:22:22,260 --> 02:22:23,510
is bending through the atmosphere it's
actually already about half a degree

7888
02:22:23,510 --> 02:22:23,520
actually already about half a degree
 

7889
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:25,910
actually already about half a degree
down beneath and what you're seeing is

7890
02:22:25,910 --> 02:22:25,920
down beneath and what you're seeing is
 

7891
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:28,190
down beneath and what you're seeing is
is that is that curvature of the light

7892
02:22:28,190 --> 02:22:28,200
is that is that curvature of the light
 

7893
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:30,590
is that is that curvature of the light
path and your brain interprets it of

7894
02:22:30,590 --> 02:22:30,600
path and your brain interprets it of
 

7895
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,730
path and your brain interprets it of
course to be following a straight line

7896
02:22:31,730 --> 02:22:31,740
course to be following a straight line
 

7897
02:22:31,740 --> 02:22:34,130
course to be following a straight line
because your brain always thinks that

7898
02:22:34,130 --> 02:22:34,140
because your brain always thinks that
 

7899
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:36,050
because your brain always thinks that
um and so you can use that bending

7900
02:22:36,050 --> 02:22:36,060
um and so you can use that bending
 

7901
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:37,490
um and so you can use that bending
whenever you have bending you have a

7902
02:22:37,490 --> 02:22:37,500
whenever you have bending you have a
 

7903
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:39,230
whenever you have bending you have a
telescope and so we've proposed to my

7904
02:22:39,230 --> 02:22:39,240
telescope and so we've proposed to my
 

7905
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:41,050
telescope and so we've proposed to my
team that you could use this refraction

7906
02:22:41,050 --> 02:22:41,060
team that you could use this refraction
 

7907
02:22:41,060 --> 02:22:44,150
team that you could use this refraction
to similarly create an earth-sized

7908
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,160
to similarly create an earth-sized
 

7909
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:46,610
to similarly create an earth-sized
telescope called the terrascope the

7910
02:22:46,610 --> 02:22:46,620
telescope called the terrascope the
 

7911
02:22:46,620 --> 02:22:49,730
telescope called the terrascope the
tyroscope yeah great video Yeah and uh

7912
02:22:49,730 --> 02:22:49,740
tyroscope yeah great video Yeah and uh
 

7913
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:51,050
tyroscope yeah great video Yeah and uh
there's the other paper on the telescope

7914
02:22:51,050 --> 02:22:51,060
there's the other paper on the telescope
 

7915
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:53,210
there's the other paper on the telescope
I do yeah great um sometimes get

7916
02:22:53,210 --> 02:22:53,220
I do yeah great um sometimes get
 

7917
02:22:53,220 --> 02:22:54,290
I do yeah great um sometimes get
confused this because they've heard of

7918
02:22:54,290 --> 02:22:54,300
confused this because they've heard of
 

7919
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:55,910
confused this because they've heard of
an earth-sized telescope because if they

7920
02:22:55,910 --> 02:22:55,920
an earth-sized telescope because if they
 

7921
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:57,170
an earth-sized telescope because if they
may have heard of The Event Horizon

7922
02:22:57,170 --> 02:22:57,180
may have heard of The Event Horizon
 

7923
02:22:57,180 --> 02:22:59,809
may have heard of The Event Horizon
telescope which took an image of

7924
02:22:59,809 --> 02:22:59,819
telescope which took an image of
 

7925
02:22:59,819 --> 02:23:01,309
telescope which took an image of
um what's the taken an image right now

7926
02:23:01,309 --> 02:23:01,319
um what's the taken an image right now
 

7927
02:23:01,319 --> 02:23:03,469
um what's the taken an image right now
at the center of our black hole and it's

7928
02:23:03,469 --> 02:23:03,479
at the center of our black hole and it's
 

7929
02:23:03,479 --> 02:23:05,210
at the center of our black hole and it's
very impressive and it previously did

7930
02:23:05,210 --> 02:23:05,220
very impressive and it previously did
 

7931
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:07,969
very impressive and it previously did
Messi 87 a nearby supermassive black

7932
02:23:07,969 --> 02:23:07,979
Messi 87 a nearby supermassive black
 

7933
02:23:07,979 --> 02:23:10,010
Messi 87 a nearby supermassive black
hole and so those images were

7934
02:23:10,010 --> 02:23:10,020
hole and so those images were
 

7935
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:12,050
hole and so those images were
interferometric so they were small

7936
02:23:12,050 --> 02:23:12,060
interferometric so they were small
 

7937
02:23:12,060 --> 02:23:13,610
interferometric so they were small
telescopes scattered across the Earth

7938
02:23:13,610 --> 02:23:13,620
telescopes scattered across the Earth
 

7939
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:16,309
telescopes scattered across the Earth
and they combined the light paths

7940
02:23:16,309 --> 02:23:16,319
and they combined the light paths
 

7941
02:23:16,319 --> 02:23:18,650
and they combined the light paths
together interferometrically to create

7942
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:18,660
together interferometrically to create
 

7943
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:21,110
together interferometrically to create
effectively an earth-sized

7944
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:21,120
effectively an earth-sized
 

7945
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,809
effectively an earth-sized
um angular resolution telescopes always

7946
02:23:23,809 --> 02:23:23,819
um angular resolution telescopes always
 

7947
02:23:23,819 --> 02:23:25,610
um angular resolution telescopes always
have two properties there's the angular

7948
02:23:25,610 --> 02:23:25,620
have two properties there's the angular
 

7949
02:23:25,620 --> 02:23:27,530
have two properties there's the angular
resolution which is how small of a thing

7950
02:23:27,530 --> 02:23:27,540
resolution which is how small of a thing
 

7951
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:29,450
resolution which is how small of a thing
you can see on the surface and then

7952
02:23:29,450 --> 02:23:29,460
you can see on the surface and then
 

7953
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:31,490
you can see on the surface and then
there's the magnification how much

7954
02:23:31,490 --> 02:23:31,500
there's the magnification how much
 

7955
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:33,110
there's the magnification how much
brighter does that object get versus

7956
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:33,120
brighter does that object get versus
 

7957
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:36,170
brighter does that object get versus
just your eye or some small object now

7958
02:23:36,170 --> 02:23:36,180
just your eye or some small object now
 

7959
02:23:36,180 --> 02:23:38,809
just your eye or some small object now
what what the Event Horizon telescope

7960
02:23:38,809 --> 02:23:38,819
what what the Event Horizon telescope
 

7961
02:23:38,819 --> 02:23:41,510
what what the Event Horizon telescope
did it traded off

7962
02:23:41,510 --> 02:23:41,520
did it traded off
 

7963
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:44,750
did it traded off
um amplification or magnification for

7964
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:44,760
um amplification or magnification for
 

7965
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:46,490
um amplification or magnification for
for the angular resolution that's what

7966
02:23:46,490 --> 02:23:46,500
for the angular resolution that's what
 

7967
02:23:46,500 --> 02:23:48,050
for the angular resolution that's what
it wanted it wanted that high angle

7968
02:23:48,050 --> 02:23:48,060
it wanted it wanted that high angle
 

7969
02:23:48,060 --> 02:23:49,550
it wanted it wanted that high angle
resolution but it doesn't really have

7970
02:23:49,550 --> 02:23:49,560
resolution but it doesn't really have
 

7971
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:51,349
resolution but it doesn't really have
much Photon collecting power because

7972
02:23:51,349 --> 02:23:51,359
much Photon collecting power because
 

7973
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:52,790
much Photon collecting power because
each telescope individually is very

7974
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:52,800
each telescope individually is very
 

7975
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:54,710
each telescope individually is very
small the terrascope is different

7976
02:23:54,710 --> 02:23:54,720
small the terrascope is different
 

7977
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:57,290
small the terrascope is different
because it is literally collecting light

7978
02:23:57,290 --> 02:23:57,300
because it is literally collecting light
 

7979
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:59,929
because it is literally collecting light
with a with a light bucket which is

7980
02:23:59,929 --> 02:23:59,939
with a with a light bucket which is
 

7981
02:23:59,939 --> 02:24:02,150
with a with a light bucket which is
essentially the size of the Earth and so

7982
02:24:02,150 --> 02:24:02,160
essentially the size of the Earth and so
 

7983
02:24:02,160 --> 02:24:04,429
essentially the size of the Earth and so
that gives you both benefits potentially

7984
02:24:04,429 --> 02:24:04,439
that gives you both benefits potentially
 

7985
02:24:04,439 --> 02:24:07,250
that gives you both benefits potentially
not only the high angle resolution that

7986
02:24:07,250 --> 02:24:07,260
not only the high angle resolution that
 

7987
02:24:07,260 --> 02:24:09,170
not only the high angle resolution that
a large aperture promises you but also

7988
02:24:09,170 --> 02:24:09,180
a large aperture promises you but also
 

7989
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:10,610
a large aperture promises you but also
actually physically collects all those

7990
02:24:10,610 --> 02:24:10,620
actually physically collects all those
 

7991
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:12,050
actually physically collects all those
photons so you can detect light from

7992
02:24:12,050 --> 02:24:12,060
photons so you can detect light from
 

7993
02:24:12,060 --> 02:24:14,150
photons so you can detect light from
very very far away through the outer

7994
02:24:14,150 --> 02:24:14,160
very very far away through the outer
 

7995
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:16,190
very very far away through the outer
edges of the Universe

7996
02:24:16,190 --> 02:24:16,200
edges of the Universe
 

7997
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:19,670
edges of the Universe
um and so we yeah we propose this as a

7998
02:24:19,670 --> 02:24:19,680
um and so we yeah we propose this as a
 

7999
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:21,790
um and so we yeah we propose this as a
possible future

8000
02:24:21,790 --> 02:24:21,800
possible future
 

8001
02:24:21,800 --> 02:24:24,650
possible future
technological way of achieving these

8002
02:24:24,650 --> 02:24:24,660
technological way of achieving these
 

8003
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:26,510
technological way of achieving these
these extreme

8004
02:24:26,510 --> 02:24:26,520
these extreme
 

8005
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:28,370
these extreme
goals ambitious goals we have in

8006
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:28,380
goals ambitious goals we have in
 

8007
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:31,010
goals ambitious goals we have in
astronomy but um it's a very difficult

8008
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:31,020
astronomy but um it's a very difficult
 

8009
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:33,590
astronomy but um it's a very difficult
system to test because you essentially

8010
02:24:33,590 --> 02:24:33,600
system to test because you essentially
 

8011
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:35,330
system to test because you essentially
have to fly out to these Focus points

8012
02:24:35,330 --> 02:24:35,340
have to fly out to these Focus points
 

8013
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:37,190
have to fly out to these Focus points
and these Focus points lie beyond the

8014
02:24:37,190 --> 02:24:37,200
and these Focus points lie beyond the
 

8015
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:38,750
and these Focus points lie beyond the
moon so you have to have

8016
02:24:38,750 --> 02:24:38,760
moon so you have to have
 

8017
02:24:38,760 --> 02:24:41,570
moon so you have to have
someone who is willing to fly beyond the

8018
02:24:41,570 --> 02:24:41,580
someone who is willing to fly beyond the
 

8019
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:44,030
someone who is willing to fly beyond the
moon and hitchhike an experimental

8020
02:24:44,030 --> 02:24:44,040
moon and hitchhike an experimental
 

8021
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:47,090
moon and hitchhike an experimental
telescope onto it and do that cheaply if

8022
02:24:47,090 --> 02:24:47,100
telescope onto it and do that cheaply if
 

8023
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:48,710
telescope onto it and do that cheaply if
it was something doing low earth orbit

8024
02:24:48,710 --> 02:24:48,720
it was something doing low earth orbit
 

8025
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:50,150
it was something doing low earth orbit
it'd be easier you could just attach a

8026
02:24:50,150 --> 02:24:50,160
it'd be easier you could just attach a
 

8027
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:52,130
it'd be easier you could just attach a
cubesat to the next Falcon 9 rocket or

8028
02:24:52,130 --> 02:24:52,140
cubesat to the next Falcon 9 rocket or
 

8029
02:24:52,140 --> 02:24:53,990
cubesat to the next Falcon 9 rocket or
something and test it out it probably

8030
02:24:53,990 --> 02:24:54,000
something and test it out it probably
 

8031
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,270
something and test it out it probably
only cost you a few tens of thousands

8032
02:24:56,270 --> 02:24:56,280
only cost you a few tens of thousands
 

8033
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:57,410
only cost you a few tens of thousands
dollars maybe a hundred thousand dollars

8034
02:24:57,410 --> 02:24:57,420
dollars maybe a hundred thousand dollars
 

8035
02:24:57,420 --> 02:24:59,510
dollars maybe a hundred thousand dollars
but there's basically no one who flies

8036
02:24:59,510 --> 02:24:59,520
but there's basically no one who flies
 

8037
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:03,650
but there's basically no one who flies
out that far except for bespoke Missions

8038
02:25:03,650 --> 02:25:03,660
out that far except for bespoke Missions
 

8039
02:25:03,660 --> 02:25:05,929
out that far except for bespoke Missions
such as like a mission that's going to

8040
02:25:05,929 --> 02:25:05,939
such as like a mission that's going to
 

8041
02:25:05,939 --> 02:25:07,790
such as like a mission that's going to
Mars or something that would that would

8042
02:25:07,790 --> 02:25:07,800
Mars or something that would that would
 

8043
02:25:07,800 --> 02:25:10,490
Mars or something that would that would
pass through that kind of space and they

8044
02:25:10,490 --> 02:25:10,500
pass through that kind of space and they
 

8045
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:13,250
pass through that kind of space and they
typically don't have a lot of leeway in

8046
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:13,260
typically don't have a lot of leeway in
 

8047
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:14,990
typically don't have a lot of leeway in
excess payload that they're willing to

8048
02:25:14,990 --> 02:25:15,000
excess payload that they're willing to
 

8049
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,630
excess payload that they're willing to
strap on for radical experiments so

8050
02:25:17,630 --> 02:25:17,640
strap on for radical experiments so
 

8051
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:19,370
strap on for radical experiments so
that's been the problem with it in

8052
02:25:19,370 --> 02:25:19,380
that's been the problem with it in
 

8053
02:25:19,380 --> 02:25:21,050
that's been the problem with it in
theory it should work beautifully but

8054
02:25:21,050 --> 02:25:21,060
theory it should work beautifully but
 

8055
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:23,150
theory it should work beautifully but
it's a very difficult idea to

8056
02:25:23,150 --> 02:25:23,160
it's a very difficult idea to
 

8057
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:25,130
it's a very difficult idea to
experimentally test can you elaborate

8058
02:25:25,130 --> 02:25:25,140
experimentally test can you elaborate
 

8059
02:25:25,140 --> 02:25:27,530
experimentally test can you elaborate
where the focal point is that far away

8060
02:25:27,530 --> 02:25:27,540
where the focal point is that far away
 

8061
02:25:27,540 --> 02:25:30,530
where the focal point is that far away
so you get about half a degree Bend from

8062
02:25:30,530 --> 02:25:30,540
so you get about half a degree Bend from
 

8063
02:25:30,540 --> 02:25:32,330
so you get about half a degree Bend from
the Earth's atmosphere

8064
02:25:32,330 --> 02:25:32,340
the Earth's atmosphere
 

8065
02:25:32,340 --> 02:25:33,469
the Earth's atmosphere
um when you're looking the Sun at the

8066
02:25:33,469 --> 02:25:33,479
um when you're looking the Sun at the
 

8067
02:25:33,479 --> 02:25:35,570
um when you're looking the Sun at the
Horizon and you get that two times over

8068
02:25:35,570 --> 02:25:35,580
Horizon and you get that two times over
 

8069
02:25:35,580 --> 02:25:37,190
Horizon and you get that two times over
if you're outside of the planet's

8070
02:25:37,190 --> 02:25:37,200
if you're outside of the planet's
 

8071
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:38,990
if you're outside of the planet's
atmosphere because it comes you know the

8072
02:25:38,990 --> 02:25:39,000
atmosphere because it comes you know the
 

8073
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,910
atmosphere because it comes you know the
star is half a Bend to use on the

8074
02:25:40,910 --> 02:25:40,920
star is half a Bend to use on the
 

8075
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:42,830
star is half a Bend to use on the
horizon then half a degree back out

8076
02:25:42,830 --> 02:25:42,840
horizon then half a degree back out
 

8077
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:44,210
horizon then half a degree back out
either way so you get about a one degree

8078
02:25:44,210 --> 02:25:44,220
either way so you get about a one degree
 

8079
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:45,889
either way so you get about a one degree
Bend you take the rates of the earth

8080
02:25:45,889 --> 02:25:45,899
Bend you take the rates of the earth
 

8081
02:25:45,899 --> 02:25:47,330
Bend you take the rates of the earth
which is about seven thousand kilometers

8082
02:25:47,330 --> 02:25:47,340
which is about seven thousand kilometers
 

8083
02:25:47,340 --> 02:25:50,389
which is about seven thousand kilometers
and do your arctan function you'll end

8084
02:25:50,389 --> 02:25:50,399
and do your arctan function you'll end
 

8085
02:25:50,399 --> 02:25:52,309
and do your arctan function you'll end
up with a distance that's about two it's

8086
02:25:52,309 --> 02:25:52,319
up with a distance that's about two it's
 

8087
02:25:52,319 --> 02:25:53,750
up with a distance that's about two it's
actually the the inner focal points

8088
02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:53,760
actually the the inner focal points
 

8089
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:55,130
actually the the inner focal points
about two-thirds the distance of the

8090
02:25:55,130 --> 02:25:55,140
about two-thirds the distance of the
 

8091
02:25:55,140 --> 02:25:57,230
about two-thirds the distance of the
Earth Moon system the problem with that

8092
02:25:57,230 --> 02:25:57,240
Earth Moon system the problem with that
 

8093
02:25:57,240 --> 02:25:59,870
Earth Moon system the problem with that
inner focal point is not useful because

8094
02:25:59,870 --> 02:25:59,880
inner focal point is not useful because
 

8095
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:02,150
inner focal point is not useful because
that light Ray path had to basically

8096
02:26:02,150 --> 02:26:02,160
that light Ray path had to basically
 

8097
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,190
that light Ray path had to basically
scrape the surface of the Earth so it

8098
02:26:04,190 --> 02:26:04,200
scrape the surface of the Earth so it
 

8099
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:05,690
scrape the surface of the Earth so it
passes through the clouds it passes

8100
02:26:05,690 --> 02:26:05,700
passes through the clouds it passes
 

8101
02:26:05,700 --> 02:26:07,309
passes through the clouds it passes
through all the thick atmosphere gets a

8102
02:26:07,309 --> 02:26:07,319
through all the thick atmosphere gets a
 

8103
02:26:07,319 --> 02:26:09,590
through all the thick atmosphere gets a
lot of Extinction along the way if you

8104
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:09,600
lot of Extinction along the way if you
 

8105
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:11,990
lot of Extinction along the way if you
go higher up in altitude you get less

8106
02:26:11,990 --> 02:26:12,000
go higher up in altitude you get less
 

8107
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,790
go higher up in altitude you get less
Extinction in fact you can even go above

8108
02:26:13,790 --> 02:26:13,800
Extinction in fact you can even go above
 

8109
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:15,050
Extinction in fact you can even go above
the clouds and so that's even better

8110
02:26:15,050 --> 02:26:15,060
the clouds and so that's even better
 

8111
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:16,550
the clouds and so that's even better
because the clouds obviously going to be

8112
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:16,560
because the clouds obviously going to be
 

8113
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:17,510
because the clouds obviously going to be
a pain in the neck for doing anything

8114
02:26:17,510 --> 02:26:17,520
a pain in the neck for doing anything
 

8115
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:19,730
a pain in the neck for doing anything
Optical but the problem with that is

8116
02:26:19,730 --> 02:26:19,740
Optical but the problem with that is
 

8117
02:26:19,740 --> 02:26:20,870
Optical but the problem with that is
that the atmosphere because it gets

8118
02:26:20,870 --> 02:26:20,880
that the atmosphere because it gets
 

8119
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:23,330
that the atmosphere because it gets
thinner at higher altitude it bends

8120
02:26:23,330 --> 02:26:23,340
thinner at higher altitude it bends
 

8121
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:25,910
thinner at higher altitude it bends
light less and so that pushes the focal

8122
02:26:25,910 --> 02:26:25,920
light less and so that pushes the focal
 

8123
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:28,670
light less and so that pushes the focal
point out so the most useful focal point

8124
02:26:28,670 --> 02:26:28,680
point out so the most useful focal point
 

8125
02:26:28,680 --> 02:26:30,530
point out so the most useful focal point
is actually about three or four times

8126
02:26:30,530 --> 02:26:30,540
is actually about three or four times
 

8127
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:31,670
is actually about three or four times
the distance of the Earth Moon

8128
02:26:31,670 --> 02:26:31,680
the distance of the Earth Moon
 

8129
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:33,710
the distance of the Earth Moon
separation and so that's what we call

8130
02:26:33,710 --> 02:26:33,720
separation and so that's what we call
 

8131
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:35,929
separation and so that's what we call
one little garage points essentially out

8132
02:26:35,929 --> 02:26:35,939
one little garage points essentially out
 

8133
02:26:35,939 --> 02:26:37,610
one little garage points essentially out
there and so there was a stable orbit

8134
02:26:37,610 --> 02:26:37,620
there and so there was a stable orbit
 

8135
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:39,290
there and so there was a stable orbit
it's kind of the outermost stable orbit

8136
02:26:39,290 --> 02:26:39,300
it's kind of the outermost stable orbit
 

8137
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:41,210
it's kind of the outermost stable orbit
you could have around the Earth

8138
02:26:41,210 --> 02:26:41,220
you could have around the Earth
 

8139
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:42,849
you could have around the Earth
um so the atmosphere

8140
02:26:42,849 --> 02:26:42,859
um so the atmosphere
 

8141
02:26:42,859 --> 02:26:46,790
um so the atmosphere
uh does bad things to to the signal yeah

8142
02:26:46,790 --> 02:26:46,800
uh does bad things to to the signal yeah
 

8143
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:49,130
uh does bad things to to the signal yeah
it's it's absorbing light

8144
02:26:49,130 --> 02:26:49,140
it's it's absorbing light
 

8145
02:26:49,140 --> 02:26:51,650
it's it's absorbing light
um is that possible to reconstruct this

8146
02:26:51,650 --> 02:26:51,660
um is that possible to reconstruct this
 

8147
02:26:51,660 --> 02:26:54,530
um is that possible to reconstruct this
the to to remove the noise whatever so

8148
02:26:54,530 --> 02:26:54,540
the to to remove the noise whatever so
 

8149
02:26:54,540 --> 02:26:56,750
the to to remove the noise whatever so
it's just strength it's not nothing else

8150
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:56,760
it's just strength it's not nothing else
 

8151
02:26:56,760 --> 02:26:58,610
it's just strength it's not nothing else
it's possible to reconstruct I mean to

8152
02:26:58,610 --> 02:26:58,620
it's possible to reconstruct I mean to
 

8153
02:26:58,620 --> 02:27:00,110
it's possible to reconstruct I mean to
some degree we do this as a technology

8154
02:27:00,110 --> 02:27:00,120
some degree we do this as a technology
 

8155
02:27:00,120 --> 02:27:02,990
some degree we do this as a technology
called Adaptive Optics that can correct

8156
02:27:02,990 --> 02:27:03,000
called Adaptive Optics that can correct
 

8157
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:04,550
called Adaptive Optics that can correct
for what's called wavefront errors that

8158
02:27:04,550 --> 02:27:04,560
for what's called wavefront errors that
 

8159
02:27:04,560 --> 02:27:05,690
for what's called wavefront errors that
happen through the Earth's atmosphere

8160
02:27:05,690 --> 02:27:05,700
happen through the Earth's atmosphere
 

8161
02:27:05,700 --> 02:27:07,969
happen through the Earth's atmosphere
the Earth's atmosphere is turbulent it

8162
02:27:07,969 --> 02:27:07,979
the Earth's atmosphere is turbulent it
 

8163
02:27:07,979 --> 02:27:09,429
the Earth's atmosphere is turbulent it
is not a

8164
02:27:09,429 --> 02:27:09,439
is not a
 

8165
02:27:09,439 --> 02:27:12,530
is not a
single plane of air of the same density

8166
02:27:12,530 --> 02:27:12,540
single plane of air of the same density
 

8167
02:27:12,540 --> 02:27:14,389
single plane of air of the same density
there's all kind of Wiggles and currents

8168
02:27:14,389 --> 02:27:14,399
there's all kind of Wiggles and currents
 

8169
02:27:14,399 --> 02:27:18,230
there's all kind of Wiggles and currents
in the air and so that each little layer

8170
02:27:18,230 --> 02:27:18,240
in the air and so that each little layer
 

8171
02:27:18,240 --> 02:27:20,570
in the air and so that each little layer
is uh bending light in in slightly

8172
02:27:20,570 --> 02:27:20,580
is uh bending light in in slightly
 

8173
02:27:20,580 --> 02:27:21,830
is uh bending light in in slightly
different ways and so the light actually

8174
02:27:21,830 --> 02:27:21,840
different ways and so the light actually
 

8175
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:23,570
different ways and so the light actually
kind of follows a wiggly path on its way

8176
02:27:23,570 --> 02:27:23,580
kind of follows a wiggly path on its way
 

8177
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:26,210
kind of follows a wiggly path on its way
down what that means is that

8178
02:27:26,210 --> 02:27:26,220
down what that means is that
 

8179
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:27,770
down what that means is that
um two light rays which are traveling at

8180
02:27:27,770 --> 02:27:27,780
um two light rays which are traveling at
 

8181
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:29,750
um two light rays which are traveling at
slightly different spatial separations

8182
02:27:29,750 --> 02:27:29,760
slightly different spatial separations
 

8183
02:27:29,760 --> 02:27:31,849
slightly different spatial separations
from each other will arrive at the

8184
02:27:31,849 --> 02:27:31,859
from each other will arrive at the
 

8185
02:27:31,859 --> 02:27:33,950
from each other will arrive at the
detector at different times because one

8186
02:27:33,950 --> 02:27:33,960
detector at different times because one
 

8187
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:35,150
detector at different times because one
maybe goes on more or less a straight

8188
02:27:35,150 --> 02:27:35,160
maybe goes on more or less a straight
 

8189
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:36,950
maybe goes on more or less a straight
path and the one Wiggles down a bit more

8190
02:27:36,950 --> 02:27:36,960
path and the one Wiggles down a bit more
 

8191
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:38,270
path and the one Wiggles down a bit more
before it arrives and so you have an

8192
02:27:38,270 --> 02:27:38,280
before it arrives and so you have an
 

8193
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:40,070
before it arrives and so you have an
incoherent

8194
02:27:40,070 --> 02:27:40,080
incoherent
 

8195
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:41,809
incoherent
um light source

8196
02:27:41,809 --> 02:27:41,819
um light source
 

8197
02:27:41,819 --> 02:27:42,830
um light source
um and when you're trying to image

8198
02:27:42,830 --> 02:27:42,840
um and when you're trying to image
 

8199
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:43,849
um and when you're trying to image
reconstruction you always want a

8200
02:27:43,849 --> 02:27:43,859
reconstruction you always want a
 

8201
02:27:43,859 --> 02:27:45,650
reconstruction you always want a
coherent light source so the way they

8202
02:27:45,650 --> 02:27:45,660
coherent light source so the way they
 

8203
02:27:45,660 --> 02:27:47,750
coherent light source so the way they
correct for this is that this if this

8204
02:27:47,750 --> 02:27:47,760
correct for this is that this if this
 

8205
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:49,370
correct for this is that this if this
path had to travel a little bit faster

8206
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:49,380
path had to travel a little bit faster
 

8207
02:27:49,380 --> 02:27:51,710
path had to travel a little bit faster
uh the straight one goes faster and the

8208
02:27:51,710 --> 02:27:51,720
uh the straight one goes faster and the
 

8209
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:53,809
uh the straight one goes faster and the
wiggly one takes longer the mirror is

8210
02:27:53,809 --> 02:27:53,819
wiggly one takes longer the mirror is
 

8211
02:27:53,819 --> 02:27:55,670
wiggly one takes longer the mirror is
deformable and so you actually bend the

8212
02:27:55,670 --> 02:27:55,680
deformable and so you actually bend the
 

8213
02:27:55,680 --> 02:27:57,650
deformable and so you actually bend the
mirror on this on the on the straight

8214
02:27:57,650 --> 02:27:57,660
mirror on this on the on the straight
 

8215
02:27:57,660 --> 02:27:59,330
mirror on this on the on the straight
one down a little bit to make it an

8216
02:27:59,330 --> 02:27:59,340
one down a little bit to make it an
 

8217
02:27:59,340 --> 02:28:01,610
one down a little bit to make it an
equivalent light path distance so the

8218
02:28:01,610 --> 02:28:01,620
equivalent light path distance so the
 

8219
02:28:01,620 --> 02:28:03,349
equivalent light path distance so the
mirror itself has all these little

8220
02:28:03,349 --> 02:28:03,359
mirror itself has all these little
 

8221
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:05,570
mirror itself has all these little
actuators and it's actually made up of

8222
02:28:05,570 --> 02:28:05,580
actuators and it's actually made up of
 

8223
02:28:05,580 --> 02:28:06,889
actuators and it's actually made up of
like thousands of little elements almost

8224
02:28:06,889 --> 02:28:06,899
like thousands of little elements almost
 

8225
02:28:06,899 --> 02:28:08,750
like thousands of little elements almost
looks like a liquid mirror because they

8226
02:28:08,750 --> 02:28:08,760
looks like a liquid mirror because they
 

8227
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:10,969
looks like a liquid mirror because they
can manipulate it in kind of real time

8228
02:28:10,969 --> 02:28:10,979
can manipulate it in kind of real time
 

8229
02:28:10,979 --> 02:28:13,130
can manipulate it in kind of real time
and so they scan the atmosphere with a

8230
02:28:13,130 --> 02:28:13,140
and so they scan the atmosphere with a
 

8231
02:28:13,140 --> 02:28:14,929
and so they scan the atmosphere with a
laser beam to tell what the deformations

8232
02:28:14,929 --> 02:28:14,939
laser beam to tell what the deformations
 

8233
02:28:14,939 --> 02:28:17,030
laser beam to tell what the deformations
are in the atmosphere and then make the

8234
02:28:17,030 --> 02:28:17,040
are in the atmosphere and then make the
 

8235
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:18,950
are in the atmosphere and then make the
corrections to the mirror to account for

8236
02:28:18,950 --> 02:28:18,960
corrections to the mirror to account for
 

8237
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:21,290
corrections to the mirror to account for
it that's amazing so you could you could

8238
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:21,300
it that's amazing so you could you could
 

8239
02:28:21,300 --> 02:28:23,090
it that's amazing so you could you could
do something like this for the terrorist

8240
02:28:23,090 --> 02:28:23,100
do something like this for the terrorist
 

8241
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:25,010
do something like this for the terrorist
group but it would be

8242
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:25,020
group but it would be
 

8243
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:26,929
group but it would be
um it's cheaper and easier to go above

8244
02:28:26,929 --> 02:28:26,939
um it's cheaper and easier to go above
 

8245
02:28:26,939 --> 02:28:29,150
um it's cheaper and easier to go above
the atmosphere and just fly out I think

8246
02:28:29,150 --> 02:28:29,160
the atmosphere and just fly out I think
 

8247
02:28:29,160 --> 02:28:31,130
the atmosphere and just fly out I think
so it would be very it's a very that's a

8248
02:28:31,130 --> 02:28:31,140
so it would be very it's a very that's a
 

8249
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:32,450
so it would be very it's a very that's a
very challenging thing to do and

8250
02:28:32,450 --> 02:28:32,460
very challenging thing to do and
 

8251
02:28:32,460 --> 02:28:34,070
very challenging thing to do and
normally when you do Adaptive Optics as

8252
02:28:34,070 --> 02:28:34,080
normally when you do Adaptive Optics as
 

8253
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:35,690
normally when you do Adaptive Optics as
it's called you're looking straight up

8254
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:35,700
it's called you're looking straight up
 

8255
02:28:35,700 --> 02:28:37,670
it's called you're looking straight up
so you're you know or very close to

8256
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:37,680
so you're you know or very close to
 

8257
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:39,410
so you're you know or very close to
straight up if you look at the Horizon

8258
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:39,420
straight up if you look at the Horizon
 

8259
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:40,849
straight up if you look at the Horizon
we basically never do astronomical

8260
02:28:40,849 --> 02:28:40,859
we basically never do astronomical
 

8261
02:28:40,859 --> 02:28:42,410
we basically never do astronomical
observations on the horizon because

8262
02:28:42,410 --> 02:28:42,420
observations on the horizon because
 

8263
02:28:42,420 --> 02:28:43,790
observations on the horizon because
you're looking through more atmosphere

8264
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:43,800
you're looking through more atmosphere
 

8265
02:28:43,800 --> 02:28:45,590
you're looking through more atmosphere
the if you go straight up you're looking

8266
02:28:45,590 --> 02:28:45,600
the if you go straight up you're looking
 

8267
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:46,910
the if you go straight up you're looking
at the thinnest portion of atmosphere

8268
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:46,920
at the thinnest portion of atmosphere
 

8269
02:28:46,920 --> 02:28:48,530
at the thinnest portion of atmosphere
possible but as you go closer and closer

8270
02:28:48,530 --> 02:28:48,540
possible but as you go closer and closer
 

8271
02:28:48,540 --> 02:28:50,210
possible but as you go closer and closer
towards the horizon you're increasing

8272
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:50,220
towards the horizon you're increasing
 

8273
02:28:50,220 --> 02:28:51,710
towards the horizon you're increasing
what we call the air mass the amount of

8274
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:51,720
what we call the air mass the amount of
 

8275
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:54,650
what we call the air mass the amount of
air you have to travel through so here

8276
02:28:54,650 --> 02:28:54,660
air you have to travel through so here
 

8277
02:28:54,660 --> 02:28:55,969
air you have to travel through so here
it's kind of the worst case because

8278
02:28:55,969 --> 02:28:55,979
it's kind of the worst case because
 

8279
02:28:55,979 --> 02:28:56,990
it's kind of the worst case because
you're going through the entire

8280
02:28:56,990 --> 02:28:57,000
you're going through the entire
 

8281
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,870
you're going through the entire
atmosphere in and out again with a

8282
02:28:59,870 --> 02:28:59,880
atmosphere in and out again with a
 

8283
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:02,270
atmosphere in and out again with a
telescope so you'd need a very

8284
02:29:02,270 --> 02:29:02,280
telescope so you'd need a very
 

8285
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:04,130
telescope so you'd need a very
impressive adaptive optic system to

8286
02:29:04,130 --> 02:29:04,140
impressive adaptive optic system to
 

8287
02:29:04,140 --> 02:29:06,110
impressive adaptive optic system to
correct for that so yeah I would say

8288
02:29:06,110 --> 02:29:06,120
correct for that so yeah I would say
 

8289
02:29:06,120 --> 02:29:07,849
correct for that so yeah I would say
it's probably simpler at least for proof

8290
02:29:07,849 --> 02:29:07,859
it's probably simpler at least for proof
 

8291
02:29:07,859 --> 02:29:10,849
it's probably simpler at least for proof
of principle just to test it with um

8292
02:29:10,849 --> 02:29:10,859
of principle just to test it with um
 

8293
02:29:10,859 --> 02:29:13,550
of principle just to test it with um
with with with having some satellite

8294
02:29:13,550 --> 02:29:13,560
with with with having some satellite
 

8295
02:29:13,560 --> 02:29:15,950
with with with having some satellite
that was at a much wider orbit now

8296
02:29:15,950 --> 02:29:15,960
that was at a much wider orbit now
 

8297
02:29:15,960 --> 02:29:17,929
that was at a much wider orbit now
speaking of traveling out into deep

02:29:17,929 --> 02:29:17,939
speaking of traveling out into deep
 

8299
02:29:17,939 --> 02:29:19,730
speaking of traveling out into deep
space you already mentioned this a

8300
02:29:19,730 --> 02:29:19,740
space you already mentioned this a
 

8301
02:29:19,740 --> 02:29:21,710
space you already mentioned this a
little bit uh

8302
02:29:21,710 --> 02:29:21,720
little bit uh
 

8303
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:24,830
little bit uh
you uh made a beautiful video called The

8304
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:24,840
you uh made a beautiful video called The
 

8305
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:26,630
you uh made a beautiful video called The
Journey to the End of the Universe

8306
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:26,640
Journey to the End of the Universe
 

8307
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:28,190
Journey to the End of the Universe
and sort of at the start of that you're

8308
02:29:28,190 --> 02:29:28,200
and sort of at the start of that you're
 

8309
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:30,530
and sort of at the start of that you're
talking about office Centauri

8310
02:29:30,530 --> 02:29:30,540
talking about office Centauri
 

8311
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:33,349
talking about office Centauri
so what would it take for humans

8312
02:29:33,349 --> 02:29:33,359
so what would it take for humans
 

8313
02:29:33,359 --> 02:29:36,110
so what would it take for humans
or for human-like creatures to travel

8314
02:29:36,110 --> 02:29:36,120
or for human-like creatures to travel
 

8315
02:29:36,120 --> 02:29:38,570
or for human-like creatures to travel
out to Alpha Centauri

8316
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:38,580
out to Alpha Centauri
 

8317
02:29:38,580 --> 02:29:40,790
out to Alpha Centauri
there's a few different ways of doing it

8318
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:40,800
there's a few different ways of doing it
 

8319
02:29:40,800 --> 02:29:41,990
there's a few different ways of doing it
I suppose

8320
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,000
I suppose
 

8321
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,849
I suppose
um one is it depends on how fast your

8322
02:29:43,849 --> 02:29:43,859
um one is it depends on how fast your
 

8323
02:29:43,859 --> 02:29:45,050
um one is it depends on how fast your
ship is that's always going to be the

8324
02:29:45,050 --> 02:29:45,060
ship is that's always going to be the
 

8325
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:48,650
ship is that's always going to be the
determining Factor if we devised some

8326
02:29:48,650 --> 02:29:48,660
determining Factor if we devised some
 

8327
02:29:48,660 --> 02:29:50,750
determining Factor if we devised some
inside proportion system that could

8328
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:50,760
inside proportion system that could
 

8329
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:52,070
inside proportion system that could
travel a fraction of the speed of light

8330
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:52,080
travel a fraction of the speed of light
 

8331
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:54,230
travel a fraction of the speed of light
then we could do it in our lifetimes

8332
02:29:54,230 --> 02:29:54,240
then we could do it in our lifetimes
 

8333
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:56,770
then we could do it in our lifetimes
which is I think what people normally

8334
02:29:56,770 --> 02:29:56,780
which is I think what people normally
 

8335
02:29:56,780 --> 02:29:58,670
which is I think what people normally
dream of when they think about

8336
02:29:58,670 --> 02:29:58,680
dream of when they think about
 

8337
02:29:58,680 --> 02:30:00,469
dream of when they think about
Interstellar you know proportion and

8338
02:30:00,469 --> 02:30:00,479
Interstellar you know proportion and
 

8339
02:30:00,479 --> 02:30:03,050
Interstellar you know proportion and
travel that you could literally step

8340
02:30:03,050 --> 02:30:03,060
travel that you could literally step
 

8341
02:30:03,060 --> 02:30:04,610
travel that you could literally step
onto the spacecraft maybe a few years

8342
02:30:04,610 --> 02:30:04,620
onto the spacecraft maybe a few years
 

8343
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:06,530
onto the spacecraft maybe a few years
later you step off and have a century B

8344
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:06,540
later you step off and have a century B
 

8345
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:08,750
later you step off and have a century B
you walk around the surface and come

8346
02:30:08,750 --> 02:30:08,760
you walk around the surface and come
 

8347
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:10,790
you walk around the surface and come
back and visit your family there would

8348
02:30:10,790 --> 02:30:10,800
back and visit your family there would
 

8349
02:30:10,800 --> 02:30:12,349
back and visit your family there would
be of course a lot of relativistic time

8350
02:30:12,349 --> 02:30:12,359
be of course a lot of relativistic time
 

8351
02:30:12,359 --> 02:30:14,870
be of course a lot of relativistic time
dilation as a result of that trip you

8352
02:30:14,870 --> 02:30:14,880
dilation as a result of that trip you
 

8353
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:16,490
dilation as a result of that trip you
would have aged a lot less than people

8354
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:16,500
would have aged a lot less than people
 

8355
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:18,650
would have aged a lot less than people
back on Earth by traveling close to the

8356
02:30:18,650 --> 02:30:18,660
back on Earth by traveling close to the
 

8357
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:21,469
back on Earth by traveling close to the
speed of light for some fraction of time

8358
02:30:21,469 --> 02:30:21,479
speed of light for some fraction of time
 

8359
02:30:21,479 --> 02:30:23,750
speed of light for some fraction of time
um the challenge of this of course is

8360
02:30:23,750 --> 02:30:23,760
um the challenge of this of course is
 

8361
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:25,309
um the challenge of this of course is
that we have no such propulsion system

8362
02:30:25,309 --> 02:30:25,319
that we have no such propulsion system
 

8363
02:30:25,319 --> 02:30:28,370
that we have no such propulsion system
that can achieve this so but you think

8364
02:30:28,370 --> 02:30:28,380
that can achieve this so but you think
 

8365
02:30:28,380 --> 02:30:31,570
that can achieve this so but you think
it's possible like uh so yeah

8366
02:30:31,570 --> 02:30:31,580
it's possible like uh so yeah
 

8367
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:34,010
it's possible like uh so yeah
uh you have a paper called the Halo

8368
02:30:34,010 --> 02:30:34,020
uh you have a paper called the Halo
 

8369
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:36,590
uh you have a paper called the Halo
drive feel free relatively propulsion

8370
02:30:36,590 --> 02:30:36,600
drive feel free relatively propulsion
 

8371
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:38,570
drive feel free relatively propulsion
large masses via recycled Boomerang

8372
02:30:38,570 --> 02:30:38,580
large masses via recycled Boomerang
 

8373
02:30:38,580 --> 02:30:40,250
large masses via recycled Boomerang
photons

8374
02:30:40,250 --> 02:30:40,260
photons
 

8375
02:30:40,260 --> 02:30:42,710
photons
so uh do you think uh first of all what

8376
02:30:42,710 --> 02:30:42,720
so uh do you think uh first of all what
 

8377
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:46,309
so uh do you think uh first of all what
is that and second of all uh how

8378
02:30:46,309 --> 02:30:46,319
is that and second of all uh how
 

8379
02:30:46,319 --> 02:30:48,110
is that and second of all uh how
difficult are alternate propulsion

8380
02:30:48,110 --> 02:30:48,120
difficult are alternate propulsion
 

8381
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:52,730
difficult are alternate propulsion
systems yeah so the before taking the

8382
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:52,740
systems yeah so the before taking the
 

8383
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:55,070
systems yeah so the before taking the
Halo drive there was there was an idea

8384
02:30:55,070 --> 02:30:55,080
Halo drive there was there was an idea
 

8385
02:30:55,080 --> 02:30:56,690
Halo drive there was there was an idea
because I think the Halo drive

8386
02:30:56,690 --> 02:30:56,700
because I think the Halo drive
 

8387
02:30:56,700 --> 02:30:59,030
because I think the Halo drive
is not going to solve this problem uh

8388
02:30:59,030 --> 02:30:59,040
is not going to solve this problem uh
 

8389
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,230
is not going to solve this problem uh
I'll talk about the Halo drive in a

8390
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:00,240
I'll talk about the Halo drive in a
 

8391
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:01,849
I'll talk about the Halo drive in a
moment but the Halo drive is useful for

8392
02:31:01,849 --> 02:31:01,859
moment but the Halo drive is useful for
 

8393
02:31:01,859 --> 02:31:03,170
moment but the Halo drive is useful for
a civilization which is a bit more

8394
02:31:03,170 --> 02:31:03,180
a civilization which is a bit more
 

8395
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:04,250
a civilization which is a bit more
advanced than this that has spread

8396
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:04,260
advanced than this that has spread
 

8397
02:31:04,260 --> 02:31:06,110
advanced than this that has spread
across the stars and it's looking for a

8398
02:31:06,110 --> 02:31:06,120
across the stars and it's looking for a
 

8399
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:08,210
across the stars and it's looking for a
cheap highway system to to get across

8400
02:31:08,210 --> 02:31:08,220
cheap highway system to to get across
 

8401
02:31:08,220 --> 02:31:09,590
cheap highway system to to get across
the Galaxy

8402
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:09,600
the Galaxy
 

8403
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:11,929
the Galaxy
for that first step

8404
02:31:11,929 --> 02:31:11,939
for that first step
 

8405
02:31:11,939 --> 02:31:15,230
for that first step
um because just to context that the the

8406
02:31:15,230 --> 02:31:15,240
um because just to context that the the
 

8407
02:31:15,240 --> 02:31:16,790
um because just to context that the the
Halo drive requires a black hole so

8408
02:31:16,790 --> 02:31:16,800
Halo drive requires a black hole so
 

8409
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:17,929
Halo drive requires a black hole so
that's why you're not going to be able

8410
02:31:17,929 --> 02:31:17,939
that's why you're not going to be able
 

8411
02:31:17,939 --> 02:31:19,969
that's why you're not going to be able
to do this on the Earth right now

8412
02:31:19,969 --> 02:31:19,979
to do this on the Earth right now
 

8413
02:31:19,979 --> 02:31:21,110
to do this on the Earth right now
um but there are lots of black holes in

8414
02:31:21,110 --> 02:31:21,120
um but there are lots of black holes in
 

8415
02:31:21,120 --> 02:31:22,429
um but there are lots of black holes in
the Milky Way if that's the good news so

8416
02:31:22,429 --> 02:31:22,439
the Milky Way if that's the good news so
 

8417
02:31:22,439 --> 02:31:23,809
the Milky Way if that's the good news so
we'll come to that in a moment but if

8418
02:31:23,809 --> 02:31:23,819
we'll come to that in a moment but if
 

8419
02:31:23,819 --> 02:31:24,710
we'll come to that in a moment but if
you're trying to travel to Alpha

8420
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:24,720
you're trying to travel to Alpha
 

8421
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:27,530
you're trying to travel to Alpha
Centauri without a black hole

8422
02:31:27,530 --> 02:31:27,540
Centauri without a black hole
 

8423
02:31:27,540 --> 02:31:29,750
Centauri without a black hole
um then the the most you know there are

8424
02:31:29,750 --> 02:31:29,760
um then the the most you know there are
 

8425
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:31,610
um then the the most you know there are
some ideas out there there was a project

8426
02:31:31,610 --> 02:31:31,620
some ideas out there there was a project
 

8427
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:33,770
some ideas out there there was a project
idalis and project Icarus there were two

8428
02:31:33,770 --> 02:31:33,780
idalis and project Icarus there were two
 

8429
02:31:33,780 --> 02:31:35,230
idalis and project Icarus there were two
projects that the

8430
02:31:35,230 --> 02:31:35,240
projects that the
 

8431
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:37,910
projects that the
British interplanetary Society conjured

8432
02:31:37,910 --> 02:31:37,920
British interplanetary Society conjured
 

8433
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:40,370
British interplanetary Society conjured
up on sort of a 20 30 year time scale

8434
02:31:40,370 --> 02:31:40,380
up on sort of a 20 30 year time scale
 

8435
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:43,010
up on sort of a 20 30 year time scale
and they asked themselves if we took

8436
02:31:43,010 --> 02:31:43,020
and they asked themselves if we took
 

8437
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:46,309
and they asked themselves if we took
existing and speculatively uh but

8438
02:31:46,309 --> 02:31:46,319
existing and speculatively uh but
 

8439
02:31:46,319 --> 02:31:48,170
existing and speculatively uh but
realistic attempts at Future technology

8440
02:31:48,170 --> 02:31:48,180
realistic attempts at Future technology
 

8441
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:49,429
realistic attempts at Future technology
that are emerging over the next few

8442
02:31:49,429 --> 02:31:49,439
that are emerging over the next few
 

8443
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:52,969
that are emerging over the next few
decades how far can we push into that uh

8444
02:31:52,969 --> 02:31:52,979
decades how far can we push into that uh
 

8445
02:31:52,979 --> 02:31:57,110
decades how far can we push into that uh
travel system and they settled on Fusion

8446
02:31:57,110 --> 02:31:57,120
travel system and they settled on Fusion
 

8447
02:31:57,120 --> 02:31:59,090
travel system and they settled on Fusion
drives in in that so if we had the

8448
02:31:59,090 --> 02:31:59,100
drives in in that so if we had the
 

8449
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:01,309
drives in in that so if we had the
ability to essentially uh either

8450
02:32:01,309 --> 02:32:01,319
ability to essentially uh either
 

8451
02:32:01,319 --> 02:32:03,110
ability to essentially uh either
detonate you can also Imagine That kind

8452
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:03,120
detonate you can also Imagine That kind
 

8453
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:04,969
detonate you can also Imagine That kind
of nuclear fission or nuclear fusion

8454
02:32:04,969 --> 02:32:04,979
of nuclear fission or nuclear fusion
 

8455
02:32:04,979 --> 02:32:06,530
of nuclear fission or nuclear fusion
bombs going off behind the spacecraft

8456

and propelling it that way or having

8458
02:32:08,990 --> 02:32:09,000
and propelling it that way or having
 

8459
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,330
and propelling it that way or having
some kind of successful nuclear fusion

8460
02:32:11,330 --> 02:32:11,340
some kind of successful nuclear fusion
 

8461
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:12,889
some kind of successful nuclear fusion
reaction

8462
02:32:12,889 --> 02:32:12,899
reaction
 

8463
02:32:12,899 --> 02:32:14,630
reaction
um which obviously we haven't really

8464
02:32:14,630 --> 02:32:14,640
um which obviously we haven't really
 

8465
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:16,429
um which obviously we haven't really
demonstrated yet as a propulsion system

8466
02:32:16,429 --> 02:32:16,439
demonstrated yet as a propulsion system
 

8467
02:32:16,439 --> 02:32:18,770
demonstrated yet as a propulsion system
then you could achieve something like 10

8468
02:32:18,770 --> 02:32:18,780
then you could achieve something like 10
 

8469
02:32:18,780 --> 02:32:20,750
then you could achieve something like 10
the speed of light in those systems but

8470
02:32:20,750 --> 02:32:20,760
the speed of light in those systems but
 

8471
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:23,330
the speed of light in those systems but
these are huge spacecrafts I think you

8472
02:32:23,330 --> 02:32:23,340
these are huge spacecrafts I think you
 

8473
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:24,770
these are huge spacecrafts I think you
need a huge spacecraft if you're going

8474
02:32:24,770 --> 02:32:24,780
need a huge spacecraft if you're going
 

8475
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:26,330
need a huge spacecraft if you're going
to take people along

8476
02:32:26,330 --> 02:32:26,340
to take people along
 

8477
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:28,010
to take people along
um the conversation recently is actually

8478
02:32:28,010 --> 02:32:28,020
um the conversation recently is actually
 

8479
02:32:28,020 --> 02:32:30,770
um the conversation recently is actually
switched and that's that idea is kind of

8480
02:32:30,770 --> 02:32:30,780
switched and that's that idea is kind of
 

8481
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:32,929
switched and that's that idea is kind of
seems a little bit Antiquated now and

8482
02:32:32,929 --> 02:32:32,939
seems a little bit Antiquated now and
 

8483
02:32:32,939 --> 02:32:34,670
seems a little bit Antiquated now and
most of us have kind of given up in the

8484
02:32:34,670 --> 02:32:34,680
most of us have kind of given up in the
 

8485
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:37,550
most of us have kind of given up in the
idea of people physically biologically

8486
02:32:37,550 --> 02:32:37,560
idea of people physically biologically
 

8487
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:40,429
idea of people physically biologically
stepping on board the spacecraft and

8488
02:32:40,429 --> 02:32:40,439
stepping on board the spacecraft and
 

8489
02:32:40,439 --> 02:32:41,690
stepping on board the spacecraft and
maybe we'll be sending something that's

8490
02:32:41,690 --> 02:32:41,700
maybe we'll be sending something that's
 

8491
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:43,610
maybe we'll be sending something that's
more like a micro probe that maybe just

8492
02:32:43,610 --> 02:32:43,620
more like a micro probe that maybe just
 

8493
02:32:43,620 --> 02:32:46,550
more like a micro probe that maybe just
weighs a gram or two and that's much

8494
02:32:46,550 --> 02:32:46,560
weighs a gram or two and that's much
 

8495
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:47,990
weighs a gram or two and that's much
easier to accelerate you could push that

8496
02:32:47,990 --> 02:32:48,000
easier to accelerate you could push that
 

8497
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,849
easier to accelerate you could push that
with a laser system to very high speed

8498
02:32:49,849 --> 02:32:49,859
with a laser system to very high speed
 

8499
02:32:49,859 --> 02:32:52,670
with a laser system to very high speed
get it to maybe 20 the speed of light it

8500
02:32:52,670 --> 02:32:52,680
get it to maybe 20 the speed of light it
 

8501
02:32:52,680 --> 02:32:54,170
get it to maybe 20 the speed of light it
has to survive the journey probably a

8502
02:32:54,170 --> 02:32:54,180
has to survive the journey probably a
 

8503
02:32:54,180 --> 02:32:55,550
has to survive the journey probably a
large fraction of them won't survive the

8504
02:32:55,550 --> 02:32:55,560
large fraction of them won't survive the
 

8505
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:56,690
large fraction of them won't survive the
journey but they're cheap enough that

8506
02:32:56,690 --> 02:32:56,700
journey but they're cheap enough that
 

8507
02:32:56,700 --> 02:32:58,429
journey but they're cheap enough that
you could maybe manufacture millions of

8508
02:32:58,429 --> 02:32:58,439
you could maybe manufacture millions of
 

8509
02:32:58,439 --> 02:33:00,950
you could maybe manufacture millions of
them and some of them do arrive and able

8510
02:33:00,950 --> 02:33:00,960
them and some of them do arrive and able
 

8511
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:04,730
them and some of them do arrive and able
to send back an image or maybe even if

8512
02:33:04,730 --> 02:33:04,740
to send back an image or maybe even if
 

8513
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:06,710
to send back an image or maybe even if
you wanted to have a person there we

8514
02:33:06,710 --> 02:33:06,720
you wanted to have a person there we
 

8515
02:33:06,720 --> 02:33:08,510
you wanted to have a person there we
might have some way of doing like a

8516
02:33:08,510 --> 02:33:08,520
might have some way of doing like a
 

8517
02:33:08,520 --> 02:33:10,309
might have some way of doing like a
telepresence or some kind of delayed

8518
02:33:10,309 --> 02:33:10,319
telepresence or some kind of delayed
 

8519
02:33:10,319 --> 02:33:12,349
telepresence or some kind of delayed
telepresence or

8520
02:33:12,349 --> 02:33:12,359
telepresence or
 

8521
02:33:12,359 --> 02:33:14,690
telepresence or
um some kind of reconstruction of the

8522
02:33:14,690 --> 02:33:14,700
um some kind of reconstruction of the
 

8523
02:33:14,700 --> 02:33:16,190
um some kind of reconstruction of the
planet which is sent back so you can

8524
02:33:16,190 --> 02:33:16,200
planet which is sent back so you can
 

8525
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:18,050
planet which is sent back so you can
digitally interact with that environment

8526
02:33:18,050 --> 02:33:18,060
digitally interact with that environment
 

8527
02:33:18,060 --> 02:33:20,389
digitally interact with that environment
in a way which is

8528
02:33:20,389 --> 02:33:20,399
in a way which is
 

8529
02:33:20,399 --> 02:33:22,849
in a way which is
um not real time but representative of

8530
02:33:22,849 --> 02:33:22,859
um not real time but representative of
 

8531
02:33:22,859 --> 02:33:24,830
um not real time but representative of
what that planet would be like to be on

8532
02:33:24,830 --> 02:33:24,840
what that planet would be like to be on
 

8533
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:26,270
what that planet would be like to be on
the surface so we might be more like

8534
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:26,280
the surface so we might be more like
 

8535
02:33:26,280 --> 02:33:28,070
the surface so we might be more like
digital visitors to these plants

8536
02:33:28,070 --> 02:33:28,080
digital visitors to these plants
 

8537
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:30,830
digital visitors to these plants
certainly far easier practically to do

8538
02:33:30,830 --> 02:33:30,840
certainly far easier practically to do
 

8539
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:34,429
certainly far easier practically to do
that than physically forcing this wet

8540
02:33:34,429 --> 02:33:34,439
that than physically forcing this wet
 

8541
02:33:34,439 --> 02:33:37,309
that than physically forcing this wet
chunk of meat to fly light years across

8542
02:33:37,309 --> 02:33:37,319
chunk of meat to fly light years across
 

8543
02:33:37,319 --> 02:33:39,170
chunk of meat to fly light years across
space to do that

8544
02:33:39,170 --> 02:33:39,180
space to do that
 

8545
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:42,830
space to do that
um and so that's maybe uh something we

8546
02:33:42,830 --> 02:33:42,840
um and so that's maybe uh something we
 

8547
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:45,230
um and so that's maybe uh something we
can imagine down the road the Halo drive

8548
02:33:45,230 --> 02:33:45,240
can imagine down the road the Halo drive
 

8549
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:47,870
can imagine down the road the Halo drive
as I said is thinking even further ahead

8550
02:33:47,870 --> 02:33:47,880
as I said is thinking even further ahead
 

8551
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:50,870
as I said is thinking even further ahead
and if you did want to launch large

8552
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:50,880
and if you did want to launch large
 

8553
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:53,570
and if you did want to launch large
masses large masses could even be

8554
02:33:53,570 --> 02:33:53,580
masses large masses could even be
 

8555
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:55,250
masses large masses could even be
planet-sized things in the case of the

8556
02:33:55,250 --> 02:33:55,260
planet-sized things in the case of the
 

8557
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:58,490
planet-sized things in the case of the
Halo drive you can use black holes

8558
02:33:58,490 --> 02:33:58,500
Halo drive you can use black holes
 

8559
02:33:58,500 --> 02:34:00,349
Halo drive you can use black holes
so this is kind of

8560
02:34:00,349 --> 02:34:00,359
so this is kind of
 

8561
02:34:00,359 --> 02:34:02,690
so this is kind of
um a trick of physics you know I often

8562
02:34:02,690 --> 02:34:02,700
um a trick of physics you know I often
 

8563
02:34:02,700 --> 02:34:04,849
um a trick of physics you know I often
think of the universe as like a big

8564
02:34:04,849 --> 02:34:04,859
think of the universe as like a big
 

8565
02:34:04,859 --> 02:34:07,010
think of the universe as like a big
computer game and you're trying to find

8566
02:34:07,010 --> 02:34:07,020
computer game and you're trying to find
 

8567
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:10,730
computer game and you're trying to find
cheat codes hacks exploits that the

8568
02:34:10,730 --> 02:34:10,740
cheat codes hacks exploits that the
 

8569
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:12,530
cheat codes hacks exploits that the
Universe didn't intend for you to use

8570
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:12,540
Universe didn't intend for you to use
 

8571
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:15,050
Universe didn't intend for you to use
but once you find them you can address

8572
02:34:15,050 --> 02:34:15,060
but once you find them you can address
 

8573
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:16,790
but once you find them you can address
all sorts of interesting capabilities

8574
02:34:16,790 --> 02:34:16,800
all sorts of interesting capabilities
 

8575
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:19,610
all sorts of interesting capabilities
that you didn't previously have yeah and

8576
02:34:19,610 --> 02:34:19,620
that you didn't previously have yeah and
 

8577
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:21,770
that you didn't previously have yeah and
the Halo drive does that with black hole

8578
02:34:21,770 --> 02:34:21,780
the Halo drive does that with black hole
 

8579
02:34:21,780 --> 02:34:23,389
the Halo drive does that with black hole
so if you have two black holes which are

8580
02:34:23,389 --> 02:34:23,399
so if you have two black holes which are
 

8581
02:34:23,399 --> 02:34:25,190
so if you have two black holes which are
very common situation a binary black

8582
02:34:25,190 --> 02:34:25,200
very common situation a binary black
 

8583
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:28,250
very common situation a binary black
hole and they're inspiring towards each

8584
02:34:28,250 --> 02:34:28,260
hole and they're inspiring towards each
 

8585
02:34:28,260 --> 02:34:30,349
hole and they're inspiring towards each
other ligers detected I think dozens of

8586
02:34:30,349 --> 02:34:30,359
other ligers detected I think dozens of
 

8587
02:34:30,359 --> 02:34:31,910
other ligers detected I think dozens of
these things maybe even over 100 at this

8588
02:34:31,910 --> 02:34:31,920
these things maybe even over 100 at this
 

8589
02:34:31,920 --> 02:34:33,830
these things maybe even over 100 at this
point and these things as they merge

8590
02:34:33,830 --> 02:34:33,840
point and these things as they merge
 

8591
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:37,010
point and these things as they merge
together they uh the pre-merger phase

8592
02:34:37,010 --> 02:34:37,020
together they uh the pre-merger phase
 

8593
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:38,750
together they uh the pre-merger phase
they're they're orbiting each other very

8594
02:34:38,750 --> 02:34:38,760
they're they're orbiting each other very
 

8595
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:40,250
they're they're orbiting each other very
very fast even close to the speed of

8596
02:34:40,250 --> 02:34:40,260
very fast even close to the speed of
 

8597
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:43,910
very fast even close to the speed of
light and so Freeman Dyson uh before he

8598
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:43,920
light and so Freeman Dyson uh before he
 

8599
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:45,290
light and so Freeman Dyson uh before he
passed away I think in the 70s he had

8600
02:34:45,290 --> 02:34:45,300
passed away I think in the 70s he had
 

8601
02:34:45,300 --> 02:34:46,550
passed away I think in the 70s he had
this provocative paper called

8602
02:34:46,550 --> 02:34:46,560
this provocative paper called
 

8603
02:34:46,560 --> 02:34:48,469
this provocative paper called
gravitational machines and he suggested

8604
02:34:48,469 --> 02:34:48,479
gravitational machines and he suggested
 

8605
02:34:48,479 --> 02:34:50,870
gravitational machines and he suggested
that you could use neutron stars as a

8606
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:50,880
that you could use neutron stars as a
 

8607
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:53,150
that you could use neutron stars as a
Interstellar propulsion system

8608
02:34:53,150 --> 02:34:53,160
Interstellar propulsion system
 

8609
02:34:53,160 --> 02:34:55,969
Interstellar propulsion system
and neutron stars are sort of the

8610
02:34:55,969 --> 02:34:55,979
and neutron stars are sort of the
 

8611
02:34:55,979 --> 02:34:56,570
and neutron stars are sort of the
um

8612
02:34:56,570 --> 02:34:56,580
um
 

8613
02:34:56,580 --> 02:34:58,190
um
the you know the lower Mass version of

8614
02:34:58,190 --> 02:34:58,200
the you know the lower Mass version of
 

8615
02:34:58,200 --> 02:35:00,410
the you know the lower Mass version of
binary black hole system essentially

8616
02:35:00,410 --> 02:35:00,420
binary black hole system essentially
 

8617
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:02,929
binary black hole system essentially
in this case he suggested just doing

8618
02:35:02,929 --> 02:35:02,939
in this case he suggested just doing
 

8619
02:35:02,939 --> 02:35:04,969
in this case he suggested just doing
gravitational slingshot just fly your

8620
02:35:04,969 --> 02:35:04,979
gravitational slingshot just fly your
 

8621
02:35:04,979 --> 02:35:11,090
gravitational slingshot just fly your
spacecraft into this uh very Compact and

8622
02:35:11,090 --> 02:35:11,100
spacecraft into this uh very Compact and
 

8623
02:35:11,100 --> 02:35:13,429
spacecraft into this uh very Compact and
relativistic binary system and you do

8624
02:35:13,429 --> 02:35:13,439
relativistic binary system and you do
 

8625
02:35:13,439 --> 02:35:15,050
relativistic binary system and you do
need neutron stars because if there were

8626
02:35:15,050 --> 02:35:15,060
need neutron stars because if there were
 

8627
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:16,910
need neutron stars because if there were
two stars they'd be physically touching

8628
02:35:16,910 --> 02:35:16,920
two stars they'd be physically touching
 

8629
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:18,830
two stars they'd be physically touching
each other so the neutron stars are so

8630
02:35:18,830 --> 02:35:18,840
each other so the neutron stars are so
 

8631
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:20,750
each other so the neutron stars are so
small like 10 kilometers across they can

8632
02:35:20,750 --> 02:35:20,760
small like 10 kilometers across they can
 

8633
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:22,670
small like 10 kilometers across they can
get really close to each other and have

8634
02:35:22,670 --> 02:35:22,680
get really close to each other and have
 

8635
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:24,650
get really close to each other and have
these very very fast orbits with respect

8636
02:35:24,650 --> 02:35:24,660
these very very fast orbits with respect
 

8637
02:35:24,660 --> 02:35:25,670
these very very fast orbits with respect
to each other

8638
02:35:25,670 --> 02:35:25,680
to each other
 

8639
02:35:25,680 --> 02:35:27,950
to each other
you shoot your spacecraft through right

8640
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:27,960
you shoot your spacecraft through right
 

8641
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:28,969
you shoot your spacecraft through right
through the middle like throwing through

8642
02:35:28,969 --> 02:35:28,979
through the middle like throwing through
 

8643
02:35:28,979 --> 02:35:30,710
through the middle like throwing through
the eye of a needle and you do a

8644
02:35:30,710 --> 02:35:30,720
the eye of a needle and you do a
 

8645
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:32,990
the eye of a needle and you do a
slingshot around one of them and you do

8646
02:35:32,990 --> 02:35:33,000
slingshot around one of them and you do
 

8647
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,610
slingshot around one of them and you do
it around the one that's coming sort of

8648
02:35:34,610 --> 02:35:34,620
it around the one that's coming sort of
 

8649
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:36,290
it around the one that's coming sort of
towards you so when I'm becoming away

8650
02:35:36,290 --> 02:35:36,300
towards you so when I'm becoming away
 

8651
02:35:36,300 --> 02:35:37,490
towards you so when I'm becoming away
you want to be coming towards you any

8652
02:35:37,490 --> 02:35:37,500
you want to be coming towards you any
 

8653
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:39,349
you want to be coming towards you any
one point and then you could basically

8654
02:35:39,349 --> 02:35:39,359
one point and then you could basically
 

8655
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:41,870
one point and then you could basically
steal some of the kinetic energy in the

8656
02:35:41,870 --> 02:35:41,880
steal some of the kinetic energy in the
 

8657
02:35:41,880 --> 02:35:43,429
steal some of the kinetic energy in the
slingshot in principle you can sell up

8658
02:35:43,429 --> 02:35:43,439
slingshot in principle you can sell up
 

8659
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:46,070
slingshot in principle you can sell up
to twice the speed you can take your

8660
02:35:46,070 --> 02:35:46,080
to twice the speed you can take your
 

8661
02:35:46,080 --> 02:35:49,130
to twice the speed you can take your
speed and it becomes your speed plus

8662
02:35:49,130 --> 02:35:49,140
speed and it becomes your speed plus
 

8663
02:35:49,140 --> 02:35:50,690
speed and it becomes your speed plus
twice the speed of the black of the

8664
02:35:50,690 --> 02:35:50,700
twice the speed of the black of the
 

8665
02:35:50,700 --> 02:35:52,429
twice the speed of the black of the
neutron star in this case and that would

8666
02:35:52,429 --> 02:35:52,439
neutron star in this case and that would
 

8667
02:35:52,439 --> 02:35:54,170
neutron star in this case and that would
be your new speed after the slingshot

8668
02:35:54,170 --> 02:35:54,180
be your new speed after the slingshot
 

8669
02:35:54,180 --> 02:35:56,690
be your new speed after the slingshot
this seems great because it's just free

8670
02:35:56,690 --> 02:35:56,700
this seems great because it's just free
 

8671
02:35:56,700 --> 02:35:59,150
this seems great because it's just free
energy basically you're not doing it you

8672
02:35:59,150 --> 02:35:59,160
energy basically you're not doing it you
 

8673
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:00,710
energy basically you're not doing it you
know you're not generally to have a

8674
02:36:00,710 --> 02:36:00,720
know you're not generally to have a
 

8675
02:36:00,720 --> 02:36:01,730
know you're not generally to have a
nuclear power react or anything to

8676
02:36:01,730 --> 02:36:01,740
nuclear power react or anything to
 

8677
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:03,010
nuclear power react or anything to
generate this you're just stealing it

8678
02:36:03,010 --> 02:36:03,020
generate this you're just stealing it
 

8679
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:05,270
generate this you're just stealing it
and indeed you can get to relativistic

8680
02:36:05,270 --> 02:36:05,280
and indeed you can get to relativistic
 

8681
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:07,730
and indeed you can get to relativistic
speeds this way so I loved that paper

8682
02:36:07,730 --> 02:36:07,740
speeds this way so I loved that paper
 

8683
02:36:07,740 --> 02:36:10,130
speeds this way so I loved that paper
but I had a criticism and the criticism

8684
02:36:10,130 --> 02:36:10,140
but I had a criticism and the criticism
 

8685
02:36:10,140 --> 02:36:12,710
but I had a criticism and the criticism
was that this is like trying to fly your

8686
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:12,720
was that this is like trying to fly your
 

8687
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,870
was that this is like trying to fly your
ship into a blender right this is this

8688
02:36:14,870 --> 02:36:14,880
ship into a blender right this is this
 

8689
02:36:14,880 --> 02:36:17,450
ship into a blender right this is this
is two neutron stars which have huge

8690
02:36:17,450 --> 02:36:17,460
is two neutron stars which have huge
 

8691
02:36:17,460 --> 02:36:19,309
is two neutron stars which have huge
total forces

8692
02:36:19,309 --> 02:36:19,319
total forces
 

8693
02:36:19,319 --> 02:36:20,750
total forces
um and they're whipping around each

8694
02:36:20,750 --> 02:36:20,760
um and they're whipping around each
 

8695
02:36:20,760 --> 02:36:22,790
um and they're whipping around each
other once every second or even less

8696
02:36:22,790 --> 02:36:22,800
other once every second or even less
 

8697
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:24,590
other once every second or even less
than a second and you're trying to fly

8698
02:36:24,590 --> 02:36:24,600
than a second and you're trying to fly
 

8699
02:36:24,600 --> 02:36:26,690
than a second and you're trying to fly
your spaceship and do this maneuver that

8700
02:36:26,690 --> 02:36:26,700
your spaceship and do this maneuver that
 

8701
02:36:26,700 --> 02:36:28,790
your spaceship and do this maneuver that
is pretty precarious and so it just

8702
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:28,800
is pretty precarious and so it just
 

8703
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,889
is pretty precarious and so it just
didn't seem practical to me to do this

8704
02:36:30,889 --> 02:36:30,899
didn't seem practical to me to do this
 

8705
02:36:30,899 --> 02:36:34,130
didn't seem practical to me to do this
but I loved it and so I I took that idea

8706
02:36:34,130 --> 02:36:34,140
but I loved it and so I I took that idea
 

8707
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:35,510
but I loved it and so I I took that idea
and this is how science is it's

8708
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:35,520
and this is how science is it's
 

8709
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:37,790
and this is how science is it's
iterative it's it's you take a previous

8710
02:36:37,790 --> 02:36:37,800
iterative it's it's you take a previous
 

8711
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:40,010
iterative it's it's you take a previous
great man's idea and you just sort of

8712
02:36:40,010 --> 02:36:40,020
great man's idea and you just sort of
 

8713
02:36:40,020 --> 02:36:41,630
great man's idea and you just sort of
maybe slightly tweak it and prove it

8714
02:36:41,630 --> 02:36:41,640
maybe slightly tweak it and prove it
 

8715
02:36:41,640 --> 02:36:44,510
maybe slightly tweak it and prove it
that's how I see the Halo drive and I

8716
02:36:44,510 --> 02:36:44,520
that's how I see the Halo drive and I
 

8717
02:36:44,520 --> 02:36:46,190
that's how I see the Halo drive and I
just suggested why not replace those out

8718
02:36:46,190 --> 02:36:46,200
just suggested why not replace those out
 

8719
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:47,389
just suggested why not replace those out
for black holes

8720
02:36:47,389 --> 02:36:47,399
for black holes
 

8721
02:36:47,399 --> 02:36:49,610
for black holes
which is certainly very common and

8722
02:36:49,610 --> 02:36:49,620
which is certainly very common and
 

8723
02:36:49,620 --> 02:36:51,710
which is certainly very common and
rather than flying your ship into that

8724
02:36:51,710 --> 02:36:51,720
rather than flying your ship into that
 

8725
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:54,230
rather than flying your ship into that
uh that hell hole of a blender System

8726
02:36:54,230 --> 02:36:54,240
uh that hell hole of a blender System
 

8727
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:56,690
uh that hell hole of a blender System
you just stand back and you fire a laser

8728
02:36:56,690 --> 02:36:56,700
you just stand back and you fire a laser
 

8729
02:36:56,700 --> 02:36:59,450
you just stand back and you fire a laser
beam now because black holes have such

8730
02:36:59,450 --> 02:36:59,460
beam now because black holes have such
 

8731
02:36:59,460 --> 02:37:01,010
beam now because black holes have such
intense gravitational fields they can

8732
02:37:01,010 --> 02:37:01,020
intense gravitational fields they can
 

8733
02:37:01,020 --> 02:37:03,410
intense gravitational fields they can
bend light into complete 180s they can

8734
02:37:03,410 --> 02:37:03,420
bend light into complete 180s they can
 

8735
02:37:03,420 --> 02:37:05,929
bend light into complete 180s they can
actually become mirrors so you know the

8736
02:37:05,929 --> 02:37:05,939
actually become mirrors so you know the
 

8737
02:37:05,939 --> 02:37:08,030
actually become mirrors so you know the
sun bends light by maybe a fraction of a

8738
02:37:08,030 --> 02:37:08,040
sun bends light by maybe a fraction of a
 

8739
02:37:08,040 --> 02:37:10,910
sun bends light by maybe a fraction of a
degree through gravitational lensing but

8740
02:37:10,910 --> 02:37:10,920
degree through gravitational lensing but
 

8741
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:12,469
degree through gravitational lensing but
you know a compact object like a black

8742
02:37:12,469 --> 02:37:12,479
you know a compact object like a black
 

8743
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:14,570
you know a compact object like a black
hole can do a full 180 in fact if you

8744
02:37:14,570 --> 02:37:14,580
hole can do a full 180 in fact if you
 

8745
02:37:14,580 --> 02:37:16,250
hole can do a full 180 in fact if you
obviously if you if you went too close

8746
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:16,260
obviously if you if you went too close
 

8747
02:37:16,260 --> 02:37:17,990
obviously if you if you went too close
if you put the laser beam too close to

8748
02:37:17,990 --> 02:37:18,000
if you put the laser beam too close to
 

8749
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,309
if you put the laser beam too close to
the black hole just fall into it and

8750
02:37:19,309 --> 02:37:19,319
the black hole just fall into it and
 

8751
02:37:19,319 --> 02:37:21,290
the black hole just fall into it and
never come back out so you just kind of

8752
02:37:21,290 --> 02:37:21,300
never come back out so you just kind of
 

8753
02:37:21,300 --> 02:37:22,730
never come back out so you just kind of
push it out push it out push it out

8754
02:37:22,730 --> 02:37:22,740
push it out push it out push it out
 

8755
02:37:22,740 --> 02:37:24,110
push it out push it out push it out
until you get to a point where it's just

8756
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:24,120
until you get to a point where it's just
 

8757
02:37:24,120 --> 02:37:26,570
until you get to a point where it's just
skirting The Event Horizon and then that

8758
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:26,580
skirting The Event Horizon and then that
 

8759
02:37:26,580 --> 02:37:28,490
skirting The Event Horizon and then that
laser beam skirts around it comes back

8760
02:37:28,490 --> 02:37:28,500
laser beam skirts around it comes back
 

8761
02:37:28,500 --> 02:37:30,710
laser beam skirts around it comes back
now the laser beam wants to do a graphic

8762
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:30,720
now the laser beam wants to do a graphic
 

8763
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:31,790
now the laser beam wants to do a graphic
I mean it is doing a gravitational

8764
02:37:31,790 --> 02:37:31,800
I mean it is doing a gravitational
 

8765
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:35,450
I mean it is doing a gravitational
slingshot but laser I mean light photons

8766
02:37:35,450 --> 02:37:35,460
slingshot but laser I mean light photons
 

8767
02:37:35,460 --> 02:37:37,610
slingshot but laser I mean light photons
can't speed up unlike in like the

8768
02:37:37,610 --> 02:37:37,620
can't speed up unlike in like the
 

8769
02:37:37,620 --> 02:37:40,130
can't speed up unlike in like the
spaceship case so instead of speeding up

8770
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:40,140
spaceship case so instead of speeding up
 

8771
02:37:40,140 --> 02:37:42,170
spaceship case so instead of speeding up
the way they steal energy is they they

8772
02:37:42,170 --> 02:37:42,180
the way they steal energy is they they
 

8773
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:44,570
the way they steal energy is they they
increase their frequency so they become

8774
02:37:44,570 --> 02:37:44,580
increase their frequency so they become
 

8775
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:46,670
increase their frequency so they become
higher energy Photon packets essentially

8776
02:37:46,670 --> 02:37:46,680
higher energy Photon packets essentially
 

8777
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:48,770
higher energy Photon packets essentially
and they get blue shifted so that you

8778
02:37:48,770 --> 02:37:48,780
and they get blue shifted so that you
 

8779
02:37:48,780 --> 02:37:50,690
and they get blue shifted so that you
send maybe a red laser beam that comes

8780
02:37:50,690 --> 02:37:50,700
send maybe a red laser beam that comes
 

8781
02:37:50,700 --> 02:37:53,030
send maybe a red laser beam that comes
back blue it's got more energy in it and

8782
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:53,040
back blue it's got more energy in it and
 

8783
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:53,990
back blue it's got more energy in it and
because

8784
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:54,000
because
 

8785
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,090
because
um photons carry momentum which is

8786
02:37:56,090 --> 02:37:56,100
um photons carry momentum which is
 

8787
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:57,530
um photons carry momentum which is
somewhat unintuitive in everyday

8788
02:37:57,530 --> 02:37:57,540
somewhat unintuitive in everyday
 

8789
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:59,570
somewhat unintuitive in everyday
experience but they do that's how solar

8790
02:37:59,570 --> 02:37:59,580
experience but they do that's how solar
 

8791
02:37:59,580 --> 02:38:01,130
experience but they do that's how solar
cells work they can't momentum they push

8792
02:38:01,130 --> 02:38:01,140
cells work they can't momentum they push
 

8793
02:38:01,140 --> 02:38:03,950
cells work they can't momentum they push
things you can even use them as laser

8794
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:03,960
things you can even use them as laser
 

8795
02:38:03,960 --> 02:38:06,530
things you can even use them as laser
tweezers and things to pick things up

8796
02:38:06,530 --> 02:38:06,540
tweezers and things to pick things up
 

8797
02:38:06,540 --> 02:38:09,349
tweezers and things to pick things up
um because they push the Met it comes

8798
02:38:09,349 --> 02:38:09,359
um because they push the Met it comes
 

8799
02:38:09,359 --> 02:38:11,330
um because they push the Met it comes
back with momentum than it left

8800
02:38:11,330 --> 02:38:11,340
back with momentum than it left
 

8801
02:38:11,340 --> 02:38:14,389
back with momentum than it left
so you get an acceleration force from

8802
02:38:14,389 --> 02:38:14,399
so you get an acceleration force from
 

8803
02:38:14,399 --> 02:38:16,490
so you get an acceleration force from
this and again you're just seeing energy

8804
02:38:16,490 --> 02:38:16,500
this and again you're just seeing energy
 

8805
02:38:16,500 --> 02:38:18,290
this and again you're just seeing energy
from the black hole to do this so you

8806
02:38:18,290 --> 02:38:18,300
from the black hole to do this so you
 

8807
02:38:18,300 --> 02:38:20,150
from the black hole to do this so you
can get up to the same speed it's

8808
02:38:20,150 --> 02:38:20,160
can get up to the same speed it's
 

8809
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:21,950
can get up to the same speed it's
basically the same idea as Freeman Dyson

8810
02:38:21,950 --> 02:38:21,960
basically the same idea as Freeman Dyson
 

8811
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:24,230
basically the same idea as Freeman Dyson
but doing it from a safer distance and

8812
02:38:24,230 --> 02:38:24,240
but doing it from a safer distance and
 

8813
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:25,790
but doing it from a safer distance and
there should be a border of you know a

8814
02:38:25,790 --> 02:38:25,800
there should be a border of you know a
 

8815
02:38:25,800 --> 02:38:27,650
there should be a border of you know a
million or so or 10 million black holes

8816
02:38:27,650 --> 02:38:27,660
million or so or 10 million black holes
 

8817
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:29,809
million or so or 10 million black holes
in the Milky Way galaxy

8818
02:38:29,809 --> 02:38:29,819
in the Milky Way galaxy
 

8819
02:38:29,819 --> 02:38:32,990
in the Milky Way galaxy
some of them would be even as close as

8820
02:38:32,990 --> 02:38:33,000
some of them would be even as close as
 

8821
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,969
some of them would be even as close as
sort of 10 to 20 light years when you do

8822
02:38:34,969 --> 02:38:34,979
sort of 10 to 20 light years when you do
 

8823
02:38:34,979 --> 02:38:36,950
sort of 10 to 20 light years when you do
the occurrence rate statistics of how

8824
02:38:36,950 --> 02:38:36,960
the occurrence rate statistics of how
 

8825
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:38,450
the occurrence rate statistics of how
close you might expect feasibly want to

8826
02:38:38,450 --> 02:38:38,460
close you might expect feasibly want to
 

8827
02:38:38,460 --> 02:38:40,429
close you might expect feasibly want to
be they're of course difficult to detect

8828
02:38:40,429 --> 02:38:40,439
be they're of course difficult to detect
 

8829
02:38:40,439 --> 02:38:41,990
be they're of course difficult to detect
because they're black and so they're

8830
02:38:41,990 --> 02:38:42,000
because they're black and so they're
 

8831
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,150
because they're black and so they're
inherently hard to see but statistically

8832
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:44,160
inherently hard to see but statistically
 

8833
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:45,650
inherently hard to see but statistically
there should be plenty out there in the

8834
02:38:45,650 --> 02:38:45,660
there should be plenty out there in the
 

8835
02:38:45,660 --> 02:38:47,630
there should be plenty out there in the
Milky Way and so these objects would be

8836
02:38:47,630 --> 02:38:47,640
Milky Way and so these objects would be
 

8837
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:50,150
Milky Way and so these objects would be
natural Waypoint stations you could use

8838
02:38:50,150 --> 02:38:50,160
natural Waypoint stations you could use
 

8839
02:38:50,160 --> 02:38:53,090
natural Waypoint stations you could use
them to both accelerate away and to

8840
02:38:53,090 --> 02:38:53,100
them to both accelerate away and to
 

8841
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:54,889
them to both accelerate away and to
break and slow down

8842
02:38:54,889 --> 02:38:54,899
break and slow down
 

8843
02:38:54,899 --> 02:38:57,590
break and slow down
oh and on top of all this you know

02:38:57,590 --> 02:38:57,600
oh and on top of all this you know
 

8845
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:59,270
oh and on top of all this you know
there's we've been talking about

02:38:59,270 --> 02:38:59,280
there's we've been talking about
 

8847
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:01,490
there's we've been talking about
astronomy and cosmology there's been a

8848
02:39:01,490 --> 02:39:01,500
astronomy and cosmology there's been a
 

8849
02:39:01,500 --> 02:39:04,309
astronomy and cosmology there's been a
lot of exciting uh breakthroughs in

8850
02:39:04,309 --> 02:39:04,319
lot of exciting uh breakthroughs in
 

8851
02:39:04,319 --> 02:39:07,610

8855
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:12,830

02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:12,840
photons that you're talking about
 

8857
02:39:12,840 --> 02:39:15,410
photons that you're talking about
there's been a lot of work on photon

8858
02:39:15,410 --> 02:39:15,420
there's been a lot of work on photon
 

8859
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:17,450
there's been a lot of work on photon
rings and just all the fun stuff going

8860
02:39:17,450 --> 02:39:17,460
rings and just all the fun stuff going
 

8861
02:39:17,460 --> 02:39:20,690
rings and just all the fun stuff going
on outside the black holes yeah

8862
02:39:20,690 --> 02:39:20,700
on outside the black holes yeah
 

8863
02:39:20,700 --> 02:39:23,510
on outside the black holes yeah
um so all the the garbage outside is

8864
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:23,520
um so all the the garbage outside is
 

8865
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:26,630
um so all the the garbage outside is
actually might be the thing that holds a

be used for propulsion yeah I mean it
 

8907
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:09,110
be used for propulsion yeah I mean it
may be that black holes are used in all

in a way you know a unique capability

8926
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:29,700
in a way you know a unique capability
 

8927
02:40:29,700 --> 02:40:31,190
in a way you know a unique capability
for black hole is you can basically

8928
02:40:31,190 --> 02:40:31,200
for black hole is you can basically
 

8929
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:33,290
for black hole is you can basically
throw matter into it and you can get

8930
02:40:33,290 --> 02:40:33,300
throw matter into it and you can get
 

8931
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,210
throw matter into it and you can get
these jets that come out the accretion

8932
02:40:35,210 --> 02:40:35,220
these jets that come out the accretion
 

8933
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:37,370
these jets that come out the accretion
discs and the jets that fly out and so

8934
02:40:37,370 --> 02:40:37,380
discs and the jets that fly out and so
 

8935
02:40:37,380 --> 02:40:39,950
discs and the jets that fly out and so
you can more or less use them to convert

8936
02:40:39,950 --> 02:40:39,960
you can more or less use them to convert
 

8937
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:42,710
you can more or less use them to convert
Mata into energy V equals mc squared and

8938
02:40:42,710 --> 02:40:42,720
Mata into energy V equals mc squared and
 

8939
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:45,110
Mata into energy V equals mc squared and
there's pretty much nothing else except

8940
02:40:45,110 --> 02:40:45,120
there's pretty much nothing else except
 

8941
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:47,330
there's pretty much nothing else except
for you know Annihilation with and with

that
 

8947
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:51,469
that
so they have some unique properties you

8948
02:40:51,469 --> 02:40:51,479
so they have some unique properties you
 

8949
02:40:51,479 --> 02:40:52,910
so they have some unique properties you
could perhaps power a civilization

8950
02:40:52,910 --> 02:40:52,920
could perhaps power a civilization

02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:55,250
could perhaps power a civilization
registering garbage into a black hole

8952
02:40:55,250 --> 02:40:55,260
registering garbage into a black hole
 

8953
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:57,349
registering garbage into a black hole
right and just throwing asteroids in and

8954
02:40:57,349 --> 02:40:57,359
right and just throwing asteroids in and
 

8955
02:40:57,359 --> 02:40:58,910
right and just throwing asteroids in and
how your civilization with as much

8956
02:40:58,910 --> 02:40:58,920
how your civilization with as much
 

8957
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:00,230
how your civilization with as much
energy as you really would ever

8958
02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:00,240
energy as you really would ever
 

8959
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:02,690
energy as you really would ever
plausibly need and you could also use

8960
02:41:02,690 --> 02:41:02,700
plausibly need and you could also use
 

8961
02:41:02,700 --> 02:41:04,429
plausibly need and you could also use
them to accelerate away Across the

8962
02:41:04,429 --> 02:41:04,439
them to accelerate away Across the
 

8963
02:41:04,439 --> 02:41:06,530
them to accelerate away Across the
Universe and you can even imagine using

8964
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:06,540
Universe and you can even imagine using
 

8965
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:08,929
Universe and you can even imagine using
small artificial black holes as thermal

8966
02:41:08,929 --> 02:41:08,939
small artificial black holes as thermal
 

8967
02:41:08,939 --> 02:41:10,610
small artificial black holes as thermal
generators right so the Hawking

8968
02:41:10,610 --> 02:41:10,620
generators right so the Hawking
 

8969
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:12,770
generators right so the Hawking
radiation from them kind of

8970
02:41:12,770 --> 02:41:12,780
radiation from them kind of
 

8971
02:41:12,780 --> 02:41:14,330
radiation from them kind of
exponentially increases as they get

8972
02:41:14,330 --> 02:41:14,340
exponentially increases as they get
 

8973
02:41:14,340 --> 02:41:17,630
exponentially increases as they get
smaller and smaller in size and so a

8974
02:41:17,630 --> 02:41:17,640
smaller and smaller in size and so a
 

8975
02:41:17,640 --> 02:41:19,429
smaller and smaller in size and so a
very small black hole one you can almost

8976
02:41:19,429 --> 02:41:19,439
very small black hole one you can almost
 

8977
02:41:19,439 --> 02:41:21,530
very small black hole one you can almost
imagine like holding in your hand would

8978
02:41:21,530 --> 02:41:21,540
imagine like holding in your hand would
 

8979
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:24,410
imagine like holding in your hand would
be a fairly significant heat Source

8980
02:41:24,410 --> 02:41:24,420
be a fairly significant heat Source
 

8981
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:26,389
be a fairly significant heat Source
um and so that raises all sorts of

8982
02:41:26,389 --> 02:41:26,399
um and so that raises all sorts of
 

8983
02:41:26,399 --> 02:41:29,270
um and so that raises all sorts of
prospects about how you might use that

8984
02:41:29,270 --> 02:41:29,280
prospects about how you might use that
 

8985
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:31,070
prospects about how you might use that
in an engineering context to power your

8986
02:41:31,070 --> 02:41:31,080
in an engineering context to power your
 

8987
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:32,830
in an engineering context to power your
civilization as well

8988
02:41:32,830 --> 02:41:32,840
civilization as well
 

8989
02:41:32,840 --> 02:41:35,510
civilization as well
uh you have a video on becoming a

8990
02:41:35,510 --> 02:41:35,520
uh you have a video on becoming a
 

8991
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:37,250
uh you have a video on becoming a
Kardashian type one civilization what

8992
02:41:37,250 --> 02:41:37,260
Kardashian type one civilization what
 

8993
02:41:37,260 --> 02:41:39,770
Kardashian type one civilization what
what's our hope for doing that we're a

8994
02:41:39,770 --> 02:41:39,780
what's our hope for doing that we're a
 

8995
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:41,809
what's our hope for doing that we're a
few orders of magnitude away from that

8996
02:41:41,809 --> 02:41:41,819
few orders of magnitude away from that
 

8997
02:41:41,819 --> 02:41:44,030
few orders of magnitude away from that
yeah it is surprising I think people

8998
02:41:44,030 --> 02:41:44,040
yeah it is surprising I think people
 

8999
02:41:44,040 --> 02:41:46,429
yeah it is surprising I think people
tend to think that we're close to this

9000
02:41:46,429 --> 02:41:46,439
tend to think that we're close to this
 

9001
02:41:46,439 --> 02:41:49,490
tend to think that we're close to this
this scale the the kardashev type one is

9002
02:41:49,490 --> 02:41:49,500
this scale the the kardashev type one is
 

9003
02:41:49,500 --> 02:41:52,309
this scale the the kardashev type one is
defined as a civilization which is using

9004
02:41:52,309 --> 02:41:52,319
defined as a civilization which is using
 

9005
02:41:52,319 --> 02:41:54,349
defined as a civilization which is using
as much energy as is essentially insulin

9006
02:41:54,349 --> 02:41:54,359
as much energy as is essentially insulin
 

9007
02:41:54,359 --> 02:41:56,870
as much energy as is essentially insulin
upon the planet from the Star

9008
02:41:56,870 --> 02:41:56,880
upon the planet from the Star
 

9009
02:41:56,880 --> 02:41:58,309
upon the planet from the Star
um so that's a border I think for the

9010
02:41:58,309 --> 02:41:58,319
um so that's a border I think for the
 

9011
02:41:58,319 --> 02:42:00,110
um so that's a border I think for the
Earth of something like 10 to the five

9012
02:42:00,110 --> 02:42:00,120
Earth of something like 10 to the five
 

9013
02:42:00,120 --> 02:42:02,510
Earth of something like 10 to the five
tarot so 10 to the seven terrorists is a

9014
02:42:02,510 --> 02:42:02,520
tarot so 10 to the seven terrorists is a
 

9015
02:42:02,520 --> 02:42:04,429
tarot so 10 to the seven terrorists is a
gigantic amount of energy and we're

9016
02:42:04,429 --> 02:42:04,439
gigantic amount of energy and we're
 

9017
02:42:04,439 --> 02:42:06,590
gigantic amount of energy and we're
using a tiny tiny tiny fraction of that

9018
02:42:06,590 --> 02:42:06,600
using a tiny tiny tiny fraction of that
 

9019
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:10,309
using a tiny tiny tiny fraction of that
right now so um you know if you became a

9020
02:42:10,309 --> 02:42:10,319
right now so um you know if you became a
 

9021
02:42:10,319 --> 02:42:12,770
right now so um you know if you became a
color Chef type 1 civilization which is

9022
02:42:12,770 --> 02:42:12,780
color Chef type 1 civilization which is
 

9023
02:42:12,780 --> 02:42:14,270
color Chef type 1 civilization which is
seen not necessarily as a goal into

9024
02:42:14,270 --> 02:42:14,280
seen not necessarily as a goal into
 

9025
02:42:14,280 --> 02:42:16,130
seen not necessarily as a goal into
itself I think people think why why are

9026
02:42:16,130 --> 02:42:16,140
itself I think people think why why are
 

9027
02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:19,130
itself I think people think why why are
we aspiring to become this energy hungry

9028
02:42:19,130 --> 02:42:19,140
we aspiring to become this energy hungry
 

9029
02:42:19,140 --> 02:42:21,889
we aspiring to become this energy hungry
civilization you know surely

9030
02:42:21,889 --> 02:42:21,899
civilization you know surely
 

9031
02:42:21,899 --> 02:42:24,410
civilization you know surely
um our energy needs might become you

9032
02:42:24,410 --> 02:42:24,420
um our energy needs might become you
 

9033
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:26,030
um our energy needs might become you
know might improve our efficiency or

9034
02:42:26,030 --> 02:42:26,040
know might improve our efficiency or
 

9035
02:42:26,040 --> 02:42:27,830
know might improve our efficiency or
something as time goes on but ultimately

9036
02:42:27,830 --> 02:42:27,840
something as time goes on but ultimately
 

9037
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:30,469
something as time goes on but ultimately
the more energy you have access to the

9038
02:42:30,469 --> 02:42:30,479
the more energy you have access to the
 

9039
02:42:30,479 --> 02:42:32,450
the more energy you have access to the
greater your capabilities will be I mean

9040
02:42:32,450 --> 02:42:32,460
greater your capabilities will be I mean
 

9041
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:34,849
greater your capabilities will be I mean
if you want to lift Mount Everest into

9042
02:42:34,849 --> 02:42:34,859
if you want to lift Mount Everest into
 

9043
02:42:34,859 --> 02:42:37,910
if you want to lift Mount Everest into
space there is just a calculable amount

9044
02:42:37,910 --> 02:42:37,920
space there is just a calculable amount
 

9045
02:42:37,920 --> 02:42:39,530
space there is just a calculable amount
of potential energy change that that's

9046
02:42:39,530 --> 02:42:39,540
of potential energy change that that's
 

9047
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:41,030
of potential energy change that that's
going to take in order to accomplish

9048
02:42:41,030 --> 02:42:41,040
going to take in order to accomplish
 

9049
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:43,250
going to take in order to accomplish
that and the more energy you have access

9050
02:42:43,250 --> 02:42:43,260
that and the more energy you have access
 

9051
02:42:43,260 --> 02:42:45,349
that and the more energy you have access
to a civilization then include the

9052
02:42:45,349 --> 02:42:45,359
to a civilization then include the
 

9053
02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:47,450
to a civilization then include the
easier that energy achievement is going

9054
02:42:47,450 --> 02:42:47,460
easier that energy achievement is going
 

9055
02:42:47,460 --> 02:42:49,130
easier that energy achievement is going
to be so depends on what your

9056
02:42:49,130 --> 02:42:49,140
to be so depends on what your
 

9057
02:42:49,140 --> 02:42:50,630
to be so depends on what your
aspirations are as a civilization it

9058
02:42:50,630 --> 02:42:50,640
aspirations are as a civilization it
 

9059
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:51,889
aspirations are as a civilization it
might not be something you want to ever

9060
02:42:51,889 --> 02:42:51,899
might not be something you want to ever
 

9061
02:42:51,899 --> 02:42:55,010
might not be something you want to ever
do but well but we should make clear

9062
02:42:55,010 --> 02:42:55,020
do but well but we should make clear
 

9063
02:42:55,020 --> 02:42:57,230
do but well but we should make clear
that lifting heavy things isn't the only

9064
02:42:57,230 --> 02:42:57,240
that lifting heavy things isn't the only
 

9065
02:42:57,240 --> 02:42:59,150
that lifting heavy things isn't the only
thing it's uh it's just doing work so

9066
02:42:59,150 --> 02:42:59,160
thing it's uh it's just doing work so
 

9067
02:42:59,160 --> 02:43:01,070
thing it's uh it's just doing work so
yeah it could be computation it could be

9068
02:43:01,070 --> 02:43:01,080
yeah it could be computation it could be
 

9069
02:43:01,080 --> 02:43:03,170
yeah it could be computation it could be
right it could be more and more and more

9070
02:43:03,170 --> 02:43:03,180
right it could be more and more and more
 

9071
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:04,730
right it could be more and more and more
and more sophisticated and larger and

9072
02:43:04,730 --> 02:43:04,740
and more sophisticated and larger and
 

9073
02:43:04,740 --> 02:43:06,710
and more sophisticated and larger and
larger larger computation which is it

9074
02:43:06,710 --> 02:43:06,720
larger larger computation which is it
 

9075
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:09,290
larger larger computation which is it
does seem where we're headed with the uh

9076
02:43:09,290 --> 02:43:09,300
does seem where we're headed with the uh
 

9077
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:11,510
does seem where we're headed with the uh
very fast increase

9078
02:43:11,510 --> 02:43:11,520
very fast increase
 

9079
02:43:11,520 --> 02:43:13,309
very fast increase
and um

9080
02:43:13,309 --> 02:43:13,319
and um
 

9081
02:43:13,319 --> 02:43:16,130
and um
the the scale and the quality of our

9082
02:43:16,130 --> 02:43:16,140
the the scale and the quality of our
 

9083
02:43:16,140 --> 02:43:18,530
the the scale and the quality of our

9084
02:43:18,530 --> 02:43:18,540
computation outside the human brain yeah
 

9085
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:20,570

artificial computation yeah I mean

9086
02:43:20,570 --> 02:43:20,580
artificial computation yeah I mean
 

9087
02:43:20,580 --> 02:43:23,210
artificial computation yeah I mean
computation is a great example of I mean

9088
02:43:23,210 --> 02:43:23,220
computation is a great example of I mean
 

9089
02:43:23,220 --> 02:43:24,950

02:43:24,950 --> 02:43:24,960
already I think it's about 10 of us

02:43:27,050 --> 02:43:27,060
power electricity use is going towards
 

9093
02:43:27,060 --> 02:43:29,030
power electricity use is going towards
the super Computing centers so there's a

02:43:29,030 --> 02:43:29,040
the super Computing centers so there's a
 

9095
02:43:29,040 --> 02:43:31,130
the super Computing centers so there's a
there's a vast amount of uh current

9109
02:43:43,740 --> 02:43:45,770
realities that that cost will surely
become almost a dominant source of our

9110
02:43:45,770 --> 02:43:45,780
become almost a dominant source of our
 

9111
02:43:45,780 --> 02:43:47,090
become almost a dominant source of our
energy requirements at that point if

9112
02:43:47,090 --> 02:43:47,100
energy requirements at that point if
 

9113
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:50,090
energy requirements at that point if
civilization completely moves over to

9114
02:43:50,090 --> 02:43:50,100
civilization completely moves over to
 

9115
02:43:50,100 --> 02:43:52,849
civilization completely moves over to
this kind of post-humanism stage and so

9116
02:43:52,849 --> 02:43:52,859
this kind of post-humanism stage and so
 

9117
02:43:52,859 --> 02:43:55,070
this kind of post-humanism stage and so
it's not unreasonable that our engine

9118
02:43:55,070 --> 02:43:55,080
it's not unreasonable that our engine
 

9119
02:43:55,080 --> 02:43:56,929
it's not unreasonable that our engine
needs would continue to grow certainly

9120
02:43:56,929 --> 02:43:56,939
needs would continue to grow certainly
 

9121
02:43:56,939 --> 02:43:58,730
needs would continue to grow certainly
historically they always have at about

9122
02:43:58,730 --> 02:43:58,740
historically they always have at about
 

9123
02:43:58,740 --> 02:44:01,550
historically they always have at about
two percent per year and so if that

9124
02:44:01,550 --> 02:44:01,560
two percent per year and so if that
 

9125
02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:02,929
two percent per year and so if that
continues there is going to be a certain

9126
02:44:02,929 --> 02:44:02,939
continues there is going to be a certain
 

9127
02:44:02,939 --> 02:44:04,309
continues there is going to be a certain
point

9128
02:44:04,309 --> 02:44:04,319
point
 

9129
02:44:04,319 --> 02:44:06,530
point
um where you're running up against the

9130
02:44:06,530 --> 02:44:06,540
um where you're running up against the
 

9131
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:08,150
um where you're running up against the
amount of energy which you can Harvest

9132
02:44:08,150 --> 02:44:08,160
amount of energy which you can Harvest
 

9133
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:10,190
amount of energy which you can Harvest
because it's you're using every even if

9134
02:44:10,190 --> 02:44:10,200
because it's you're using every even if
 

9135
02:44:10,200 --> 02:44:11,510
because it's you're using every even if
you cover the entire planet and solar

9136
02:44:11,510 --> 02:44:11,520
you cover the entire planet and solar
 

9137
02:44:11,520 --> 02:44:14,750
you cover the entire planet and solar
panels there's no more energy to be had

9138
02:44:14,750 --> 02:44:14,760
panels there's no more energy to be had
 

9139
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:16,670
panels there's no more energy to be had
um and so this is a you know there's a

9140
02:44:16,670 --> 02:44:16,680
um and so this is a you know there's a
 

9141
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:18,230
um and so this is a you know there's a
few ways of achieving this I sort of

9142
02:44:18,230 --> 02:44:18,240
few ways of achieving this I sort of
 

9143
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:20,270
few ways of achieving this I sort of
talked about in the video how there were

9144
02:44:20,270 --> 02:44:20,280
talked about in the video how there were
 

9145
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:21,770
talked about in the video how there were
several renewable energy sources that

9146
02:44:21,770 --> 02:44:21,780
several renewable energy sources that
 

9147
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:24,290
several renewable energy sources that
were excited about like geothermal wind

9148
02:44:24,290 --> 02:44:24,300
were excited about like geothermal wind
 

9149
02:44:24,300 --> 02:44:26,990
were excited about like geothermal wind
power waves but pretty much all of those

9150
02:44:26,990 --> 02:44:27,000
power waves but pretty much all of those
 

9151
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,090
power waves but pretty much all of those
don't really scratch the surface or

9152
02:44:29,090 --> 02:44:29,100
don't really scratch the surface or
 

9153
02:44:29,100 --> 02:44:30,349
don't really scratch the surface or
don't really scratch the itch of getting

9154
02:44:30,349 --> 02:44:30,359
don't really scratch the itch of getting
 

9155
02:44:30,359 --> 02:44:31,969
don't really scratch the itch of getting
to a kardashev type one civilization

9156
02:44:31,969 --> 02:44:31,979
to a kardashev type one civilization
 

9157
02:44:31,979 --> 02:44:33,830
to a kardashev type one civilization
they're meaningful now I would never

9158
02:44:33,830 --> 02:44:33,840
they're meaningful now I would never
 

9159
02:44:33,840 --> 02:44:36,290
they're meaningful now I would never
tell anybody don't do wind power now

9160
02:44:36,290 --> 02:44:36,300
tell anybody don't do wind power now
 

9161
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:38,330
tell anybody don't do wind power now
because it's it's clearly used for our

9162
02:44:38,330 --> 02:44:38,340
because it's it's clearly used for our
 

9163
02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:40,610
because it's it's clearly used for our
current stage of civilization but it's

9164
02:44:40,610 --> 02:44:40,620
current stage of civilization but it's
 

9165
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:42,590
current stage of civilization but it's
not it's going to be a pretty negligible

9166
02:44:42,590 --> 02:44:42,600
not it's going to be a pretty negligible
 

9167
02:44:42,600 --> 02:44:43,969
not it's going to be a pretty negligible
fraction of our energy requirements if

9168
02:44:43,969 --> 02:44:43,979
fraction of our energy requirements if
 

9169
02:44:43,979 --> 02:44:46,070
fraction of our energy requirements if
we got to that stage of development and

9170
02:44:46,070 --> 02:44:46,080
we got to that stage of development and
 

9171
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:48,410
we got to that stage of development and
so there has to be a breakthrough in

9172
02:44:48,410 --> 02:44:48,420
so there has to be a breakthrough in
 

9173
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:50,090
so there has to be a breakthrough in
either our ability to harvest solar

9174
02:44:50,090 --> 02:44:50,100
either our ability to harvest solar
 

9175
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:52,130
either our ability to harvest solar
energy which would require maybe

9176
02:44:52,130 --> 02:44:52,140
energy which would require maybe
 

9177
02:44:52,140 --> 02:44:54,110
energy which would require maybe
something like a space array of solar

9178
02:44:54,110 --> 02:44:54,120
something like a space array of solar
 

9179
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:55,929
something like a space array of solar
panels of beaming the energy back down

9180
02:44:55,929 --> 02:44:55,939
panels of beaming the energy back down
 

9181
02:44:55,939 --> 02:44:59,990
panels of beaming the energy back down
or some developments and Innovations in

9182
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:00,000
or some developments and Innovations in
 

9183
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,030
or some developments and Innovations in
nuclear fusion that would allow us to

9184
02:45:02,030 --> 02:45:02,040
nuclear fusion that would allow us to
 

9185
02:45:02,040 --> 02:45:04,250
nuclear fusion that would allow us to
essentially reproduce the same process

9186
02:45:04,250 --> 02:45:04,260
essentially reproduce the same process
 

9187
02:45:04,260 --> 02:45:06,410
essentially reproduce the same process
of what's producing the solar photons

9188
02:45:06,410 --> 02:45:06,420
of what's producing the solar photons
 

9189
02:45:06,420 --> 02:45:09,469
of what's producing the solar photons
but here on Earth but even that comes

9190
02:45:09,469 --> 02:45:09,479
but here on Earth but even that comes
 

9191
02:45:09,479 --> 02:45:10,730
but here on Earth but even that comes
with some consequences if you're

9192
02:45:10,730 --> 02:45:10,740
with some consequences if you're
 

9193
02:45:10,740 --> 02:45:12,050
with some consequences if you're
generating the energy here on Earth and

9194
02:45:12,050 --> 02:45:12,060
generating the energy here on Earth and
 

9195
02:45:12,060 --> 02:45:14,270
generating the energy here on Earth and
you're doing work on it on Earth then

9196
02:45:14,270 --> 02:45:14,280
you're doing work on it on Earth then
 

9197
02:45:14,280 --> 02:45:15,950
you're doing work on it on Earth then
that work is going to produce waste heat

9198
02:45:15,950 --> 02:45:15,960
that work is going to produce waste heat
 

9199
02:45:15,960 --> 02:45:17,270
that work is going to produce waste heat
and that waste heat is going to increase

9200
02:45:17,270 --> 02:45:17,280
and that waste heat is going to increase
 

9201
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:18,550
and that waste heat is going to increase
the ambient temperature of the planet

9202
02:45:18,550 --> 02:45:18,560
the ambient temperature of the planet
 

9203
02:45:18,560 --> 02:45:22,250
the ambient temperature of the planet
and so you whether even if this isn't

9204
02:45:22,250 --> 02:45:22,260
and so you whether even if this isn't
 

9205
02:45:22,260 --> 02:45:24,230
and so you whether even if this isn't
really a greenhouse effect that you're

9206
02:45:24,230 --> 02:45:24,240
really a greenhouse effect that you're
 

9207
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:25,309
really a greenhouse effect that you're
increasing the temperature of the planet

9208
02:45:25,309 --> 02:45:25,319
increasing the temperature of the planet
 

9209
02:45:25,319 --> 02:45:27,230
increasing the temperature of the planet
this is just the amount of computers

9210
02:45:27,230 --> 02:45:27,240
this is just the amount of computers
 

9211
02:45:27,240 --> 02:45:28,910
this is just the amount of computers
that are churning you put your hand to a

9212
02:45:28,910 --> 02:45:28,920
that are churning you put your hand to a
 

9213
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:29,990
that are churning you put your hand to a
computer you can feel the warmth coming

9214
02:45:29,990 --> 02:45:30,000
computer you can feel the warmth coming
 

9215
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:33,050
computer you can feel the warmth coming
off them if you do them at work of

9216
02:45:33,050 --> 02:45:33,060
off them if you do them at work of
 

9217
02:45:33,060 --> 02:45:35,090
off them if you do them at work of
literally in you know the entire instant

9218
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:35,100
literally in you know the entire instant
 

9219
02:45:35,100 --> 02:45:36,849
literally in you know the entire instant
energy of the planet is doing that work

9220
02:45:36,849 --> 02:45:36,859
energy of the planet is doing that work
 

9221
02:45:36,859 --> 02:45:38,750
energy of the planet is doing that work
the player is going to warm up

9222
02:45:38,750 --> 02:45:38,760
the player is going to warm up
 

9223
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:41,809
the player is going to warm up
significantly as a result of that and so

9224
02:45:41,809 --> 02:45:41,819
significantly as a result of that and so
 

9225
02:45:41,819 --> 02:45:45,469
significantly as a result of that and so
you know that's uh it that clearly

9226
02:45:45,469 --> 02:45:45,479
you know that's uh it that clearly
 

9227
02:45:45,479 --> 02:45:47,389
you know that's uh it that clearly
indicates that this is not a sustainable

9228
02:45:47,389 --> 02:45:47,399
indicates that this is not a sustainable
 

9229
02:45:47,399 --> 02:45:49,130
indicates that this is not a sustainable
path that civilizations as they approach

9230
02:45:49,130 --> 02:45:49,140
path that civilizations as they approach
 

9231
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:50,929

color Chef type 1 are going to have to

9232
02:45:50,929 --> 02:45:50,939
color Chef type 1 are going to have to
 

9233
02:45:50,939 --> 02:45:52,790
color Chef type 1 are going to have to
leave planet Earth which is really the

9234
02:45:52,790 --> 02:45:52,800
leave planet Earth which is really the
 

9235
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:56,389
leave planet Earth which is really the
point of that video to show that it's

9236
02:45:56,389 --> 02:45:56,399
point of that video to show that it's
 

9237
02:45:56,399 --> 02:45:58,730
point of that video to show that it's
a color Chef type 1 civilization even

9238
02:45:58,730 --> 02:45:58,740
a color Chef type 1 civilization even
 

9239
02:45:58,740 --> 02:45:59,990
a color Chef type 1 civilization even
though it's defined as instant energy

9240
02:45:59,990 --> 02:46:00,000
though it's defined as instant energy
 

9241
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:03,590
though it's defined as instant energy
upon a planet that is not a species that

9242
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:03,600
upon a planet that is not a species that
 

9243
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:04,730
upon a planet that is not a species that
is going to still be living on their

9244
02:46:04,730 --> 02:46:04,740
is going to still be living on their
 

9245
02:46:04,740 --> 02:46:06,830
is going to still be living on their
Planet at least

9246
02:46:06,830 --> 02:46:06,840
Planet at least
 

9247
02:46:06,840 --> 02:46:08,750
Planet at least
um in isolation they will have to be

9248
02:46:08,750 --> 02:46:08,760
um in isolation they will have to be
 

9249
02:46:08,760 --> 02:46:10,910
um in isolation they will have to be
harvesting energy from afar there will

9250
02:46:10,910 --> 02:46:10,920
harvesting energy from afar there will
 

9251
02:46:10,920 --> 02:46:13,370
harvesting energy from afar there will
have to be you doing work on that energy

9252
02:46:13,370 --> 02:46:13,380
have to be you doing work on that energy
 

9253
02:46:13,380 --> 02:46:14,950
have to be you doing work on that energy
outside of their Planet because

9254
02:46:14,950 --> 02:46:14,960
outside of their Planet because
 

9255
02:46:14,960 --> 02:46:17,210
outside of their Planet because
otherwise you're going to dramatically

9256
02:46:17,210 --> 02:46:17,220
otherwise you're going to dramatically
 

9257
02:46:17,220 --> 02:46:18,889
otherwise you're going to dramatically
change the environment in which you live

9258
02:46:18,889 --> 02:46:18,899
change the environment in which you live
 

9259
02:46:18,899 --> 02:46:22,010
change the environment in which you live
well yeah so the the it's uh

9260
02:46:22,010 --> 02:46:22,020
well yeah so the the it's uh
 

9261
02:46:22,020 --> 02:46:23,809
well yeah so the the it's uh
the more energy you create the more

9262
02:46:23,809 --> 02:46:23,819
the more energy you create the more
 

9263
02:46:23,819 --> 02:46:26,030
the more energy you create the more
energy you use the more the higher the

02:46:27,590 --> 02:46:27,600
imperative to expand out into the
 

9267
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:29,150
imperative to expand out into the
universe but also not just imperative

9268
02:46:29,150 --> 02:46:29,160
universe but also not just imperative

uh so what what kind of uh space

9278
02:46:41,870 --> 02:46:41,880
uh so what what kind of uh space
 

9279
02:46:41,880 --> 02:46:44,030
uh so what what kind of uh space
architectures do you think we can build

9280
02:46:44,030 --> 02:46:44,040
architectures do you think we can build
 

9281
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:46,670
architectures do you think we can build
to house humans or interesting things

9282
02:46:46,670 --> 02:46:46,680
to house humans or interesting things
 

9283
02:46:46,680 --> 02:46:48,349
to house humans or interesting things
outside of Earth

outside of Earth
 

9285
02:46:48,359 --> 02:46:50,750
outside of Earth
yeah I mean there's there's a lot of fun

9286
02:46:50,750 --> 02:46:50,760
yeah I mean there's there's a lot of fun
 

9287
02:46:50,760 --> 02:46:52,550
yeah I mean there's there's a lot of fun
ideas here um one of the classic ideas

9288
02:46:52,550 --> 02:46:52,560
ideas here um one of the classic ideas
 

9289
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:55,190
ideas here um one of the classic ideas
is only or cylinder or a Stanford Taurus

9290
02:46:55,190 --> 02:46:55,200
is only or cylinder or a Stanford Taurus
 

9291
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:57,889
is only or cylinder or a Stanford Taurus
these are like two rotating structures

9292
02:46:57,889 --> 02:46:57,899
these are like two rotating structures
 

9293
02:46:57,899 --> 02:46:59,990
these are like two rotating structures
that were devised in space they're

9294
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,000
that were devised in space they're
 

9295
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,130
that were devised in space they're
basically

9296
02:47:01,130 --> 02:47:01,140
basically
 

9297
02:47:01,140 --> 02:47:03,170
basically
using the centrifugal force as

9298
02:47:03,170 --> 02:47:03,180
using the centrifugal force as
 

9299
02:47:03,180 --> 02:47:05,450
using the centrifugal force as
artificial gravity and so these are

9300
02:47:05,450 --> 02:47:05,460
artificial gravity and so these are
 

9301
02:47:05,460 --> 02:47:07,130
artificial gravity and so these are
structures which tend to be many

9302
02:47:07,130 --> 02:47:07,140
structures which tend to be many
 

9303
02:47:07,140 --> 02:47:08,630
structures which tend to be many
kilometers across that you're building

9304
02:47:08,630 --> 02:47:08,640
kilometers across that you're building
 

9305
02:47:08,640 --> 02:47:12,290
kilometers across that you're building
in space but could potentially habitat

9306
02:47:12,290 --> 02:47:12,300
in space but could potentially habitat
 

9307
02:47:12,300 --> 02:47:15,230
in space but could potentially habitat
um millions of people in in orbit of the

9308
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:15,240
um millions of people in in orbit of the
 

9309
02:47:15,240 --> 02:47:16,429
um millions of people in in orbit of the
earth

um of course you could imagine pulling

9312
02:47:18,110 --> 02:47:18,120
um of course you could imagine pulling
 

9313
02:47:18,120 --> 02:47:20,330
um of course you could imagine pulling
them if you you know the expanse does a

pretty good job I think of exploring the

9316
02:47:22,010 --> 02:47:22,020
pretty good job I think of exploring the
 

9317
02:47:22,020 --> 02:47:24,290
pretty good job I think of exploring the
idea of human exploration of the solar

9318
02:47:24,290 --> 02:47:24,300
idea of human exploration of the solar
 

9319
02:47:24,300 --> 02:47:27,290
idea of human exploration of the solar
system and having uh many objects many

02:47:35,030 --> 02:47:35,040
um one of the ideas we've played around
 

9327
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:37,010
um one of the ideas we've played around
with our group is this technology called

um an extension again we always tend to

9332
02:47:43,309 --> 02:47:43,319
um an extension again we always tend to
 

9333
02:47:43,319 --> 02:47:45,290
um an extension again we always tend to
extend previous ideas ideas build upon

9334
02:47:45,290 --> 02:47:45,300
extend previous ideas ideas build upon
 

9335
02:47:45,300 --> 02:47:47,510
extend previous ideas ideas build upon
ideas but an extensional idea called a

02:47:47,510 --> 02:47:47,520
ideas but an extensional idea called a
 

9337
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:50,870

02:47:50,870 --> 02:47:50,880
star type A statite was an idea proposed
 

9339
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:53,450
star type A statite was an idea proposed
I think by Ron forward in the 1970s

9340
02:47:53,450 --> 02:47:53,460
I think by Ron forward in the 1970s
 

9341
02:47:53,460 --> 02:47:55,490
I think by Ron forward in the 1970s
1970s seemed to have all sorts of wacky

9342
02:47:55,490 --> 02:47:55,500
1970s seemed to have all sorts of wacky
 

9343
02:47:55,500 --> 02:47:57,889
1970s seemed to have all sorts of wacky
ideas I don't know what's going on then

02:47:57,889 --> 02:47:57,899
ideas I don't know what's going on then
 

9345
02:47:57,899 --> 02:48:00,349

I think it's time for Taurus the O'Neill

9346
02:48:00,349 --> 02:48:00,359
I think it's time for Taurus the O'Neill
 

9347
02:48:00,359 --> 02:48:02,750
I think it's time for Taurus the O'Neill
cylinder status

9348
02:48:02,750 --> 02:48:02,760
cylinder status
 

9349
02:48:02,760 --> 02:48:04,670
cylinder status
um the the gravitational lens people

9350
02:48:04,670 --> 02:48:04,680
um the the gravitational lens people
 

9351
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:07,429
um the the gravitational lens people
were really having fun with dreaming

9352
02:48:07,429 --> 02:48:07,439
were really having fun with dreaming
 

9353
02:48:07,439 --> 02:48:10,490
were really having fun with dreaming
about space in the 70s the starter is is

9354
02:48:10,490 --> 02:48:10,500
about space in the 70s the starter is is
 

9355
02:48:10,500 --> 02:48:14,809
about space in the 70s the starter is is
basically a solar Sail but it's such an

9356
02:48:14,809 --> 02:48:14,819
basically a solar Sail but it's such an
 

9357
02:48:14,819 --> 02:48:16,790
basically a solar Sail but it's such an
efficient solar sail that the outward

9358
02:48:16,790 --> 02:48:16,800
efficient solar sail that the outward
 

9359
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:18,590
efficient solar sail that the outward
force of radiation pressure equals the

9360
02:48:18,590 --> 02:48:18,600
force of radiation pressure equals the
 

9361
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:20,809
force of radiation pressure equals the
inward force of gravity from the Sun and

9362
02:48:20,809 --> 02:48:20,819
inward force of gravity from the Sun and
 

9363
02:48:20,819 --> 02:48:23,450
inward force of gravity from the Sun and
so it doesn't need to orbit normally you

9364
02:48:23,450 --> 02:48:23,460
so it doesn't need to orbit normally you
 

9365
02:48:23,460 --> 02:48:25,550
so it doesn't need to orbit normally you
avoid the sun is pulling us right now

9366
02:48:25,550 --> 02:48:25,560
avoid the sun is pulling us right now
 

9367
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:27,410
avoid the sun is pulling us right now
through a force of gravity but we are

9368
02:48:27,410 --> 02:48:27,420
through a force of gravity but we are
 

9369
02:48:27,420 --> 02:48:29,809
through a force of gravity but we are
not we are not getting closer towards

9370
02:48:29,809 --> 02:48:29,819
not we are not getting closer towards
 

9371
02:48:29,819 --> 02:48:31,849
not we are not getting closer towards
the sun even though we are Falling

9372
02:48:31,849 --> 02:48:31,859
the sun even though we are Falling
 

9373
02:48:31,859 --> 02:48:33,230
the sun even though we are Falling
Towards the sun because we're in orbit

9374
02:48:33,230 --> 02:48:33,240
Towards the sun because we're in orbit
 

9375
02:48:33,240 --> 02:48:35,750
Towards the sun because we're in orbit
which means our translational speed is

9376
02:48:35,750 --> 02:48:35,760
which means our translational speed is
 

9377
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:37,010
which means our translational speed is
just enough to keep us at the same

9378
02:48:37,010 --> 02:48:37,020
just enough to keep us at the same
 

9379
02:48:37,020 --> 02:48:39,469
just enough to keep us at the same
altitude essentially from the Sun and so

9380
02:48:39,469 --> 02:48:39,479
altitude essentially from the Sun and so
 

9381
02:48:39,479 --> 02:48:40,910
altitude essentially from the Sun and so
you're in orbit and that's how you

9382
02:48:40,910 --> 02:48:40,920
you're in orbit and that's how you
 

9383
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:42,770
you're in orbit and that's how you
maintain distance a star type doesn't

9384
02:48:42,770 --> 02:48:42,780
maintain distance a star type doesn't
 

9385
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:44,410
maintain distance a star type doesn't
need to do that it could be basically

9386
02:48:44,410 --> 02:48:44,420
need to do that it could be basically
 

9387
02:48:44,420 --> 02:48:47,330
need to do that it could be basically
you know completely static in inertial

9388
02:48:47,330 --> 02:48:47,340
you know completely static in inertial
 

9389
02:48:47,340 --> 02:48:49,730
you know completely static in inertial
space but it's just balancing the two

9390
02:48:49,730 --> 02:48:49,740
space but it's just balancing the two
 

9391
02:48:49,740 --> 02:48:52,130
space but it's just balancing the two
forces of radiation pressure and inward

9392
02:48:52,130 --> 02:48:52,140
forces of radiation pressure and inward
 

9393
02:48:52,140 --> 02:48:54,710
forces of radiation pressure and inward
gravitational pressure a quasite is the

9394
02:48:54,710 --> 02:48:54,720
gravitational pressure a quasite is the
 

9395
02:48:54,720 --> 02:48:58,130
gravitational pressure a quasite is the
in-between of those two states so it's

9396
02:48:58,130 --> 02:48:58,140
in-between of those two states so it's
 

9397
02:48:58,140 --> 02:49:00,590
in-between of those two states so it's
it has some significant outward pressure

9398
02:49:00,590 --> 02:49:00,600
it has some significant outward pressure
 

9399
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:03,290
it has some significant outward pressure
but not enough to resist fully falling

9400
02:49:03,290 --> 02:49:03,300
but not enough to resist fully falling
 

9401
02:49:03,300 --> 02:49:05,389
but not enough to resist fully falling
into the star and so it compensates for

9402
02:49:05,389 --> 02:49:05,399
into the star and so it compensates for
 

9403
02:49:05,399 --> 02:49:07,309
into the star and so it compensates for
that by having some translational motion

9404
02:49:07,309 --> 02:49:07,319
that by having some translational motion
 

9405
02:49:07,319 --> 02:49:09,950
that by having some translational motion
so it's in between an orbit and a

9406
02:49:09,950 --> 02:49:09,960
so it's in between an orbit and a
 

9407
02:49:09,960 --> 02:49:12,349
so it's in between an orbit and a
statite and so what that allows you to

9408
02:49:12,349 --> 02:49:12,359
statite and so what that allows you to
 

9409
02:49:12,359 --> 02:49:15,170
statite and so what that allows you to
do is maintain artificial orbits so

9410
02:49:15,170 --> 02:49:15,180
do is maintain artificial orbits so
 

9411
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:16,550
do is maintain artificial orbits so
normally you you know if you want to

9412
02:49:16,550 --> 02:49:16,560
normally you you know if you want to
 

9413
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:17,870
normally you you know if you want to
calculate your orbital speed of

9414
02:49:17,870 --> 02:49:17,880
calculate your orbital speed of
 

9415
02:49:17,880 --> 02:49:20,330
calculate your orbital speed of
something at say half an au you would

9416
02:49:20,330 --> 02:49:20,340
something at say half an au you would
 

9417
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:21,889
something at say half an au you would
use Kepler's Third Law and go through

9418
02:49:21,889 --> 02:49:21,899
use Kepler's Third Law and go through
 

9419
02:49:21,899 --> 02:49:23,510
use Kepler's Third Law and go through
that and you say okay you know if it's

9420
02:49:23,510 --> 02:49:23,520
that and you say okay you know if it's
 

9421
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:25,730
that and you say okay you know if it's
at half an au I can calculate the period

9422
02:49:25,730 --> 02:49:25,740
at half an au I can calculate the period
 

9423
02:49:25,740 --> 02:49:27,590
at half an au I can calculate the period
by P squares proportional to a cubed and

9424
02:49:27,590 --> 02:49:27,600
by P squares proportional to a cubed and
 

9425
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:31,010
by P squares proportional to a cubed and
go through that but for a a quasi you

9426
02:49:31,010 --> 02:49:31,020
go through that but for a a quasi you
 

9427
02:49:31,020 --> 02:49:32,570
go through that but for a a quasi you
can basically have any speed you want

9428
02:49:32,570 --> 02:49:32,580
can basically have any speed you want
 

9429
02:49:32,580 --> 02:49:35,210
can basically have any speed you want
it's just a matter of how much uh how

9430
02:49:35,210 --> 02:49:35,220
it's just a matter of how much uh how
 

9431
02:49:35,220 --> 02:49:36,950
it's just a matter of how much uh how
much of the gravitational force are you

9432
02:49:36,950 --> 02:49:36,960
much of the gravitational force are you
 

9433
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:39,590
much of the gravitational force are you
balancing out you effectively enter an

9434
02:49:39,590 --> 02:49:39,600
balancing out you effectively enter an
 

9435
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:41,330
balancing out you effectively enter an
orbit where you're making the mass of

9436
02:49:41,330 --> 02:49:41,340
orbit where you're making the mass of
 

9437
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:42,950
orbit where you're making the mass of
the star be less massive than it really

9438
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:42,960
the star be less massive than it really
 

9439
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:45,650
the star be less massive than it really
is so it's as if you're orbiting a 0.1

9440
02:49:45,650 --> 02:49:45,660
is so it's as if you're orbiting a 0.1
 

9441
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:47,750
is so it's as if you're orbiting a 0.1
solar mass star or 0.2 solar mass star

9442
02:49:47,750 --> 02:49:47,760
solar mass star or 0.2 solar mass star
 

9443
02:49:47,760 --> 02:49:49,849
solar mass star or 0.2 solar mass star
or whatever you want and so that means

9444
02:49:49,849 --> 02:49:49,859
or whatever you want and so that means
 

9445
02:49:49,859 --> 02:49:52,790
or whatever you want and so that means
that Mercury orbits with a pretty fast

9446
02:49:52,790 --> 02:49:52,800
that Mercury orbits with a pretty fast
 

9447
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:55,429
that Mercury orbits with a pretty fast
gravitation a pretty fast orbital speed

9448
02:49:55,429 --> 02:49:55,439
gravitation a pretty fast orbital speed
 

9449
02:49:55,439 --> 02:49:57,950
gravitation a pretty fast orbital speed
around the sun because it's closer to

9450
02:49:57,950 --> 02:49:57,960
around the sun because it's closer to
 

9451
02:49:57,960 --> 02:49:59,750
around the sun because it's closer to
the Sun than we are but we could put

9452
02:49:59,750 --> 02:49:59,760
the Sun than we are but we could put
 

9453
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:02,150
the Sun than we are but we could put
something in Mercury's orbit that would

9454
02:50:02,150 --> 02:50:02,160
something in Mercury's orbit that would
 

9455
02:50:02,160 --> 02:50:03,830
something in Mercury's orbit that would
have a slower speed and so it would

9456
02:50:03,830 --> 02:50:03,840
have a slower speed and so it would
 

9457
02:50:03,840 --> 02:50:06,530
have a slower speed and so it would
co-track with the Earth and so we would

9458
02:50:06,530 --> 02:50:06,540
co-track with the Earth and so we would
 

9459
02:50:06,540 --> 02:50:08,929
co-track with the Earth and so we would
always be aligned with them at all times

9460
02:50:08,929 --> 02:50:08,939
always be aligned with them at all times
 

9461
02:50:08,939 --> 02:50:11,750
always be aligned with them at all times
and so this could be useful if you

9462
02:50:11,750 --> 02:50:11,760
and so this could be useful if you
 

9463
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:13,730
and so this could be useful if you
wanted to have a

9464
02:50:13,730 --> 02:50:13,740
wanted to have a
 

9465
02:50:13,740 --> 02:50:16,550
wanted to have a
um either a chain of colonies or

9466
02:50:16,550 --> 02:50:16,560
um either a chain of colonies or
 

9467
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:18,290
um either a chain of colonies or
something that were able to easily

9468
02:50:18,290 --> 02:50:18,300
something that were able to easily
 

9469
02:50:18,300 --> 02:50:22,010
something that were able to easily
communicate and Tran and uh and move

9470
02:50:22,010 --> 02:50:22,020
communicate and Tran and uh and move
 

9471
02:50:22,020 --> 02:50:23,330
communicate and Tran and uh and move
between one another between these

9472
02:50:23,330 --> 02:50:23,340
between one another between these
 

9473
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:25,130
between one another between these
different bases you'd probably use

9474
02:50:25,130 --> 02:50:25,140
different bases you'd probably use
 

9475
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:27,710
different bases you'd probably use
something like this to maintain that uh

9476
02:50:27,710 --> 02:50:27,720
something like this to maintain that uh
 

9477
02:50:27,720 --> 02:50:31,010
something like this to maintain that uh
easy transferability or you could even

9478
02:50:31,010 --> 02:50:31,020
easy transferability or you could even
 

9479
02:50:31,020 --> 02:50:33,770
easy transferability or you could even
use it as a a space weather monitoring

9480
02:50:33,770 --> 02:50:33,780
use it as a a space weather monitoring
 

9481
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:35,450
use it as a a space weather monitoring

02:50:39,410 --> 02:50:39,420
we know that uh major events like the
 

9487
02:50:39,420 --> 02:50:40,849
we know that uh major events like the
Carrington event that happen you know

Carrington event that happen you know
 

9489
02:50:40,859 --> 02:50:42,349
Carrington event that happen you know
can knock out all of electromagnetic

02:50:47,809 --> 02:50:47,819
could do that a geometric storm but if
 

9495
02:50:47,819 --> 02:50:51,290
could do that a geometric storm but if
we had the ability to detect those uh

9496
02:50:51,290 --> 02:50:51,300
we had the ability to detect those uh

um the problem is they travel obviously

9502
02:50:57,170 --> 02:50:57,180
um the problem is they travel obviously
 

9503
02:50:57,180 --> 02:50:58,849
um the problem is they travel obviously
pretty fast and so it's hard to get

9504
02:50:58,849 --> 02:50:58,859
pretty fast and so it's hard to get
 

9505
02:50:58,859 --> 02:51:00,469
pretty fast and so it's hard to get
ahead of them but you could have a

02:51:00,469 --> 02:51:00,479
ahead of them but you could have a
 

9507
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:01,790

anything suspicious
 

9515
02:51:06,439 --> 02:51:08,690
anything suspicious
magnetically it could then send that

9516
02:51:08,690 --> 02:51:08,700
magnetically it could then send that
 

9517
02:51:08,700 --> 02:51:10,010

9521
02:51:11,460 --> 02:51:14,090

something bad was coming you should shut
 

9527
02:51:16,740 --> 02:51:19,250
something bad was coming you should shut
off all your systems or get in your

02:51:19,250 --> 02:51:19,260
off all your systems or get in your
 

9529
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:21,130
off all your systems or get in your
Faraday cage now and protect yourself

9530
02:51:21,130 --> 02:51:21,140
Faraday cage now and protect yourself
 

9531
02:51:21,140 --> 02:51:23,570

and so these These cryosites are kind of

9532
02:51:23,570 --> 02:51:23,580
and so these These cryosites are kind of
 

9533

to do something you know it that's why
 

9559
02:51:53,580 --> 02:51:54,950
to do something you know it that's why
you always think solar energy is so

9560
02:51:54,950 --> 02:51:54,960
you always think solar energy is so
 

9561
02:51:54,960 --> 02:51:57,110
you always think solar energy is so
powerful because in the battle against

nuclear fusion nuclear fusion you're
 

9565
02:51:58,859 --> 02:52:00,410
nuclear fusion nuclear fusion you're
really fighting a battle where you're

9566
02:52:00,410 --> 02:52:00,420
really fighting a battle where you're
 

9567
02:52:00,420 --> 02:52:02,090
really fighting a battle where you're
trying to confine plasma into this

trying to confine plasma into this
 

9569

trying to confine plasma into this
extremely tight space or

02:52:04,439 --> 02:52:07,250
extremely tight space or
um it's the sun does this for free it

9572
02:52:07,250 --> 02:52:07,260
um it's the sun does this for free it
 

9573
02:52:07,260 --> 02:52:09,769
um it's the sun does this for free it
has gravitation and so

9574
02:52:09,769 --> 02:52:09,779
has gravitation and so
 

9575
02:52:09,779 --> 02:52:11,929
has gravitation and so
that's the the arson Essence what a

9576
02:52:11,929 --> 02:52:11,939
that's the the arson Essence what a
 

9577
02:52:11,939 --> 02:52:13,849
that's the the arson Essence what a
solar panel does it's exp it is a

9578
02:52:13,849 --> 02:52:13,859
solar panel does it's exp it is a
 

9579
02:52:13,859 --> 02:52:16,730
solar panel does it's exp it is a
nuclear fusion reactor fueled Energy

9580
02:52:16,730 --> 02:52:16,740
nuclear fusion reactor fueled Energy
 

9581
02:52:16,740 --> 02:52:19,429
nuclear fusion reactor fueled Energy
System but it's just using gravitation

9582
02:52:19,429 --> 02:52:19,439
System but it's just using gravitation
 

9583
02:52:19,439 --> 02:52:22,370
System but it's just using gravitation
for the confinement and having a huge

9584
02:52:22,370 --> 02:52:22,380
for the confinement and having a huge
 

9585
02:52:22,380 --> 02:52:23,570
for the confinement and having a huge
standoff distance for its energy

9586
02:52:23,570 --> 02:52:23,580
standoff distance for its energy
 

9587
02:52:23,580 --> 02:52:26,210
standoff distance for its energy
collection and so

9588
02:52:26,210 --> 02:52:26,220
collection and so
 

9589
02:52:26,220 --> 02:52:28,610
collection and so
um there are tricks like that it's very

9590
02:52:28,610 --> 02:52:28,620
um there are tricks like that it's very
 

9591
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:31,010
um there are tricks like that it's very
naive simple trick in that case where we

9592
02:52:31,010 --> 02:52:31,020
naive simple trick in that case where we
 

9593
02:52:31,020 --> 02:52:33,590
naive simple trick in that case where we
can rather have to reinvent the wheel we

9594
02:52:33,590 --> 02:52:33,600
can rather have to reinvent the wheel we
 

9595
02:52:33,600 --> 02:52:35,870
can rather have to reinvent the wheel we
can use the space infrastructure if you

9596
02:52:35,870 --> 02:52:35,880
can use the space infrastructure if you
 

9597
02:52:35,880 --> 02:52:37,550
can use the space infrastructure if you
like the astrophysical infrastructure

9598
02:52:37,550 --> 02:52:37,560
like the astrophysical infrastructure
 

9599
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:39,349
like the astrophysical infrastructure
that's already there to our benefit yeah

9600
02:52:39,349 --> 02:52:39,359
that's already there to our benefit yeah
 

9601
02:52:39,359 --> 02:52:42,230
that's already there to our benefit yeah
I think in the long Arc of human history

9602
02:52:42,230 --> 02:52:42,240
I think in the long Arc of human history
 

9603
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:44,510
I think in the long Arc of human history
probably natural phenomena is the right

9604
02:52:44,510 --> 02:52:44,520
probably natural phenomena is the right
 

9605
02:52:44,520 --> 02:52:46,550
probably natural phenomena is the right
Solution that's the simple that's the

9606
02:52:46,550 --> 02:52:46,560
Solution that's the simple that's the
 

9607
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:47,690
Solution that's the simple that's the
elegant solution because all the power

9608
02:52:47,690 --> 02:52:47,700
elegant solution because all the power
 

9609
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:49,370
elegant solution because all the power
is already there that's why it Dyson

9610
02:52:49,370 --> 02:52:49,380
is already there that's why it Dyson
 

9611
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:51,110
is already there that's why it Dyson
Sphere in the long

9612
02:52:51,110 --> 02:52:51,120
Sphere in the long
 

9613
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:52,790
Sphere in the long
sort of

9614
02:52:52,790 --> 02:52:52,800
sort of
 

9615
02:52:52,800 --> 02:52:54,469
sort of
but you don't know what a dices field

9616
02:52:54,469 --> 02:52:54,479
but you don't know what a dices field
 

9617
02:52:54,479 --> 02:52:56,929
but you don't know what a dices field
would look like but some kind of thing

9618
02:52:56,929 --> 02:52:56,939
would look like but some kind of thing
 

9619
02:52:56,939 --> 02:52:58,849
would look like but some kind of thing
that leverages the power the energy

9620
02:52:58,849 --> 02:52:58,859
that leverages the power the energy
 

9621
02:52:58,859 --> 02:53:00,650
that leverages the power the energy
that's already in the sun is is better

9622
02:53:00,650 --> 02:53:00,660
that's already in the sun is is better
 

9623
02:53:00,660 --> 02:53:04,250
that's already in the sun is is better
than creating artificial nuclear uh

9624
02:53:04,250 --> 02:53:04,260
than creating artificial nuclear uh
 

9625
02:53:04,260 --> 02:53:06,730
than creating artificial nuclear uh
fusion reaction but then again

9626
02:53:06,730 --> 02:53:06,740
fusion reaction but then again
 

9627
02:53:06,740 --> 02:53:10,309
fusion reaction but then again
that brings us to the topic of AI how

9628
02:53:10,309 --> 02:53:10,319
that brings us to the topic of AI how
 

9629
02:53:10,319 --> 02:53:12,230
that brings us to the topic of AI how
much of this

9630
02:53:12,230 --> 02:53:12,240
much of this
 

9631
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:15,309
much of this
if we're traveling out there

9632
02:53:15,309 --> 02:53:15,319
if we're traveling out there
 

9633
02:53:15,319 --> 02:53:18,650
if we're traveling out there
Interstellar travel or um

9634
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:18,660
Interstellar travel or um
 

9635
02:53:18,660 --> 02:53:20,030
Interstellar travel or um
doing some of the interesting things

9636
02:53:20,030 --> 02:53:20,040
doing some of the interesting things
 

9637
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:22,610
doing some of the interesting things
we'll be talking about how much

9638
02:53:22,610 --> 02:53:22,620
we'll be talking about how much
 

9639
02:53:22,620 --> 02:53:25,130
we'll be talking about how much
of those ships would be occupied by AI

9640
02:53:25,130 --> 02:53:25,140
of those ships would be occupied by AI
 

9641
02:53:25,140 --> 02:53:27,410
of those ships would be occupied by AI
systems do you think

9642
02:53:27,410 --> 02:53:27,420
systems do you think
 

9643
02:53:27,420 --> 02:53:31,490
systems do you think
what would the

9644
02:53:31,490 --> 02:53:31,500

 

9645
02:53:31,500 --> 02:53:33,469

what would be the living organisms

9646
02:53:33,469 --> 02:53:33,479
what would be the living organisms
 

9647
02:53:33,479 --> 02:53:36,889
what would be the living organisms
occupying those ships

9648
02:53:36,889 --> 02:53:36,899

 

9649
02:53:36,899 --> 02:53:39,530

yeah it it's depressing to think about

9650
02:53:39,530 --> 02:53:39,540
yeah it it's depressing to think about
 

9651
02:53:39,540 --> 02:53:42,710
yeah it it's depressing to think about
AI in the search for life because

9652
02:53:42,710 --> 02:53:42,720
AI in the search for life because
 

9653
02:53:42,720 --> 02:53:43,849
AI in the search for life because
they had I mean I've been thinking about

9654
02:53:43,849 --> 02:53:43,859
they had I mean I've been thinking about
 

9655
02:53:43,859 --> 02:53:45,650
they had I mean I've been thinking about
this over the last few weeks with

9656
02:53:45,650 --> 02:53:45,660
this over the last few weeks with
 

9657
02:53:45,660 --> 02:53:47,809
this over the last few weeks with
playing around with chat gbt3 like many

9658
02:53:47,809 --> 02:53:47,819
playing around with chat gbt3 like many
 

9659
02:53:47,819 --> 02:53:49,490
playing around with chat gbt3 like many
of us and being astonished with its

9660
02:53:49,490 --> 02:53:49,500
of us and being astonished with its
 

9661
02:53:49,500 --> 02:53:52,730
of us and being astonished with its
capabilities and you see that it that

9662
02:53:52,730 --> 02:53:52,740
capabilities and you see that it that
 

9663
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:54,290
capabilities and you see that it that
our society

9664
02:53:54,290 --> 02:53:54,300
our society
 

9665
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:58,309
our society
is undergoing a change that seems

9666
02:53:58,309 --> 02:53:58,319
is undergoing a change that seems
 

9667
02:53:58,319 --> 02:53:59,990
is undergoing a change that seems
significant in terms of the development

9668
02:53:59,990 --> 02:54:00,000
significant in terms of the development
 

9669
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,269
significant in terms of the development
of artificiality we've been promised

9670
02:54:02,269 --> 02:54:02,279
of artificiality we've been promised
 

9671
02:54:02,279 --> 02:54:04,910
of artificiality we've been promised
this revolution this Singularity for a

9672
02:54:04,910 --> 02:54:04,920
this revolution this Singularity for a
 

9673
02:54:04,920 --> 02:54:07,010
this revolution this Singularity for a
long time but it really seems to be

9674
02:54:07,010 --> 02:54:07,020
long time but it really seems to be
 

9675
02:54:07,020 --> 02:54:10,370
long time but it really seems to be
stepping up its uh its pace of

9676
02:54:10,370 --> 02:54:10,380
stepping up its uh its pace of
 

9677
02:54:10,380 --> 02:54:13,250
stepping up its uh its pace of
development at this point and so that's

9678
02:54:13,250 --> 02:54:13,260
development at this point and so that's
 

9679
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:16,370
development at this point and so that's
interesting because as someone who looks

9680
02:54:16,370 --> 02:54:16,380
interesting because as someone who looks
 

9681
02:54:16,380 --> 02:54:19,969
interesting because as someone who looks
freely in life out there in the universe

9682
02:54:19,969 --> 02:54:19,979
freely in life out there in the universe
 

9683
02:54:19,979 --> 02:54:22,610
freely in life out there in the universe
um it sort of implies that our current

9684
02:54:22,610 --> 02:54:22,620
um it sort of implies that our current
 

9685
02:54:22,620 --> 02:54:25,610
um it sort of implies that our current
stage development is highly transitional

9686
02:54:25,610 --> 02:54:25,620
stage development is highly transitional
 

9687
02:54:25,620 --> 02:54:27,170
stage development is highly transitional
and that

9688
02:54:27,170 --> 02:54:27,180
and that
 

9689
02:54:27,180 --> 02:54:28,910
and that
you know you go back for the last four

9690
02:54:28,910 --> 02:54:28,920
you know you go back for the last four
 

9691
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:30,889
you know you go back for the last four
and a half billion years the the planet

9692
02:54:30,889 --> 02:54:30,899
and a half billion years the the planet
 

9693
02:54:30,899 --> 02:54:34,130
and a half billion years the the planet
was dumb essentially if you go back uh

9694
02:54:34,130 --> 02:54:34,140
was dumb essentially if you go back uh
 

9695
02:54:34,140 --> 02:54:35,570
was dumb essentially if you go back uh
that's a few thousand years there was a

9696
02:54:35,570 --> 02:54:35,580
that's a few thousand years there was a
 

9697
02:54:35,580 --> 02:54:36,469
that's a few thousand years there was a
civilization but it wasn't really

9698
02:54:36,469 --> 02:54:36,479
civilization but it wasn't really
 

9699
02:54:36,479 --> 02:54:38,510
civilization but it wasn't really
producing any technical signatures and

9700
02:54:38,510 --> 02:54:38,520
producing any technical signatures and
 

9701
02:54:38,520 --> 02:54:39,950
producing any technical signatures and
then over the last maybe 100 years

9702
02:54:39,950 --> 02:54:39,960
then over the last maybe 100 years
 

9703
02:54:39,960 --> 02:54:41,330
then over the last maybe 100 years
there's been something that might be

9704
02:54:41,330 --> 02:54:41,340
there's been something that might be
 

9705
02:54:41,340 --> 02:54:43,190
there's been something that might be
detectable from afar

9706
02:54:43,190 --> 02:54:43,200
detectable from afar
 

9707
02:54:43,200 --> 02:54:46,429
detectable from afar
but we're approaching this cusp where we

9708
02:54:46,429 --> 02:54:46,439
but we're approaching this cusp where we
 

9709
02:54:46,439 --> 02:54:48,830
but we're approaching this cusp where we
might imagine it I mean we're thinking

9710
02:54:48,830 --> 02:54:48,840
might imagine it I mean we're thinking
 

9711
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:50,929
might imagine it I mean we're thinking
of like maybe years and decades with AI

9712
02:54:50,929 --> 02:54:50,939
of like maybe years and decades with AI
 

9713
02:54:50,939 --> 02:54:52,550
of like maybe years and decades with AI
development typically when we talk about

9714
02:54:52,550 --> 02:54:52,560
development typically when we talk about
 

9715
02:54:52,560 --> 02:54:54,590
development typically when we talk about
this but as an astronomer I have to

9716
02:54:54,590 --> 02:54:54,600
this but as an astronomer I have to
 

9717
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:56,330
this but as an astronomer I have to
think about much longer time scares of

9718
02:54:56,330 --> 02:54:56,340
think about much longer time scares of
 

9719
02:54:56,340 --> 02:54:59,210
think about much longer time scares of
centuries Millennia millions of years

9720
02:54:59,210 --> 02:54:59,220
centuries Millennia millions of years
 

9721
02:54:59,220 --> 02:55:01,370
centuries Millennia millions of years
and so if this

9722
02:55:01,370 --> 02:55:01,380
and so if this
 

9723
02:55:01,380 --> 02:55:04,070
and so if this
if this wave continues over that time

9724
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:04,080
if this wave continues over that time
 

9725
02:55:04,080 --> 02:55:06,230
if this wave continues over that time
scale which is still the blink of an eye

9726
02:55:06,230 --> 02:55:06,240
scale which is still the blink of an eye
 

9727
02:55:06,240 --> 02:55:08,030
scale which is still the blink of an eye
on a cosmic time scale

9728
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:08,040
on a cosmic time scale
 

9729
02:55:08,040 --> 02:55:10,250
on a cosmic time scale
that implies that

9730
02:55:10,250 --> 02:55:10,260
that implies that
 

9731
02:55:10,260 --> 02:55:12,050
that implies that
everything will be AI essentially out

9732
02:55:12,050 --> 02:55:12,060
everything will be AI essentially out
 

9733
02:55:12,060 --> 02:55:14,269
everything will be AI essentially out
there if this is a common behavior and

9734
02:55:14,269 --> 02:55:14,279
there if this is a common behavior and
 

9735
02:55:14,279 --> 02:55:16,130
there if this is a common behavior and
so that's intriguing because it sort of

right this would be the time that you

9784
02:56:10,969 --> 02:56:10,979
right this would be the time that you
 

9785
02:56:10,979 --> 02:56:13,849
right this would be the time that you
would want to study a civilization very

9786

would want to study a civilization very

carefully you wouldn't want to interfere
 

9789
02:56:15,240 --> 02:56:17,690
carefully you wouldn't want to interfere
with it you would just want to see how

9790
02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:17,700
with it you would just want to see how
 

9791
02:56:17,700 --> 02:56:20,150
with it you would just want to see how
it plays out kind of similar to the

about the simulation argument that you

9796
02:56:23,690 --> 02:56:23,700
about the simulation argument that you
 

9797
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:25,969
about the simulation argument that you
are able to observe perhaps your own

9798
02:56:25,969 --> 02:56:25,979
are able to observe perhaps your own

Origins and study how the transformation
happens and so yeah that has for me

9802
02:56:30,889 --> 02:56:30,899
happens and so yeah that has for me

02:57:12,060 --> 02:57:14,750
the busy stuff we're doing
to do the hard work of learning so like

02:57:14,750 --> 02:57:14,760
to do the hard work of learning so like
 

9843
02:57:14,760 --> 02:57:17,389
to do the hard work of learning so like
uh the language models are trained on

output of brain power from humans and so
 

9853
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:32,929

02:58:21,300 --> 02:58:23,570
we think of as Consciousness is that

artificial systems is that the thing

9900
02:58:25,309 --> 02:58:25,319
artificial systems is that the thing
 

9901
02:58:25,319 --> 02:58:27,349
artificial systems is that the thing
that makes us fundamentally human

9902
02:58:27,349 --> 02:58:27,359
that makes us fundamentally human
 

9903
02:58:27,359 --> 02:58:29,570
that makes us fundamentally human
or is it just a side effect

9904
02:58:29,570 --> 02:58:29,580
or is it just a side effect
 

9905
02:58:29,580 --> 02:58:31,550
or is it just a side effect
that we attribute way too much

9906
02:58:31,550 --> 02:58:31,560
that we attribute way too much
 

9907
02:58:31,560 --> 02:58:33,830
that we attribute way too much

I mean there's I guess we're talking

9932
02:59:00,050 --> 02:59:00,060
I mean there's I guess we're talking
 

9933
02:59:00,060 --> 02:59:01,130
I mean there's I guess we're talking
about the difference here between sort

9934
02:59:01,130 --> 02:59:01,140
about the difference here between sort

intelligence or Consciousness which are
 

9939
02:59:05,700 --> 02:59:08,630
intelligence or Consciousness which are
distinct ideas and you can certainly

9940
02:59:08,630 --> 02:59:08,640
distinct ideas and you can certainly
 

9941
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:10,130
distinct ideas and you can certainly
have one without the other so I couldn't

9942
02:59:10,130 --> 02:59:10,140
have one without the other so I couldn't
 

9943
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:11,570
have one without the other so I couldn't
imagine I would I would disagree with

9944
02:59:11,570 --> 02:59:11,580
imagine I would I would disagree with
 

9945
02:59:11,580 --> 02:59:13,429
imagine I would I would disagree with
this certainly in that statement okay

9946
02:59:13,429 --> 02:59:13,439
this certainly in that statement okay
 

9947
02:59:13,439 --> 02:59:15,950
this certainly in that statement okay
okay I I think it's very possible in

9948
02:59:15,950 --> 02:59:15,960
okay I I think it's very possible in
 

9949
02:59:15,960 --> 02:59:17,210
okay I I think it's very possible in
order to have intelligence you have to

9950
02:59:17,210 --> 02:59:17,220
order to have intelligence you have to
 

9951
02:59:17,220 --> 02:59:18,650
order to have intelligence you have to
have consciousness

9952
02:59:18,650 --> 02:59:18,660
have consciousness
 

9953
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:21,469
have consciousness
okay well I mean to a certain degree

9954
02:59:21,469 --> 02:59:21,479
okay well I mean to a certain degree
 

9955
02:59:21,479 --> 02:59:23,990
okay well I mean to a certain degree
chat gbt3 has a level of intelligence

9956
02:59:23,990 --> 02:59:24,000
chat gbt3 has a level of intelligence
 

9957
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,030
chat gbt3 has a level of intelligence
already it's not a general intelligence

9958
02:59:26,030 --> 02:59:26,040
already it's not a general intelligence
 

9959
02:59:26,040 --> 02:59:28,490
already it's not a general intelligence
but it displays properties of

9960
02:59:28,490 --> 02:59:28,500
but it displays properties of
 

9961
02:59:28,500 --> 02:59:30,950
but it displays properties of
intelligence with with no consciousness

9962
02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:30,960
intelligence with with no consciousness
 

9963
02:59:30,960 --> 02:59:34,870
intelligence with with no consciousness
so again I would disagree okay okay well

9964
02:59:34,870 --> 02:59:34,880
so again I would disagree okay okay well
 

9965
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:38,150
so again I would disagree okay okay well
I I don't I don't I don't know because

9966
02:59:38,150 --> 02:59:38,160
I I don't I don't I don't know because
 

9967
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:40,790
I I don't I don't I don't know because
you said it's very nasty you said it

9968
02:59:40,790 --> 02:59:40,800
you said it's very nasty you said it
 

9969
02:59:40,800 --> 02:59:43,730
you said it's very nasty you said it
displays properties of intelligence in

9970
02:59:43,730 --> 02:59:43,740
displays properties of intelligence in
 

9971
02:59:43,740 --> 02:59:45,110
displays properties of intelligence in
the same way displaced properties of

9972
02:59:45,110 --> 02:59:45,120
the same way displaced properties of
 

9973
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:47,150
the same way displaced properties of
intelligence I would say it's starting

9974
02:59:47,150 --> 02:59:47,160
intelligence I would say it's starting
 

9975
02:59:47,160 --> 02:59:49,070
intelligence I would say it's starting
to display properties of Consciousness

9976
02:59:49,070 --> 02:59:49,080
to display properties of Consciousness
 

9977
02:59:49,080 --> 02:59:50,750
to display properties of Consciousness
it certainly could fool you that it's

9978
02:59:50,750 --> 02:59:50,760
it certainly could fool you that it's
 

9979
02:59:50,760 --> 02:59:51,769
it certainly could fool you that it's
conscious

9980
02:59:51,769 --> 02:59:51,779
conscious
 

9981
02:59:51,779 --> 02:59:54,349
conscious
correct yeah there's I guess like a a

9982
02:59:54,349 --> 02:59:54,359
correct yeah there's I guess like a a
 

9983
02:59:54,359 --> 02:59:56,990
correct yeah there's I guess like a a
Turing test problem like if it's

9984
02:59:56,990 --> 02:59:57,000
Turing test problem like if it's
 

9985
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:58,969
Turing test problem like if it's
displaying all those properties

9986
02:59:58,969 --> 02:59:58,979
displaying all those properties
 

9987
02:59:58,979 --> 03:00:01,130
displaying all those properties
if it quacks like a parent looks like a

9988
03:00:01,130 --> 03:00:01,140
if it quacks like a parent looks like a
 

9989
03:00:01,140 --> 03:00:02,889
if it quacks like a parent looks like a
parent or cracks like a duck things like

9990
03:00:02,889 --> 03:00:02,899
parent or cracks like a duck things like
 

9991
03:00:02,899 --> 03:00:04,910
parent or cracks like a duck things like
isn't it basically a duck at that point

9992
03:00:04,910 --> 03:00:04,920
isn't it basically a duck at that point
 

9993
03:00:04,920 --> 03:00:07,490
isn't it basically a duck at that point
so yeah I can see that argument

9994
03:00:07,490 --> 03:00:07,500
so yeah I can see that argument
 

9995
03:00:07,500 --> 03:00:10,730
so yeah I can see that argument
um it probably

9996
03:00:10,730 --> 03:00:10,740
um it probably
 

9997
03:00:10,740 --> 03:00:12,830
um it probably
it I mean certainly isn't it I tried to

9998
03:00:12,830 --> 03:00:12,840
it I mean certainly isn't it I tried to
 

9999
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:15,050
it I mean certainly isn't it I tried to
think about it from the observer's point

10000
03:00:15,050 --> 03:00:15,060
think about it from the observer's point
 

10001
03:00:15,060 --> 03:00:16,730
think about it from the observer's point
of view as an astronomer what am I

10002
03:00:16,730 --> 03:00:16,740
of view as an astronomer what am I
 

10003
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:20,269
of view as an astronomer what am I
looking for whether that intelligence is

10004
03:00:20,269 --> 03:00:20,279
looking for whether that intelligence is
 

10005
03:00:20,279 --> 03:00:23,990
looking for whether that intelligence is
conscious or not has little bearing I

10006
03:00:23,990 --> 03:00:24,000
conscious or not has little bearing I
 

10007
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:27,050
conscious or not has little bearing I
think as to what I should be looking for

10008
03:00:27,050 --> 03:00:27,060
think as to what I should be looking for
 

10009
03:00:27,060 --> 03:00:29,690
think as to what I should be looking for
when I'm trying to detect evidence of

10010
03:00:29,690 --> 03:00:29,700
when I'm trying to detect evidence of
 

10011
03:00:29,700 --> 03:00:30,469
when I'm trying to detect evidence of
them

10012
03:00:30,469 --> 03:00:30,479
them
 

10013
03:00:30,479 --> 03:00:34,730
them
it would maybe affect their behavior in

10014
03:00:34,730 --> 03:00:34,740
it would maybe affect their behavior in
 

10015
03:00:34,740 --> 03:00:37,670
it would maybe affect their behavior in
ways that I can't predict

10016
03:00:37,670 --> 03:00:37,680
ways that I can't predict
 

10017
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:40,010
ways that I can't predict
um but that's again getting into the

10018
03:00:40,010 --> 03:00:40,020
um but that's again getting into the
 

10019
03:00:40,020 --> 03:00:41,090
um but that's again getting into the
game of what I would cause you know

10020
03:00:41,090 --> 03:00:41,100
game of what I would cause you know
 

10021
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:43,429
game of what I would cause you know

10031
03:00:52,140 --> 03:00:55,130
intelligence it's unfathomable what its
intentions may be I mean I would sort of

10032
03:00:55,130 --> 03:00:55,140
intentions may be I mean I would sort of
 

10033
03:00:55,140 --> 03:00:56,210
intentions may be I mean I would sort of
question whether it would even be

03:00:56,210 --> 03:00:56,220
question whether it would even be

then it's probably going to have a

trying to increase computer substrate

10056
03:01:18,950 --> 03:01:18,960
trying to increase computer substrate
 

10057
03:01:18,960 --> 03:01:20,570
trying to increase computer substrate
Across the Universe

10058
03:01:20,570 --> 03:01:20,580
Across the Universe
 

10059
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:23,090
Across the Universe
and that of course if that is its

10060
03:01:23,090 --> 03:01:23,100
and that of course if that is its
 

10061
03:01:23,100 --> 03:01:24,769
and that of course if that is its
principal intention to just essentially

10062
03:01:24,769 --> 03:01:24,779
principal intention to just essentially
 

10063
03:01:24,779 --> 03:01:26,750
principal intention to just essentially
convert dumb matter into smart matter as

10064
03:01:26,750 --> 03:01:26,760
convert dumb matter into smart matter as
 

10065
03:01:26,760 --> 03:01:28,969
convert dumb matter into smart matter as
it goes then

10066
03:01:28,969 --> 03:01:28,979
it goes then
 

10067
03:01:28,979 --> 03:01:30,830
it goes then
I think that would come into conflict

10068
03:01:30,830 --> 03:01:30,840
I think that would come into conflict
 

10069
03:01:30,840 --> 03:01:32,330
I think that would come into conflict
with our observations of the universe

10070
03:01:32,330 --> 03:01:32,340
with our observations of the universe
 

10071
03:01:32,340 --> 03:01:33,769
with our observations of the universe
right because

10072
03:01:33,769 --> 03:01:33,779
right because
 

10073
03:01:33,779 --> 03:01:36,290
right because
the the Earth shouldn't be here if that

10074
03:01:36,290 --> 03:01:36,300
the the Earth shouldn't be here if that
 

10075
03:01:36,300 --> 03:01:37,790
the the Earth shouldn't be here if that
were true the Earth should have been

10076
03:01:37,790 --> 03:01:37,800
were true the Earth should have been
 

10077
03:01:37,800 --> 03:01:39,769
were true the Earth should have been
transformed into computer substrate by

10079
03:01:39,779 --> 03:01:41,809

this point there has been plenty of time

10080
03:01:41,809 --> 03:01:41,819
this point there has been plenty of time
 

10081
03:01:41,819 --> 03:01:43,849
this point there has been plenty of time
yeah in the history of the Galaxy for

10082
03:01:43,849 --> 03:01:43,859
yeah in the history of the Galaxy for
 

10083
03:01:43,859 --> 03:01:45,530
yeah in the history of the Galaxy for
that to have happened

10084
03:01:45,530 --> 03:01:45,540
that to have happened
 

10085
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:47,630
that to have happened
um so I'm skeptical

10086
03:01:47,630 --> 03:01:47,640
um so I'm skeptical
 

10087
03:01:47,640 --> 03:01:50,630
um so I'm skeptical
that we can uh

10088
03:01:50,630 --> 03:01:50,640
that we can uh
 

10089
03:01:50,640 --> 03:01:53,030
that we can uh
I'm skeptical in the part that that's a

10090
03:01:53,030 --> 03:01:53,040
I'm skeptical in the part that that's a
 

10091
03:01:53,040 --> 03:01:55,490
I'm skeptical in the part that that's a
behavior that AI or any civilization

10092
03:01:55,490 --> 03:01:55,500
behavior that AI or any civilization
 

10093
03:01:55,500 --> 03:01:58,010
behavior that AI or any civilization
really engages in but I also find it

10094
03:01:58,010 --> 03:01:58,020
really engages in but I also find it
 

10095
03:01:58,020 --> 03:02:00,349
really engages in but I also find it
difficult to find a way out of it

10096
03:02:00,349 --> 03:02:00,359
difficult to find a way out of it
 

10097
03:02:00,359 --> 03:02:03,469
difficult to find a way out of it
to explain why that would never happen

10098
03:02:03,469 --> 03:02:03,479
to explain why that would never happen
 

10099
03:02:03,479 --> 03:02:04,730
to explain why that would never happen
in the entire history of the Galaxy

10100
03:02:04,730 --> 03:02:04,740
in the entire history of the Galaxy
 

10101
03:02:04,740 --> 03:02:06,849
in the entire history of the Galaxy

10104
03:02:09,710 --> 03:02:09,720

03:02:09,720 --> 03:02:11,870

instantiations of AI could have occurred

10106
03:02:11,870 --> 03:02:11,880
instantiations of AI could have occurred
 

10107
03:02:11,880 --> 03:02:13,969

across the Galaxy

10108
03:02:13,969 --> 03:02:13,979
across the Galaxy
 

10109
03:02:13,979 --> 03:02:15,950
across the Galaxy
um and so that seems to be a knock

10110
03:02:15,950 --> 03:02:15,960
um and so that seems to be a knock
 

10111
03:02:15,960 --> 03:02:19,610
um and so that seems to be a knock
against the idea that there is life else

10112
03:02:19,610 --> 03:02:19,620
against the idea that there is life else
 

10113
03:02:19,620 --> 03:02:21,710
against the idea that there is life else
or intelligent life elsewhere in the in

10114
03:02:21,710 --> 03:02:21,720
or intelligent life elsewhere in the in
 

10115
03:02:21,720 --> 03:02:24,170
or intelligent life elsewhere in the in
the Galaxy the fact that that hasn't

10116
03:02:24,170 --> 03:02:24,180
the Galaxy the fact that that hasn't
 

10117
03:02:24,180 --> 03:02:27,230
the Galaxy the fact that that hasn't
occurred in our history is maybe the

10118
03:02:27,230 --> 03:02:27,240
occurred in our history is maybe the
 

10119
03:02:27,240 --> 03:02:29,510
occurred in our history is maybe the
only solid data point we really have

10120
03:02:29,510 --> 03:02:29,520
only solid data point we really have
 

10121
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:31,429
only solid data point we really have
about the activities of other

of course the scary one could be that um

03:02:36,290 --> 03:02:36,300
of course the scary one could be that um
 

10127

03:03:57,290 --> 03:03:57,300
ourselves so maybe that's what happens
 

10193
03:03:57,300 --> 03:03:58,969
ourselves so maybe that's what happens
to the other alien civilizations is that

10194
03:03:58,969 --> 03:03:58,979
to the other alien civilizations is that

03:03:58,979 --> 03:04:01,190
to the other alien civilizations is that

03:04:04,740 --> 03:04:06,349
Australian Community aren't thinking
about this problem seriously enough in

10202
03:04:06,349 --> 03:04:06,359
about this problem seriously enough in
 

10203
03:04:06,359 --> 03:04:07,969
about this problem seriously enough in
my opinion we should we should be

10204
03:04:07,969 --> 03:04:07,979
my opinion we should we should be
 

10205
03:04:07,979 --> 03:04:11,750
my opinion we should we should be
thinking about the what AI is is doing

10206
03:04:11,750 --> 03:04:11,760
thinking about the what AI is is doing
 

10207
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:13,550
thinking about the what AI is is doing
to our society and the implications of

10208
03:04:13,550 --> 03:04:13,560
to our society and the implications of
 

10209
03:04:13,560 --> 03:04:16,429
to our society and the implications of
what we're looking for and so the only I

10210
03:04:16,429 --> 03:04:16,439
what we're looking for and so the only I
 

10211
03:04:16,439 --> 03:04:18,530
what we're looking for and so the only I
think part of this thinking has to

10212
03:04:18,530 --> 03:04:18,540
think part of this thinking has to
 

10213
03:04:18,540 --> 03:04:20,389

you said earlier that you think you
 

10223
03:04:29,640 --> 03:04:31,370
you said earlier that you think you
can't imagine a Galaxy where life and

extremely difficult for me it's the the

03:05:02,460 --> 03:05:05,750
extremely difficult for me and the the
terrifying thing is one thing I suspect

10252
03:05:05,750 --> 03:05:05,760
terrifying thing is one thing I suspect
 

10253
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:07,969
terrifying thing is one thing I suspect
is that we keep destroying ourselves the

10254
03:05:07,969 --> 03:05:07,979
is that we keep destroying ourselves the
 

10255
03:05:07,979 --> 03:05:09,769
is that we keep destroying ourselves the
probability of self-destruction with

10256
03:05:09,769 --> 03:05:09,779
probability of self-destruction with
 

10257
03:05:09,779 --> 03:05:11,389
probability of self-destruction with
with advanced technology is just

10258
03:05:11,389 --> 03:05:11,399
with advanced technology is just
 

10259
03:05:11,399 --> 03:05:13,490
with advanced technology is just
extremely high that's why we're not

10260
03:05:13,490 --> 03:05:13,500
extremely high that's why we're not
 

10261
03:05:13,500 --> 03:05:14,830
extremely high that's why we're not
seeing it

10262
03:05:14,830 --> 03:05:14,840
seeing it
 

10263
03:05:14,840 --> 03:05:17,990
seeing it
but then again my intuition about about

10264
03:05:17,990 --> 03:05:18,000
but then again my intuition about about
 

10265
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:19,730
but then again my intuition about about
why we haven't blown ourselves up with

10266
03:05:19,730 --> 03:05:19,740
why we haven't blown ourselves up with
 

10267
03:05:19,740 --> 03:05:21,370
why we haven't blown ourselves up with

10269
03:05:21,380 --> 03:05:23,809

it's very surprising to me from a

10270
03:05:23,809 --> 03:05:23,819
it's very surprising to me from a
 

10271
03:05:23,819 --> 03:05:25,130
it's very surprising to me from a
scientific perspective

10272
03:05:25,130 --> 03:05:25,140
scientific perspective
 

10273
03:05:25,140 --> 03:05:27,110
scientific perspective
but yeah it doesn't given all the

10274
03:05:27,110 --> 03:05:27,120
but yeah it doesn't given all the
 

10275
03:05:27,120 --> 03:05:29,690
but yeah it doesn't given all the
cruelty I've seen in the world

10276
03:05:29,690 --> 03:05:29,700
cruelty I've seen in the world
 

10277
03:05:29,700 --> 03:05:33,590
cruelty I've seen in the world
um given the the the power that nuclear

10278
03:05:33,590 --> 03:05:33,600
um given the the the power that nuclear
 

10279
03:05:33,600 --> 03:05:35,210
um given the the the power that nuclear
weapons place in the hands a very small

10280
03:05:35,210 --> 03:05:35,220
weapons place in the hands a very small
 

10281
03:05:35,220 --> 03:05:36,710
weapons place in the hands a very small
number of individuals

10282
03:05:36,710 --> 03:05:36,720
number of individuals
 

10283
03:05:36,720 --> 03:05:38,809
number of individuals
it's very surprising to destroy

10284
03:05:38,809 --> 03:05:38,819
it's very surprising to destroy
 

10285
03:05:38,819 --> 03:05:41,090
it's very surprising to destroy
ourselves and it seems to be a very low

10286
03:05:41,090 --> 03:05:41,100
ourselves and it seems to be a very low
 

10287
03:05:41,100 --> 03:05:42,889
ourselves and it seems to be a very low
probability situation with Happening

10288
03:05:42,889 --> 03:05:42,899
probability situation with Happening
 

10289
03:05:42,899 --> 03:05:44,389
probability situation with Happening
Here

10290
03:05:44,389 --> 03:05:44,399
Here
 

10291
03:05:44,399 --> 03:05:45,290
Here
um

10292
03:05:45,290 --> 03:05:45,300
um
 

10293
03:05:45,300 --> 03:05:47,330
um
but and then the other explanation is

10294
03:05:47,330 --> 03:05:47,340
but and then the other explanation is
 

10295
03:05:47,340 --> 03:05:49,849
but and then the other explanation is
the is the zoo is the observation that

10296
03:05:49,849 --> 03:05:49,859
the is the zoo is the observation that
 

10297
03:05:49,859 --> 03:05:51,469
the is the zoo is the observation that
we're just being observed

10298
03:05:51,469 --> 03:05:51,479
we're just being observed
 

10299
03:05:51,479 --> 03:05:53,510
we're just being observed
that's that's the only other thing it's

10300
03:05:53,510 --> 03:05:53,520
that's that's the only other thing it's
 

10301
03:05:53,520 --> 03:05:56,530
that's that's the only other thing it's
just it's so difficult for me

10302
03:05:56,530 --> 03:05:56,540
just it's so difficult for me
 

10303
03:05:56,540 --> 03:05:59,210
just it's so difficult for me
of course all of science everything is

10304
03:05:59,210 --> 03:05:59,220
of course all of science everything is
 

10305
03:05:59,220 --> 03:06:01,070
of course all of science everything is
very humbling it would be very humbling

10306
03:06:01,070 --> 03:06:01,080
very humbling it would be very humbling
 

10307
03:06:01,080 --> 03:06:03,349
very humbling it would be very humbling
for me to learn

10308
03:06:03,349 --> 03:06:03,359
for me to learn
 

10309
03:06:03,359 --> 03:06:05,870
for me to learn
that we're alone in the universe

10310
03:06:05,870 --> 03:06:05,880
that we're alone in the universe
 

10311
03:06:05,880 --> 03:06:07,490
that we're alone in the universe
it would change

10312
03:06:07,490 --> 03:06:07,500
it would change
 

10313
03:06:07,500 --> 03:06:10,969
it would change
uh I you know what it maybe I do want

10314
03:06:10,969 --> 03:06:10,979
uh I you know what it maybe I do want
 

10315
03:06:10,979 --> 03:06:12,650
uh I you know what it maybe I do want
that to be true because you want us to

10316
03:06:12,650 --> 03:06:12,660
that to be true because you want us to
 

10317
03:06:12,660 --> 03:06:14,450
that to be true because you want us to
be special that's why I'm resisting that

10318
03:06:14,450 --> 03:06:14,460
be special that's why I'm resisting that
 

10319
03:06:14,460 --> 03:06:16,910
be special that's why I'm resisting that
thought maybe there's no way we're that

10320
03:06:16,910 --> 03:06:16,920
thought maybe there's no way we're that
 

10321
03:06:16,920 --> 03:06:18,769
thought maybe there's no way we're that
special there's no way we're that

10322
03:06:18,769 --> 03:06:18,779
special there's no way we're that
 

10323
03:06:18,779 --> 03:06:20,570
special there's no way we're that
special that's that's that's where my

10324
03:06:20,570 --> 03:06:20,580
special that's that's that's where my
 

10325
03:06:20,580 --> 03:06:22,190
special that's that's that's where my
resistance comes from I would just say

10326
03:06:22,190 --> 03:06:22,200
resistance comes from I would just say
 

10327
03:06:22,200 --> 03:06:23,570
resistance comes from I would just say
you know

10328
03:06:23,570 --> 03:06:23,580
you know
 

10329
03:06:23,580 --> 03:06:26,090
you know
the specialness is something we we in

10330
03:06:26,090 --> 03:06:26,100
the specialness is something we we in
 

10331
03:06:26,100 --> 03:06:27,889
the specialness is something we we in
implicitly in that statement there's

10332
03:06:27,889 --> 03:06:27,899
implicitly in that statement there's
 

10333
03:06:27,899 --> 03:06:29,450
implicitly in that statement there's
kind of an assumption that we are

10334
03:06:29,450 --> 03:06:29,460
kind of an assumption that we are
 

10335
03:06:29,460 --> 03:06:32,630
kind of an assumption that we are
something positive like we're a gift to

10336
03:06:32,630 --> 03:06:32,640
something positive like we're a gift to
 

10337
03:06:32,640 --> 03:06:34,190
something positive like we're a gift to
this planet or something and that makes

10338
03:06:34,190 --> 03:06:34,200
this planet or something and that makes
 

10339
03:06:34,200 --> 03:06:37,190
this planet or something and that makes
it special but you know it may be that

10340
03:06:37,190 --> 03:06:37,200
it special but you know it may be that
 

10341
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:39,170
it special but you know it may be that
intelligence is more often is like we

03:06:39,170 --> 03:06:39,180
intelligence is more often is like we

the wake of a nuclear war
would that be an absolute eradication of

10370
03:07:12,530 --> 03:07:12,540
would that be an absolute eradication of
 

10371
03:07:12,540 --> 03:07:14,510
would that be an absolute eradication of
every human being which would be a

10372
03:07:14,510 --> 03:07:14,520
every human being which would be a
 

10373
03:07:14,520 --> 03:07:17,870
every human being which would be a
fairly extreme event or would the kind

10374
03:07:17,870 --> 03:07:17,880
fairly extreme event or would the kind
 

10375
03:07:17,880 --> 03:07:19,190
fairly extreme event or would the kind
of like Consciousness as you might call

10376
03:07:19,190 --> 03:07:19,200
of like Consciousness as you might call
 

10377
03:07:19,200 --> 03:07:20,389
of like Consciousness as you might call
it the flame of Consciousness continue

10378
03:07:20,389 --> 03:07:20,399
it the flame of Consciousness continue
 

10379
03:07:20,399 --> 03:07:23,150
it the flame of Consciousness continue
with some small Pockets that would maybe

10380
03:07:23,150 --> 03:07:23,160
with some small Pockets that would maybe
 

10381
03:07:23,160 --> 03:07:25,010
with some small Pockets that would maybe
in ten thousand years a hundred thousand

10382
03:07:25,010 --> 03:07:25,020
in ten thousand years a hundred thousand
 

10383
03:07:25,020 --> 03:07:27,710
in ten thousand years a hundred thousand
years we'd see civilization re-emerge

10384
03:07:27,710 --> 03:07:27,720
years we'd see civilization re-emerge
 

10385
03:07:27,720 --> 03:07:29,690
years we'd see civilization re-emerge
and play out the same thing over again

10386
03:07:29,690 --> 03:07:29,700
and play out the same thing over again
 

10387
03:07:29,700 --> 03:07:32,030
and play out the same thing over again
yeah that's certainly but nuclear

10388
03:07:32,030 --> 03:07:32,040
yeah that's certainly but nuclear
 

10389
03:07:32,040 --> 03:07:34,190
yeah that's certainly but nuclear
weapons aren't powerful enough yet but

10390
03:07:34,190 --> 03:07:34,200
weapons aren't powerful enough yet but
 

10391
03:07:34,200 --> 03:07:37,610
weapons aren't powerful enough yet but
yes the uh but to sort of push back on

10392
03:07:37,610 --> 03:07:37,620
yes the uh but to sort of push back on
 

10393
03:07:37,620 --> 03:07:39,469
yes the uh but to sort of push back on
the infestation sure but the word

10394
03:07:39,469 --> 03:07:39,479
the infestation sure but the word
 

10395
03:07:39,479 --> 03:07:42,349
the infestation sure but the word
special doesn't have to be positive

10396
03:07:42,349 --> 03:07:42,359
special doesn't have to be positive
 

10397
03:07:42,359 --> 03:07:43,910
special doesn't have to be positive
I just mean

10398
03:07:43,910 --> 03:07:43,920
I just mean
 

10399
03:07:43,920 --> 03:07:45,889
I just mean
I think it tends to imply but I take

10400
03:07:45,889 --> 03:07:45,899
I think it tends to imply but I take
 

10401
03:07:45,899 --> 03:07:47,929
I think it tends to imply but I take
your point yeah but maybe

10402
03:07:47,929 --> 03:07:47,939
your point yeah but maybe
 

10403
03:07:47,939 --> 03:07:48,590
your point yeah but maybe
um

10404
03:07:48,590 --> 03:07:48,600
um
 

10405
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:51,110
um
just maybe extremely rare maybe yeah and

10406
03:07:51,110 --> 03:07:51,120
just maybe extremely rare maybe yeah and
 

10407
03:07:51,120 --> 03:07:55,490
just maybe extremely rare maybe yeah and
that to me it just it's very strange

10408
03:07:55,490 --> 03:07:55,500
that to me it just it's very strange
 

10409
03:07:55,500 --> 03:07:58,330
that to me it just it's very strange
for me to be

10410
03:07:58,330 --> 03:07:58,340
for me to be
 

10411
03:07:58,340 --> 03:08:00,469
for me to be
cosmically unique

10412
03:08:00,469 --> 03:08:00,479
cosmically unique
 

10413
03:08:00,479 --> 03:08:03,469
cosmically unique
it's just very strange I I

10414
03:08:03,469 --> 03:08:03,479
it's just very strange I I
 

10415
03:08:03,479 --> 03:08:08,030
it's just very strange I I
mean that word the only thing

10416
03:08:08,030 --> 03:08:08,040
mean that word the only thing
 

10417
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:10,490
mean that word the only thing
of this level of complexity in the

10418
03:08:10,490 --> 03:08:10,500
of this level of complexity in the
 

10419
03:08:10,500 --> 03:08:13,969
of this level of complexity in the
Galaxy just seems very strange to me I

10420
03:08:13,969 --> 03:08:13,979
Galaxy just seems very strange to me I
 

10421
03:08:13,979 --> 03:08:16,250
Galaxy just seems very strange to me I
would just yeah I I said I do think it

10422
03:08:16,250 --> 03:08:16,260
would just yeah I I said I do think it
 

10423
03:08:16,260 --> 03:08:18,469
would just yeah I I said I do think it
depends on this classification I think

10424
03:08:18,469 --> 03:08:18,479
depends on this classification I think
 

10425
03:08:18,479 --> 03:08:20,450
depends on this classification I think
there is sort of again it's kind of

10426
03:08:20,450 --> 03:08:20,460
there is sort of again it's kind of
 

10427
03:08:20,460 --> 03:08:22,250
there is sort of again it's kind of
buried within there as a subtext but

10428
03:08:22,250 --> 03:08:22,260
buried within there as a subtext but
 

10429
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:24,530
buried within there as a subtext but
there was a a classification that we're

10430
03:08:24,530 --> 03:08:24,540
there was a a classification that we're
 

10431
03:08:24,540 --> 03:08:27,710
there was a a classification that we're
doing here that what we are is a

10432
03:08:27,710 --> 03:08:27,720
doing here that what we are is a
 

10433
03:08:27,720 --> 03:08:30,349
doing here that what we are is a
distinct category of of life let's say

10434
03:08:30,349 --> 03:08:30,359
distinct category of of life let's say
 

10435
03:08:30,359 --> 03:08:31,250
distinct category of of life let's say
in this case we're talking about

10436
03:08:31,250 --> 03:08:31,260
in this case we're talking about
 

10437
03:08:31,260 --> 03:08:33,050
in this case we're talking about
intelligence we have something that can

10438
03:08:33,050 --> 03:08:33,060
intelligence we have something that can
 

10439
03:08:33,060 --> 03:08:34,910
intelligence we have something that can
be separated

10440
03:08:34,910 --> 03:08:34,920
be separated
 

10441
03:08:34,920 --> 03:08:36,349
be separated
um but of course we see intelligence

10442
03:08:36,349 --> 03:08:36,359
um but of course we see intelligence
 

10443
03:08:36,359 --> 03:08:38,809
um but of course we see intelligence
across the Animal Kingdom in you know

10444
03:08:38,809 --> 03:08:38,819
across the Animal Kingdom in you know
 

10445
03:08:38,819 --> 03:08:41,389
across the Animal Kingdom in you know
Dolphins humpback whales

10446
03:08:41,389 --> 03:08:41,399
Dolphins humpback whales
 

10447
03:08:41,399 --> 03:08:44,389
Dolphins humpback whales
um octopuses crows Ravens and so it's

10448
03:08:44,389 --> 03:08:44,399
um octopuses crows Ravens and so it's
 

10449
03:08:44,399 --> 03:08:47,210
um octopuses crows Ravens and so it's
quite possible that

10450
03:08:47,210 --> 03:08:47,220
quite possible that
 

10451
03:08:47,220 --> 03:08:48,050
quite possible that
um

10452
03:08:48,050 --> 03:08:48,060
um
 

10453
03:08:48,060 --> 03:08:50,630
um
that these are all manifestations of

10454
03:08:50,630 --> 03:08:50,640
that these are all manifestations of
 

10455
03:08:50,640 --> 03:08:53,929
that these are all manifestations of
this same thing and we are not uh we are

10456
03:08:53,929 --> 03:08:53,939
this same thing and we are not uh we are
 

10457
03:08:53,939 --> 03:08:56,389
this same thing and we are not uh we are
not a particularly distinct class except

10458
03:08:56,389 --> 03:08:56,399
not a particularly distinct class except
 

10459
03:08:56,399 --> 03:08:57,830
not a particularly distinct class except
for the fact we make technology that's

10460
03:08:57,830 --> 03:08:57,840
for the fact we make technology that's
 

10461
03:08:57,840 --> 03:08:58,730
for the fact we make technology that's
really any difference to our

10462
03:08:58,730 --> 03:08:58,740
really any difference to our
 

10463
03:08:58,740 --> 03:09:01,550
really any difference to our
intelligence and we we classify that

10464
03:09:01,550 --> 03:09:01,560
intelligence and we we classify that
 

10465
03:09:01,560 --> 03:09:03,710
intelligence and we we classify that
separately but from a biological

10466
03:09:03,710 --> 03:09:03,720
separately but from a biological
 

10467
03:09:03,720 --> 03:09:05,450
separately but from a biological
perspective to some degree it's really

10468
03:09:05,450 --> 03:09:05,460
perspective to some degree it's really
 

10469
03:09:05,460 --> 03:09:07,309
perspective to some degree it's really
just all part of a Continuum and so

10470
03:09:07,309 --> 03:09:07,319
just all part of a Continuum and so
 

10471
03:09:07,319 --> 03:09:08,630
just all part of a Continuum and so
that's why I

10472
03:09:08,630 --> 03:09:08,640
that's why I
 

10473
03:09:08,640 --> 03:09:10,849
that's why I
when we talk about unique you're you're

10474
03:09:10,849 --> 03:09:10,859
when we talk about unique you're you're
 

10475
03:09:10,859 --> 03:09:13,250
when we talk about unique you're you're
you are putting yourself in a box which

10476
03:09:13,250 --> 03:09:13,260
you are putting yourself in a box which
 

10477
03:09:13,260 --> 03:09:14,630
you are putting yourself in a box which
is distinct and saying this is the only

10478
03:09:14,630 --> 03:09:14,640
is distinct and saying this is the only
 

10479
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:16,070
is distinct and saying this is the only
example of things that fall into this

10480
03:09:16,070 --> 03:09:16,080
example of things that fall into this
 

10481
03:09:16,080 --> 03:09:18,710
example of things that fall into this
box but that but the wars of that box

10482
03:09:18,710 --> 03:09:18,720
box but that but the wars of that box
 

10483
03:09:18,720 --> 03:09:22,190
box but that but the wars of that box
May themselves be a construct of our own

10484
03:09:22,190 --> 03:09:22,200
May themselves be a construct of our own
 

10485
03:09:22,200 --> 03:09:25,450
May themselves be a construct of our own
arrogance that we are something distinct

10486
03:09:25,450 --> 03:09:25,460
arrogance that we are something distinct
 

10487
03:09:25,460 --> 03:09:28,550
arrogance that we are something distinct
and uh but I was also speaking broadly

10488
03:09:28,550 --> 03:09:28,560
and uh but I was also speaking broadly
 

10489
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:32,389
and uh but I was also speaking broadly
for us meaning all life on Earth

10490
03:09:32,389 --> 03:09:32,399
for us meaning all life on Earth
 

10491
03:09:32,399 --> 03:09:35,150
for us meaning all life on Earth
that but then it's possible that there's

10492
03:09:35,150 --> 03:09:35,160
that but then it's possible that there's
 

10493
03:09:35,160 --> 03:09:36,830
that but then it's possible that there's
all kinds of

10494
03:09:36,830 --> 03:09:36,840
all kinds of
 

10495
03:09:36,840 --> 03:09:38,769
all kinds of
living

10496
03:09:38,769 --> 03:09:38,779
living
 

10497
03:09:38,779 --> 03:09:41,450
living
ecosystems in on other planets and other

03:09:41,450 --> 03:09:41,460
ecosystems in on other planets and other
 

10499
03:09:41,460 --> 03:09:44,030

03:09:44,030 --> 03:09:44,040
moons that just don't have interest in
 

10501
03:09:44,040 --> 03:09:46,610
moons that just don't have interest in
technological development and maybe

10502
03:09:46,610 --> 03:09:46,620
technological development and maybe
 

10503
03:09:46,620 --> 03:09:49,070
technological development and maybe
maybe technological development is the

10504
03:09:49,070 --> 03:09:49,080
maybe technological development is the
 

10505
03:09:49,080 --> 03:09:49,990
maybe technological development is the
the

10506
03:09:49,990 --> 03:09:50,000
the
 

10507
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,429
the
parasitic thing it destroys the organism

10508
03:09:52,429 --> 03:09:52,439
parasitic thing it destroys the organism
 

10509
03:09:52,439 --> 03:09:54,730
parasitic thing it destroys the organism
broadly and then

10510
03:09:54,730 --> 03:09:54,740
broadly and then
 

10511
03:09:54,740 --> 03:09:57,110
broadly and then
maybe that's actually one of the

10512
03:09:57,110 --> 03:09:57,120
maybe that's actually one of the
 

10513
03:09:57,120 --> 03:10:00,590
maybe that's actually one of the
fundamental realities whatever broad way

10514
03:10:00,590 --> 03:10:00,600
fundamental realities whatever broad way
 

10515
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:02,210
fundamental realities whatever broad way
to categorize technological development

10516
03:10:02,210 --> 03:10:02,220
to categorize technological development
 

10517
03:10:02,220 --> 03:10:03,889
to categorize technological development
that's that's just a parasitic thing

10518
03:10:03,889 --> 03:10:03,899
that's that's just a parasitic thing
 

10519
03:10:03,899 --> 03:10:06,410
that's that's just a parasitic thing
that just destroys itself yeah it's a

10520
03:10:06,410 --> 03:10:06,420
that just destroys itself yeah it's a
 

10521
03:10:06,420 --> 03:10:07,670
that just destroys itself yeah it's a
cancer you know like floating around

10522
03:10:07,670 --> 03:10:07,680
cancer you know like floating around
 

10523
03:10:07,680 --> 03:10:08,750

sorry to interrupt it we're floating

sorry to interrupt it we're floating

03:10:08,760 --> 03:10:10,730
sorry to interrupt it we're floating
around this idea of the great filter a

10526
03:10:10,730 --> 03:10:10,740
around this idea of the great filter a
 

10527
03:10:10,740 --> 03:10:12,950
around this idea of the great filter a
little bit here so we'll be asking where

10528
03:10:12,950 --> 03:10:12,960
little bit here so we'll be asking where
 

10529
03:10:12,960 --> 03:10:15,410
little bit here so we'll be asking where
is this does it lie ahead of us nuclear

10530
03:10:15,410 --> 03:10:15,420
is this does it lie ahead of us nuclear
 

10531
03:10:15,420 --> 03:10:16,910
is this does it lie ahead of us nuclear
war maybe imminent that would be a

10532
03:10:16,910 --> 03:10:16,920
war maybe imminent that would be a
 

10533
03:10:16,920 --> 03:10:18,830
war maybe imminent that would be a
filter that's ahead of us or could it be

10534
03:10:18,830 --> 03:10:18,840
filter that's ahead of us or could it be
 

10535
03:10:18,840 --> 03:10:20,450
filter that's ahead of us or could it be
behind us and it's the Advent of

10536
03:10:20,450 --> 03:10:20,460
behind us and it's the Advent of
 

10537
03:10:20,460 --> 03:10:23,570
behind us and it's the Advent of
technology that is genuinely a rare

10538
03:10:23,570 --> 03:10:23,580
technology that is genuinely a rare
 

10539
03:10:23,580 --> 03:10:24,710
technology that is genuinely a rare
occurrence in the universe and that

10540
03:10:24,710 --> 03:10:24,720
occurrence in the universe and that
 

10541
03:10:24,720 --> 03:10:27,830
occurrence in the universe and that
explains the Fermi Paradox um

10542
03:10:27,830 --> 03:10:27,840
explains the Fermi Paradox um
 

10543
03:10:27,840 --> 03:10:30,170
explains the Fermi Paradox um
and so that's uh that's something that

10544
03:10:30,170 --> 03:10:30,180
and so that's uh that's something that
 

10545
03:10:30,180 --> 03:10:32,090
and so that's uh that's something that
obviously people have debated and gone

10546
03:10:32,090 --> 03:10:32,100
obviously people have debated and gone
 

10547
03:10:32,100 --> 03:10:34,790
obviously people have debated and gone
argued about in seti for decades and

10548
03:10:34,790 --> 03:10:34,800
argued about in seti for decades and
 

10549
03:10:34,800 --> 03:10:39,170
argued about in seti for decades and
decades but it remains a persistent

10550
03:10:39,170 --> 03:10:39,180
decades but it remains a persistent
 

10551
03:10:39,180 --> 03:10:40,429
decades but it remains a persistent
people argue oh that should be really

10552
03:10:40,429 --> 03:10:40,439
people argue oh that should be really
 

10553
03:10:40,439 --> 03:10:42,110
people argue oh that should be really
quite a paradox or not but it remains a

10554
03:10:42,110 --> 03:10:42,120
quite a paradox or not but it remains a
 

10555
03:10:42,120 --> 03:10:45,410
quite a paradox or not but it remains a
consistent apparent contradiction that

10556
03:10:45,410 --> 03:10:45,420
consistent apparent contradiction that
 

10557
03:10:45,420 --> 03:10:47,870
consistent apparent contradiction that
you can make a very cogent argument as

10558
03:10:47,870 --> 03:10:47,880
you can make a very cogent argument as
 

10559
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:49,490
you can make a very cogent argument as
to why you expect life and intelligence

10560
03:10:49,490 --> 03:10:49,500
to why you expect life and intelligence
 

10561
03:10:49,500 --> 03:10:51,710
to why you expect life and intelligence
to be common in the universe and yet

10562
03:10:51,710 --> 03:10:51,720
to be common in the universe and yet
 

10563
03:10:51,720 --> 03:10:54,230
to be common in the universe and yet
everything everything we know about the

10564
03:10:54,230 --> 03:10:54,240
everything everything we know about the
 

10565
03:10:54,240 --> 03:10:57,710
everything everything we know about the
universe is fully compatible with just

10566
03:10:57,710 --> 03:10:57,720
universe is fully compatible with just
 

10567
03:10:57,720 --> 03:10:59,929
universe is fully compatible with just
us being here and that's

10568
03:10:59,929 --> 03:10:59,939
us being here and that's
 

10569
03:10:59,939 --> 03:11:03,590
us being here and that's
a haunting thought but

10570
03:11:03,590 --> 03:11:03,600
a haunting thought but
 

10571
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:06,050
a haunting thought but
um I'm not I have no preference or

10572
03:11:06,050 --> 03:11:06,060
um I'm not I have no preference or
 

10573
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:07,969
um I'm not I have no preference or
desire for that to be true I'm not

10574
03:11:07,969 --> 03:11:07,979
desire for that to be true I'm not
 

10575
03:11:07,979 --> 03:11:11,450
desire for that to be true I'm not
trying to impose that view on anyone but

10576
03:11:11,450 --> 03:11:11,460
trying to impose that view on anyone but
 

10577
03:11:11,460 --> 03:11:13,670
trying to impose that view on anyone but
I do ask that we remain open-minded

10578
03:11:13,670 --> 03:11:13,680
I do ask that we remain open-minded
 

10579
03:11:13,680 --> 03:11:15,889
I do ask that we remain open-minded
until evidence has been collected either

10580
03:11:15,889 --> 03:11:15,899
until evidence has been collected either
 

10581
03:11:15,899 --> 03:11:17,990
until evidence has been collected either
way well the thing is

10582
03:11:17,990 --> 03:11:18,000
way well the thing is
 

10583
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:18,790
way well the thing is
it's

10584
03:11:18,790 --> 03:11:18,800
it's
 

10585
03:11:18,800 --> 03:11:22,130
it's
one of if not the probably I would argue

10586
03:11:22,130 --> 03:11:22,140
one of if not the probably I would argue
 

10587
03:11:22,140 --> 03:11:24,110
one of if not the probably I would argue
is the most important question facing

10588
03:11:24,110 --> 03:11:24,120
is the most important question facing
 

10589
03:11:24,120 --> 03:11:25,490
is the most important question facing
human civilization or the most

10590
03:11:25,490 --> 03:11:25,500
human civilization or the most
 

10591
03:11:25,500 --> 03:11:28,250
human civilization or the most
interesting yeah I think

10592
03:11:28,250 --> 03:11:28,260
interesting yeah I think
 

10593
03:11:28,260 --> 03:11:30,230
interesting yeah I think
scientifically speaking like what

10594
03:11:30,230 --> 03:11:30,240
scientifically speaking like what
 

10595
03:11:30,240 --> 03:11:31,929
scientifically speaking like what
question is more important

10596
03:11:31,929 --> 03:11:31,939
question is more important
 

10597
03:11:31,939 --> 03:11:35,990
question is more important
then um somehow

10598
03:11:35,990 --> 03:11:36,000
then um somehow
 

10599
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:37,849
then um somehow
you know there could be other ways to

10600
03:11:37,849 --> 03:11:37,859
you know there could be other ways to
 

10601
03:11:37,859 --> 03:11:40,250
you know there could be other ways to
sneak up to it but it gets to the

10602
03:11:40,250 --> 03:11:40,260
sneak up to it but it gets to the
 

10603
03:11:40,260 --> 03:11:42,170
sneak up to it but it gets to the
essence of

10604
03:11:42,170 --> 03:11:42,180
essence of
 

10605
03:11:42,180 --> 03:11:43,790
essence of
what we are

10606
03:11:43,790 --> 03:11:43,800
what we are
 

10607
03:11:43,800 --> 03:11:46,070
what we are
what these living organisms are is

10608
03:11:46,070 --> 03:11:46,080
what these living organisms are is
 

10609
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:48,830
what these living organisms are is
somehow seeing another kind

10610
03:11:48,830 --> 03:11:48,840
somehow seeing another kind
 

10611
03:11:48,840 --> 03:11:50,750
somehow seeing another kind
yeah helps us understand it speaks to

10612
03:11:50,750 --> 03:11:50,760
yeah helps us understand it speaks to
 

10613
03:11:50,760 --> 03:11:52,370
yeah helps us understand it speaks to
The Human Condition helps us understand

10614
03:11:52,370 --> 03:11:52,380
The Human Condition helps us understand
 

10615
03:11:52,380 --> 03:11:56,210
The Human Condition helps us understand
what it is to be human to some degree

10616
03:11:56,210 --> 03:11:56,220
what it is to be human to some degree
 

10617
03:11:56,220 --> 03:11:59,630
what it is to be human to some degree
um I think you know I I have tried to

10618
03:11:59,630 --> 03:11:59,640
um I think you know I I have tried to
 

10619
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:01,910
um I think you know I I have tried to
mean remain very agnostic about the idea

10620
03:12:01,910 --> 03:12:01,920
mean remain very agnostic about the idea
 

10621
03:12:01,920 --> 03:12:04,370
mean remain very agnostic about the idea
of life and intelligence one thing I try

10622
03:12:04,370 --> 03:12:04,380
of life and intelligence one thing I try
 

10623
03:12:04,380 --> 03:12:07,010
of life and intelligence one thing I try
to be more optimistic about and I've

10624
03:12:07,010 --> 03:12:07,020
to be more optimistic about and I've
 

10625
03:12:07,020 --> 03:12:09,230
to be more optimistic about and I've
been thinking a lot with our searches

10626
03:12:09,230 --> 03:12:09,240
been thinking a lot with our searches
 

10627
03:12:09,240 --> 03:12:11,210
been thinking a lot with our searches
for life in the universe is life in the

10628
03:12:11,210 --> 03:12:11,220
for life in the universe is life in the
 

10629
03:12:11,220 --> 03:12:12,530
for life in the universe is life in the
past

10630
03:12:12,530 --> 03:12:12,540
past
 

10631
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:14,690
past
you can I think it's actually not that

10632
03:12:14,690 --> 03:12:14,700
you can I think it's actually not that
 

10633
03:12:14,700 --> 03:12:16,130
you can I think it's actually not that
hard to imagine we are the only

10634
03:12:16,130 --> 03:12:16,140
hard to imagine we are the only
 

10635
03:12:16,140 --> 03:12:17,870
hard to imagine we are the only
civilization in the Galaxy right now

10636
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:17,880
civilization in the Galaxy right now
 

10637
03:12:17,880 --> 03:12:21,230
civilization in the Galaxy right now
living yeah this this current extent but

10638
03:12:21,230 --> 03:12:21,240
living yeah this this current extent but
 

10639
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:23,389
living yeah this this current extent but
there may be very many extinct

10640
03:12:23,389 --> 03:12:23,399
there may be very many extinct
 

10641
03:12:23,399 --> 03:12:25,250
there may be very many extinct
civilizations if each civilization has a

10642
03:12:25,250 --> 03:12:25,260
civilizations if each civilization has a
 

10643
03:12:25,260 --> 03:12:27,290
civilizations if each civilization has a
typical lifetime comparable to let's say

10644
03:12:27,290 --> 03:12:27,300
typical lifetime comparable to let's say
 

10645
03:12:27,300 --> 03:12:29,630
typical lifetime comparable to let's say
AI is the demise of our own that's only

10646
03:12:29,630 --> 03:12:29,640
AI is the demise of our own that's only
 

10647
03:12:29,640 --> 03:12:30,950
AI is the demise of our own that's only
a few hundred years of technological

10648
03:12:30,950 --> 03:12:30,960
a few hundred years of technological
 

10649
03:12:30,960 --> 03:12:33,170
a few hundred years of technological
development or maybe 10 000 years if you

10650
03:12:33,170 --> 03:12:33,180
development or maybe 10 000 years if you
 

10651
03:12:33,180 --> 03:12:35,750
development or maybe 10 000 years if you
go back to the nearest Revolution I

10652
03:12:35,750 --> 03:12:35,760
go back to the nearest Revolution I
 

10653
03:12:35,760 --> 03:12:37,790
go back to the nearest Revolution I
don't have agriculture you know hardly

10654
03:12:37,790 --> 03:12:37,800
don't have agriculture you know hardly
 

10655
03:12:37,800 --> 03:12:40,190
don't have agriculture you know hardly
anything can Cosmic time span

10656
03:12:40,190 --> 03:12:40,200
anything can Cosmic time span
 

10657
03:12:40,200 --> 03:12:41,750
anything can Cosmic time span
um that that's nothing that's the blink

10658
03:12:41,750 --> 03:12:41,760
um that that's nothing that's the blink
 

10659
03:12:41,760 --> 03:12:44,090
um that that's nothing that's the blink
of an eye and so it's not surprising at

10660
03:12:44,090 --> 03:12:44,100
of an eye and so it's not surprising at
 

10661
03:12:44,100 --> 03:12:46,429
of an eye and so it's not surprising at
all that we would happen not to coexist

10662
03:12:46,429 --> 03:12:46,439
all that we would happen not to coexist
 

10663
03:12:46,439 --> 03:12:48,650
all that we would happen not to coexist
with anyone else but that doesn't mean

10664
03:12:48,650 --> 03:12:48,660
with anyone else but that doesn't mean
 

10665
03:12:48,660 --> 03:12:50,990
with anyone else but that doesn't mean
nobody else was ever here

10666
03:12:50,990 --> 03:12:51,000
nobody else was ever here
 

10667
03:12:51,000 --> 03:12:54,230
nobody else was ever here
and if other civilizations come to that

10668
03:12:54,230 --> 03:12:54,240
and if other civilizations come to that
 

10669
03:12:54,240 --> 03:12:56,630
and if other civilizations come to that
same conclusion and realization maybe

10670
03:12:56,630 --> 03:12:56,640
same conclusion and realization maybe
 

10671
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:58,490
same conclusion and realization maybe
they scour the Galaxy around them don't

10672
03:12:58,490 --> 03:12:58,500
they scour the Galaxy around them don't
 

10673
03:12:58,500 --> 03:13:00,469
they scour the Galaxy around them don't
find any evidence for intelligence

10674
03:13:00,469 --> 03:13:00,479
find any evidence for intelligence
 

10675
03:13:00,479 --> 03:13:02,450
find any evidence for intelligence
then they have two options they can

10676
03:13:02,450 --> 03:13:02,460
then they have two options they can
 

10677
03:13:02,460 --> 03:13:04,670
then they have two options they can
either give up on communication and just

10678
03:13:04,670 --> 03:13:04,680
either give up on communication and just
 

10679
03:13:04,680 --> 03:13:06,590
either give up on communication and just
say well it's never going to happen uh

10680
03:13:06,590 --> 03:13:06,600
say well it's never going to happen uh
 

10681
03:13:06,600 --> 03:13:08,990
say well it's never going to happen uh
we just may as well just you know worry

10682
03:13:08,990 --> 03:13:09,000
we just may as well just you know worry
 

10683
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:10,130
we just may as well just you know worry
about what's Happening Here on our own

10684
03:13:10,130 --> 03:13:10,140
about what's Happening Here on our own
 

10685
03:13:10,140 --> 03:13:12,050
about what's Happening Here on our own
planet or they could attempt

10686
03:13:12,050 --> 03:13:12,060
planet or they could attempt
 

10687
03:13:12,060 --> 03:13:13,730
planet or they could attempt
communication but communication is

10688
03:13:13,730 --> 03:13:13,740
communication but communication is
 

10689
03:13:13,740 --> 03:13:16,849
communication but communication is
through time and that's that's almost

10690
03:13:16,849 --> 03:13:16,859
through time and that's that's almost
 

10691
03:13:16,859 --> 03:13:19,849
through time and that's that's almost
um the most selfless Act of

10692
03:13:19,849 --> 03:13:19,859
um the most selfless Act of
 

10693
03:13:19,859 --> 03:13:21,769
um the most selfless Act of
communication because there's no hope of

10694
03:13:21,769 --> 03:13:21,779
communication because there's no hope of
 

10695
03:13:21,779 --> 03:13:24,710
communication because there's no hope of
getting anything back it's

10696
03:13:24,710 --> 03:13:24,720
getting anything back it's
 

10697
03:13:24,720 --> 03:13:26,809
getting anything back it's
um a philanthropic a gift almost to that

10698
03:13:26,809 --> 03:13:26,819
um a philanthropic a gift almost to that
 

10699
03:13:26,819 --> 03:13:29,150
um a philanthropic a gift almost to that
other civilization that you can maybe

10700
03:13:29,150 --> 03:13:29,160
other civilization that you can maybe
 

10701
03:13:29,160 --> 03:13:30,950
other civilization that you can maybe
maybe might just be nothing more than a

10702
03:13:30,950 --> 03:13:30,960
maybe might just be nothing more than a
 

10703
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:32,570
maybe might just be nothing more than a
monument which the pyramids essentially

10704
03:13:32,570 --> 03:13:32,580
monument which the pyramids essentially
 

10705
03:13:32,580 --> 03:13:34,790
monument which the pyramids essentially
are a monument of their existence that

10706
03:13:34,790 --> 03:13:34,800
are a monument of their existence that
 

10707
03:13:34,800 --> 03:13:36,889
are a monument of their existence that
these are the things they achieve this

10708
03:13:36,889 --> 03:13:36,899
these are the things they achieve this
 

10709
03:13:36,899 --> 03:13:38,450
these are the things they achieve this
is their you know the things they

10710
03:13:38,450 --> 03:13:38,460
is their you know the things they
 

10711
03:13:38,460 --> 03:13:41,269
is their you know the things they
believed in their language their culture

10712
03:13:41,269 --> 03:13:41,279
believed in their language their culture
 

10713
03:13:41,279 --> 03:13:42,950
believed in their language their culture
or

10714
03:13:42,950 --> 03:13:42,960
or
 

10715
03:13:42,960 --> 03:13:44,929
or
um it could be maybe something more than

10716
03:13:44,929 --> 03:13:44,939
um it could be maybe something more than
 

10717
03:13:44,939 --> 03:13:46,550
um it could be maybe something more than
that it could be sort of lessons from

10718
03:13:46,550 --> 03:13:46,560
that it could be sort of lessons from
 

10719
03:13:46,560 --> 03:13:47,750
that it could be sort of lessons from
what they learned in their own history

10720
03:13:47,750 --> 03:13:47,760
what they learned in their own history
 

10721
03:13:47,760 --> 03:13:49,010
what they learned in their own history
and so

10722
03:13:49,010 --> 03:13:49,020
and so
 

10723
03:13:49,020 --> 03:13:52,550
and so
I've been thinking a lot recently about

10724
03:13:52,550 --> 03:13:52,560
I've been thinking a lot recently about
 

10725
03:13:52,560 --> 03:13:56,389
I've been thinking a lot recently about
how would we send a message to other

10726
03:13:56,389 --> 03:13:56,399
how would we send a message to other
 

10727
03:13:56,399 --> 03:13:58,910
how would we send a message to other
civilizations in the future

10728
03:13:58,910 --> 03:13:58,920
civilizations in the future
 

10729
03:13:58,920 --> 03:14:01,490
civilizations in the future
because that act of thinking seriously

10730
03:14:01,490 --> 03:14:01,500
because that act of thinking seriously
 

10731
03:14:01,500 --> 03:14:03,230
because that act of thinking seriously
about the engineering of how you design

10732
03:14:03,230 --> 03:14:03,240
about the engineering of how you design
 

10733
03:14:03,240 --> 03:14:06,290
about the engineering of how you design
that would inform us about what we

10734
03:14:06,290 --> 03:14:06,300
that would inform us about what we
 

10735
03:14:06,300 --> 03:14:08,090
that would inform us about what we
should be looking for

10736
03:14:08,090 --> 03:14:08,100
should be looking for
 

10737
03:14:08,100 --> 03:14:10,670
should be looking for
and also perhaps be our best chance

10738
03:14:10,670 --> 03:14:10,680
and also perhaps be our best chance
 

10739
03:14:10,680 --> 03:14:13,670
and also perhaps be our best chance
quite frankly of ever making contact it

10740
03:14:13,670 --> 03:14:13,680
quite frankly of ever making contact it
 

10741
03:14:13,680 --> 03:14:15,950
quite frankly of ever making contact it
might not be the contact we dream of

10742
03:14:15,950 --> 03:14:15,960
might not be the contact we dream of
 

10743
03:14:15,960 --> 03:14:18,290
might not be the contact we dream of
but it's still contact they would there

10744
03:14:18,290 --> 03:14:18,300
but it's still contact they would there
 

10745
03:14:18,300 --> 03:14:20,750
but it's still contact they would there
would still be a record of our existence

10746
03:14:20,750 --> 03:14:20,760
would still be a record of our existence
 

10747
03:14:20,760 --> 03:14:23,210
would still be a record of our existence
as pitiful as it might be compared to a

10748
03:14:23,210 --> 03:14:23,220
as pitiful as it might be compared to a
 

10749
03:14:23,220 --> 03:14:25,010
as pitiful as it might be compared to a
two-way communication

10750
03:14:25,010 --> 03:14:25,020
two-way communication
 

10751
03:14:25,020 --> 03:14:27,769
two-way communication
and I love the humility behind that

10752
03:14:27,769 --> 03:14:27,779
and I love the humility behind that
 

10753
03:14:27,779 --> 03:14:29,750
and I love the humility behind that
project that Universal project

10754
03:14:29,750 --> 03:14:29,760
project that Universal project
 

10755
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:34,490
project that Universal project
yeah it's a sort of it's humble in the

10756
03:14:34,490 --> 03:14:34,500
yeah it's a sort of it's humble in the
 

10757
03:14:34,500 --> 03:14:39,230
yeah it's a sort of it's humble in the
it uh humbles you to the the vast

10758
03:14:39,230 --> 03:14:39,240
it uh humbles you to the the vast
 

10759
03:14:39,240 --> 03:14:42,769
it uh humbles you to the the vast
temporal landscape of the universe just

10760
03:14:42,769 --> 03:14:42,779
temporal landscape of the universe just
 

10761
03:14:42,779 --> 03:14:45,290
temporal landscape of the universe just
realizing our like day-to-day lives they

10762
03:14:45,290 --> 03:14:45,300
realizing our like day-to-day lives they
 

10763
03:14:45,300 --> 03:14:47,990
realizing our like day-to-day lives they
all of us will be forgotten it's nice to

10764
03:14:47,990 --> 03:14:48,000
all of us will be forgotten it's nice to
 

10765
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:50,269
all of us will be forgotten it's nice to
think about something that sends a

10766
03:14:50,269 --> 03:14:50,279
think about something that sends a
 

10767
03:14:50,279 --> 03:14:52,250
think about something that sends a
signal out to other

10768
03:14:52,250 --> 03:14:52,260
signal out to other
 

10769
03:14:52,260 --> 03:14:55,490
signal out to other
um yeah it was almost like a humility of

10770
03:14:55,490 --> 03:14:55,500
um yeah it was almost like a humility of
 

10771
03:14:55,500 --> 03:14:58,309
um yeah it was almost like a humility of
acceptance as well of like knowing that

10772
03:14:58,309 --> 03:14:58,319
acceptance as well of like knowing that
 

10773
03:14:58,319 --> 03:15:01,370
acceptance as well of like knowing that
you have a terminal disease but your

10774
03:15:01,370 --> 03:15:01,380
you have a terminal disease but your
 

10775
03:15:01,380 --> 03:15:03,710
you have a terminal disease but your
impact on the earth doesn't have to end

10776
03:15:03,710 --> 03:15:03,720
impact on the earth doesn't have to end
 

10777
03:15:03,720 --> 03:15:05,690
impact on the earth doesn't have to end
with your death that it could go on

10778
03:15:05,690 --> 03:15:05,700
with your death that it could go on
 

10779
03:15:05,700 --> 03:15:08,630
with your death that it could go on
Beyond with what you leave behind for

10780
03:15:08,630 --> 03:15:08,640
Beyond with what you leave behind for
 

10781
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:10,309
Beyond with what you leave behind for
others to discover with maybe the books

10782
03:15:10,309 --> 03:15:10,319
others to discover with maybe the books
 

10783
03:15:10,319 --> 03:15:12,290
others to discover with maybe the books
you write or what you leave in the

10784
03:15:12,290 --> 03:15:12,300
you write or what you leave in the
 

10785
03:15:12,300 --> 03:15:14,450
you write or what you leave in the
literature do you think launching the

10786
03:15:14,450 --> 03:15:14,460
literature do you think launching the
 

10787
03:15:14,460 --> 03:15:18,469
literature do you think launching the
Roadster vehicle out in space yeah the

10788
03:15:18,469 --> 03:15:18,479
Roadster vehicle out in space yeah the
 

10789
03:15:18,479 --> 03:15:19,670
Roadster vehicle out in space yeah the
Roadster

10790
03:15:19,670 --> 03:15:19,680
Roadster
 

10791
03:15:19,680 --> 03:15:21,230
Roadster
um I'm not sure what someone would make

10792
03:15:21,230 --> 03:15:21,240
um I'm not sure what someone would make
 

10793
03:15:21,240 --> 03:15:23,030
um I'm not sure what someone would make
of that if they've

10794
03:15:23,030 --> 03:15:23,040
of that if they've
 

10795
03:15:23,040 --> 03:15:25,610
of that if they've
yeah that's true um I mean there have

10796
03:15:25,610 --> 03:15:25,620
yeah that's true um I mean there have
 

10797
03:15:25,620 --> 03:15:27,830
yeah that's true um I mean there have
been quasi-attempts at it be on the

10798
03:15:27,830 --> 03:15:27,840
been quasi-attempts at it be on the
 

10799
03:15:27,840 --> 03:15:29,870
been quasi-attempts at it be on the
Roadster I mean there's like plaques on

10800
03:15:29,870 --> 03:15:29,880
Roadster I mean there's like plaques on
 

10801
03:15:29,880 --> 03:15:32,030
Roadster I mean there's like plaques on
there's the Pioneer plaques

10802
03:15:32,030 --> 03:15:32,040
there's the Pioneer plaques
 

10803
03:15:32,040 --> 03:15:34,730
there's the Pioneer plaques
um there's the Voyager 2 golden record

10804
03:15:34,730 --> 03:15:34,740
um there's the Voyager 2 golden record
 

10805
03:15:34,740 --> 03:15:36,410
um there's the Voyager 2 golden record
um it's pretty unlikely anybody's going

10806
03:15:36,410 --> 03:15:36,420
um it's pretty unlikely anybody's going
 

10807
03:15:36,420 --> 03:15:39,349
um it's pretty unlikely anybody's going
to discover those uh because they're

10808
03:15:39,349 --> 03:15:39,359
to discover those uh because they're
 

10809
03:15:39,359 --> 03:15:41,570
to discover those uh because they're
just adrift in space and they they they

10810
03:15:41,570 --> 03:15:41,580
just adrift in space and they they they
 

10811
03:15:41,580 --> 03:15:43,550
just adrift in space and they they they
will eventually mechanically die and not

10812
03:15:43,550 --> 03:15:43,560
will eventually mechanically die and not
 

10813
03:15:43,560 --> 03:15:45,469
will eventually mechanically die and not
produce any signal for anyone to spot so

10814
03:15:45,469 --> 03:15:45,479
produce any signal for anyone to spot so
 

10815
03:15:45,479 --> 03:15:46,670
produce any signal for anyone to spot so
you'd have to be extremely lucky to come

10816
03:15:46,670 --> 03:15:46,680
you'd have to be extremely lucky to come
 

10817
03:15:46,680 --> 03:15:49,010
you'd have to be extremely lucky to come
across them I've often said to my

10818
03:15:49,010 --> 03:15:49,020
across them I've often said to my
 

10819
03:15:49,020 --> 03:15:50,750
across them I've often said to my
colleagues I think the best place is the

10820
03:15:50,750 --> 03:15:50,760
colleagues I think the best place is the
 

10821
03:15:50,760 --> 03:15:51,590
colleagues I think the best place is the
Moon

10822
03:15:51,590 --> 03:15:51,600
Moon
 

10823
03:15:51,600 --> 03:15:54,230
Moon
the moon unlike the Earth has no

10824
03:15:54,230 --> 03:15:54,240
the moon unlike the Earth has no
 

10825
03:15:54,240 --> 03:15:56,809
the moon unlike the Earth has no
significant weathering the you know that

10826
03:15:56,809 --> 03:15:56,819
significant weathering the you know that
 

10827
03:15:56,819 --> 03:16:00,050
significant weathering the you know that
how long will the Apollo descent stages

10828
03:16:00,050 --> 03:16:00,060
how long will the Apollo descent stages
 

10829
03:16:00,060 --> 03:16:01,849
how long will the Apollo descent stages
which are still sun on the lunar surface

10830
03:16:01,849 --> 03:16:01,859
which are still sun on the lunar surface
 

10831
03:16:01,859 --> 03:16:05,290
which are still sun on the lunar surface
last for the the only real effect is

03:16:05,290 --> 03:16:05,300
last for the the only real effect is
 

10833
03:16:05,300 --> 03:16:07,910

micrometeorites which are slowly like

micrometeorites which are slowly like
 

10835
03:16:07,920 --> 03:16:11,030
micrometeorites which are slowly like
dust smashing against them pretty much

10836
03:16:11,030 --> 03:16:11,040
dust smashing against them pretty much
 

10837
03:16:11,040 --> 03:16:12,290
dust smashing against them pretty much
um but that's going to take Millions

10838
03:16:12,290 --> 03:16:12,300
um but that's going to take Millions
 

10839
03:16:12,300 --> 03:16:14,330
um but that's going to take Millions
potentially billions of years to erode

10840
03:16:14,330 --> 03:16:14,340
potentially billions of years to erode
 

10841
03:16:14,340 --> 03:16:17,269
potentially billions of years to erode
that down and so we have an opportunity

10842
03:16:17,269 --> 03:16:17,279
that down and so we have an opportunity
 

10843
03:16:17,279 --> 03:16:19,010
that down and so we have an opportunity
and that's on the surface if you put

10844
03:16:19,010 --> 03:16:19,020
and that's on the surface if you put
 

10845
03:16:19,020 --> 03:16:20,630
and that's on the surface if you put
something just a few meters beneath the

10846
03:16:20,630 --> 03:16:20,640
something just a few meters beneath the
 

10847
03:16:20,640 --> 03:16:22,130
something just a few meters beneath the
surface it would have even greater

10848
03:16:22,130 --> 03:16:22,140
surface it would have even greater
 

10849
03:16:22,140 --> 03:16:24,349
surface it would have even greater
protection and so it raises the prospect

10850
03:16:24,349 --> 03:16:24,359
protection and so it raises the prospect
 

10851
03:16:24,359 --> 03:16:26,929
protection and so it raises the prospect
of that if we wanted to

10852
03:16:26,929 --> 03:16:26,939
of that if we wanted to
 

10853
03:16:26,939 --> 03:16:29,150
of that if we wanted to
send something a significant amount of

10854
03:16:29,150 --> 03:16:29,160
send something a significant amount of
 

10855
03:16:29,160 --> 03:16:31,610
send something a significant amount of
information to a future Galactic

10856
03:16:31,610 --> 03:16:31,620
information to a future Galactic
 

10857
03:16:31,620 --> 03:16:33,349
information to a future Galactic
spanning Civilization that maybe cracks

10858
03:16:33,349 --> 03:16:33,359
spanning Civilization that maybe cracks
 

10859
03:16:33,359 --> 03:16:35,090
spanning Civilization that maybe cracks
the interstellar proportion problem

10860
03:16:35,090 --> 03:16:35,100
the interstellar proportion problem
 

10861
03:16:35,100 --> 03:16:36,950
the interstellar proportion problem
the moon's going to be there for five

10862
03:16:36,950 --> 03:16:36,960
the moon's going to be there for five
 

10863
03:16:36,960 --> 03:16:40,429
the moon's going to be there for five
billion years that's a long time for

10864
03:16:40,429 --> 03:16:40,439
billion years that's a long time for
 

10865
03:16:40,439 --> 03:16:43,730
billion years that's a long time for
somebody to come by and detect maybe a

10866
03:16:43,730 --> 03:16:43,740
somebody to come by and detect maybe a
 

10867
03:16:43,740 --> 03:16:45,410
somebody to come by and detect maybe a
strange pattern that we draw on the sand

10868
03:16:45,410 --> 03:16:45,420
strange pattern that we draw on the sand
 

10869
03:16:45,420 --> 03:16:48,349
strange pattern that we draw on the sand
for them to you know big Arrow big cross

10870
03:16:48,349 --> 03:16:48,359
for them to you know big Arrow big cross
 

10871
03:16:48,359 --> 03:16:50,929
for them to you know big Arrow big cross
like look under here and we could have a

10872
03:16:50,929 --> 03:16:50,939
like look under here and we could have a
 

10873
03:16:50,939 --> 03:16:52,730
like look under here and we could have a
tomb of knowledge of some record of our

10874
03:16:52,730 --> 03:16:52,740
tomb of knowledge of some record of our
 

10875
03:16:52,740 --> 03:16:57,050
tomb of knowledge of some record of our
civilization and so I think it's uh when

10876
03:16:57,050 --> 03:16:57,060
civilization and so I think it's uh when
 

10877
03:16:57,060 --> 03:16:58,849
civilization and so I think it's uh when
you think like that what that implies to

10878
03:16:58,849 --> 03:16:58,859
you think like that what that implies to
 

10879
03:16:58,859 --> 03:17:01,610
you think like that what that implies to
us well okay the Galaxy's 13 billion

10880
03:17:01,610 --> 03:17:01,620
us well okay the Galaxy's 13 billion
 

10881
03:17:01,620 --> 03:17:03,590
us well okay the Galaxy's 13 billion
years old the Moon is already 4 billion

10882
03:17:03,590 --> 03:17:03,600
years old the Moon is already 4 billion
 

10883
03:17:03,600 --> 03:17:06,050
years old the Moon is already 4 billion
years old there may be places

10884
03:17:06,050 --> 03:17:06,060
years old there may be places
 

10885
03:17:06,060 --> 03:17:08,269
years old there may be places
familiar to Us nearby to us that we

10886
03:17:08,269 --> 03:17:08,279
familiar to Us nearby to us that we
 

10887
03:17:08,279 --> 03:17:10,790
familiar to Us nearby to us that we
should be seriously considering

10888
03:17:10,790 --> 03:17:10,800
should be seriously considering
 

10889
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:13,730
should be seriously considering
as places we should look for life and

10890
03:17:13,730 --> 03:17:13,740
as places we should look for life and
 

10891
03:17:13,740 --> 03:17:15,650
as places we should look for life and
intelligent life or evidence of relics

10892
03:17:15,650 --> 03:17:15,660
intelligent life or evidence of relics
 

10893
03:17:15,660 --> 03:17:17,510
intelligent life or evidence of relics
that they might leave behind for us so

10894
03:17:17,510 --> 03:17:17,520
that they might leave behind for us so
 

10895
03:17:17,520 --> 03:17:19,190
that they might leave behind for us so
that thinking like that will help us

10896
03:17:19,190 --> 03:17:19,200
that thinking like that will help us
 

10897
03:17:19,200 --> 03:17:23,510
that thinking like that will help us
find such relics and it's like uh it's a

10898
03:17:23,510 --> 03:17:23,520
find such relics and it's like uh it's a
 

10899
03:17:23,520 --> 03:17:26,030
find such relics and it's like uh it's a
like a beneficial cycle that happens yes

10900
03:17:26,030 --> 03:17:26,040
like a beneficial cycle that happens yes
 

10901
03:17:26,040 --> 03:17:28,429
like a beneficial cycle that happens yes
yeah exactly that enables the science of

10902
03:17:28,429 --> 03:17:28,439
yeah exactly that enables the science of
 

10903
03:17:28,439 --> 03:17:30,769
yeah exactly that enables the science of
said you better like of of searching for

10904
03:17:30,769 --> 03:17:30,779
said you better like of of searching for
 

10905
03:17:30,779 --> 03:17:33,349
said you better like of of searching for
bios and Tech signatures and so on yeah

10906
03:17:33,349 --> 03:17:33,359
bios and Tech signatures and so on yeah
 

10907
03:17:33,359 --> 03:17:35,929
bios and Tech signatures and so on yeah
and it's inspiring I mean it's it's it's

10908
03:17:35,929 --> 03:17:35,939
and it's inspiring I mean it's it's it's
 

10909
03:17:35,939 --> 03:17:37,370
and it's inspiring I mean it's it's it's
it's

10910
03:17:37,370 --> 03:17:37,380
it's
 

10911
03:17:37,380 --> 03:17:39,710
it's
it's also inspiring in that we want to

10912
03:17:39,710 --> 03:17:39,720
it's also inspiring in that we want to
 

10913
03:17:39,720 --> 03:17:40,610
it's also inspiring in that we want to
leave

10914
03:17:40,610 --> 03:17:40,620
leave
 

10915
03:17:40,620 --> 03:17:43,370
leave
a legacy behind as an entire

10916
03:17:43,370 --> 03:17:43,380
a legacy behind as an entire
 

10917
03:17:43,380 --> 03:17:45,769
a legacy behind as an entire
civilization not just in the symbols but

10918
03:17:45,769 --> 03:17:45,779
civilization not just in the symbols but
 

10919
03:17:45,779 --> 03:17:48,110
civilization not just in the symbols but
broadly speaking Yeah that's the last

10920
03:17:48,110 --> 03:17:48,120
broadly speaking Yeah that's the last
 

10921
03:17:48,120 --> 03:17:50,450
broadly speaking Yeah that's the last
thing somehow yeah and I'm part of a

10922
03:17:50,450 --> 03:17:50,460
thing somehow yeah and I'm part of a
 

10923
03:17:50,460 --> 03:17:52,330
thing somehow yeah and I'm part of a
team that's trying to

10924
03:17:52,330 --> 03:17:52,340
team that's trying to
 

10925
03:17:52,340 --> 03:17:54,769
team that's trying to
re-re repeat the golden record

10926
03:17:54,769 --> 03:17:54,779
re-re repeat the golden record
 

10927
03:17:54,779 --> 03:17:56,809
re-re repeat the golden record
experiment uh we're trying to create

10928
03:17:56,809 --> 03:17:56,819
experiment uh we're trying to create
 

10929
03:17:56,819 --> 03:17:58,429
experiment uh we're trying to create
like an open source version of the

10930
03:17:58,429 --> 03:17:58,439
like an open source version of the
 

10931
03:17:58,439 --> 03:18:00,349
like an open source version of the
golden record the future spacecraft are

10932
03:18:00,349 --> 03:18:00,359
golden record the future spacecraft are
 

10933
03:18:00,359 --> 03:18:02,750
golden record the future spacecraft are
able to download and basically put a

10934
03:18:02,750 --> 03:18:02,760
able to download and basically put a
 

10935
03:18:02,760 --> 03:18:04,070
able to download and basically put a
little hard drive so they can carry

10936
03:18:04,070 --> 03:18:04,080
little hard drive so they can carry
 

10937
03:18:04,080 --> 03:18:05,870
little hard drive so they can carry
around with them and you know get these

10938
03:18:05,870 --> 03:18:05,880
around with them and you know get these
 

10939
03:18:05,880 --> 03:18:07,790
around with them and you know get these
distributed hopefully across the solar

10940
03:18:07,790 --> 03:18:07,800
distributed hopefully across the solar
 

10941
03:18:07,800 --> 03:18:09,950
distributed hopefully across the solar
system eventually and it's going to be

10942
03:18:09,950 --> 03:18:09,960
system eventually and it's going to be
 

10943
03:18:09,960 --> 03:18:11,389
system eventually and it's going to be
called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the

10944
03:18:11,389 --> 03:18:11,399
called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
 

10945
03:18:11,399 --> 03:18:13,429
called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy yeah it could be that's a good

10946
03:18:13,429 --> 03:18:13,439
Galaxy yeah it could be that's a good
 

10947
03:18:13,439 --> 03:18:15,590
Galaxy yeah it could be that's a good
name for it we've we've been talking a

10948
03:18:15,590 --> 03:18:15,600
name for it we've we've been talking a
 

10949
03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:16,370
name for it we've we've been talking a
little bit with the name but I think

10950
03:18:16,370 --> 03:18:16,380
little bit with the name but I think
 

10951
03:18:16,380 --> 03:18:17,809
little bit with the name but I think
probably just be golden record at this

10952
03:18:17,809 --> 03:18:17,819
probably just be golden record at this
 

10953
03:18:17,819 --> 03:18:19,130
probably just be golden record at this
point I've got record version two or

10954
03:18:19,130 --> 03:18:19,140
point I've got record version two or
 

10955
03:18:19,140 --> 03:18:20,510
point I've got record version two or
something but

10956
03:18:20,510 --> 03:18:20,520
something but
 

10957
03:18:20,520 --> 03:18:23,870
something but
um I think uh I think another benefit

10958
03:18:23,870 --> 03:18:23,880
um I think uh I think another benefit
 

10959
03:18:23,880 --> 03:18:26,090
um I think uh I think another benefit
that I see of this activity

10960
03:18:26,090 --> 03:18:26,100
that I see of this activity
 

10961
03:18:26,100 --> 03:18:29,690
that I see of this activity
is that it forces us as a species

10962
03:18:29,690 --> 03:18:29,700
is that it forces us as a species
 

10963
03:18:29,700 --> 03:18:32,389
is that it forces us as a species
to ask those questions about what it is

10964
03:18:32,389 --> 03:18:32,399
to ask those questions about what it is
 

10965
03:18:32,399 --> 03:18:34,429
to ask those questions about what it is
that we want under the civilization to

10966
03:18:34,429 --> 03:18:34,439
that we want under the civilization to
 

10967
03:18:34,439 --> 03:18:36,710
that we want under the civilization to
know about us the god record was kind of

10968
03:18:36,710 --> 03:18:36,720
know about us the god record was kind of
 

10969
03:18:36,720 --> 03:18:39,650
know about us the god record was kind of
funny because it had photos on it and it

10970
03:18:39,650 --> 03:18:39,660
funny because it had photos on it and it
 

10971
03:18:39,660 --> 03:18:42,469
funny because it had photos on it and it
had photos of people eating for instance

10972
03:18:42,469 --> 03:18:42,479
had photos of people eating for instance
 

10973
03:18:42,479 --> 03:18:44,030
had photos of people eating for instance
um but it had no photos of people

10974
03:18:44,030 --> 03:18:44,040
um but it had no photos of people
 

10975
03:18:44,040 --> 03:18:46,550
um but it had no photos of people
defecating and so I always thought that

10976
03:18:46,550 --> 03:18:46,560
defecating and so I always thought that
 

10977
03:18:46,560 --> 03:18:48,469
defecating and so I always thought that
was kind of funny because of her post

10978
03:18:48,469 --> 03:18:48,479
was kind of funny because of her post
 

10979
03:18:48,479 --> 03:18:50,990
was kind of funny because of her post
if I was an alien yeah or if I was

10980
03:18:50,990 --> 03:18:51,000
if I was an alien yeah or if I was
 

10981
03:18:51,000 --> 03:18:53,630
if I was an alien yeah or if I was
studying an alien if I saw images from

10982
03:18:53,630 --> 03:18:53,640
studying an alien if I saw images from
 

10983
03:18:53,640 --> 03:18:55,370
studying an alien if I saw images from
an alien I wouldn't I'm not trying to be

10984
03:18:55,370 --> 03:18:55,380
an alien I wouldn't I'm not trying to be
 

10985
03:18:55,380 --> 03:18:56,630
an alien I wouldn't I'm not trying to be
like a perv or anything but I would want

10986
03:18:56,630 --> 03:18:56,640
like a perv or anything but I would want
 

10987
03:18:56,640 --> 03:18:57,889
like a perv or anything but I would want
to see the full Bible I want to

10988
03:18:57,889 --> 03:18:57,899
to see the full Bible I want to
 

10989
03:18:57,899 --> 03:18:59,990
to see the full Bible I want to
understand the biology of that alien and

10990
03:18:59,990 --> 03:19:00,000
understand the biology of that alien and
 

10991
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:03,650
understand the biology of that alien and
so we we always censor what we what we

10992
03:19:03,650 --> 03:19:03,660
so we we always censor what we what we
 

10993
03:19:03,660 --> 03:19:05,030
so we we always censor what we what we
show

10994
03:19:05,030 --> 03:19:05,040
show
 

10995
03:19:05,040 --> 03:19:06,950
show
um and which was just show the whole

10996
03:19:06,950 --> 03:19:06,960
um and which was just show the whole
 

10997
03:19:06,960 --> 03:19:09,710
um and which was just show the whole
actual natural process and then also say

10998
03:19:09,710 --> 03:19:09,720
actual natural process and then also say
 

10999
03:19:09,720 --> 03:19:12,349
actual natural process and then also say
we humans tend to censor these things we

11000
03:19:12,349 --> 03:19:12,359
we humans tend to censor these things we
 

11001
03:19:12,359 --> 03:19:14,210
we humans tend to censor these things we
tend to not like to walk around naked we

11002
03:19:14,210 --> 03:19:14,220
tend to not like to walk around naked we
 

11003
03:19:14,220 --> 03:19:17,450
tend to not like to walk around naked we
tend to not to talk about uh some of the

11004
03:19:17,450 --> 03:19:17,460
tend to not to talk about uh some of the
 

11005
03:19:17,460 --> 03:19:19,790
tend to not to talk about uh some of the
natural biological phenomena and talk a

11006
03:19:19,790 --> 03:19:19,800
natural biological phenomena and talk a
 

11007
03:19:19,800 --> 03:19:21,950
natural biological phenomena and talk a
lot about others yeah and and actually

11008
03:19:21,950 --> 03:19:21,960
lot about others yeah and and actually
 

11009
03:19:21,960 --> 03:19:24,590
lot about others yeah and and actually
just be very uh like the way you would

11010
03:19:24,590 --> 03:19:24,600
just be very uh like the way you would
 

11011
03:19:24,600 --> 03:19:26,030
just be very uh like the way you would
be to a therapist or something very

11012
03:19:26,030 --> 03:19:26,040
be to a therapist or something very
 

11013
03:19:26,040 --> 03:19:27,410
be to a therapist or something very
transparent about the way we actually

11014
03:19:27,410 --> 03:19:27,420
transparent about the way we actually
 

11015
03:19:27,420 --> 03:19:29,750
transparent about the way we actually
operate yeah I mean and Sagan had that

11016
03:19:29,750 --> 03:19:29,760
operate yeah I mean and Sagan had that
 

11017
03:19:29,760 --> 03:19:30,590
operate yeah I mean and Sagan had that
has second had that with the golden

11018
03:19:30,590 --> 03:19:30,600
has second had that with the golden
 

11019
03:19:30,600 --> 03:19:32,990
has second had that with the golden
record I think he he originally uh

11020
03:19:32,990 --> 03:19:33,000
record I think he he originally uh
 

11021
03:19:33,000 --> 03:19:34,130
record I think he he originally uh
there's a there's a male and a female

11022
03:19:34,130 --> 03:19:34,140
there's a there's a male and a female
 

11023
03:19:34,140 --> 03:19:36,590
there's a there's a male and a female
figure depicts on the golden record

11024
03:19:36,590 --> 03:19:36,600
figure depicts on the golden record
 

11025
03:19:36,600 --> 03:19:39,830
figure depicts on the golden record
and the the woman had a genitalia

11026
03:19:39,830 --> 03:19:39,840
and the the woman had a genitalia
 

11027
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:42,530
and the the woman had a genitalia
originally drawn and uh there was a lot

11028
03:19:42,530 --> 03:19:42,540
originally drawn and uh there was a lot
 

11029
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:44,269
originally drawn and uh there was a lot
of pushback from I think a lot of

11030
03:19:44,269 --> 03:19:44,279
of pushback from I think a lot of
 

11031
03:19:44,279 --> 03:19:45,590
of pushback from I think a lot of
Christian groups who were not happy

11032
03:19:45,590 --> 03:19:45,600
Christian groups who were not happy
 

11033
03:19:45,600 --> 03:19:47,929
Christian groups who were not happy
about the idea of throwing this into

11034
03:19:47,929 --> 03:19:47,939
about the idea of throwing this into
 

11035
03:19:47,939 --> 03:19:50,330
about the idea of throwing this into
space And So eventually they had to

11036
03:19:50,330 --> 03:19:50,340
space And So eventually they had to
 

11037
03:19:50,340 --> 03:19:53,389
space And So eventually they had to
remove that and so it's it would be

11038
03:19:53,389 --> 03:19:53,399
remove that and so it's it would be
 

11039
03:19:53,399 --> 03:19:55,730
remove that and so it's it would be
confusing biologically if you're you

11040
03:19:55,730 --> 03:19:55,740
confusing biologically if you're you
 

11041
03:19:55,740 --> 03:19:57,889
confusing biologically if you're you
know trying to study xenobiology of this

11042
03:19:57,889 --> 03:19:57,899
know trying to study xenobiology of this
 

11043
03:19:57,899 --> 03:20:00,950
know trying to study xenobiology of this
alien that apparently has no genitalia

11044
03:20:00,950 --> 03:20:00,960
alien that apparently has no genitalia
 

11045
03:20:00,960 --> 03:20:02,809
alien that apparently has no genitalia
or demanders but for some reason the

11046
03:20:02,809 --> 03:20:02,819
or demanders but for some reason the
 

11047
03:20:02,819 --> 03:20:04,670
or demanders but for some reason the
woman doesn't you know and that's our

11048
03:20:04,670 --> 03:20:04,680
woman doesn't you know and that's our
 

11049
03:20:04,680 --> 03:20:08,630
woman doesn't you know and that's our
that's our own societal and cultural uh

11050
03:20:08,630 --> 03:20:08,640
that's our own societal and cultural uh
 

11051
03:20:08,640 --> 03:20:10,570
that's our own societal and cultural uh
imprint happening into that information

11052
03:20:10,570 --> 03:20:10,580
imprint happening into that information
 

11053
03:20:10,580 --> 03:20:13,309
imprint happening into that information
that's to be fair

11054
03:20:13,309 --> 03:20:13,319
that's to be fair
 

11055
03:20:13,319 --> 03:20:15,290
that's to be fair
just even having

11056
03:20:15,290 --> 03:20:15,300
just even having
 

11057
03:20:15,300 --> 03:20:18,710
just even having
two Sexes and predators and prey just a

11058
03:20:18,710 --> 03:20:18,720
two Sexes and predators and prey just a
 

11059
03:20:18,720 --> 03:20:20,090
two Sexes and predators and prey just a
whole that could be just a very unique

11060
03:20:20,090 --> 03:20:20,100
whole that could be just a very unique
 

11061
03:20:20,100 --> 03:20:21,230
whole that could be just a very unique
Earth-like thing so they might be

11062
03:20:21,230 --> 03:20:21,240
Earth-like thing so they might be
 

11063
03:20:21,240 --> 03:20:23,750
Earth-like thing so they might be
confused about why there's like pairs of

11064
03:20:23,750 --> 03:20:23,760
confused about why there's like pairs of
 

11065
03:20:23,760 --> 03:20:26,870
confused about why there's like pairs of
things like why are you like why why is

03:20:26,870 --> 03:20:26,880
things like why are you like why why is
 

11067
03:20:26,880 --> 03:20:29,630

there a man and a woman in general like

11068
03:20:29,630 --> 03:20:29,640
there a man and a woman in general like
 

11069
03:20:29,640 --> 03:20:31,490
there a man and a woman in general like
they they could be I mean they could be

they they could be I mean they could be
 

11071
03:20:31,500 --> 03:20:33,230
they they could be I mean they could be
confused about a lot of things in

11072
03:20:33,230 --> 03:20:33,240
confused about a lot of things in
 

11073
03:20:33,240 --> 03:20:35,030
confused about a lot of things in
general I don't I don't think the I

03:20:35,030 --> 03:20:35,040
general I don't I don't think the I
 

11075
03:20:35,040 --> 03:20:36,349
general I don't I don't think the I
don't even know which way to hold the

03:20:36,349 --> 03:20:36,359
don't even know which way to hold the
 

11077

don't even know which way to hold the
pigs

11078
03:20:37,450 --> 03:20:37,460
pigs
 

11079
03:20:37,460 --> 03:20:39,950
pigs
or there's the picture they don't they

11080
03:20:39,950 --> 03:20:39,960
or there's the picture they don't they
 

11081
03:20:39,960 --> 03:20:41,389
or there's the picture they don't they
might not need they might have very

11082
03:20:41,389 --> 03:20:41,399
might not need they might have very
 

11083
03:20:41,399 --> 03:20:43,010
might not need they might have very
different sensory devices to even

11084
03:20:43,010 --> 03:20:43,020
different sensory devices to even
 

11085
03:20:43,020 --> 03:20:44,750
different sensory devices to even
interpret them if they only you know

11086
03:20:44,750 --> 03:20:44,760
interpret them if they only you know
 

11087
03:20:44,760 --> 03:20:46,730
interpret them if they only you know
have uh sound is our only way of

11088
03:20:46,730 --> 03:20:46,740
have uh sound is our only way of
 

11089
03:20:46,740 --> 03:20:49,070
have uh sound is our only way of
navigating the world it's kind of lost

navigating the world it's kind of lost

to send any kind of you know there's

11092
03:20:50,750 --> 03:20:50,760
to send any kind of you know there's
 

11093
03:20:50,760 --> 03:20:51,889
to send any kind of you know there's
been a lot of conversation about sending

11094
03:20:51,889 --> 03:20:51,899
been a lot of conversation about sending
 

11095
03:20:51,899 --> 03:20:55,370
been a lot of conversation about sending
video and uh audio and uh video and

11096
03:20:55,370 --> 03:20:55,380
video and uh audio and uh video and
 

11097
03:20:55,380 --> 03:20:56,929
video and uh audio and uh video and
pictures and I've that's one of the

11098
03:20:56,929 --> 03:20:56,939
pictures and I've that's one of the
 

11099
03:20:56,939 --> 03:20:58,969
pictures and I've that's one of the
things I've been a little bit resistant

11100
03:20:58,969 --> 03:20:58,979
things I've been a little bit resistant
 

11101
03:20:58,979 --> 03:21:00,530
things I've been a little bit resistant
about in the team that I've been

11102
03:21:00,530 --> 03:21:00,540
about in the team that I've been
 

11103
03:21:00,540 --> 03:21:01,670
about in the team that I've been
thinking well

11104
03:21:01,670 --> 03:21:01,680
thinking well
 

11105
03:21:01,680 --> 03:21:04,849
thinking well
they might have eyes and so if you lived

11106
03:21:04,849 --> 03:21:04,859
they might have eyes and so if you lived
 

11107
03:21:04,859 --> 03:21:07,550
they might have eyes and so if you lived
in um on the Europa surface having eyes

11108
03:21:07,550 --> 03:21:07,560
in um on the Europa surface having eyes
 

11109
03:21:07,560 --> 03:21:09,830
in um on the Europa surface having eyes
wouldn't be very useful

11110
03:21:09,830 --> 03:21:09,840
wouldn't be very useful
 

11111
03:21:09,840 --> 03:21:11,630
wouldn't be very useful
um if you lived in a on a very dark

11112
03:21:11,630 --> 03:21:11,640
um if you lived in a on a very dark
 

11113
03:21:11,640 --> 03:21:13,790
um if you lived in a on a very dark
planet on the Tidy locked night side of

11114
03:21:13,790 --> 03:21:13,800
planet on the Tidy locked night side of
 

11115
03:21:13,800 --> 03:21:15,410
planet on the Tidy locked night side of
an exoplanet having eyes would be

11116
03:21:15,410 --> 03:21:15,420
an exoplanet having eyes would be
 

11117
03:21:15,420 --> 03:21:17,150
an exoplanet having eyes would be
particularly useful so it's kind of a

11118
03:21:17,150 --> 03:21:17,160
particularly useful so it's kind of a
 

11119
03:21:17,160 --> 03:21:19,429
particularly useful so it's kind of a
presumption of us to think that video is

11120
03:21:19,429 --> 03:21:19,439
presumption of us to think that video is
 

11121
03:21:19,439 --> 03:21:22,010
presumption of us to think that video is
a useful form of communication

11122
03:21:22,010 --> 03:21:22,020
a useful form of communication
 

11123
03:21:22,020 --> 03:21:24,170
a useful form of communication
do you hope we become a multi-planetary

11124
03:21:24,170 --> 03:21:24,180
do you hope we become a multi-planetary
 

11125
03:21:24,180 --> 03:21:26,690
do you hope we become a multi-planetary
species so we almost sneaking up to that

11126
03:21:26,690 --> 03:21:26,700
species so we almost sneaking up to that
 

11127
03:21:26,700 --> 03:21:29,450
species so we almost sneaking up to that
but um you know the efforts of SpaceX of

11128
03:21:29,450 --> 03:21:29,460
but um you know the efforts of SpaceX of
 

11129
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:31,849
but um you know the efforts of SpaceX of
Elon maybe in general what your thoughts

11130
03:21:31,849 --> 03:21:31,859
Elon maybe in general what your thoughts
 

11131
03:21:31,859 --> 03:21:33,769
Elon maybe in general what your thoughts
are about those efforts so you already

11132
03:21:33,769 --> 03:21:33,779
are about those efforts so you already
 

11133
03:21:33,779 --> 03:21:35,210
are about those efforts so you already
mentioned Starship will be very

11134
03:21:35,210 --> 03:21:35,220
mentioned Starship will be very
 

11135
03:21:35,220 --> 03:21:36,889
mentioned Starship will be very
interesting for astronomy for for

11136
03:21:36,889 --> 03:21:36,899
interesting for astronomy for for
 

11137
03:21:36,899 --> 03:21:39,050
interesting for astronomy for for
science in general just getting stuff

11138
03:21:39,050 --> 03:21:39,060

11139
03:21:39,060 --> 03:21:40,490

11140
03:21:40,490 --> 03:21:40,500
out into space
 

11141
03:21:40,500 --> 03:21:43,010
out into space
but what about the longer term goal of

11142
03:21:43,010 --> 03:21:43,020
but what about the longer term goal of
 

11143
03:21:43,020 --> 03:21:45,230
but what about the longer term goal of
actually colonizing of building

11144
03:21:45,230 --> 03:21:45,240
actually colonizing of building
 

11145
03:21:45,240 --> 03:21:47,570
actually colonizing of building
civilizations on other surfaces on moons

11146
03:21:47,570 --> 03:21:47,580
civilizations on other surfaces on moons
 

11147
03:21:47,580 --> 03:21:50,870
civilizations on other surfaces on moons
on planets it seems like an a fairly

11148
03:21:50,870 --> 03:21:50,880
on planets it seems like an a fairly
 

11149
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:52,250
on planets it seems like an a fairly
obvious thing to do for our survival

11150
03:21:52,250 --> 03:21:52,260
obvious thing to do for our survival
 

11151
03:21:52,260 --> 03:21:57,050
obvious thing to do for our survival
right there's a high risk if if we are

11152
03:21:57,050 --> 03:21:57,060
right there's a high risk if if we are
 

11153
03:21:57,060 --> 03:21:59,150
right there's a high risk if if we are
committed to trying to keep this human

11154
03:21:59,150 --> 03:21:59,160
committed to trying to keep this human
 

11155
03:21:59,160 --> 03:22:01,429
committed to trying to keep this human
experiment going

11156
03:22:01,429 --> 03:22:01,439
experiment going
 

11157
03:22:01,439 --> 03:22:02,929
experiment going
um putting all of our eggs in one basket

11158
03:22:02,929 --> 03:22:02,939
um putting all of our eggs in one basket
 

11159
03:22:02,939 --> 03:22:06,290
um putting all of our eggs in one basket
is always going to be a risky strategy

11160
03:22:06,290 --> 03:22:06,300
is always going to be a risky strategy
 

11161
03:22:06,300 --> 03:22:08,330
is always going to be a risky strategy
to pursue it's a nice basket though but

11162
03:22:08,330 --> 03:22:08,340
to pursue it's a nice basket though but
 

11163
03:22:08,340 --> 03:22:10,070
to pursue it's a nice basket though but
yeah it is a beautiful basket I wouldn't

11164
03:22:10,070 --> 03:22:10,080
yeah it is a beautiful basket I wouldn't
 

11165
03:22:10,080 --> 03:22:12,170
yeah it is a beautiful basket I wouldn't
want to I personally have no interest in

11166
03:22:12,170 --> 03:22:12,180
want to I personally have no interest in
 

11167
03:22:12,180 --> 03:22:14,210
want to I personally have no interest in
living on mars or the moon I would like

11168
03:22:14,210 --> 03:22:14,220
living on mars or the moon I would like
 

11169
03:22:14,220 --> 03:22:16,849
living on mars or the moon I would like
to visit but I would definitely not want

11170
03:22:16,849 --> 03:22:16,859
to visit but I would definitely not want
 

11171
03:22:16,859 --> 03:22:18,530
to visit but I would definitely not want
to spend the rest of my life and die on

11172
03:22:18,530 --> 03:22:18,540
to spend the rest of my life and die on
 

11173
03:22:18,540 --> 03:22:22,130
to spend the rest of my life and die on
Mars it's a it means a hell hole Mars is

11174
03:22:22,130 --> 03:22:22,140
Mars it's a it means a hell hole Mars is
 

11175
03:22:22,140 --> 03:22:24,469
Mars it's a it means a hell hole Mars is
a very very diff I think the idea this

11176
03:22:24,469 --> 03:22:24,479
a very very diff I think the idea this
 

11177
03:22:24,479 --> 03:22:26,809
a very very diff I think the idea this
is going to happen in the next you know

11178
03:22:26,809 --> 03:22:26,819
is going to happen in the next you know
 

11179
03:22:26,819 --> 03:22:29,030
is going to happen in the next you know
10 20 years is seems to me very

11180
03:22:29,030 --> 03:22:29,040
10 20 years is seems to me very
 

11181
03:22:29,040 --> 03:22:30,889
10 20 years is seems to me very
optimistic

11182
03:22:30,889 --> 03:22:30,899
optimistic
 

11183
03:22:30,899 --> 03:22:34,670
optimistic
um not that it's insurmountable but the

11184
03:22:34,670 --> 03:22:34,680
um not that it's insurmountable but the
 

11185
03:22:34,680 --> 03:22:37,250
um not that it's insurmountable but the
the challenges are extreme to survive on

11186
03:22:37,250 --> 03:22:37,260
the challenges are extreme to survive on
 

11187
03:22:37,260 --> 03:22:38,990
the challenges are extreme to survive on
a planet like Mars which is you know

11188
03:22:38,990 --> 03:22:39,000
a planet like Mars which is you know
 

11189
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:41,809
a planet like Mars which is you know
like a dry Frozen desert

11190
03:22:41,809 --> 03:22:41,819
like a dry Frozen desert
 

11191
03:22:41,819 --> 03:22:43,969
like a dry Frozen desert
um with a high radiation environment

11192
03:22:43,969 --> 03:22:43,979
um with a high radiation environment
 

11193
03:22:43,979 --> 03:22:46,849
um with a high radiation environment
it's it's a challenge of a type we've

11194
03:22:46,849 --> 03:22:46,859
it's it's a challenge of a type we've
 

11195
03:22:46,859 --> 03:22:49,070
it's it's a challenge of a type we've
never faced before so it's I'm sure

11196
03:22:49,070 --> 03:22:49,080
never faced before so it's I'm sure
 

11197
03:22:49,080 --> 03:22:52,130
never faced before so it's I'm sure
human Ingenuity can tackle it but I'm

11198
03:22:52,130 --> 03:22:52,140
human Ingenuity can tackle it but I'm
 

11199
03:22:52,140 --> 03:22:53,870
human Ingenuity can tackle it but I'm
skeptical that we'll have thousands of

11200
03:22:53,870 --> 03:22:53,880
skeptical that we'll have thousands of
 

11201
03:22:53,880 --> 03:22:56,450
skeptical that we'll have thousands of
people living on Mars in my lifetime but

11202
03:22:56,450 --> 03:22:56,460
people living on Mars in my lifetime but
 

11203
03:22:56,460 --> 03:22:59,570
people living on Mars in my lifetime but
I would I would would relish that

11204
03:22:59,570 --> 03:22:59,580
I would I would would relish that
 

11205
03:22:59,580 --> 03:23:02,870
I would I would would relish that
opportunity to maybe one day visit such

11206
03:23:02,870 --> 03:23:02,880
opportunity to maybe one day visit such
 

11207
03:23:02,880 --> 03:23:06,530
opportunity to maybe one day visit such
a settlement and you know do scientific

do astronomy from you know all sorts of

11212
03:23:10,550 --> 03:23:10,560
do astronomy from you know all sorts of
 

11213

do astronomy from you know all sorts of
cool stuff you could do

11214

cool stuff you could do
 

11215
03:23:12,540 --> 03:23:13,910
cool stuff you could do
um you know sometimes you see these

11216
03:23:13,910 --> 03:23:13,920
um you know sometimes you see these
 

11217
03:23:13,920 --> 03:23:15,889
um you know sometimes you see these
dreams of outer solar system exploration

11218
03:23:15,889 --> 03:23:15,899
dreams of outer solar system exploration
 

11219
03:23:15,899 --> 03:23:18,410
dreams of outer solar system exploration
and you can like fly through the clouds

11220
03:23:18,410 --> 03:23:18,420
and you can like fly through the clouds
 

11221
03:23:18,420 --> 03:23:21,710
and you can like fly through the clouds
of Venus or you could just do these

03:23:21,710 --> 03:23:21,720
of Venus or you could just do these
 

11223
03:23:21,720 --> 03:23:23,990
of Venus or you could just do these
enormous jumps on like these small moons

11224
03:23:23,990 --> 03:23:24,000
enormous jumps on like these small moons
 

11225
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:25,610
enormous jumps on like these small moons
where you can essentially jump as high

11226
03:23:25,610 --> 03:23:25,620
where you can essentially jump as high
 

11227
03:23:25,620 --> 03:23:27,889

ice skating on Europa it might be fun so

11232
03:23:31,910 --> 03:23:31,920
ice skating on Europa it might be fun so
 

11233
03:23:31,920 --> 03:23:33,590
ice skating on Europa it might be fun so
don't get me wrong I love the idea of us

11234
03:23:33,590 --> 03:23:33,600
don't get me wrong I love the idea of us
 

11235
03:23:33,600 --> 03:23:36,410
don't get me wrong I love the idea of us
becoming into planetary I think it's

11236
03:23:36,410 --> 03:23:36,420
becoming into planetary I think it's
 

11237
03:23:36,420 --> 03:23:36,950
becoming into planetary I think it's
um

11238
03:23:36,950 --> 03:23:36,960
um
 

11239
03:23:36,960 --> 03:23:40,490
um
it's just a question of uh time our own

11240
03:23:40,490 --> 03:23:40,500
it's just a question of uh time our own
 

11241
03:23:40,500 --> 03:23:44,690
it's just a question of uh time our own
our own destructive Tendencies uh as you

11242
03:23:44,690 --> 03:23:44,700
our own destructive Tendencies uh as you
 

11243
03:23:44,700 --> 03:23:47,450
our own destructive Tendencies uh as you
said earlier are add-ons with our

11244
03:23:47,450 --> 03:23:47,460
said earlier are add-ons with our
 

11245
03:23:47,460 --> 03:23:49,910
said earlier are add-ons with our
emerging capability to become

11246
03:23:49,910 --> 03:23:49,920
emerging capability to become
 

11247
03:23:49,920 --> 03:23:52,070
emerging capability to become
interplanetary and the question is will

11248
03:23:52,070 --> 03:23:52,080
interplanetary and the question is will
 

11249
03:23:52,080 --> 03:23:54,229
interplanetary and the question is will
we get out of the nest before we burn it

11250
03:23:54,229 --> 03:23:54,239
we get out of the nest before we burn it
 

11251
03:23:54,239 --> 03:23:57,590
we get out of the nest before we burn it
down and I don't know I obviously I hope

11252
03:23:57,590 --> 03:23:57,600
down and I don't know I obviously I hope
 

11253
03:23:57,600 --> 03:24:00,410
down and I don't know I obviously I hope
that we do but I I don't have any

11254
03:24:00,410 --> 03:24:00,420
that we do but I I don't have any
 

11255
03:24:00,420 --> 03:24:02,389
that we do but I I don't have any
special Insight that

11256
03:24:02,389 --> 03:24:02,399
special Insight that
 

11257
03:24:02,399 --> 03:24:05,990
special Insight that
there is a prop there is somewhat of a

11258
03:24:05,990 --> 03:24:06,000
there is a prop there is somewhat of a
 

11259
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:08,389
there is a prop there is somewhat of a
gnoring intellectual itch I have with

11260
03:24:08,389 --> 03:24:08,399
gnoring intellectual itch I have with
 

11261
03:24:08,399 --> 03:24:11,510
gnoring intellectual itch I have with
the so-called doomsday argument which

11262
03:24:11,510 --> 03:24:11,520
the so-called doomsday argument which
 

11263
03:24:11,520 --> 03:24:14,269
the so-called doomsday argument which
um I try not to treat too seriously but

11264
03:24:14,269 --> 03:24:14,279
um I try not to treat too seriously but
 

11265
03:24:14,279 --> 03:24:15,889
um I try not to treat too seriously but
there is some element of it that bothers

11266
03:24:15,889 --> 03:24:15,899
there is some element of it that bothers
 

11267
03:24:15,899 --> 03:24:18,490
there is some element of it that bothers
me uh the Dooms argument basically

11268
03:24:18,490 --> 03:24:18,500
me uh the Dooms argument basically
 

11269
03:24:18,500 --> 03:24:20,630
me uh the Dooms argument basically
suggests that

11270
03:24:20,630 --> 03:24:20,640
suggests that
 

11271
03:24:20,640 --> 03:24:22,610
suggests that
you know you're typically the mediocrity

11272
03:24:22,610 --> 03:24:22,620
you know you're typically the mediocrity
 

11273
03:24:22,620 --> 03:24:24,590
you know you're typically the mediocrity
principal you're not special that you're

11274
03:24:24,590 --> 03:24:24,600
principal you're not special that you're
 

11275
03:24:24,600 --> 03:24:25,729
principal you're not special that you're
probably going to be born somewhere in

11276
03:24:25,729 --> 03:24:25,739
probably going to be born somewhere in
 

11277
03:24:25,739 --> 03:24:27,290
probably going to be born somewhere in
the middle of all human beings will ever

11278
03:24:27,290 --> 03:24:27,300
the middle of all human beings will ever
 

11279
03:24:27,300 --> 03:24:29,750
the middle of all human beings will ever
be born you're unlikely to be one of the

11280
03:24:29,750 --> 03:24:29,760
be born you're unlikely to be one of the
 

11281
03:24:29,760 --> 03:24:31,250
be born you're unlikely to be one of the
first one percent of human beings that

11282
03:24:31,250 --> 03:24:31,260
first one percent of human beings that
 

11283
03:24:31,260 --> 03:24:32,870
first one percent of human beings that
ever lived and then one of the last ones

11284
03:24:32,870 --> 03:24:32,880
ever lived and then one of the last ones
 

11285
03:24:32,880 --> 03:24:34,610
ever lived and then one of the last ones
and similarly the last one percent of

11286
03:24:34,610 --> 03:24:34,620
and similarly the last one percent of
 

11287
03:24:34,620 --> 03:24:36,710
and similarly the last one percent of
human beings because you'd be very

11288
03:24:36,710 --> 03:24:36,720
human beings because you'd be very
 

11289
03:24:36,720 --> 03:24:38,870
human beings because you'd be very
unique and special if that were true

11290
03:24:38,870 --> 03:24:38,880
unique and special if that were true
 

11291
03:24:38,880 --> 03:24:41,150
unique and special if that were true
and so by this logic you can sort of

11292
03:24:41,150 --> 03:24:41,160
and so by this logic you can sort of
 

11293
03:24:41,160 --> 03:24:43,250
and so by this logic you can sort of
calculate um how many generations of

11294
03:24:43,250 --> 03:24:43,260
calculate um how many generations of
 

11295
03:24:43,260 --> 03:24:44,690
calculate um how many generations of
humans you might expect so if there's

11296
03:24:44,690 --> 03:24:44,700
humans you might expect so if there's
 

11297
03:24:44,700 --> 03:24:46,910
humans you might expect so if there's
been let's say 100 billion human beings

11298
03:24:46,910 --> 03:24:46,920
been let's say 100 billion human beings
 

11299
03:24:46,920 --> 03:24:49,309
been let's say 100 billion human beings
that have ever lived on this planet then

11300
03:24:49,309 --> 03:24:49,319
that have ever lived on this planet then
 

11301
03:24:49,319 --> 03:24:52,490
that have ever lived on this planet then
you could say to 95 confidence so you

11302
03:24:52,490 --> 03:24:52,500
you could say to 95 confidence so you
 

11303
03:24:52,500 --> 03:24:55,190
you could say to 95 confidence so you
divide by five percent so a hundred

11304
03:24:55,190 --> 03:24:55,200
divide by five percent so a hundred
 

11305
03:24:55,200 --> 03:24:57,110
divide by five percent so a hundred
billion divided by 0.05 would give you 2

11306
03:24:57,110 --> 03:24:57,120
billion divided by 0.05 would give you 2
 

11307
03:24:57,120 --> 03:24:58,490
billion divided by 0.05 would give you 2
trillion human beings that would ever

11308
03:24:58,490 --> 03:24:58,500
trillion human beings that would ever
 

11309
03:24:58,500 --> 03:24:59,389
trillion human beings that would ever
live

11310
03:24:59,389 --> 03:24:59,399
live
 

11311
03:24:59,399 --> 03:25:02,690
live
you'd expect by this argument and so if

11312
03:25:02,690 --> 03:25:02,700
you'd expect by this argument and so if
 

11313
03:25:02,700 --> 03:25:03,530
you'd expect by this argument and so if
each

11314
03:25:03,530 --> 03:25:03,540
each
 

11315
03:25:03,540 --> 03:25:06,950
each
um if let's say each each planet in

11316
03:25:06,950 --> 03:25:06,960
um if let's say each each planet in
 

11317
03:25:06,960 --> 03:25:08,210
um if let's say each each planet in
general the planet has a 10 billion

11318
03:25:08,210 --> 03:25:08,220
general the planet has a 10 billion
 

11319
03:25:08,220 --> 03:25:11,330
general the planet has a 10 billion
population so that would be 200

11320
03:25:11,330 --> 03:25:11,340
population so that would be 200
 

11321
03:25:11,340 --> 03:25:13,490
population so that would be 200
generations of humans we would expect

11322
03:25:13,490 --> 03:25:13,500
generations of humans we would expect
 

11323
03:25:13,500 --> 03:25:16,429
generations of humans we would expect
ahead of us and if each one has an

11324
03:25:16,429 --> 03:25:16,439
ahead of us and if each one has an
 

11325
03:25:16,439 --> 03:25:17,750
ahead of us and if each one has an
average lifetime let's say 100 years

11326
03:25:17,750 --> 03:25:17,760
average lifetime let's say 100 years
 

11327
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:19,969
average lifetime let's say 100 years
then that would be about 20 000 years so

11328
03:25:19,969 --> 03:25:19,979
then that would be about 20 000 years so
 

11329
03:25:19,979 --> 03:25:21,650
then that would be about 20 000 years so
there's 20 000 years left in the clock

11330
03:25:21,650 --> 03:25:21,660
there's 20 000 years left in the clock
 

11331
03:25:21,660 --> 03:25:23,750
there's 20 000 years left in the clock
there's like a typical doomsday argument

11332
03:25:23,750 --> 03:25:23,760
there's like a typical doomsday argument
 

11333
03:25:23,760 --> 03:25:25,190
there's like a typical doomsday argument
type

11334
03:25:25,190 --> 03:25:25,200
type
 

11335
03:25:25,200 --> 03:25:28,370
type
that's how they typically lay it out

11336
03:25:28,370 --> 03:25:28,380
that's how they typically lay it out
 

11337
03:25:28,380 --> 03:25:30,469
that's how they typically lay it out
um now you can argue a lot of the

11338
03:25:30,469 --> 03:25:30,479
um now you can argue a lot of the
 

11339
03:25:30,479 --> 03:25:32,150
um now you can argue a lot of the
criticisms that doomsday argument come

11340
03:25:32,150 --> 03:25:32,160
criticisms that doomsday argument come
 

11341
03:25:32,160 --> 03:25:33,710
criticisms that doomsday argument come
down to well what are you really

11342
03:25:33,710 --> 03:25:33,720
down to well what are you really
 

11343
03:25:33,720 --> 03:25:35,389
down to well what are you really
counting you're counting humans there

11344
03:25:35,389 --> 03:25:35,399
counting you're counting humans there
 

11345
03:25:35,399 --> 03:25:37,010
counting you're counting humans there
but maybe you should be counting years

11346
03:25:37,010 --> 03:25:37,020
but maybe you should be counting years
 

11347
03:25:37,020 --> 03:25:38,990
but maybe you should be counting years
or maybe you should be counting human

11348
03:25:38,990 --> 03:25:39,000
or maybe you should be counting human
 

11349
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:41,150
or maybe you should be counting human
hours you know how what are you because

11350
03:25:41,150 --> 03:25:41,160
hours you know how what are you because
 

11351
03:25:41,160 --> 03:25:42,710
hours you know how what are you because
what you count makes a big difference to

11352
03:25:42,710 --> 03:25:42,720
what you count makes a big difference to
 

11353
03:25:42,720 --> 03:25:44,090
what you count makes a big difference to
what you get out on the other ends this

11354
03:25:44,090 --> 03:25:44,100
what you get out on the other ends this
 

11355
03:25:44,100 --> 03:25:46,070
what you get out on the other ends this
is called the reference class

11356
03:25:46,070 --> 03:25:46,080
is called the reference class
 

11357
03:25:46,080 --> 03:25:47,690
is called the reference class
um and so that's when the big questions

11358
03:25:47,690 --> 03:25:47,700
um and so that's when the big questions
 

11359
03:25:47,700 --> 03:25:50,450
um and so that's when the big questions
the Dooms I like men but I do think it

11360
03:25:50,450 --> 03:25:50,460
the Dooms I like men but I do think it
 

11361
03:25:50,460 --> 03:25:52,010
the Dooms I like men but I do think it
has a compelling point that it would be

11362
03:25:52,010 --> 03:25:52,020
has a compelling point that it would be
 

11363
03:25:52,020 --> 03:25:55,269
has a compelling point that it would be
surprising if our future is to one day

11364
03:25:55,269 --> 03:25:55,279
surprising if our future is to one day
 

11365
03:25:55,279 --> 03:25:58,309
surprising if our future is to one day
Blossom and become a Galactic spanning

11366
03:25:58,309 --> 03:25:58,319
Blossom and become a Galactic spanning
 

11367

Blossom and become a Galactic spanning
Empire trillions upon trillions upon

Empire trillions upon trillions upon
 

11369
03:26:00,899 --> 03:26:03,290
Empire trillions upon trillions upon
trillions of human beings will one day

11370
03:26:03,290 --> 03:26:03,300
trillions of human beings will one day
 

11371
03:26:03,300 --> 03:26:05,690
trillions of human beings will one day
live across the stars for essentially as

11372
03:26:05,690 --> 03:26:05,700
live across the stars for essentially as
 

11373
03:26:05,700 --> 03:26:08,090
live across the stars for essentially as
long as the Galaxy exists and the Stars

11374
03:26:08,090 --> 03:26:08,100
long as the Galaxy exists and the Stars
 

11375

Burn

11376
03:26:09,170 --> 03:26:09,180
Burn
 

11377
03:26:09,180 --> 03:26:11,630
Burn
we would live at an incredibly special

11378
03:26:11,630 --> 03:26:11,640
we would live at an incredibly special
 

11379
03:26:11,640 --> 03:26:14,570
we would live at an incredibly special
point in that story we would be right at

11380
03:26:14,570 --> 03:26:14,580
point in that story we would be right at
 

11381
03:26:14,580 --> 03:26:17,630
point in that story we would be right at
the very very very beginning and that's

11382
03:26:17,630 --> 03:26:17,640
the very very very beginning and that's
 

11383
03:26:17,640 --> 03:26:19,790
the very very very beginning and that's
not impossible but it's just somewhat

11384
03:26:19,790 --> 03:26:19,800
not impossible but it's just somewhat
 

11385
03:26:19,800 --> 03:26:22,610
not impossible but it's just somewhat
improbable and so there's part of that

11386
03:26:22,610 --> 03:26:22,620
improbable and so there's part of that
 

11387
03:26:22,620 --> 03:26:25,670
improbable and so there's part of that
sort of um irks against me but it also

11388
03:26:25,670 --> 03:26:25,680
sort of um irks against me but it also
 

11389
03:26:25,680 --> 03:26:26,929
sort of um irks against me but it also
almost feels like a philosophical

11390
03:26:26,929 --> 03:26:26,939
almost feels like a philosophical
 

11391
03:26:26,939 --> 03:26:28,370
almost feels like a philosophical
argument because you're sort of talking

11392
03:26:28,370 --> 03:26:28,380
argument because you're sort of talking
 

11393
03:26:28,380 --> 03:26:29,450
argument because you're sort of talking
about

11394
03:26:29,450 --> 03:26:29,460
about
 

11395
03:26:29,460 --> 03:26:33,469
about
Souls being drawn from this Cosmic pool

11396
03:26:33,469 --> 03:26:33,479
Souls being drawn from this Cosmic pool
 

11397
03:26:33,479 --> 03:26:35,630
Souls being drawn from this Cosmic pool
um so it's it's not an argument that I

11398
03:26:35,630 --> 03:26:35,640
um so it's it's not an argument that I
 

11399
03:26:35,640 --> 03:26:37,849
um so it's it's not an argument that I
lose sleep about for our fate of the

11400
03:26:37,849 --> 03:26:37,859
lose sleep about for our fate of the
 

11401
03:26:37,859 --> 03:26:40,070
lose sleep about for our fate of the
Doomsday but it is

11402
03:26:40,070 --> 03:26:40,080
Doomsday but it is
 

11403
03:26:40,080 --> 03:26:41,290
Doomsday but it is
um

11404
03:26:41,290 --> 03:26:41,300
um
 

11405
03:26:41,300 --> 03:26:44,929
um
somewhat intellectually annoying that

11406
03:26:44,929 --> 03:26:44,939
somewhat intellectually annoying that
 

11407
03:26:44,939 --> 03:26:47,090
somewhat intellectually annoying that
that there is a slight contradiction now

11408
03:26:47,090 --> 03:26:47,100
that there is a slight contradiction now
 

11409
03:26:47,100 --> 03:26:49,070
that there is a slight contradiction now
it feels like with the idea of a

11410
03:26:49,070 --> 03:26:49,080
it feels like with the idea of a
 

11411
03:26:49,080 --> 03:26:51,410
it feels like with the idea of a
Galactic spanning Empire

11412
03:26:51,410 --> 03:26:51,420
Galactic spanning Empire
 

11413
03:26:51,420 --> 03:26:53,150
Galactic spanning Empire
and but of course there's so many

11414
03:26:53,150 --> 03:26:53,160
and but of course there's so many
 

11415
03:26:53,160 --> 03:26:55,190
and but of course there's so many
unknowns

11416
03:26:55,190 --> 03:26:55,200
unknowns
 

11417
03:26:55,200 --> 03:26:58,429
unknowns
I I for one would love to visit even

11418
03:26:58,429 --> 03:26:58,439
I I for one would love to visit even
 

11419
03:26:58,439 --> 03:27:01,370
I I for one would love to visit even
space but Mars just imagine standing on

11420
03:27:01,370 --> 03:27:01,380
space but Mars just imagine standing on
 

11421
03:27:01,380 --> 03:27:05,150
space but Mars just imagine standing on
Mars and looking back at Earth

11422
03:27:05,150 --> 03:27:05,160
Mars and looking back at Earth
 

11423
03:27:05,160 --> 03:27:07,849
Mars and looking back at Earth
yeah I mean

11424
03:27:07,849 --> 03:27:07,859
yeah I mean
 

11425
03:27:07,859 --> 03:27:09,710
yeah I mean
um be incredible so

11426
03:27:09,710 --> 03:27:09,720
um be incredible so
 

11427
03:27:09,720 --> 03:27:11,450
um be incredible so
it would give you such a

11428
03:27:11,450 --> 03:27:11,460
it would give you such a
 

11429
03:27:11,460 --> 03:27:13,429
it would give you such a
fresh perspective as to your entire

11430
03:27:13,429 --> 03:27:13,439
fresh perspective as to your entire
 

11431
03:27:13,439 --> 03:27:15,650
fresh perspective as to your entire
existence and wanted to be human yeah

11432
03:27:15,650 --> 03:27:15,660
existence and wanted to be human yeah
 

11433
03:27:15,660 --> 03:27:17,510
existence and wanted to be human yeah
and then come back to earth and it would

11434
03:27:17,510 --> 03:27:17,520
and then come back to earth and it would
 

11435
03:27:17,520 --> 03:27:18,650
and then come back to earth and it would
give you

11436
03:27:18,650 --> 03:27:18,660
give you
 

11437
03:27:18,660 --> 03:27:20,269
give you
and give you a heck of a perspective

11438
03:27:20,269 --> 03:27:20,279
and give you a heck of a perspective
 

11439
03:27:20,279 --> 03:27:22,610
and give you a heck of a perspective
plus this the sunset on Mars is supposed

11440
03:27:22,610 --> 03:27:22,620
plus this the sunset on Mars is supposed
 

11441
03:27:22,620 --> 03:27:24,769
plus this the sunset on Mars is supposed
to be nice I loved what William Shatner

11442
03:27:24,769 --> 03:27:24,779
to be nice I loved what William Shatner
 

11443
03:27:24,779 --> 03:27:26,809
to be nice I loved what William Shatner
said after his flight

11444
03:27:26,809 --> 03:27:26,819
said after his flight
 

11445
03:27:26,819 --> 03:27:28,910
said after his flight
um his words really moved me when he

11446
03:27:28,910 --> 03:27:28,920
um his words really moved me when he
 

11447
03:27:28,920 --> 03:27:31,729
um his words really moved me when he
came down and I think uh

11448
03:27:31,729 --> 03:27:31,739
came down and I think uh
 

11449
03:27:31,739 --> 03:27:34,070
came down and I think uh
it really captured the idea that we

11450
03:27:34,070 --> 03:27:34,080
it really captured the idea that we
 

11451
03:27:34,080 --> 03:27:36,349
it really captured the idea that we
shouldn't really be sending uh Engineers

11452
03:27:36,349 --> 03:27:36,359
shouldn't really be sending uh Engineers
 

11453
03:27:36,359 --> 03:27:38,330
shouldn't really be sending uh Engineers
our scientists into space we should be

11454
03:27:38,330 --> 03:27:38,340
our scientists into space we should be
 

11455
03:27:38,340 --> 03:27:41,030
our scientists into space we should be
sending out poets because those are the

11456
03:27:41,030 --> 03:27:41,040
sending out poets because those are the
 

11457
03:27:41,040 --> 03:27:43,429
sending out poets because those are the
people when they come down who can who

11458
03:27:43,429 --> 03:27:43,439
people when they come down who can who
 

11459
03:27:43,439 --> 03:27:45,469
people when they come down who can who
can truly make a difference with when

11460
03:27:45,469 --> 03:27:45,479
can truly make a difference with when
 

11461
03:27:45,479 --> 03:27:47,210
can truly make a difference with when
they describe their experiences in space

11462
03:27:47,210 --> 03:27:47,220
they describe their experiences in space
 

11463
03:27:47,220 --> 03:27:49,729
they describe their experiences in space
and I found it very moving reading what

11464
03:27:49,729 --> 03:27:49,739
and I found it very moving reading what
 

11465
03:27:49,739 --> 03:27:51,250
and I found it very moving reading what
he what he said

11466
03:27:51,250 --> 03:27:51,260
he what he said
 

11467
03:27:51,260 --> 03:27:54,050
he what he said
yeah when you talk to astronauts when

11468
03:27:54,050 --> 03:27:54,060
yeah when you talk to astronauts when
 

11469
03:27:54,060 --> 03:27:55,550
yeah when you talk to astronauts when
they when they describe what they see

11470
03:27:55,550 --> 03:27:55,560
they when they describe what they see
 

11471
03:27:55,560 --> 03:27:57,490
they when they describe what they see
it's like this

11472
03:27:57,490 --> 03:27:57,500
it's like this
 

11473
03:27:57,500 --> 03:27:59,750
it's like this
like they've discovered a whole new

11474
03:27:59,750 --> 03:27:59,760
like they've discovered a whole new
 

11475
03:27:59,760 --> 03:28:01,309
like they've discovered a whole new
thing that they can't possibly convert

11476
03:28:01,309 --> 03:28:01,319
thing that they can't possibly convert
 

11477
03:28:01,319 --> 03:28:03,050
thing that they can't possibly convert
back into words yeah

11478
03:28:03,050 --> 03:28:03,060
back into words yeah
 

11479
03:28:03,060 --> 03:28:05,150
back into words yeah
um yeah it's it's beautiful to see just

11480
03:28:05,150 --> 03:28:05,160
um yeah it's it's beautiful to see just
 

11481
03:28:05,160 --> 03:28:07,790
um yeah it's it's beautiful to see just
as a quick before I forget I have to ask

11482
03:28:07,790 --> 03:28:07,800
as a quick before I forget I have to ask
 

11483
03:28:07,800 --> 03:28:08,570
as a quick before I forget I have to ask
you

11484
03:28:08,570 --> 03:28:08,580
you
 

11485
03:28:08,580 --> 03:28:10,010
you
um can you summarize your argument

11486
03:28:10,010 --> 03:28:10,020
um can you summarize your argument
 

11487
03:28:10,020 --> 03:28:11,990
um can you summarize your argument
against the hypothesis that we live in a

11488
03:28:11,990 --> 03:28:12,000
against the hypothesis that we live in a
 

11489
03:28:12,000 --> 03:28:13,429
against the hypothesis that we live in a
simulation

11490
03:28:13,429 --> 03:28:13,439
simulation
 

11491
03:28:13,439 --> 03:28:16,370
simulation
is it similar to our discussion about uh

11492
03:28:16,370 --> 03:28:16,380
is it similar to our discussion about uh
 

11493
03:28:16,380 --> 03:28:18,769
is it similar to our discussion about uh
the Doomsday Clock

11494
03:28:18,769 --> 03:28:18,779
the Doomsday Clock
 

11495
03:28:18,779 --> 03:28:19,969
the Doomsday Clock
um no it's actually probably more

11496
03:28:19,969 --> 03:28:19,979
um no it's actually probably more
 

11497
03:28:19,979 --> 03:28:21,710
um no it's actually probably more
similar to my

11498
03:28:21,710 --> 03:28:21,720
similar to my
 

11499
03:28:21,720 --> 03:28:24,170
similar to my
um agnosticism about life in the

11500
03:28:24,170 --> 03:28:24,180
um agnosticism about life in the
 

11501
03:28:24,180 --> 03:28:26,090
um agnosticism about life in the
universe and it's just sort of remaining

11502
03:28:26,090 --> 03:28:26,100
universe and it's just sort of remaining
 

11503
03:28:26,100 --> 03:28:28,610
universe and it's just sort of remaining
agnostic about all possibilities

11504
03:28:28,610 --> 03:28:28,620
agnostic about all possibilities
 

11505
03:28:28,620 --> 03:28:30,349
agnostic about all possibilities
um the simulation argument

11506
03:28:30,349 --> 03:28:30,359
um the simulation argument
 

11507
03:28:30,359 --> 03:28:32,090
um the simulation argument
sometimes it gets

11508
03:28:32,090 --> 03:28:32,100
sometimes it gets
 

11509
03:28:32,100 --> 03:28:33,050
sometimes it gets
um

11510
03:28:33,050 --> 03:28:33,060
um
 

11511
03:28:33,060 --> 03:28:36,830

mix there's kind of two distinct things

11512
03:28:36,830 --> 03:28:36,840
mix there's kind of two distinct things
 

11513
03:28:36,840 --> 03:28:38,210
mix there's kind of two distinct things
that we need to consider one is the

11514
03:28:38,210 --> 03:28:38,220
that we need to consider one is the
 

11515
03:28:38,220 --> 03:28:39,769
that we need to consider one is the
probability that we live in so-called

11516
03:28:39,769 --> 03:28:39,779
probability that we live in so-called
 

11517
03:28:39,779 --> 03:28:41,990
probability that we live in so-called
base reality that we're not living in a

11518
03:28:41,990 --> 03:28:42,000
base reality that we're not living in a
 

11519
03:28:42,000 --> 03:28:44,750
base reality that we're not living in a
simulated reality itself and another

03:28:44,750 --> 03:28:44,760
simulated reality itself and another
 

11521
03:28:44,760 --> 03:28:46,190
simulated reality itself and another
probability to consider is the

11522
03:28:46,190 --> 03:28:46,200
probability to consider is the
 

11523
03:28:46,200 --> 03:28:48,710
probability to consider is the
probability that that technology is

11524
03:28:48,710 --> 03:28:48,720
probability that that technology is
 

11525
03:28:48,720 --> 03:28:51,170
probability that that technology is
viable possible and something we will

11526
03:28:51,170 --> 03:28:51,180
viable possible and something we will
 

11527
03:28:51,180 --> 03:28:53,690
viable possible and something we will
ultimately choose to one day do those

11528
03:28:53,690 --> 03:28:53,700
ultimately choose to one day do those
 

11529
03:28:53,700 --> 03:28:54,889
ultimately choose to one day do those
are two distinct things they're probably

11530
03:28:54,889 --> 03:28:54,899
are two distinct things they're probably
 

11531
03:28:54,899 --> 03:28:57,110
are two distinct things they're probably
quite similar numbers to each other but

11532
03:28:57,110 --> 03:28:57,120
quite similar numbers to each other but
 

11533
03:28:57,120 --> 03:29:00,229
quite similar numbers to each other but
they are distinct probabilities so my in

11534
03:29:00,229 --> 03:29:00,239
they are distinct probabilities so my in
 

11535
03:29:00,239 --> 03:29:03,349
they are distinct probabilities so my in
my paper I I wrote about this I just

11536
03:29:03,349 --> 03:29:03,359
my paper I I wrote about this I just
 

11537
03:29:03,359 --> 03:29:04,790
my paper I I wrote about this I just
tried to work through the problem I

11538
03:29:04,790 --> 03:29:04,800
tried to work through the problem I
 

11539
03:29:04,800 --> 03:29:05,870
tried to work through the problem I
teach asteroid statistics actually

11540
03:29:05,870 --> 03:29:05,880
teach asteroid statistics actually
 

11541
03:29:05,880 --> 03:29:07,250
teach asteroid statistics actually
teaching me this morning

11542
03:29:07,250 --> 03:29:07,260
teaching me this morning
 

11543
03:29:07,260 --> 03:29:09,590
teaching me this morning
and so it just seemed like a fun case

11544
03:29:09,590 --> 03:29:09,600
and so it just seemed like a fun case
 

11545
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:11,269
and so it just seemed like a fun case
study of working through a Bayesian

calculation Fred
 

11549
03:29:12,960 --> 03:29:14,389
calculation Fred
um Bayesian calculations work on

11550
03:29:14,389 --> 03:29:14,399
um Bayesian calculations work on
 

11551
03:29:14,399 --> 03:29:16,790
um Bayesian calculations work on
conditionals and so when you hear any

11552
03:29:16,790 --> 03:29:16,800
conditionals and so when you hear any
 

11553
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:18,590
conditionals and so when you hear any
what kind of inspired this project was

11554
03:29:18,590 --> 03:29:18,600
what kind of inspired this project was
 

11555
03:29:18,600 --> 03:29:20,210
what kind of inspired this project was
when I heard musk said was like a

11556
03:29:20,210 --> 03:29:20,220
when I heard musk said was like a
 

11557
03:29:20,220 --> 03:29:21,889
when I heard musk said was like a
billion to one chance that we don't live

11558
03:29:21,889 --> 03:29:21,899
billion to one chance that we don't live
 

11559
03:29:21,899 --> 03:29:24,229
billion to one chance that we don't live
in a simulation

11560
03:29:24,229 --> 03:29:24,239
in a simulation
 

11561
03:29:24,239 --> 03:29:24,889
in a simulation
um

11562
03:29:24,889 --> 03:29:24,899
um
 

11563
03:29:24,899 --> 03:29:27,950
um
he's right if you add the Bayesian

11564
03:29:27,950 --> 03:29:27,960
he's right if you add the Bayesian
 

11565
03:29:27,960 --> 03:29:30,050
he's right if you add the Bayesian
conditional and the basic additional is

11566
03:29:30,050 --> 03:29:30,060
conditional and the basic additional is
 

11567
03:29:30,060 --> 03:29:32,090
conditional and the basic additional is
a conditioned upon the fact that we

11568
03:29:32,090 --> 03:29:32,100
a conditioned upon the fact that we
 

11569
03:29:32,100 --> 03:29:33,650
a conditioned upon the fact that we
eventually develop that technology and

11570
03:29:33,650 --> 03:29:33,660
eventually develop that technology and
 

11571
03:29:33,660 --> 03:29:36,349
eventually develop that technology and
choose to use it or it's it's chosen to

11572
03:29:36,349 --> 03:29:36,359
choose to use it or it's it's chosen to
 

11573
03:29:36,359 --> 03:29:38,330
choose to use it or it's it's chosen to
be used by such species both

11574
03:29:38,330 --> 03:29:38,340
be used by such species both
 

11575
03:29:38,340 --> 03:29:41,090
be used by such species both
civilizations that's the conditional and

11576
03:29:41,090 --> 03:29:41,100
civilizations that's the conditional and
 

11577
03:29:41,100 --> 03:29:42,290
civilizations that's the conditional and
you have to add that in because that

11578
03:29:42,290 --> 03:29:42,300
you have to add that in because that
 

11579
03:29:42,300 --> 03:29:44,510
you have to add that in because that
conditional isn't guaranteed

11580
03:29:44,510 --> 03:29:44,520
conditional isn't guaranteed
 

11581
03:29:44,520 --> 03:29:46,969
conditional isn't guaranteed
and so um in a Bayesian framework you

11582
03:29:46,969 --> 03:29:46,979
and so um in a Bayesian framework you
 

11583
03:29:46,979 --> 03:29:49,729
and so um in a Bayesian framework you
can kind of Make That explicit you see

11584
03:29:49,729 --> 03:29:49,739
can kind of Make That explicit you see
 

11585
03:29:49,739 --> 03:29:51,530
can kind of Make That explicit you see
mathematically explicitly that's a

11586
03:29:51,530 --> 03:29:51,540
mathematically explicitly that's a
 

11587
03:29:51,540 --> 03:29:54,110
mathematically explicitly that's a
condition on your equation and the the

11588
03:29:54,110 --> 03:29:54,120
condition on your equation and the the
 

11589
03:29:54,120 --> 03:29:56,269
condition on your equation and the the
opposite side of the coin is basically

11590
03:29:56,269 --> 03:29:56,279
opposite side of the coin is basically
 

11591
03:29:56,279 --> 03:29:57,650
opposite side of the coin is basically
um in the trilemma that Bostrom

11592
03:29:57,650 --> 03:29:57,660
um in the trilemma that Bostrom
 

11593
03:29:57,660 --> 03:29:59,150
um in the trilemma that Bostrom
originally put forward it's options one

11594
03:29:59,150 --> 03:29:59,160
originally put forward it's options one
 

11595
03:29:59,160 --> 03:30:01,910
originally put forward it's options one
and two assumption one is that you

11596
03:30:01,910 --> 03:30:01,920
and two assumption one is that you
 

11597
03:30:01,920 --> 03:30:03,650
and two assumption one is that you
basically never developed the ability to

11598
03:30:03,650 --> 03:30:03,660
basically never developed the ability to
 

11599
03:30:03,660 --> 03:30:05,990
basically never developed the ability to
do that option two is you never choose

11600
03:30:05,990 --> 03:30:06,000
do that option two is you never choose
 

11601
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:07,969
do that option two is you never choose
to execute that so we kind of group

11602
03:30:07,969 --> 03:30:07,979
to execute that so we kind of group
 

11603
03:30:07,979 --> 03:30:10,610
to execute that so we kind of group
those together as sort of the uh the

11604
03:30:10,610 --> 03:30:10,620
those together as sort of the uh the
 

11605
03:30:10,620 --> 03:30:14,330
those together as sort of the uh the
non-simulation uh scenario let's call it

11606
03:30:14,330 --> 03:30:14,340
non-simulation uh scenario let's call it
 

11607
03:30:14,340 --> 03:30:15,830
non-simulation uh scenario let's call it
and so you've got non-simulation

11608
03:30:15,830 --> 03:30:15,840
and so you've got non-simulation
 

11609
03:30:15,840 --> 03:30:18,670
and so you've got non-simulation
scenario and simulation scenario and

11610
03:30:18,670 --> 03:30:18,680
scenario and simulation scenario and
 

11611
03:30:18,680 --> 03:30:21,469
scenario and simulation scenario and
agnostically we really have to give

11612
03:30:21,469 --> 03:30:21,479
agnostically we really have to give
 

11613
03:30:21,479 --> 03:30:23,090
agnostically we really have to give
though you know how do you assess the

11614
03:30:23,090 --> 03:30:23,100
though you know how do you assess the
 

11615
03:30:23,100 --> 03:30:25,010
though you know how do you assess the
model that April and model probability

11616
03:30:25,010 --> 03:30:25,020
model that April and model probability
 

11617
03:30:25,020 --> 03:30:27,349
model that April and model probability
of those two scenarios

11618
03:30:27,349 --> 03:30:27,359
of those two scenarios
 

11619
03:30:27,359 --> 03:30:29,870
of those two scenarios
um it's very difficult and we can I

11620
03:30:29,870 --> 03:30:29,880
um it's very difficult and we can I
 

11621
03:30:29,880 --> 03:30:31,250
um it's very difficult and we can I
think people would probably argue about

11622
03:30:31,250 --> 03:30:31,260
think people would probably argue about
 

11623
03:30:31,260 --> 03:30:33,530
think people would probably argue about
how you assign those prayers in the

11624
03:30:33,530 --> 03:30:33,540
how you assign those prayers in the
 

11625
03:30:33,540 --> 03:30:35,389
how you assign those prayers in the
paper we just assigned 50 50. we just

11626
03:30:35,389 --> 03:30:35,399
paper we just assigned 50 50. we just
 

11627
03:30:35,399 --> 03:30:37,130
paper we just assigned 50 50. we just
said we this hasn't been demonstrated

11628
03:30:37,130 --> 03:30:37,140
said we this hasn't been demonstrated
 

11629
03:30:37,140 --> 03:30:40,550
said we this hasn't been demonstrated
yet there's no evidence that this is

11630
03:30:40,550 --> 03:30:40,560
yet there's no evidence that this is
 

11631
03:30:40,560 --> 03:30:43,070
yet there's no evidence that this is
actually technically possible but nor is

11632
03:30:43,070 --> 03:30:43,080
actually technically possible but nor is
 

11633
03:30:43,080 --> 03:30:44,630
actually technically possible but nor is
that it's not technically possible so

11634
03:30:44,630 --> 03:30:44,640
that it's not technically possible so
 

11635
03:30:44,640 --> 03:30:45,769
that it's not technically possible so
we're just going to assign 50 50

11636
03:30:45,769 --> 03:30:45,779
we're just going to assign 50 50
 

11637
03:30:45,779 --> 03:30:48,050
we're just going to assign 50 50
probability these two hypotheses and

11638
03:30:48,050 --> 03:30:48,060
probability these two hypotheses and
 

11639
03:30:48,060 --> 03:30:49,969
probability these two hypotheses and
then in the hypothesis where you have a

11640
03:30:49,969 --> 03:30:49,979
then in the hypothesis where you have a
 

11641
03:30:49,979 --> 03:30:51,229
then in the hypothesis where you have a
simulated reality you have a base

11642
03:30:51,229 --> 03:30:51,239
simulated reality you have a base
 

11643
03:30:51,239 --> 03:30:53,570
simulated reality you have a base
reality cell at the top so there is even

11644
03:30:53,570 --> 03:30:53,580
reality cell at the top so there is even
 

11645
03:30:53,580 --> 03:30:55,490
reality cell at the top so there is even
in the simulated hypothesis there's a

11646
03:30:55,490 --> 03:30:55,500
in the simulated hypothesis there's a
 

11647
03:30:55,500 --> 03:30:56,570
in the simulated hypothesis there's a
probability you still live in base

11648
03:30:56,570 --> 03:30:56,580
probability you still live in base
 

11649
03:30:56,580 --> 03:30:58,670
probability you still live in base
reality and then there's a whole Myriad

11650
03:30:58,670 --> 03:30:58,680
reality and then there's a whole Myriad
 

11651
03:30:58,680 --> 03:31:00,889
reality and then there's a whole Myriad
of universes beneath that which are all

11652
03:31:00,889 --> 03:31:00,899
of universes beneath that which are all
 

11653
03:31:00,899 --> 03:31:03,469
of universes beneath that which are all
simulated and so you have a very you

11654
03:31:03,469 --> 03:31:03,479
simulated and so you have a very you
 

11655
03:31:03,479 --> 03:31:05,389
simulated and so you have a very you
have a very slim probability of being in

11656
03:31:05,389 --> 03:31:05,399
have a very slim probability of being in
 

11657
03:31:05,399 --> 03:31:07,670
have a very slim probability of being in
base reality if this is true and you

11658
03:31:07,670 --> 03:31:07,680
base reality if this is true and you
 

11659
03:31:07,680 --> 03:31:09,830
base reality if this is true and you
have a 100 probability of living base

11660
03:31:09,830 --> 03:31:09,840
have a 100 probability of living base
 

11661
03:31:09,840 --> 03:31:12,410
have a 100 probability of living base
reality on the other hand if it's not

11662
03:31:12,410 --> 03:31:12,420
reality on the other hand if it's not
 

11663
03:31:12,420 --> 03:31:14,690
reality on the other hand if it's not
true and we never develop that ability

11664
03:31:14,690 --> 03:31:14,700
true and we never develop that ability
 

11665
03:31:14,700 --> 03:31:17,150
true and we never develop that ability
or choose never to use it and so then

11666
03:31:17,150 --> 03:31:17,160
or choose never to use it and so then
 

11667
03:31:17,160 --> 03:31:18,530
or choose never to use it and so then
you apply this technique called bazing

11668
03:31:18,530 --> 03:31:18,540
you apply this technique called bazing
 

11669
03:31:18,540 --> 03:31:20,870
you apply this technique called bazing
averaging which is where you propagate

11670
03:31:20,870 --> 03:31:20,880
averaging which is where you propagate
 

11671
03:31:20,880 --> 03:31:22,670
averaging which is where you propagate
the uncertainty of your two models to

11672
03:31:22,670 --> 03:31:22,680
the uncertainty of your two models to
 

11673
03:31:22,680 --> 03:31:25,010
the uncertainty of your two models to
get a final estimate and because of that

11674
03:31:25,010 --> 03:31:25,020
get a final estimate and because of that
 

11675
03:31:25,020 --> 03:31:27,050
get a final estimate and because of that
one base reality that lives in the

11676
03:31:27,050 --> 03:31:27,060
one base reality that lives in the
 

11677
03:31:27,060 --> 03:31:29,929
one base reality that lives in the
simulated scenario you end up counting

11678
03:31:29,929 --> 03:31:29,939
simulated scenario you end up counting
 

11679
03:31:29,939 --> 03:31:31,790
simulated scenario you end up counting
this up and getting that it always has

11680
03:31:31,790 --> 03:31:31,800
this up and getting that it always has
 

11681
03:31:31,800 --> 03:31:33,469
this up and getting that it always has
to be less than 50 so the probability

11682
03:31:33,469 --> 03:31:33,479
to be less than 50 so the probability
 

11683
03:31:33,479 --> 03:31:35,450
to be less than 50 so the probability
you live in this in in a simulated

11684
03:31:35,450 --> 03:31:35,460
you live in this in in a simulated
 

11685
03:31:35,460 --> 03:31:36,889
you live in this in in a simulated
reality versus base reality has to be

11686
03:31:36,889 --> 03:31:36,899
reality versus base reality has to be
 

11687
03:31:36,899 --> 03:31:39,050
reality versus base reality has to be
slightly less than 50 percent

11688
03:31:39,050 --> 03:31:39,060
slightly less than 50 percent
 

11689
03:31:39,060 --> 03:31:40,550
slightly less than 50 percent
um now that really comes down to that

11690
03:31:40,550 --> 03:31:40,560
um now that really comes down to that
 

11691
03:31:40,560 --> 03:31:43,550
um now that really comes down to that

statistician would say
 

11707
03:31:56,819 --> 03:31:59,750
statistician would say
um you're giving way too much weight to

11708
03:31:59,750 --> 03:31:59,760
um you're giving way too much weight to
 

11709
03:31:59,760 --> 03:32:01,370
um you're giving way too much weight to
the simulation hypothesis because it's

11710
03:32:01,370 --> 03:32:01,380
the simulation hypothesis because it's
 

11711
03:32:01,380 --> 03:32:03,050
the simulation hypothesis because it's
an intrinsically highly complicated

11712
03:32:03,050 --> 03:32:03,060
an intrinsically highly complicated
 

11713
03:32:03,060 --> 03:32:06,410
an intrinsically highly complicated
model you have a whole hierarchy of

11714
03:32:06,410 --> 03:32:06,420
model you have a whole hierarchy of
 

11715
03:32:06,420 --> 03:32:08,030
model you have a whole hierarchy of

11719
03:32:09,840 --> 03:32:12,170

thing right and so this requires

11720
03:32:12,170 --> 03:32:12,180
thing right and so this requires
 

11721
03:32:12,180 --> 03:32:14,229

penalize inherently complicated models

11728
03:32:20,570 --> 03:32:20,580
penalize inherently complicated models
 

11729
03:32:20,580 --> 03:32:23,210
penalize inherently complicated models
as being disfavored so I think you could

11730
03:32:23,210 --> 03:32:23,220
as being disfavored so I think you could
 

11731
03:32:23,220 --> 03:32:26,150
as being disfavored so I think you could
argue on being too generous or too kind

11732
03:32:26,150 --> 03:32:26,160
argue on being too generous or too kind
 

11733
03:32:26,160 --> 03:32:28,070
argue on being too generous or too kind
with that but I sort of want to develop

11734
03:32:28,070 --> 03:32:28,080
with that but I sort of want to develop
 

11735
03:32:28,080 --> 03:32:30,590
with that but I sort of want to develop
the the rigorous mathematical tools to

11736
03:32:30,590 --> 03:32:30,600
the the rigorous mathematical tools to
 

11737
03:32:30,600 --> 03:32:32,750
the the rigorous mathematical tools to
explore it and ultimately it's up to you

11738
03:32:32,750 --> 03:32:32,760
explore it and ultimately it's up to you
 

11739
03:32:32,760 --> 03:32:35,210
explore it and ultimately it's up to you
to decide what you think that 50 50 odds

11740
03:32:35,210 --> 03:32:35,220
to decide what you think that 50 50 odds
 

11741
03:32:35,220 --> 03:32:38,090
to decide what you think that 50 50 odds
should be but you can use my formula to

11742
03:32:38,090 --> 03:32:38,100
should be but you can use my formula to
 

11743
03:32:38,100 --> 03:32:39,590
should be but you can use my formula to
plug in whatever you want and get the

11744
03:32:39,590 --> 03:32:39,600
plug in whatever you want and get the
 

11745
03:32:39,600 --> 03:32:43,010
plug in whatever you want and get the
answer and I use 50 50. so and but when

11746
03:32:43,010 --> 03:32:43,020
answer and I use 50 50. so and but when
 

11747
03:32:43,020 --> 03:32:45,830
answer and I use 50 50. so and but when

03:32:52,979 --> 03:32:54,830
connected to that is the question we've
been talking about which is the number

11756
03:32:54,830 --> 03:32:54,840
been talking about which is the number
 

11757
03:32:54,840 --> 03:32:57,410
been talking about which is the number
of times at bat you get which is the

11758
03:32:57,410 --> 03:32:57,420
of times at bat you get which is the
 

11759
03:32:57,420 --> 03:32:58,969
of times at bat you get which is the
number of intelligent civilizations that

11760
03:32:58,969 --> 03:32:58,979
number of intelligent civilizations that
 

11761
03:32:58,979 --> 03:33:01,429
number of intelligent civilizations that
are out there that can uh build such

11762
03:33:01,429 --> 03:33:01,439
are out there that can uh build such
 

11763
03:33:01,439 --> 03:33:04,670
are out there that can uh build such
simulations that's it seems like very

11764
03:33:04,670 --> 03:33:04,680
simulations that's it seems like very
 

11765
03:33:04,680 --> 03:33:06,290
simulations that's it seems like very
closely connected because if we're the

11766
03:33:06,290 --> 03:33:06,300
closely connected because if we're the
 

11767
03:33:06,300 --> 03:33:08,809
closely connected because if we're the
only ones that are here and it could

11768
03:33:08,809 --> 03:33:08,819
only ones that are here and it could
 

11769
03:33:08,819 --> 03:33:10,969
only ones that are here and it could
build such things that changes things

11770
03:33:10,969 --> 03:33:10,979
build such things that changes things
 

11771
03:33:10,979 --> 03:33:13,070
build such things that changes things
yeah yeah I mean

11772
03:33:13,070 --> 03:33:13,080
yeah yeah I mean
 

11773
03:33:13,080 --> 03:33:14,929
yeah yeah I mean
this yeah this image complexes has all

11774
03:33:14,929 --> 03:33:14,939
this yeah this image complexes has all
 

11775
03:33:14,939 --> 03:33:17,450
this yeah this image complexes has all
sorts of implications like that

11776
03:33:17,450 --> 03:33:17,460
sorts of implications like that
 

11777
03:33:17,460 --> 03:33:19,550
sorts of implications like that
um I've always loved showing PowerPoints

11778
03:33:19,550 --> 03:33:19,560
um I've always loved showing PowerPoints
 

11779
03:33:19,560 --> 03:33:21,410
um I've always loved showing PowerPoints
about a really interesting contradiction

11780
03:33:21,410 --> 03:33:21,420
about a really interesting contradiction
 

11781
03:33:21,420 --> 03:33:22,729
about a really interesting contradiction
apparently with the simulation

11782
03:33:22,729 --> 03:33:22,739
apparently with the simulation
 

11783
03:33:22,739 --> 03:33:24,410
apparently with the simulation

11784
03:33:24,410 --> 03:33:24,420
hypothesis that I speak about a little
 

11785
03:33:24,420 --> 03:33:25,670

bit in the paper

11786
03:33:25,670 --> 03:33:25,680
bit in the paper
 

11787
03:33:25,680 --> 03:33:28,309
bit in the paper
but he showed that um or pointed out

11788
03:33:28,309 --> 03:33:28,319
but he showed that um or pointed out
 

11789
03:33:28,319 --> 03:33:31,010
but he showed that um or pointed out
that in this hierarchy of realities

11790
03:33:31,010 --> 03:33:31,020
that in this hierarchy of realities
 

11791
03:33:31,020 --> 03:33:33,170
that in this hierarchy of realities
which then developed their own AIS

11792
03:33:33,170 --> 03:33:33,180
which then developed their own AIS
 

11793
03:33:33,180 --> 03:33:34,729
which then developed their own AIS
within the realities and then they just

11794
03:33:34,729 --> 03:33:34,739
within the realities and then they just
 

11795
03:33:34,739 --> 03:33:37,370
within the realities and then they just
or really ancestor simulations I should

11796
03:33:37,370 --> 03:33:37,380
or really ancestor simulations I should
 

11797
03:33:37,380 --> 03:33:38,870
or really ancestor simulations I should
say rather than AI they develop their

11798
03:33:38,870 --> 03:33:38,880
say rather than AI they develop their
 

11799
03:33:38,880 --> 03:33:40,729
say rather than AI they develop their
own capability to simulate realities you

11800
03:33:40,729 --> 03:33:40,739
own capability to simulate realities you
 

11801
03:33:40,739 --> 03:33:42,710
own capability to simulate realities you
get this hierarchy until eventually

11802
03:33:42,710 --> 03:33:42,720
get this hierarchy until eventually
 

11803
03:33:42,720 --> 03:33:44,570
get this hierarchy until eventually
there'll be a bottom layer

11804
03:33:44,570 --> 03:33:44,580
there'll be a bottom layer
 

11805
03:33:44,580 --> 03:33:46,130
there'll be a bottom layer
um which I often call the sewer of

11806
03:33:46,130 --> 03:33:46,140
um which I often call the sewer of
 

11807
03:33:46,140 --> 03:33:48,229
um which I often call the sewer of
reality it's like the worst layer where

11808
03:33:48,229 --> 03:33:48,239
reality it's like the worst layer where
 

11809
03:33:48,239 --> 03:33:49,910
reality it's like the worst layer where
it's the most pixelated it could

11810
03:33:49,910 --> 03:33:49,920
it's the most pixelated it could
 

11811
03:33:49,920 --> 03:33:52,070
it's the most pixelated it could
possibly be right so because each layer

11812
03:33:52,070 --> 03:33:52,080
possibly be right so because each layer
 

11813
03:33:52,080 --> 03:33:53,210
possibly be right so because each layer
is necessarily going to have less

11814
03:33:53,210 --> 03:33:53,220
is necessarily going to have less
 

11815
03:33:53,220 --> 03:33:55,070
is necessarily going to have less
computational power than the layer above

11816
03:33:55,070 --> 03:33:55,080
computational power than the layer above
 

11817
03:33:55,080 --> 03:33:56,809
computational power than the layer above
it because not only are you stimulating

11818
03:33:56,809 --> 03:33:56,819
it because not only are you stimulating
 

11819
03:33:56,819 --> 03:33:58,610
it because not only are you stimulating
that entire planet but also some of

11820
03:33:58,610 --> 03:33:58,620
that entire planet but also some of
 

11821
03:33:58,620 --> 03:34:00,050
that entire planet but also some of
that's being used for the computers

11822
03:34:00,050 --> 03:34:00,060
that's being used for the computers
 

11823
03:34:00,060 --> 03:34:02,389
that's being used for the computers
themselves so those are simulated and so

11824
03:34:02,389 --> 03:34:02,399
themselves so those are simulated and so
 

11825
03:34:02,399 --> 03:34:04,969
themselves so those are simulated and so
that base reality also about the suit of

03:34:04,969 --> 03:34:04,979
that base reality also about the suit of
 

11827

03:34:10,729 --> 03:34:10,739
they are simply unable to produce

03:34:12,479 --> 03:34:14,030

Fidelity the simulation is not
 

11835
03:34:14,040 --> 03:34:15,830
Fidelity the simulation is not
sufficient and so from that point of

sufficient and so from that point of
 

11837
03:34:15,840 --> 03:34:16,790

03:34:16,790 --> 03:34:16,800
view it might not be obvious the
 

11839
03:34:16,800 --> 03:34:18,170
view it might not be obvious the
universe is pixelated but they would

11840
03:34:18,170 --> 03:34:18,180
universe is pixelated but they would
 

11841
03:34:18,180 --> 03:34:19,670
universe is pixelated but they would
just never be able to manifest that

03:34:19,670 --> 03:34:19,680
just never be able to manifest that

03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:21,950
just never be able to manifest that
capability what if they're constantly

03:34:27,060 --> 03:34:28,969
uh because it in order to uh appreciate
the limits of the Fidelity you have to

11850
03:34:28,969 --> 03:34:28,979
the limits of the Fidelity you have to
 

11851
03:34:28,979 --> 03:34:30,950
the limits of the Fidelity you have to
have an observer what if they're always

11852
03:34:30,950 --> 03:34:30,960
have an observer what if they're always
 

11853
03:34:30,960 --> 03:34:33,050
have an observer what if they're always
simulating a dumber and dumber Observer

11854
03:34:33,050 --> 03:34:33,060
simulating a dumber and dumber Observer
 

11855
03:34:33,060 --> 03:34:36,950
simulating a dumber and dumber Observer
yeah what if the sewer has very dumb

11856
03:34:36,950 --> 03:34:36,960
yeah what if the sewer has very dumb
 

11857
03:34:36,960 --> 03:34:39,110
yeah what if the sewer has very dumb
observers that can't like scientists

11858
03:34:39,110 --> 03:34:39,120
observers that can't like scientists
 

11859
03:34:39,120 --> 03:34:40,969
observers that can't like scientists
that are the dumbest possible scientists

11860
03:34:40,969 --> 03:34:40,979
that are the dumbest possible scientists
 

11861
03:34:40,979 --> 03:34:43,550
that are the dumbest possible scientists
so like it's it's very pixelated but the

11862
03:34:43,550 --> 03:34:43,560
so like it's it's very pixelated but the
 

11863
03:34:43,560 --> 03:34:45,769
so like it's it's very pixelated but the
scientists are too dumb to even see the

11864
03:34:45,769 --> 03:34:45,779
scientists are too dumb to even see the
 

11865
03:34:45,779 --> 03:34:48,050
scientists are too dumb to even see the
the pixelations right like that that's

11866
03:34:48,050 --> 03:34:48,060
the pixelations right like that that's
 

11867
03:34:48,060 --> 03:34:50,929
the pixelations right like that that's
like built into the universe always has

11868
03:34:50,929 --> 03:34:50,939
like built into the universe always has

03:35:04,969 --> 03:35:04,979
probably be able to simulate Galactic
 

11883
03:35:04,979 --> 03:35:06,410
probably be able to simulate Galactic
formation or this kind of impressive

03:35:06,410 --> 03:35:06,420
formation or this kind of impressive
 

11885
03:35:06,420 --> 03:35:09,290

11911
03:35:36,899 --> 03:35:39,469
just far more of them than there are of
any of the higher levels oh and so that

11912
03:35:39,469 --> 03:35:39,479
any of the higher levels oh and so that
 

11913
03:35:39,479 --> 03:35:40,849
any of the higher levels oh and so that
sort of sets up a contradiction because

11914
03:35:40,849 --> 03:35:40,859
sort of sets up a contradiction because
 

11915
03:35:40,859 --> 03:35:44,630
sort of sets up a contradiction because
then you live in a reality which is

11916
03:35:44,630 --> 03:35:44,640
then you live in a reality which is
 

11917
03:35:44,640 --> 03:35:47,150
then you live in a reality which is
inherently incapable of ever producing

11918
03:35:47,150 --> 03:35:47,160
inherently incapable of ever producing
 

11919
03:35:47,160 --> 03:35:49,670
inherently incapable of ever producing

11920
03:35:49,670 --> 03:35:49,680
ancestor simulations
 

11921
03:35:49,680 --> 03:35:52,610
ancestor simulations
but the premise of the entire argument

11922
03:35:52,610 --> 03:35:52,620
but the premise of the entire argument
 

11923
03:35:52,620 --> 03:35:54,650
but the premise of the entire argument
is that ancestor simulations are

11924
03:35:54,650 --> 03:35:54,660
is that ancestor simulations are
 

11925
03:35:54,660 --> 03:35:56,870
is that ancestor simulations are
possible so there's there's a

11926
03:35:56,870 --> 03:35:56,880
possible so there's there's a
 

11927
03:35:56,880 --> 03:35:59,269
possible so there's there's a
contradiction does that is that old

11928
03:35:59,269 --> 03:35:59,279
contradiction does that is that old

this is maybe more true than we think

this is maybe more true than we think
 

11935
03:36:06,859 --> 03:36:09,170
this is maybe more true than we think
uh but to me so there's of course

11936
03:36:09,170 --> 03:36:09,180
uh but to me so there's of course
 

11937
03:36:09,180 --> 03:36:11,269
uh but to me so there's of course
physics and computational uh fascinating

03:36:11,269 --> 03:36:11,279
physics and computational uh fascinating
 

11939
03:36:11,279 --> 03:36:13,190
physics and computational uh fascinating
questions here but to me there's a

11940
03:36:13,190 --> 03:36:13,200
questions here but to me there's a
 

11941
03:36:13,200 --> 03:36:16,070
questions here but to me there's a
practical psychological question which

11942
03:36:16,070 --> 03:36:16,080
practical psychological question which
 

11943
03:36:16,080 --> 03:36:19,190
practical psychological question which
is you know how do you create a virtual

that is an interesting

kind of simulation to me because that

outside of the virtual world and uh it's
 

11983
03:37:11,819 --> 03:37:13,250
outside of the virtual world and uh it's
interesting to me from an engineering

03:37:16,979 --> 03:37:19,309
I'm somebody that sort of loves video
games and it seems like you can create

11990
03:37:19,309 --> 03:37:19,319
games and it seems like you can create
 

11991
03:37:19,319 --> 03:37:21,729
games and it seems like you can create
incredible worlds there and stay there

incredible worlds there and stay there
 

11993

yeah or you could have a memory wipe

12059
03:38:35,640 --> 03:38:38,030
I mean one one skepticism I've always
had about that is is whether it's a

had about that is is whether it's a
 

12061
03:38:38,040 --> 03:38:39,650
had about that is is whether it's a
first tough question but how much is

12062
03:38:39,650 --> 03:38:39,660
first tough question but how much is

03:40:54,899 --> 03:40:57,410
in science one thing that I maybe
discovered late but has been

and I think
that tends to be seen as something

that tends to be seen as something
 

12187
03:41:18,779 --> 03:41:20,510
that tends to be seen as something
that's in either or you have to

12188
03:41:20,510 --> 03:41:20,520
that's in either or you have to
 

12189
03:41:20,520 --> 03:41:22,790
that's in either or you have to
completely dedicate your yourself to one

12190
03:41:22,790 --> 03:41:22,800
completely dedicate your yourself to one
 

12191
03:41:22,800 --> 03:41:25,309
completely dedicate your yourself to one
thing to gain Mastery in it that's a

12192
03:41:25,309 --> 03:41:25,319
thing to gain Mastery in it that's a
 

12193
03:41:25,319 --> 03:41:27,110
thing to gain Mastery in it that's a
conventional way of thinking about both

12194
03:41:27,110 --> 03:41:27,120
conventional way of thinking about both
 

12195
03:41:27,120 --> 03:41:30,410
conventional way of thinking about both
science and other disciplines and I have

12196
03:41:30,410 --> 03:41:30,420
science and other disciplines and I have
 

12197
03:41:30,420 --> 03:41:32,990
science and other disciplines and I have
found that both have been elevated by

12198
03:41:32,990 --> 03:41:33,000
found that both have been elevated by
 

12199
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:34,969
found that both have been elevated by
practicing in each

12200
03:41:34,969 --> 03:41:34,979
practicing in each
 

12201
03:41:34,979 --> 03:41:37,550
practicing in each
um and I think that that's true in all

12202
03:41:37,550 --> 03:41:37,560
um and I think that that's true in all
 

12203
03:41:37,560 --> 03:41:40,190
um and I think that that's true in all
assets of life I mean if you want to

12204
03:41:40,190 --> 03:41:40,200
assets of life I mean if you want to
 

12205
03:41:40,200 --> 03:41:42,410
assets of life I mean if you want to
become the best researcher you possibly

and so to me
I've always wanted to couple that with

I've always wanted to couple that with
 

12217
03:41:53,640 --> 03:41:55,490
I've always wanted to couple that with

always been fascinated by physics as
 

12341
03:44:11,939 --> 03:44:15,170
always been fascinated by physics as
well but I came back to astronomy

12342
03:44:15,170 --> 03:44:15,180
well but I came back to astronomy
 

12343

because it was my first love and I was
much happier doing research in astronomy

12346
03:44:20,269 --> 03:44:20,279
much happier doing research in astronomy
 

12347
03:44:20,279 --> 03:44:22,070
much happier doing research in astronomy
than I was in physics because it spoke

12348
03:44:22,070 --> 03:44:22,080
than I was in physics because it spoke
 

12349
03:44:22,080 --> 03:44:25,610
