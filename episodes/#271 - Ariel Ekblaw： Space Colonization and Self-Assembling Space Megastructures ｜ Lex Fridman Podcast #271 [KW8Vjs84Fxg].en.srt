my parents are both ex-air force so my
 

55
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,870
my parents are both ex-air force so my
dad's an a-10 fighter pilot and my mom

56
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
dad's an a-10 fighter pilot and my mom
 

57
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,870
dad's an a-10 fighter pilot and my mom
trained and had qualified to be a

trained and had qualified to be a
 

59
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,789
trained and had qualified to be a
fighter pilot but it was early enough

00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
fighter pilot but it was early enough

that women were not allowed in combat at

62
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640
that women were not allowed in combat at
 

63
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,630
that women were not allowed in combat at
that time and so i grew up with these

64
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
that time and so i grew up with these
 

65
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,310
that time and so i grew up with these
two pilots

66
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
two pilots
 

67
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,749
two pilots
and although they themselves did not

68
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
and although they themselves did not
 

69
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,270
and although they themselves did not
become astronauts there's a really rich

70
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
become astronauts there's a really rich
 

71
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,190
become astronauts there's a really rich
legacy of air force pilots becoming

72
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
legacy of air force pilots becoming
 

73
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,190
legacy of air force pilots becoming
astronauts and this loomed large in my

74
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
astronauts and this loomed large in my
 

75
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,710
astronauts and this loomed large in my
childhood what does it mean to be

76
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
childhood what does it mean to be
 

77
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,270
childhood what does it mean to be
courageous to be an explorer to be at

78
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
courageous to be an explorer to be at
 

79
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,670
courageous to be an explorer to be at
the vanguard of something

80
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
the vanguard of something
 

81
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,590
the vanguard of something
uh hard and challenging

82
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
uh hard and challenging
 

83
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,590
uh hard and challenging
and to couple with that my dad was a

84
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
and to couple with that my dad was a
 

85
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,670
and to couple with that my dad was a
huge fan of science fiction and so i as

86
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
huge fan of science fiction and so i as
 

87
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,429
huge fan of science fiction and so i as
a kid read heinlein and isaac asimov

88
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
a kid read heinlein and isaac asimov
 

89
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,870
a kid read heinlein and isaac asimov
all these different classics of science

90
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
all these different classics of science
 

91
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,710
all these different classics of science
fiction that he introduced me to and

92
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
fiction that he introduced me to and
 

93
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,630
fiction that he introduced me to and
that just started a love affair with

94
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
that just started a love affair with
 

95
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,870
that just started a love affair with
space exploration and

96
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
space exploration and
 

97
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,510
space exploration and
really thinking about civilization scale

98
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
really thinking about civilization scale
 

99
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,749
really thinking about civilization scale
space exploration

100
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
space exploration
 

101
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,270
space exploration
so

102
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
so
 

103
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,429
so
did they themselves

104
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
did they themselves
 

105
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,749
did they themselves
dream about going to the stars as

106
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
dream about going to the stars as
 

107
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,990
dream about going to the stars as
opposed to flying here in earth's

108
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
opposed to flying here in earth's
 

109
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,550

atmosphere just looking up yeah my dad

110
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
atmosphere just looking up yeah my dad
 

111
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,910
atmosphere just looking up yeah my dad
always said he was absolutely convinced

112
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
always said he was absolutely convinced
 

113
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,429
always said he was absolutely convinced
because he was a child of the apollo

114
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
because he was a child of the apollo
 

115
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,749
because he was a child of the apollo
years that he would get to go in his

116
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
years that he would get to go in his
 

117
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,270
years that he would get to go in his
lifetime really thought it was gonna

118
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
lifetime really thought it was gonna
 

119
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,670
lifetime really thought it was gonna
happen and so it was a challenge and you

120
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
happen and so it was a challenge and you
 

121
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,830
happen and so it was a challenge and you
know sad for many people when um to

122
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
know sad for many people when um to
 

123
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,430
know sad for many people when um to

exploration slowed down for a period of

126
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
exploration slowed down for a period of
 

127
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,510
exploration slowed down for a period of
time in reality we were just catching up

128
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:19,520
time in reality we were just catching up
 

129
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,750
time in reality we were just catching up
i think we leapt so far ahead with

130
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
i think we leapt so far ahead with
 

131
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,030
i think we leapt so far ahead with

more than the rest of society was ready

134
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
more than the rest of society was ready
 

135
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,110
more than the rest of society was ready
for and now we're coming back to this

136
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
for and now we're coming back to this
 

137
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,710
for and now we're coming back to this
moment for space exploration where we

138
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
moment for space exploration where we
 

139
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,470
moment for space exploration where we
actually have an economy and we have the

140
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
actually have an economy and we have the
 

141
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,710
actually have an economy and we have the
other accoutrement that society needs to

142
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
other accoutrement that society needs to
 

143
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,150
other accoutrement that society needs to
be able to make space exploration more

144
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
be able to make space exploration more
 

145
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,070
be able to make space exploration more
real and my dad's thrilled because

146
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
real and my dad's thrilled because
 

147
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,630
real and my dad's thrilled because
finally you know not nearly i hope not

148
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
finally you know not nearly i hope not
 

149
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,990
finally you know not nearly i hope not

150
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,000
anywhere near the end of his life but as
 

151
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,790
anywhere near the end of his life but as
he's an older man he now can see

152
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
he's an older man he now can see
 

153
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,869
he's an older man he now can see
still within his lifetime people really

154
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
still within his lifetime people really
 

155
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,630
still within his lifetime people really
getting a chance to build a sustainable

getting a chance to build a sustainable

lunar settlement on the moon or maybe

158
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
lunar settlement on the moon or maybe
 

159
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,309
lunar settlement on the moon or maybe
even go to mars so settlements

160
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
even go to mars so settlements
 

161
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,309
even go to mars so settlements
civilizations and other planets that's

162
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
civilizations and other planets that's
 

163
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,949
civilizations and other planets that's
the that's the cool thing to dream about

164
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
the that's the cool thing to dream about
 

165
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,710
the that's the cool thing to dream about
in the future yes

had a
role to play in blue origin so it's like

00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
role to play in blue origin so it's like
 

227
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,789
role to play in blue origin so it's like

just the implementation of ideas that
 

235
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,990
just the implementation of ideas that
come kind of um percolate up from the

come kind of um percolate up from the
 

237
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,830
come kind of um percolate up from the
sci-fi world and actually become reality

it's kind of a fascinating figure in
 

241
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,429
it's kind of a fascinating figure in
that way so do you do you also think

242
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
that way so do you do you also think
 

243
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,550
that way so do you do you also think
about uh him beyond just his work

244
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
about uh him beyond just his work
 

245
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,629
about uh him beyond just his work
in science fiction but his role in

246
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
in science fiction but his role in
 

247
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,870
in science fiction but his role in
coming up with wild crazy ideas that

248
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
coming up with wild crazy ideas that
 

249
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,870
coming up with wild crazy ideas that
actually become reality yes i think it's

250
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
actually become reality yes i think it's
 

251
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,270
actually become reality yes i think it's
a great example of this cycle between

a great example of this cycle between
 

253
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,830
a great example of this cycle between
authors and scientists and engineers

that we can be inspired in one

256
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:31,360
that we can be inspired in one
 

257
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,070
that we can be inspired in one
generation by what authors dream up we

258
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
generation by what authors dream up we
 

259
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,749
generation by what authors dream up we
build it we make it a reality and then

260
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
build it we make it a reality and then
 

261
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,430
build it we make it a reality and then
that inspires another generation of

262
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
that inspires another generation of
 

263
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,189
that inspires another generation of
really wild and crazy thought for

264
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
really wild and crazy thought for
 

265
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,189
really wild and crazy thought for
science fiction i think neil stephenson

266
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
science fiction i think neil stephenson
 

267
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,629
science fiction i think neil stephenson
does a beautiful job of being what we

268
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
does a beautiful job of being what we
 

269
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,550
does a beautiful job of being what we
would call a hard science fiction author

270
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
would call a hard science fiction author
 

271
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,909
would call a hard science fiction author
so it's really grounded in a lot of

272
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
so it's really grounded in a lot of
 

273
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,350
so it's really grounded in a lot of
science which makes it very compelling

274
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
science which makes it very compelling
 

275
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,110
science which makes it very compelling
for me as a scientist and engineer to

276
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
for me as a scientist and engineer to
 

277
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,990
for me as a scientist and engineer to
read

278
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
read
 

279
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,670
read
and then be challenged to make that

280
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:51,680
and then be challenged to make that
 

281
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,110
and then be challenged to make that
vision a reality

thinks about but when i think about this
 

315
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,830
thinks about but when i think about this
in my own work it's what does it take to

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
in my own work it's what does it take to
 

317
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,590
in my own work it's what does it take to
scale humanity's presence in orbit

desire to explore yeah the mysterious

492
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
desire to explore yeah the mysterious
 

493
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,230
desire to explore yeah the mysterious
yes but also it does seem

494
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
yes but also it does seem
 

495
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,389
yes but also it does seem
that by placing us in harsh conditions

496
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
that by placing us in harsh conditions
 

497
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,070
that by placing us in harsh conditions
the harsh conditions of space the harsh

498
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
the harsh conditions of space the harsh
 

499
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,389
the harsh conditions of space the harsh
conditions of planets and the biology

500
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:36,399
conditions of planets and the biology
 

501
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,990

robotics the
 

505
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,149
robotics the
materials all of that that's just a nice

506
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
materials all of that that's just a nice
 

507
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,829
materials all of that that's just a nice
way to come up with cool new things

508
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
way to come up with cool new things
 

509
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,670

so uh and that you can bring back to
 

519
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,110
so uh and that you can bring back to
earth and it will improve

um right like figuring out food in space

522
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
um right like figuring out food in space
 

523
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,350
um right like figuring out food in space
will make you figure out what how to eat

524
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
will make you figure out what how to eat
 

525

in california a decade ago would never
 

571
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,470
in california a decade ago would never
have had to think about having an

572
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
have had to think about having an
 

573
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,030
have had to think about having an
airtight house but now with wildfires

574
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
airtight house but now with wildfires
 

575
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,030
airtight house but now with wildfires
maybe you do want something close to an

576
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
maybe you do want something close to an
 

577
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,350
maybe you do want something close to an
airtight house how do you manage that

578
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
airtight house how do you manage that
 

579
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,949
airtight house how do you manage that
there's a lot of technologies from the

580
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
there's a lot of technologies from the
 

581
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,430
there's a lot of technologies from the
space habitation world that we are

582
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
space habitation world that we are
 

583
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,870
space habitation world that we are
hoping we can actually bring back down

584
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
hoping we can actually bring back down
 

585
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,630
hoping we can actually bring back down
to benefit life on earth as well in

586
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
to benefit life on earth as well in
 

587
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,110
to benefit life on earth as well in
these extreme environment contexts

588

these extreme environment contexts
 

589
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,470
these extreme environment contexts
okay so you mentioned to go back to

590
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
okay so you mentioned to go back to
 

591
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,750
okay so you mentioned to go back to
swarm

592
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
swarm
 

593
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,949
swarm
yeah so that was interesting to you

594
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
yeah so that was interesting to you
 

595
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,110
yeah so that was interesting to you
first of all in your own work but also i

596
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
first of all in your own work but also i
 

597
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,710
first of all in your own work but also i
i believe you said something that was

598
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
i believe you said something that was
 

599
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,790
i believe you said something that was
inspiring from neil stephenson as well

600
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
inspiring from neil stephenson as well
 

601
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,630
inspiring from neil stephenson as well
so when you say

602
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
so when you say
 

603
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,670
so when you say
swarm

604
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:17,680
swarm
 

605
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,150
swarm
are you thinking about

606
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
are you thinking about
 

607
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,190
are you thinking about
um

608
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,200
um
 

609
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,110
um
architectures

610
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
architectures
 

611
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,710
architectures
or are you thinking about artificial

612
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
or are you thinking about artificial
 

613
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,949
or are you thinking about artificial
intelligence like robotics are those

614
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
intelligence like robotics are those
 

615
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,269
intelligence like robotics are those
kind of intermixed i think the future

616
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
kind of intermixed i think the future
 

617
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,790
kind of intermixed i think the future
that we're seeing is that they're going

618
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
that we're seeing is that they're going
 

619
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,150
that we're seeing is that they're going
to be intermixed which is really

620
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
to be intermixed which is really
 

621
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,110
to be intermixed which is really
exciting so the future of space habitats

622
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
exciting so the future of space habitats
 

623
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,550
exciting so the future of space habitats
are one of

624
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
are one of
 

625
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,030
are one of
intelligent structures maybe not all the

626
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
intelligent structures maybe not all the
 

627
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,670
intelligent structures maybe not all the
way to hal and the you know 2001 space

630
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
odyssey reference that scares people
 

631
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,110
odyssey reference that scares people
about the habitat having a mind of its

632
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
about the habitat having a mind of its
 

633
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,509
about the habitat having a mind of its
own but certainly we're building systems

634
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
own but certainly we're building systems
 

635
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,190
own but certainly we're building systems
now where the habitat

636
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
now where the habitat
 

637
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,670
now where the habitat
has sensing technology

638
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
has sensing technology
 

639
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,470
has sensing technology
that allows it to communicate

640
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
that allows it to communicate
 

641
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,710
that allows it to communicate
its basic functions you know maintaining

642
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
its basic functions you know maintaining
 

643
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,310
its basic functions you know maintaining
life support for the astronauts but

644
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
life support for the astronauts but
 

645
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,430
life support for the astronauts but
could also communicate in symbiosis

646
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
could also communicate in symbiosis
 

647
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,590
could also communicate in symbiosis
with these swarm robots that would be on

648
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
with these swarm robots that would be on
 

649
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,990
with these swarm robots that would be on
the outside of the spacecraft uh whether

650
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,000
the outside of the spacecraft uh whether
 

651
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,509

structures
given

824
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399

changing conditions
 

829
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,949
changing conditions
so uh maybe can you talk about your phd

830
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
so uh maybe can you talk about your phd
 

831
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,069
so uh maybe can you talk about your phd
work about this this work about tesserae

832
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
work about this this work about tesserae
 

833
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,590
work about this this work about tesserae
what is it

834
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
what is it
 

835
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,910
what is it
in general also any any cool stuff

836
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
in general also any any cool stuff
 

837
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,910
in general also any any cool stuff
because this is super cool yeah yeah

838
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
because this is super cool yeah yeah
 

839
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,030
because this is super cool yeah yeah
absolutely

840
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
absolutely
 

841
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,990
absolutely
so tess ray is my phd research it's this

842
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,000
so tess ray is my phd research it's this
 

843
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,710
so tess ray is my phd research it's this
idea that we could take tiles

844
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
idea that we could take tiles
 

845
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,509
idea that we could take tiles
that construct a large structure like a

846
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
that construct a large structure like a
 

847
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,870
that construct a large structure like a
bucky ball yeah this is exactly what

848
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
bucky ball yeah this is exactly what
 

849
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,870
bucky ball yeah this is exactly what
we're looking at here which is the tiles

850
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
we're looking at here which is the tiles
 

851
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,870
we're looking at here which is the tiles
that are packed flat in a rocket they're

852
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
that are packed flat in a rocket they're
 

853
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,389
that are packed flat in a rocket they're
released to float in microgravity

854
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
released to float in microgravity
 

855
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,629
released to float in microgravity
magnets pretty powerful electropermanent

856
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
magnets pretty powerful electropermanent
 

857
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,470
magnets pretty powerful electropermanent
magnets on their edges draw them

858
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
magnets on their edges draw them
 

859
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,389
magnets on their edges draw them
together for autonomous docking so

860
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
together for autonomous docking so
 

861
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,069
together for autonomous docking so
there's no human in the loop here and

862
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
there's no human in the loop here and
 

863
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,069
there's no human in the loop here and
there's no central agent coordinating

864
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:48,079
there's no central agent coordinating
 

865
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,790
there's no central agent coordinating
saying tile one go to tile two it's

866
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
saying tile one go to tile two it's
 

867
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,629
saying tile one go to tile two it's
completely decentralized system they

868
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:52,639
completely decentralized system they
 

869
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,629
completely decentralized system they
find each other on their own

870
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
find each other on their own
 

871
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,389
find each other on their own
what we don't show in this video is what

872
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
what we don't show in this video is what
 

873
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,150
what we don't show in this video is what
happens if there's an error right so

874
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
happens if there's an error right so
 

875
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,990
happens if there's an error right so
what happens if they bond incorrectly

876
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
what happens if they bond incorrectly
 

877
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,069
what happens if they bond incorrectly
the tiles have sensing so proximity

878
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
the tiles have sensing so proximity
 

879
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,230
the tiles have sensing so proximity
sensing magnetometer other sensors that

880
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
sensing magnetometer other sensors that
 

881
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,870
sensing magnetometer other sensors that
allow them to detect a good bond versus

882
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:06,880
allow them to detect a good bond versus
 

883
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,790
allow them to detect a good bond versus
a bad bond and pulse off and

884
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
a bad bond and pulse off and
 

885
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,030
a bad bond and pulse off and
self-correct which anybody who works in

886
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
self-correct which anybody who works in
 

887
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,629
self-correct which anybody who works in
this you know the field of self-assembly

888
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
this you know the field of self-assembly
 

889
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,949
this you know the field of self-assembly
will tell you that error detection and

890
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
will tell you that error detection and
 

891
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,350
will tell you that error detection and
correction just like uh error detection

892
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
correction just like uh error detection
 

893
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,389
correction just like uh error detection
in a dna sequence or protein folding is

894
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
in a dna sequence or protein folding is
 

895
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,829
in a dna sequence or protein folding is
really important part of the system for

896
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:21,839
really important part of the system for
 

897
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,230
really important part of the system for
that robustness and so we've done a lot

898
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
that robustness and so we've done a lot
 

899
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,550
that robustness and so we've done a lot
of work to engineer that ability for the

900
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
of work to engineer that ability for the
 

901
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,949
of work to engineer that ability for the
tiles to be

902
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:27,959
tiles to be
 

903
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,829
tiles to be
self-determining they know whether

904
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
self-determining they know whether
 

905
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,790
self-determining they know whether
they're forming the structure that

906
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
they're forming the structure that
 

907
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,389
they're forming the structure that
they're supposed to form or not they

908
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
they're supposed to form or not they
 

909
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,230
they're supposed to form or not they
know if they're in a toxic relationship

910
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,240
know if they're in a toxic relationship
 

911
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,230
know if they're in a toxic relationship
and they need to get out right right if

912
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
and they need to get out right right if
 

913
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,670
and they need to get out right right if
they need if they need to separate

914
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
they need if they need to separate
 

915
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,990
they need if they need to separate
exactly yeah all right this is like so

916
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
exactly yeah all right this is like so
 

917
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,110
exactly yeah all right this is like so
amazing and for people who are just

918
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
amazing and for people who are just
 

919
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,870
amazing and for people who are just
listening to this yeah there's

920
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
listening to this yeah there's
 

921
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,110
listening to this yeah there's
a lot i mean how large are these tiles

922
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
a lot i mean how large are these tiles
 

923
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,829
a lot i mean how large are these tiles
so the size that we use in the lab they

924
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
so the size that we use in the lab they
 

925
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,430
so the size that we use in the lab they
can really be any size because we can

926
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
can really be any size because we can
 

927
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,030
can really be any size because we can
scale them down to do testing in

928
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
scale them down to do testing in
 

929
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,509
scale them down to do testing in
microgravity so we sent tiles that were

930
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
microgravity so we sent tiles that were
 

931
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,110
microgravity so we sent tiles that were
about three inches wide to the

932
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
about three inches wide to the
 

933
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,389
about three inches wide to the
international space station a couple

934
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
international space station a couple
 

935
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,430
international space station a couple
years ago to test the code test the

936
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
years ago to test the code test the
 

937
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,030
years ago to test the code test the
state machine test the algorithm of

938
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,040
state machine test the algorithm of
 

939
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,949
state machine test the algorithm of
self-assembly but now we're actually

940
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
self-assembly but now we're actually
 

941
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,790
self-assembly but now we're actually
building our first ever human scale

942
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
building our first ever human scale
 

943
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,110
building our first ever human scale
tiles they're me human size so a little

944
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
tiles they're me human size so a little
 

945
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,230
tiles they're me human size so a little
you know a little smaller than maybe

946
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:08,240
you know a little smaller than maybe
 

947
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,509
you know a little smaller than maybe
your average human um but they're 2.5

948
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
your average human um but they're 2.5
 

949
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,910
your average human um but they're 2.5
feet on edge length

950
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
feet on edge length
 

951
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,829
feet on edge length
the larger scale that we would love to

952
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
the larger scale that we would love to
 

953
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,430
the larger scale that we would love to
build in the future would actually be

954
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440
build in the future would actually be
 

955
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,030
build in the future would actually be
tiles that are big enough to form a

956
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
tiles that are big enough to form a
 

957
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,749
tiles that are big enough to form a
bucky ball big open spherical volume

958
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
bucky ball big open spherical volume
 

959
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,749
bucky ball big open spherical volume
spherical approximation volume that'd be

960
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
spherical approximation volume that'd be
 

961
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,030
spherical approximation volume that'd be
about 10 meters in diameter so 30 feet

962
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
about 10 meters in diameter so 30 feet
 

963
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,030
about 10 meters in diameter so 30 feet
which is much bigger and grander in

964
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
which is much bigger and grander in
 

965
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,030
which is much bigger and grander in
terms of open space than any current

966
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,040
terms of open space than any current

was to say what's the purpose of next
generation space architecture should it

974
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
generation space architecture should it
 

975
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,749
generation space architecture should it
be something that really inspires and

976
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
be something that really inspires and
 

977
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,230
be something that really inspires and
delights people when you float into that

978
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
delights people when you float into that
 

979
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,990
delights people when you float into that
space can you get goosebumps in the way

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,789
could you define a module that's a node
a small node that someone can live in

1142
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:36,799
a small node that someone can live in
 

1143
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,710
a small node that someone can live in
and you self-assemble a lot of those

1144
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
and you self-assemble a lot of those
 

1145
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,350
and you self-assemble a lot of those
together they're called uh plesiohedrons

1146
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
together they're called uh plesiohedrons
 

1147
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,830
together they're called uh plesiohedrons
like uh space filling solids and you

1148
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
like uh space filling solids and you
 

1149
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,669
like uh space filling solids and you
dock a bunch of them together and you

1150
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
dock a bunch of them together and you
 

1151
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,549
dock a bunch of them together and you
can create a really organic structure

1152
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:48,559
can create a really organic structure
 

1153
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,029
can create a really organic structure
out of that so it's the same way that

1154
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
out of that so it's the same way that
 

1155
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,750
out of that so it's the same way that
muscles accrete to appear you can have

1156
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
muscles accrete to appear you can have
 

1157
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,830
muscles accrete to appear you can have
these nodes that dock together and one

1158
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
these nodes that dock together and one
 

1159
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,350
these nodes that dock together and one
shape that i would love to form out of

1160
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,360
shape that i would love to form out of
 

1161
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,350
shape that i would love to form out of
this is something like a nautilus a

1162
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,360
this is something like a nautilus a
 

1163
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,590
this is something like a nautilus a
seashell that beautiful you know

1164
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
seashell that beautiful you know
 

1165
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,230
seashell that beautiful you know
fibonacci spiral sequence that you get

1166
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240
fibonacci spiral sequence that you get
 

1167
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,590
fibonacci spiral sequence that you get
in that shape which i think would be a

1168
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
in that shape which i think would be a
 

1169
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,590
in that shape which i think would be a
stunning and fabulous

1170
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:07,600
stunning and fabulous
 

1171
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,630
stunning and fabulous
um aggregated space station you said so

1172
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
um aggregated space station you said so
 

1173
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,909
um aggregated space station you said so
many cool words please

1174
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:12,919
many cool words please
 

1175
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,390
many cool words please
plesiohedron yeah so that that's a

1176
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
plesiohedron yeah so that that's a
 

1177
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,230
plesiohedron yeah so that that's a
space filling

1178
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:18,240
space filling
 

1179
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,990
space filling
solid the simplest thing to think about

1180
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
solid the simplest thing to think about
 

1181
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,230
solid the simplest thing to think about
like here oh cube cube right so you can

1182
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
like here oh cube cube right so you can
 

1183
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,390
like here oh cube cube right so you can
stack cubes together and if you had an

1184
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
stack cubes together and if you had an
 

1185
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,470
stack cubes together and if you had an
infinite number of cubes you'd fill all

1186
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:26,480
infinite number of cubes you'd fill all
 

1187
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,310
infinite number of cubes you'd fill all
that space there's no gaps in between

1188
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
that space there's no gaps in between
 

1189
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,190
that space there's no gaps in between
the cubes they stack and fill space

1190
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
the cubes they stack and fill space
 

1191
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,669
the cubes they stack and fill space
uh another plesiohedron is a truncated

1192
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
uh another plesiohedron is a truncated
 

1193
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,350
uh another plesiohedron is a truncated
octahedron and that's actually one of

1194
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
octahedron and that's actually one of
 

1195
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,710
octahedron and that's actually one of
the candidate structures that we think

1196
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
the candidate structures that we think
 

1197
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,710
the candidate structures that we think
would be great for space stations what's

1198
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
would be great for space stations what's
 

1199
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,430
would be great for space stations what's
the truncated part ah so it you cut off

1200
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
the truncated part ah so it you cut off
 

1201
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,350
the truncated part ah so it you cut off
an octahedron actually has like little

1202
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,360
an octahedron actually has like little
 

1203
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,510
an octahedron actually has like little
pointy areas you truncate certain

1204
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
pointy areas you truncate certain
 

1205
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,750
pointy areas you truncate certain
sections of it and you get um

1206
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:47,760
sections of it and you get um
 

1207
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,070
sections of it and you get um
surfaces that are on the structure that

1208
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,080
surfaces that are on the structure that
 

1209
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,950
surfaces that are on the structure that
are cubes and i think hexagons i have to

1210
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:52,960
are cubes and i think hexagons i have to
 

1211
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,430
are cubes and i think hexagons i have to
remind myself exactly what the faces are

1212
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
remind myself exactly what the faces are
 

1213
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,990
remind myself exactly what the faces are
but overall a truncated octahedron can

1214
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,000
but overall a truncated octahedron can
 

1215
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,630
but overall a truncated octahedron can
be bonded to other truncated octahedrons

1216
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:00,640
be bonded to other truncated octahedrons
 

1217
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,870
be bonded to other truncated octahedrons
and just like a cube it fills all the

1218
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
and just like a cube it fills all the
 

1219
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,029
and just like a cube it fills all the
gaps as you build it out so you can

1220
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039
gaps as you build it out so you can
 

1221
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,230
gaps as you build it out so you can
imagine

1222
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
imagine
 

1223
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,909
imagine
two truncated octahedrons they come

1224
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
two truncated octahedrons they come
 

1225
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,510
two truncated octahedrons they come
together at an airlock which is what we

1226
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
together at an airlock which is what we
 

1227
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,149
together at an airlock which is what we
space people call doors in space

1228
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
space people call doors in space
 

1229
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,149
space people call doors in space
and you dock them on all sides and

1230
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:14,159
and you dock them on all sides and
 

1231
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,789
and you dock them on all sides and
you've basically created this

1232
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:15,799
you've basically created this
 

1233
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,669
you've basically created this
decentralized network of space nodes

1234
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
decentralized network of space nodes
 

1235
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,830
decentralized network of space nodes
that make a big space station

1236
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
that make a big space station
 

1237
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,669
that make a big space station
and once you have enough of them and

1238
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
and once you have enough of them and
 

1239
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,430
and once you have enough of them and
you're growing with enough big units you

1240
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
you're growing with enough big units you
 

1241
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,830
you're growing with enough big units you
can do it in any macro shape you want

1242
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:27,840
can do it in any macro shape you want
 

1243
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,270
can do it in any macro shape you want
that's where the nautilus comes in is

1244
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
that's where the nautilus comes in is
 

1245
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,390
that's where the nautilus comes in is
could we design

1246
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
could we design
 

1247
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,270
could we design
an organically inspired shape for space

1248
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
an organically inspired shape for space
 

1249
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,430
an organically inspired shape for space
station can i just say how awesome it is

1250
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
station can i just say how awesome it is
 

1251
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,789
station can i just say how awesome it is
to hear you say

1252
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
to hear you say
 

1253
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,750
to hear you say
we space people i know you meant people

1254
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760
we space people i know you meant people
 

1255
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,990
we space people i know you meant people
that are doing research on space

1256
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
that are doing research on space
 

1257
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,149
that are doing research on space
exploration space technology but it also

1258
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
exploration space technology but it also
 

1259
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,390
exploration space technology but it also
made me think of a future there's earth

1260
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
made me think of a future there's earth
 

1261
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,990
made me think of a future there's earth
people

1262
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
people
 

1263
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,070
people
and there's and there's those space

1264
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,080
and there's and there's those space
 

1265
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,990
and there's and there's those space
people and then i love them

1266
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
people and then i love them
 

1267
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,230
people and then i love them
too yeah no no for sure for sure but

1268
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
too yeah no no for sure for sure but
 

1269
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,190
too yeah no no for sure for sure but
like

1270
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
like
 

1271
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,630
like
it's like new yorkers and like texans or

1272
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,640
it's like new yorkers and like texans or
 

1273
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,630
it's like new yorkers and like texans or
something like that

1274
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
something like that
 

1275
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,870
something like that
yeah of course you you live for time in

1276
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:02,880
yeah of course you you live for time in
 

1277
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,710
yeah of course you you live for time in
new york and then you go up to boston

1278
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,720
new york and then you go up to boston
 

1279
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,950
new york and then you go up to boston
and but for tom you're the space people

1280
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:06,960
and but for tom you're the space people
 

1281
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,190
and but for tom you're the space people
i know those space people

1282
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
i know those space people
 

1283
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,270
i know those space people
they're kind of wild up there let's see

1284
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,280
they're kind of wild up there let's see
 

1285
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,870
they're kind of wild up there let's see
how that dynamic evolved yeah exactly

1286
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:12,880
how that dynamic evolved yeah exactly
 

1287
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,350
how that dynamic evolved yeah exactly
there's that culture culture forms and i

1288
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
there's that culture culture forms and i
 

1289
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,029
there's that culture culture forms and i
would love to see what kind of culture

1290
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:17,039
would love to see what kind of culture
 

1291
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,350
would love to see what kind of culture
once you once you have

1292
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
once you once you have
 

1293
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,110
once you once you have
sort of more and more civilians i mean

1294
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
sort of more and more civilians i mean
 

1295
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,390
sort of more and more civilians i mean
there's a human

1296
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:22,400
there's a human
 

1297
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,390
there's a human

and
 

1301
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,669
and
i'll maybe ask you about that too which

1302
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:27,679
i'll maybe ask you about that too which
 

1303
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,590
i'll maybe ask you about that too which
is like the dynamic between humans you

1304
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:29,600
is like the dynamic between humans you
 

1305
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,590
is like the dynamic between humans you
have to kind of start considering that

have to kind of start considering that
 

1307
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,430

you start spending more and more time up
 

1309
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,710
you start spending more and more time up
in space and and start sending civilians

and
 

1459
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,789
and
you can have probably some centralized

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,549
you can have probably some centralized
guidance of the kind of thing you want

to build
 

1465
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,430
to build
but they also kind of figure stuff out

1466
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
but they also kind of figure stuff out
 

1467
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,950
but they also kind of figure stuff out
themselves in terms of the low level

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,510
details in terms of the figuring out
when the when if everything fits just

1472
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:17,520
when the when if everything fits just
 

1473
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,549
when the when if everything fits just
right

1474

pleasantly
 

1481
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,070
pleasantly
it's like really fun everything they

1482
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
it's like really fun everything they
 

1483
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,430
it's like really fun everything they
have like videos of everything is just

1484
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440
have like videos of everything is just
 

1485
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,630
have like videos of everything is just
pleasant when everything just fits

1486
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
pleasant when everything just fits
 

1487
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,630
pleasant when everything just fits
perfectly very pleasing all the

1488
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
perfectly very pleasing all the
 

1489
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,470
perfectly very pleasing all the
tolerances come together

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
tolerances come together
 

1491
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,470
tolerances come together
so they figured that out on themselves

1492
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
so they figured that out on themselves
 

1493
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,470
so they figured that out on themselves
and the local robotics problem but by

1494
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
and the local robotics problem but by
 

1495
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,070
and the local robotics problem but by
the way was danielle rose pebbles what's

1496
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,080
the way was danielle rose pebbles what's
 

1497
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,149
the way was danielle rose pebbles what's
the pebbles project the pebbles project

1498
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
the pebbles project the pebbles project
 

1499
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,870
the pebbles project the pebbles project
are little cubes that have epms in them

1500
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:42,880
are little cubes that have epms in them
 

1501
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,630
are little cubes that have epms in them
electro-permanent magnets and they can

1502
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:44,640
electro-permanent magnets and they can
 

1503
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,029
electro-permanent magnets and they can
self-disassemble so they'll turn off and

1504
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:47,039
self-disassemble so they'll turn off and
 

1505
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,230
self-disassemble so they'll turn off and
so you'll have this little structure

1506
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,240
so you'll have this little structure
 

1507
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,750
so you'll have this little structure
that all of a sudden can

1508
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
that all of a sudden can
 

1509
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,549
that all of a sudden can
flip the little pebbles over and

1510
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:52,559
flip the little pebbles over and
 

1511
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,950
flip the little pebbles over and
essentially just disaggregate they have

1512
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
essentially just disaggregate they have
 

1513
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,269
essentially just disaggregate they have
to make some pleasing sounds

1514
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279

 

1515
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,870

that's gonna so i'm supposed to talk to

1516
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
that's gonna so i'm supposed to talk to
 

1517
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,630
that's gonna so i'm supposed to talk to
danielle so that i'll probably spend an

1518
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
danielle so that i'll probably spend an
 

1519
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,149
danielle so that i'll probably spend an
hour just discussing the sounds on the

1520
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,159
hour just discussing the sounds on the
 

1521
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,269
hour just discussing the sounds on the
pebbles okay uh what were we talking

1522
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:07,279
pebbles okay uh what were we talking
 

1523
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,190
pebbles okay uh what were we talking
about so the that's because you

1524
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200
about so the that's because you
 

1525
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,990
about so the that's because you
mentioned two i think right my third one

1526
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
mentioned two i think right my third one
 

1527
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,669
mentioned two i think right my third one
yeah is there a third one my third one

1528
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
yeah is there a third one my third one
 

1529
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,750
yeah is there a third one my third one
is the ring world just because

1530
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
is the ring world just because
 

1531
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,430
is the ring world just because
every science fiction book ever that's

1532
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:17,440
every science fiction book ever that's
 

1533
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,750
every science fiction book ever that's
worth anything has a ring world in it

1534
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:19,760
worth anything has a ring world in it
 

1535
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,710
worth anything has a ring world in it
and uh it's just a donut a donut yeah so

1536
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
and uh it's just a donut a donut yeah so
 

1537
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,990
and uh it's just a donut a donut yeah so
a really big taurus that could encircle

shipping up all that material so we

1596
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
shipping up all that material so we
 

1597
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,909
shipping up all that material so we
wanted something that would maximize the

1615
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,470
freaking cool that's awesome so you
mentioned uh microgravity and i saw i

1616
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,480
mentioned uh microgravity and i saw i
 

1617
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,310
mentioned uh microgravity and i saw i
believe that uh there's a picture of you

1618
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
believe that uh there's a picture of you
 

1619
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,710
believe that uh there's a picture of you
floating microgravity uh when when did

1620
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
floating microgravity uh when when did
 

1621
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,070
floating microgravity uh when when did
you get to experience that what was that

1622
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
you get to experience that what was that
 

1623
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,029
you get to experience that what was that
like yeah so i've flown nine times on

1624
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:57,039
like yeah so i've flown nine times on
 

1625
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,950
like yeah so i've flown nine times on
the affectionately known as the vomit

1626
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
the affectionately known as the vomit
 

1627
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,909
the affectionately known as the vomit
comet

1628
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
comet
 

1629
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,990
comet
it's the parabolic flight and

1630
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,000
it's the parabolic flight and
 

1631
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,029
it's the parabolic flight and
essentially it does what you'd want a

1632
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:03,039
essentially it does what you'd want a
 

1633
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,110
essentially it does what you'd want a
plane never to do it pitches really

1634
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,120
plane never to do it pitches really
 

1635
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,029
plane never to do it pitches really
steeply upwards at 45 degrees that's a

1636
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:07,039
steeply upwards at 45 degrees that's a
 

1637
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,430
steeply upwards at 45 degrees that's a
picture you yeah yeah that's test rate

1638
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
picture you yeah yeah that's test rate
 

1639
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,430
picture you yeah yeah that's test rate
that's super early in my phd some of

1640
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,440
that's super early in my phd some of
 

1641
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,190
that's super early in my phd some of
just the passive tiles before we even

1642
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,200
just the passive tiles before we even
 

1643
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,590
just the passive tiles before we even
put electronics in we were just testing

1644
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
put electronics in we were just testing
 

1645
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,149
put electronics in we were just testing
the magnet polarity and the

1646
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:18,159
the magnet polarity and the
 

1647
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,990
the magnet polarity and the
essentially is it an energy favorable

1648
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,000
essentially is it an energy favorable
 

1649
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,230
essentially is it an energy favorable
structure to self-assemble on its own so

1650
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
structure to self-assemble on its own so
 

1651
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,909
structure to self-assemble on its own so
we tweaked a lot of things between are

1652
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:23,919
we tweaked a lot of things between are
 

1653
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,830
we tweaked a lot of things between are
we looking at a couple of them

1654
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:25,840
we looking at a couple of them
 

1655
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,870
we looking at a couple of them
yeah you're looking at a bunch of them

1656
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880
yeah you're looking at a bunch of them
 

1657
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,590
yeah you're looking at a bunch of them
there's also almost 32 of them yeah

1658
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:29,600
there's also almost 32 of them yeah
 

1659
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,510
there's also almost 32 of them yeah
they're clumping they're clumping yeah

1660
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:31,520
they're clumping they're clumping yeah
 

1661
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,870
they're clumping they're clumping yeah
can you comment on what's the difference

1662
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:32,880
can you comment on what's the difference
 

1663
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,269
can you comment on what's the difference
between microgravity and and zero

1664
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:35,279
between microgravity and and zero
 

1665
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,830
between microgravity and and zero
gravity yes so there is

1666
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:37,840
gravity yes so there is
 

1667
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,230
gravity yes so there is
it's important difference there is no

1668
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
it's important difference there is no
 

1669
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,950
it's important difference there is no
zero gravity there's no nothing there's

1670
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:42,960
zero gravity there's no nothing there's
 

1671
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,630
zero gravity there's no nothing there's
in the universe there is no such thing

1672
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,640
in the universe there is no such thing
 

1673
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,269
in the universe there is no such thing
as zero gravity so newton's law of

1674
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:47,279
as zero gravity so newton's law of
 

1675
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,029
as zero gravity so newton's law of
gravity tells us that there's always

1676
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:49,039
gravity tells us that there's always
 

1677
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,710
gravity tells us that there's always
gravity attraction between any two

1678
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
gravity attraction between any two
 

1679
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,950
gravity attraction between any two
objects so zero g is a shorthand that

1680
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
objects so zero g is a shorthand that
 

1681
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,310
objects so zero g is a shorthand that
some of us fall into using or is a

1682
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,320
some of us fall into using or is a
 

1683
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,510
some of us fall into using or is a
little easier to communicate to the

1684
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:55,520
little easier to communicate to the
 

1685
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,269
little easier to communicate to the
public the accurate term is microgravity

1686
00:28:59,269 --> 00:28:59,279
public the accurate term is microgravity
 

1687
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,269
public the accurate term is microgravity
where you are essentially floating

1688
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
where you are essentially floating
 

1689
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,110
where you are essentially floating
you're weightless but generally in free

1690
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,120
you're weightless but generally in free
 

1691
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,149
you're weightless but generally in free
fall

1692
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159
fall
 

1693
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,149
fall
so on the parabolic flights the vomit

1694
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
so on the parabolic flights the vomit
 

1695
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,149
so on the parabolic flights the vomit
comet you're in free fall at the end of

1696
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
comet you're in free fall at the end of
 

1697
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,789
comet you're in free fall at the end of
the parabola and in orbit around the

1698
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:10,799
the parabola and in orbit around the
 

1699
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,789
the parabola and in orbit around the
earth when you're floating you're also

1700
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
earth when you're floating you're also
 

1701
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,750
earth when you're floating you're also
in free fall

1702
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760

 

1703
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,750

so affectionately call vomit comment i'm

1704
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
so affectionately call vomit comment i'm
 

1705
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,110
so affectionately call vomit comment i'm
sure there's a reason why it's called

1706
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
sure there's a reason why it's called
 

1707
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,870
sure there's a reason why it's called
affectionately so so what's it like

1708
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:20,880
affectionately so so what's it like
 

1709
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,430
affectionately so so what's it like
what's uh your first time

1710
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
what's uh your first time
 

1711
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,870
what's uh your first time
to both philosophically spiritually and

1712
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:26,880
to both philosophically spiritually and
 

1713
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,190
to both philosophically spiritually and
biologically what's it like it's

1714
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
biologically what's it like it's
 

1715
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,350
biologically what's it like it's
profound it is

1716
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
profound it is
 

1717
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,990
profound it is
unlike anything else you will experience

1718
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,000
unlike anything else you will experience
 

1719
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,029
unlike anything else you will experience
on earth

1720
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,039
on earth
 

1721
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,430
on earth
because it is this true feeling of

1722
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:37,440
because it is this true feeling of
 

1723
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,230
because it is this true feeling of
weightlessness with no drag so the

1724
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,240
weightlessness with no drag so the
 

1725
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,510
weightlessness with no drag so the
closest experience you can think of

1726
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:41,520
closest experience you can think of
 

1727
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,430
closest experience you can think of
would be floating in a pool but you move

1728
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:43,440
would be floating in a pool but you move
 

1729
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,950
would be floating in a pool but you move
slowly when you float in a pool and your

1730
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960
slowly when you float in a pool and your
 

1731
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,870
slowly when you float in a pool and your
motion is restricted when you're

1732
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
motion is restricted when you're
 

1733
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,029
motion is restricted when you're
floating it's just you and your body

1734
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,039
floating it's just you and your body
 

1735
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,070
floating it's just you and your body
flying like in a dream

1736
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,080
flying like in a dream
 

1737
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,149
flying like in a dream
it takes the littlest amount of energy

1738
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:54,159
it takes the littlest amount of energy
 

1739
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,909
it takes the littlest amount of energy
like a finger tap against the wall of

1740
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
like a finger tap against the wall of
 

1741
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,430
like a finger tap against the wall of
the plane to shoot all the way across

1742
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:57,440
the plane to shoot all the way across
 

1743
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,510
the plane to shoot all the way across
the fuselage wow and you can move at

1744
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
the fuselage wow and you can move at
 

1745
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,990
the fuselage wow and you can move at
full speed like you're you can move your

1746
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
full speed like you're you can move your
 

1747
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,230
full speed like you're you can move your
arms exactly your muscles there's no

1748
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,240
arms exactly your muscles there's no
 

1749
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,630
arms exactly your muscles there's no
yeah there's no resistance

1750
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
yeah there's no resistance
 

1751
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,830
yeah there's no resistance
they actually tell you to make a memory

1752
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:09,840
they actually tell you to make a memory
 

1753
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,350
they actually tell you to make a memory
when you're on the plane

1754
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,360
when you're on the plane
 

1755
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,110
when you're on the plane
because it's such a fleeting experience

1756
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
because it's such a fleeting experience
 

1757
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,789
because it's such a fleeting experience
for your body that even a few days later

1758
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:14,799
for your body that even a few days later
 

1759
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,269
for your body that even a few days later
you've already forgotten exactly what it

1760
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,279
you've already forgotten exactly what it
 

1761
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,350
you've already forgotten exactly what it
felt like it's so foreign to the human

1762
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,360
felt like it's so foreign to the human
 

1763
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,510
felt like it's so foreign to the human
experience they kind of that you

1764
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
experience they kind of that you
 

1765
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,750
experience they kind of that you
explicitly tried to really form this

1766
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
explicitly tried to really form this
 

1767
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,789
explicitly tried to really form this
into a membrane and then you could do

1768
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:24,799
into a membrane and then you could do
 

1769
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,669
into a membrane and then you could do
the replay cognitively freeze it yeah

1770
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:29,679
the replay cognitively freeze it yeah
 

1771
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,830
the replay cognitively freeze it yeah
save right uh when we have neural link

1772
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
save right uh when we have neural link
 

1773
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,310
save right uh when we have neural link
we can replay that um

1774
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,320
we can replay that um
 

1775
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,389
we can replay that um
that memory so in terms of

1776
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:36,399
that memory so in terms of
 

1777
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,230
that memory so in terms of
how much stress it has on your body is

1778
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,240
how much stress it has on your body is
 

1779
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,029
how much stress it has on your body is
it uh biologically stressful

1780
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
it uh biologically stressful
 

1781
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,669
it uh biologically stressful
you do feel a 2g pull out right so the

1782
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:43,679
you do feel a 2g pull out right so the
 

1783
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,190
you do feel a 2g pull out right so the
cost of getting those

1784
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,200
cost of getting those
 

1785
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,350
cost of getting those
micro g parabolas is you then have a 2g

1786
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
micro g parabolas is you then have a 2g
 

1787
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,029
micro g parabolas is you then have a 2g
pull out and that's hard you have to

1788
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
pull out and that's hard you have to
 

1789
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,029
pull out and that's hard you have to
train for it uh if you move your neck

1790
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,039
train for it uh if you move your neck
 

1791
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,789
train for it uh if you move your neck
too quickly in that 2g pull out you can

1792
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
too quickly in that 2g pull out you can
 

1793
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,549
too quickly in that 2g pull out you can
strain muscles

1794
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
strain muscles
 

1795
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,230
strain muscles
but i wouldn't say that it's

1796
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,240
but i wouldn't say that it's
 

1797
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,950
but i wouldn't say that it's
actually a a profound

1798
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
actually a a profound
 

1799
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,630
actually a a profound
tough thing on the body it's really just

1800
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:00,640
tough thing on the body it's really just
 

1801
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,789
tough thing on the body it's really just
an incredibly novel experience

1802
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:02,799
an incredibly novel experience
 

1803
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,789
an incredibly novel experience
and when you're in orbit and you're not

1804
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
and when you're in orbit and you're not
 

1805
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,470
and when you're in orbit and you're not
having to go through the ups and downs

1806
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:06,480
having to go through the ups and downs
 

1807
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,389
having to go through the ups and downs
of the parabolic plane there's a real

1808
00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:08,399
of the parabolic plane there's a real
 

1809
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,549
of the parabolic plane there's a real
grace and elegance and you see the

1810
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
grace and elegance and you see the
 

1811
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,110
grace and elegance and you see the
astronauts learn to operate in this

1812
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120
astronauts learn to operate in this
 

1813
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,870
astronauts learn to operate in this
completely new environment

1814
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
completely new environment
 

1815
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,310
completely new environment
what are some interesting differences

1816
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
what are some interesting differences
 

1817
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,990
what are some interesting differences
between the parabolic plane and when

1818
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
between the parabolic plane and when
 

1819
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,389
between the parabolic plane and when
you're actually going up in orbit is it

1820
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:20,399
you're actually going up in orbit is it
 

1821
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,509
you're actually going up in orbit is it
that with orbit you can look out and see

1822
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:23,519
that with orbit you can look out and see
 

1823
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,149
that with orbit you can look out and see
yeah that blue little planet of ours you

1824
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
yeah that blue little planet of ours you
 

1825
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,830
yeah that blue little planet of ours you
can see the blue marble the stunning

1826
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:27,840
can see the blue marble the stunning
 

1827
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,269
can see the blue marble the stunning
overview effect which is something i

1828
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:29,279
overview effect which is something i
 

1829
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,269
overview effect which is something i
hope to see one day

1830
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:31,279
hope to see one day
 

1831
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,269
hope to see one day
um what's also really different is if

1832
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:33,279
um what's also really different is if
 

1833
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,870
um what's also really different is if
you're in orbit for any significant

1834
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:34,880
you're in orbit for any significant
 

1835
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,630
you're in orbit for any significant
period of time there's going to be a lot

1836
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640
period of time there's going to be a lot
 

1837
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,950
period of time there's going to be a lot
more physiological changes to your body

1838
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:38,960
more physiological changes to your body
 

1839
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,350
more physiological changes to your body
than if you just did an afternoon flight

1840
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
than if you just did an afternoon flight
 

1841
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,590
than if you just did an afternoon flight
on the vomit comet everything from your

1842
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
on the vomit comet everything from your
 

1843
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,230
on the vomit comet everything from your
bones your muscles your eyeballs change

1844
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
bones your muscles your eyeballs change
 

1845
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,149
bones your muscles your eyeballs change
shape uh there's a lot of different

1846
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:48,159
shape uh there's a lot of different
 

1847
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,389
shape uh there's a lot of different
things that happen for long duration

1848
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399
things that happen for long duration
 

1849
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,830
things that happen for long duration
space flight and we still have to as

1850
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
space flight and we still have to as
 

1851
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,269
space flight and we still have to as
scientists we still have to solve a lot

1852
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:53,279
scientists we still have to solve a lot
 

1853
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,630
scientists we still have to solve a lot
of these interesting challenges to be

1854
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
of these interesting challenges to be
 

1855
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,310
of these interesting challenges to be
able to keep humans

1856
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:56,320
able to keep humans
 

1857
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,630
able to keep humans
thriving in microgravity or deep

1858
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:58,640
thriving in microgravity or deep
 

1859
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,029
thriving in microgravity or deep
duration space missions

1860
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
duration space missions
 

1861
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,990
duration space missions
deep duration space missions okay let's

1862
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
deep duration space missions okay let's
 

1863
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,269
deep duration space missions okay let's
talk about this

1864
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
talk about this
 

1865
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,750
talk about this
um i'm just gonna ask a bunch of dumb

1866
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:07,760
um i'm just gonna ask a bunch of dumb
 

1867
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,750
um i'm just gonna ask a bunch of dumb
questions so approximately how long does

1868
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:09,760
questions so approximately how long does
 

1869
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,149
questions so approximately how long does
it take to travel to mars asking for a

1870
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:12,159
it take to travel to mars asking for a
 

1871
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,710
it take to travel to mars asking for a
friend asking for a friend as we all do

1872
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:14,720
friend asking for a friend as we all do
 

1873
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,350
friend asking for a friend as we all do
uh about three years for a round trip

1874
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
uh about three years for a round trip
 

1875
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,029
uh about three years for a round trip
okay and that's not that it actually why

1876
00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:19,039
okay and that's not that it actually why
 

1877
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,909
okay and that's not that it actually why
why the round trip is that well

1878
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:21,919
why the round trip is that well
 

1879
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,590
why the round trip is that well
you're just asking about the one like

1880
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:23,600
you're just asking about the one like
 

1881
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,710
you're just asking about the one like
we're getting one more

1882
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
we're getting one more
 

1883
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,870
we're getting one more
us okay cool so for just like literally

1884
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:26,880
us okay cool so for just like literally
 

1885
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,990
us okay cool so for just like literally
flying to mars and around it takes three

1886
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,000
flying to mars and around it takes three
 

1887
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,149
flying to mars and around it takes three
years there's some interstitial time

1888
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
years there's some interstitial time
 

1889
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,230
years there's some interstitial time
there because you really can only go

1890
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,240
there because you really can only go
 

1891
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,149
there because you really can only go
between earth and mars at certain points

1892
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:36,159
between earth and mars at certain points
 

1893
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,310
between earth and mars at certain points
in their orbits where it's favorable to

1894
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
in their orbits where it's favorable to
 

1895
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,230
in their orbits where it's favorable to
make that journey and so part of that

1896
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:40,240
make that journey and so part of that
 

1897
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,310
make that journey and so part of that
three years is you take the journey to

1898
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,320
three years is you take the journey to
 

1899
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,870
three years is you take the journey to
mars a few months six to nine months

1900
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:44,880
mars a few months six to nine months
 

1901
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,470
mars a few months six to nine months
you're there for a period of time until

1902
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:46,480
you're there for a period of time until
 

1903
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,029
you're there for a period of time until
the orbits find a favorable alignment

1904
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:49,039
the orbits find a favorable alignment
 

1905
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,029
the orbits find a favorable alignment
again and then you come back another six

1906
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,039
again and then you come back another six
 

1907
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,350
again and then you come back another six
to nine months so one way travel six to

1908
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,360
to nine months so one way travel six to
 

1909
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,269
to nine months so one way travel six to
nine months they hang out there on

1910
00:32:55,269 --> 00:32:55,279
nine months they hang out there on
 

1911
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,710
nine months they hang out there on
vacation then come back forced vacation

1912
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
vacation then come back forced vacation
 

1913
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,870
vacation then come back forced vacation
well me who loves working all the time

1914
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
well me who loves working all the time
 

1915
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,269
well me who loves working all the time
all vacation is forced vacation uh all

1916
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
all vacation is forced vacation uh all
 

1917
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,310
all vacation is forced vacation uh all
right

1918
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,320
right
 

1919
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,789
right
uh so okay so that gives us a sense of

1920
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
uh so okay so that gives us a sense of
 

1921
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,430
uh so okay so that gives us a sense of
duration and we can maybe also talk

1922
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,440
duration and we can maybe also talk
 

1923
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,870
duration and we can maybe also talk
about longer and longer and longer

1924
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:10,880
about longer and longer and longer
 

1925
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,990
about longer and longer and longer
duration

1926
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,000
duration
 

1927
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,509
duration

especially as we try to scale the number
 

1991
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,470

of humans in orbit or in space so that's
 

1993
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,589
of humans in orbit or in space so that's
another big challenge is how to keep

on the moon is once you've gotten out of
 

2125
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,069
on the moon is once you've gotten out of
the gravity well of earth if you can

00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:38,079
the gravity well of earth if you can
 

2127
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,390
the gravity well of earth if you can
find water on the moon and refine it you

2128
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,400
find water on the moon and refine it you
 

2129
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,069
find water on the moon and refine it you
can either make it into propellant or

okay yeah does that scare you or excite

2210
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
okay yeah does that scare you or excite
 

2211
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,390
okay yeah does that scare you or excite
you it excites me profoundly there's

you it excites me profoundly there's

you it excites me profoundly there's
other alien civilizations potentially

other alien civilizations potentially
 

2215
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,950
other alien civilizations potentially
very different than our our own i think

2216
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:16,960
very different than our our own i think
 

2217
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,550
very different than our our own i think
there's got to be some humility there

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,910
there's got to be some humility there
and certainly from science fiction we

2220
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:19,920
and certainly from science fiction we
 

2221
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,990
and certainly from science fiction we
have plenty of reasons to fear that

2222

have plenty of reasons to fear that
 

2223
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,829
have plenty of reasons to fear that
outcome as well but i do think as a

outcome as well but i do think as a

exciting if we were to find life

how would you even build a detector to

2246
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
how would you even build a detector to
 

2247
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,670
how would you even build a detector to
look for silicon-based life

00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
the carbon base i mean to look outside
 

2263
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,270

on that one but there could be stuff

2358
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:42,079
on that one but there could be stuff
 

2359
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,670

civilizations are out there

2374
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:58,480
civilizations are out there
 

2375
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,270

as a ex-physicist i'm now much more on

2376
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,280
as a ex-physicist i'm now much more on
 

2377
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,950
as a ex-physicist i'm now much more on
the aerospace engineering side for space

2378
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
the aerospace engineering side for space
 

2379
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,030
the aerospace engineering side for space
architecture but as an ex-physicist i

2380
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040
architecture but as an ex-physicist i
 

2381
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,870
architecture but as an ex-physicist i
hope it is

2382
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:06,880
hope it is
 

2383
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,550
hope it is
uh prolific

2384
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
uh prolific
 

2385
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,069
uh prolific
i think the challenge is if it's as

2386
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
i think the challenge is if it's as
 

2387
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,829
i think the challenge is if it's as
prolific as we would hope if there are

2388
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:11,839
prolific as we would hope if there are
 

2389
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,390
prolific as we would hope if there are
many many many civilizations then the

2390
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
many many many civilizations then the
 

2391
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,750
many many many civilizations then the
question is

2392
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:15,760
question is
 

2393
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,910
question is
where are they why haven't we heard from

2394
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:17,920
where are they why haven't we heard from
 

2395
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,309
where are they why haven't we heard from
them uh and the fermi paradox is there

2396
00:41:20,309 --> 00:41:20,319
them uh and the fermi paradox is there
 

2397
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,270
them uh and the fermi paradox is there
some great filter that life only gets to

2398
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
some great filter that life only gets to
 

2399
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,910
some great filter that life only gets to
some level of sophistication and then

2400
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
some level of sophistication and then
 

2401
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,630
some level of sophistication and then
kills itself off through war or through

2402
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:28,640
kills itself off through war or through
 

2403
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,069
kills itself off through war or through
famine or through different challenges

2404
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:30,079
famine or through different challenges
 

2405
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,589
famine or through different challenges
that filter that

2406
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:31,599
that filter that
 

2407
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,670
that filter that
society out of existence

2408
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
society out of existence
 

2409
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,790
society out of existence
and it would be an interesting question

2410
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
and it would be an interesting question
 

2411
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,950
and it would be an interesting question
to try to understand if the universe was

2412
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:36,960
to try to understand if the universe was
 

2413
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,430
to try to understand if the universe was
teeming with life why haven't we

2414
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
teeming with life why haven't we
 

2415
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,190
teeming with life why haven't we
found it or heard from it yet to our

2416
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,200
found it or heard from it yet to our
 

2417
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,109
found it or heard from it yet to our
knowledge yeah i mean i personally

2418
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:43,119
knowledge yeah i mean i personally
 

2419
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,870
knowledge yeah i mean i personally
believe that it's teeming with life and

2420
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:44,880
believe that it's teeming with life and
 

2421
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,390
believe that it's teeming with life and
you're right i think that's a really

2422
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,400
you're right i think that's a really
 

2423
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,470
you're right i think that's a really
useful productive engineering scientific

2424
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,480
useful productive engineering scientific
 

2425
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,349
useful productive engineering scientific
question

2426
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:49,359
question
 

2427
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,750
question
of what kind of great filter yeah can

2428
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760
of what kind of great filter yeah can
 

2429
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,710
of what kind of great filter yeah can
just be destroying all that life or

2430
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:54,720
just be destroying all that life or
 

2431
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,470
just be destroying all that life or
preventing it from

2432
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:56,480
preventing it from
 

2433
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,349
preventing it from
just constantly talking to to us silly

2434
00:41:59,349 --> 00:41:59,359
just constantly talking to to us silly
 

2435
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,230
just constantly talking to to us silly
descendants of apes that's a really nice

2436
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,240
descendants of apes that's a really nice
 

2437
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,990
descendants of apes that's a really nice
question like

2438
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
question like
 

2439
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,390
question like
what are the ways civilizations can

2440
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,400
what are the ways civilizations can
 

2441
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,550
what are the ways civilizations can
destroy themselves

2442
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
destroy themselves
 

2443
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,190
destroy themselves
and there's too many sadly well we i

2444
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:11,200
and there's too many sadly well we i
 

2445
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,950
and there's too many sadly well we i
don't think we've come up with most of

2446
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,960
don't think we've come up with most of
 

2447
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,430
don't think we've come up with most of
them yet that's also probably true

2448
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:15,440
them yet that's also probably true
 

2449
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,349
them yet that's also probably true
that's the thing it's uh

2450
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:17,359
that's the thing it's uh
 

2451
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,349
that's the thing it's uh
i mean and like if you look at nuclear

2452
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:19,359
i mean and like if you look at nuclear
 

2453
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,750
i mean and like if you look at nuclear
war some of it is physics

2454
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:21,760
war some of it is physics
 

2455
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,030
war some of it is physics
but some of it

2456
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
but some of it
 

2457
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,190
but some of it
is game theory it's uh

2458
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:25,200
is game theory it's uh
 

2459
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,790
is game theory it's uh
it's human nature it's how society's

2460
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:26,800
it's human nature it's how society's
 

2461
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,430
it's human nature it's how society's
built themselves how they interact

2462
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
built themselves how they interact
 

2463
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,710
built themselves how they interact
how we create and resolve conflict and

2464
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:32,720
how we create and resolve conflict and
 

2465
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,710
how we create and resolve conflict and
it gets back to the human question on

2466
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:34,720
it gets back to the human question on
 

2467
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,030
it gets back to the human question on
when you're doing long-term space travel

2468
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:37,040
when you're doing long-term space travel
 

2469
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,230
when you're doing long-term space travel
how do you

2470
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,240
how do you
 

2471
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,190
how do you
maintain this dynamical system of

2472
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,200
maintain this dynamical system of
 

2473
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,270
maintain this dynamical system of

persists
 

2479
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,030
persists
throughout time to not just maintain

2480
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,040
throughout time to not just maintain
 

2481
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,030
throughout time to not just maintain
their biological body but get people

2482
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:51,040
their biological body but get people
 

2483
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,950
their biological body but get people
from not murdering each other and like

to where you kind of
 

2489
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,309
to where you kind of
fit well but i think you know if uh the

2490
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:00,319
fit well but i think you know if uh the
 

2491
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,069
fit well but i think you know if uh the
songs or poetry or books taught me

um
 

2499
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,349
um
i mean the problems arise because then

2500
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:07,359
i mean the problems arise because then
 

2501
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,870
i mean the problems arise because then
there's always a third person who also

2502
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:08,880
there's always a third person who also
 

2503
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,150
there's always a third person who also
likes and then there's the drama he's

2504
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,160
likes and then there's the drama he's
 

2505
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,750
likes and then there's the drama he's
like i can't believe you did that and

there's beer gets complicated gets
 

2511
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,790
there's beer gets complicated gets
complicated quickly okay anyway um back

2512

what kind of instruments
 

2531
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,870
what kind of instruments
you could use to play music in space

2532
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:38,880
you could use to play music in space
 

2533
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,950
you could use to play music in space
could you could you mention about

2534
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:40,960
could you could you mention about
 

2535
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,349
could you could you mention about
uh like the spotify working space and if

2536
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:43,359
uh like the spotify working space and if
 

2537
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,589
uh like the spotify working space and if
i wanted to do a live performance what

2538
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:45,599
i wanted to do a live performance what
 

2539
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,670
i wanted to do a live performance what
what kind of instruments would i need

2540
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:47,680
what kind of instruments would i need
 

2541

what kind of instruments would i need
yeah i mean you referenced culture

2542
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,680
yeah i mean you referenced culture
 

2543
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,190
yeah i mean you referenced culture
before and this is one of the most

2544
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:51,200
before and this is one of the most
 

2545
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,790
before and this is one of the most
exciting things that we have at our

2546
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:52,800
exciting things that we have at our
 

2547
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,750
exciting things that we have at our
fingertips which is to define a new

2548
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:55,760
fingertips which is to define a new
 

2549
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,910
fingertips which is to define a new
culture for space exploration we don't

2550
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:57,920
culture for space exploration we don't
 

2551
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,349
culture for space exploration we don't
just have to import

2552
00:43:59,349 --> 00:43:59,359
just have to import
 

2553
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,430
just have to import
cultural artifacts from earth

2554
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:01,440
cultural artifacts from earth
 

2555
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,430
cultural artifacts from earth
to make life worth living in space and

2556
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
to make life worth living in space and
 

2557
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,550
to make life worth living in space and
this musical instrument that you

2558
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:04,560
this musical instrument that you
 

2559
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,550
this musical instrument that you
referenced was a design of an object

2560
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:06,560
referenced was a design of an object
 

2561
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,150
referenced was a design of an object
that could only be performed in

2562
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
that could only be performed in
 

2563
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,349
that could only be performed in
microgravity oh cool so it doesn't sound

2564
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:11,359
microgravity oh cool so it doesn't sound
 

2565
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,190
microgravity oh cool so it doesn't sound
the same way when it's um it's a

2566
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,200
the same way when it's um it's a
 

2567
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,030
the same way when it's um it's a
percussive instrument when it's rattled

2568
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,040
percussive instrument when it's rattled
 

2569
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,109
percussive instrument when it's rattled
or moved in a gravity environment is

2570
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:17,119
or moved in a gravity environment is
 

2571
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,630
or moved in a gravity environment is
that can we look it up it's called the

2572
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:18,640
that can we look it up it's called the
 

2573
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,230
that can we look it up it's called the
telematron yep it's created by yeah

2574
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:22,240
telematron yep it's created by yeah
 

2575
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,230
telematron yep it's created by yeah
that is so awesome uh created by sans

2576
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:24,240
that is so awesome uh created by sans
 

2577
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,710
that is so awesome uh created by sans
fish and nicole boulier two amazing uh

2578
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
fish and nicole boulier two amazing uh

graduate students and staff researchers

2580
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:28,400
graduate students and staff researchers
 

2581
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,470
graduate students and staff researchers
on my team what does it look like it's

2582
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:30,480
on my team what does it look like it's
 

2583
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,430
on my team what does it look like it's
uh it looks steampunk actually yeah

2584
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:33,440
uh it looks steampunk actually yeah
 

2585
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,109
uh it looks steampunk actually yeah
awesome yeah it's pretty cool design it

2586
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:35,119
awesome yeah it's pretty cool design it
 

2587
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,270
awesome yeah it's pretty cool design it
looks like it's a geometric solid that

2588
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:37,280
looks like it's a geometric solid that
 

2589
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,870
looks like it's a geometric solid that
has these interesting artifacts on the

2590
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
has these interesting artifacts on the
 

2591
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,790
has these interesting artifacts on the
inside and it has a lot of sensors

2592
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
inside and it has a lot of sensors
 

2593
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,309
inside and it has a lot of sensors
actually additionally on the inside like

2594
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:42,319
actually additionally on the inside like
 

2595
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,109
actually additionally on the inside like
imu's inertial measurement sensors that

2596
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:45,119
imu's inertial measurement sensors that
 

2597
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,589
imu's inertial measurement sensors that
allow it to detect when it's floating

2598
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:47,599
allow it to detect when it's floating
 

2599
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,910
allow it to detect when it's floating
and when it's not floating and provides

2600
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:49,920
and when it's not floating and provides
 

2601
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,470
and when it's not floating and provides
this really kind of ethereal um they

2602
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,480
this really kind of ethereal um they
 

2603
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,470
this really kind of ethereal um they
later sonify it so they use electronic

2604
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
later sonify it so they use electronic
 

2605
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,390
later sonify it so they use electronic
music to turn it into a symphony or turn

2606
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
music to turn it into a symphony or turn
 

2607
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,390
music to turn it into a symphony or turn
it into a piece and yeah this is the

2608
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,400
it into a piece and yeah this is the
 

2609
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,150
it into a piece and yeah this is the
object the telematron how does the human

2610
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,160
object the telematron how does the human
 

2611
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,230
object the telematron how does the human
interact with it uh by tossing it so

2612
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240
interact with it uh by tossing it so
 

2613
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,910
interact with it uh by tossing it so
it's an interactive musical instrument

2614
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:03,920
it's an interactive musical instrument
 

2615
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,230
it's an interactive musical instrument
it actually requires another partner

2616
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,240
it actually requires another partner
 

2617
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,589
it actually requires another partner
so the idea was that it's something like

2618
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:07,599
so the idea was that it's something like
 

2619
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:08,710
so the idea was that it's something like
a dance

2620
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:08,720
a dance
 

2621
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,230
a dance
um or just like something like a

2622
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,240
um or just like something like a
 

2623
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,790
um or just like something like a
choreography in space got it and then

2624
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:12,800
choreography in space got it and then
 

2625
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,470
choreography in space got it and then
speaking of which you also talked about

2626
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,480
speaking of which you also talked about
 

2627
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,750
speaking of which you also talked about
sports

2628
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:15,760
sports
 

2629
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,750
sports
and uh like ball sports like playing

2630
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:17,760
and uh like ball sports like playing
 

2631
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,270
and uh like ball sports like playing
soccer so what

2632
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:19,280
soccer so what
 

2633
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,190
soccer so what
you you mentioned that so your muscles

2634
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,200
you you mentioned that so your muscles
 

2635
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,750
you you mentioned that so your muscles
can move with full speed

2636
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:23,760
can move with full speed
 

2637
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,430
can move with full speed
and then if you push off the wall

2638
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
and then if you push off the wall
 

2639
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,630
and then if you push off the wall
lightly

2640
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:26,640
lightly
 

2641
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,750
lightly
you fly

2642
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:27,760
you fly
 

2643
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,990
you fly
zoom zoom across so how does the physics

2644
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:30,000
zoom zoom across so how does the physics
 

2645
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,470
zoom zoom across so how does the physics
of that work for can you still play

2646
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,480
of that work for can you still play
 

2647
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,349
of that work for can you still play
soccer for example in space you can but

2648
00:45:35,349 --> 00:45:35,359
soccer for example in space you can but
 

2649
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,190
soccer for example in space you can but
one of the most uh intuitive things that

2650
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
one of the most uh intuitive things that
 

2651
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,430
one of the most uh intuitive things that
we all learn as babies right is whenever

2652
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:39,440
we all learn as babies right is whenever
 

2653
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,349
we all learn as babies right is whenever
you throw something if i was gonna toss

2654
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:41,359
you throw something if i was gonna toss
 

2655
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,270
you throw something if i was gonna toss
something to you i toss it up because i

2656
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:43,280
something to you i toss it up because i
 

2657
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,790
something to you i toss it up because i
know that it has to compensate for the

2658
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:44,800
know that it has to compensate for the
 

2659
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,710
know that it has to compensate for the
fact that that keplerian arc is going to

2660
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:46,720
fact that that keplerian arc is going to
 

2661
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,030
fact that that keplerian arc is going to
draw it down the you know equations of

2662
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
draw it down the you know equations of
 

2663
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,430
draw it down the you know equations of
motion are going to drop down i would in

2664
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:51,440
motion are going to drop down i would in
 

2665
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,030
motion are going to drop down i would in
space i would just shoot something

2666
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,040
space i would just shoot something
 

2667
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,270
space i would just shoot something
directly towards you so like straight

2668
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:55,280
directly towards you so like straight
 

2669
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,030
directly towards you so like straight
line of sight and so that would be very

2670
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,040
line of sight and so that would be very
 

2671
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,630
line of sight and so that would be very
different for any type of ball sport is

2672
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:58,640
different for any type of ball sport is
 

2673
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,109
different for any type of ball sport is
to retrain your human mind to have that

2674
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:01,119
to retrain your human mind to have that
 

2675
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,630
to retrain your human mind to have that
as your intuitive

2676
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:02,640
as your intuitive
 

2677
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,790
as your intuitive
arc of motion or lack of arc from your

2678
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:04,800
arc of motion or lack of arc from your
 

2679
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,550
arc of motion or lack of arc from your
experience from understanding how

2680
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:06,560
experience from understanding how
 

2681
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,550
experience from understanding how
astronauts get adjusted to the stuff how

2682
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,560
astronauts get adjusted to the stuff how
 

2683
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,910
astronauts get adjusted to the stuff how
long does it take to adjust to the

2684
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:09,920
long does it take to adjust to the
 

2685
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,870
long does it take to adjust to the
physics of this world this other world

2686
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:12,880
physics of this world this other world
 

2687
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,870
physics of this world this other world
so even after one or two parabolic

2688
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:14,880
so even after one or two parabolic
 

2689
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,550
so even after one or two parabolic
flights you can gain a certain facility

2690
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:18,560
flights you can gain a certain facility
 

2691
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,870
flights you can gain a certain facility
with moving in that environment i think

2692
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
with moving in that environment i think
 

2693
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,790
with moving in that environment i think
most astronauts would say maybe several

2694
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:22,800
most astronauts would say maybe several
 

2695
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,030
most astronauts would say maybe several
days on station or a week on station and

2696
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:25,040
days on station or a week on station and
 

2697
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,230
days on station or a week on station and
their brain

2698
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:26,240
their brain
 

2699
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,390
their brain
flips it's amazing the plasticity of the

2700
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
flips it's amazing the plasticity of the
 

2701
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,829
flips it's amazing the plasticity of the
human brain and how quickly they are

2702
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:29,839
human brain and how quickly they are
 

2703
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,150
human brain and how quickly they are
able to adapt and so pretty quickly they

2704
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
able to adapt and so pretty quickly they
 

2705
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,270
able to adapt and so pretty quickly they
become

2706
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:33,280
become
 

2707
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,990
become
creatures of this new environment

2708
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:36,000
creatures of this new environment
 

2709
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,990
creatures of this new environment
okay so that's cool it's it's creating a

2710
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,000
okay so that's cool it's it's creating a
 

2711
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,270
okay so that's cool it's it's creating a
little bit of an experience what about

2712
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280
little bit of an experience what about
 

2713
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,950
little bit of an experience what about
if you go for more than 100 days for one

2714
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:42,960
if you go for more than 100 days for one
 

2715
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,069
if you go for more than 100 days for one
year for two years for three years yeah

2716
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:46,079
year for two years for three years yeah
 

2717
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,069
year for two years for three years yeah
what challenges start to emerge in that

2718
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
what challenges start to emerge in that
 

2719
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,030
what challenges start to emerge in that
case

2720
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:49,040
case
 

2721
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,870
case
so scott kelly wrote this amazing book

2722
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
so scott kelly wrote this amazing book
 

2723
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,790
so scott kelly wrote this amazing book
after he spent a year in space and he's

2724
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:52,800
after he spent a year in space and he's
 

2725
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,790
after he spent a year in space and he's
a twin it's absolutely fantastic that

2726
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:54,800
a twin it's absolutely fantastic that
 

2727
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,390
a twin it's absolutely fantastic that
nasa got to do a twin studies perfect

2728
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,400
nasa got to do a twin studies perfect
 

2729
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,630
nasa got to do a twin studies perfect
so he wrote a lot about his experience

2730
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:00,640
so he wrote a lot about his experience
 

2731
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,950
so he wrote a lot about his experience
on the health side of what changed

2732
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
on the health side of what changed
 

2733
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,150
on the health side of what changed
things like

2734
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:04,160
things like
 

2735
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,790
things like
bone density muscle atrophy

2736
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:06,800
bone density muscle atrophy
 

2737
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,030
bone density muscle atrophy
eye sight changing because the shape of

2738
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:09,040
eye sight changing because the shape of
 

2739
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,710
eye sight changing because the shape of
your eyeball changes which changes your

2740
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
your eyeball changes which changes your
 

2741
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,790
your eyeball changes which changes your
lens which changes how you see

2742
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:12,800
lens which changes how you see
 

2743
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,069
lens which changes how you see
if we're then thinking about the

2744
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
if we're then thinking about the
 

2745
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,990
if we're then thinking about the
challenges between a year and three

2746
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:16,000
challenges between a year and three
 

2747
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,349
challenges between a year and three
years especially if we're doing that

2748
00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:17,359
years especially if we're doing that
 

2749
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,870
years especially if we're doing that
three year trip to mars for your friend

2750
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
three year trip to mars for your friend
 

2751
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,309
three year trip to mars for your friend
who asked earlier

2752
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:20,319
who asked earlier
 

2753
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,829
who asked earlier
then you have to think about

2754
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:22,839
then you have to think about
 

2755
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,670
then you have to think about
nutrition and so how are you keeping all

2756
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:25,680
nutrition and so how are you keeping all
 

2757
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,190
nutrition and so how are you keeping all
of these different needs for your body

2758
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:27,200
of these different needs for your body
 

2759
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,510
of these different needs for your body
alive how are you protecting astronauts

2760
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:29,520
alive how are you protecting astronauts
 

2761
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,190
alive how are you protecting astronauts

type of a shell on the spacecraft which
 

2765
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,430
type of a shell on the spacecraft which
is expensive because it's heavy you know

2766
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:35,440
is expensive because it's heavy you know
 

2767
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,710
is expensive because it's heavy you know
if it's something like lead a really

00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:36,720
if it's something like lead a really
 

2769
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,150
if it's something like lead a really
effective radiation shell it's going to

00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,160
effective radiation shell it's going to
 

2771
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,589
effective radiation shell it's going to
be a lot of mass

2772
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:39,599
be a lot of mass
 

2773
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,910
be a lot of mass
or is there a pill that could be taken

2774
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:41,920
or is there a pill that could be taken
 

2775
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,309
or is there a pill that could be taken
to try to make you

radiation effects
 

2783
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,030
radiation effects
a lot of this has not yet been answered

00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:51,040
a lot of this has not yet been answered
 

2785
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,950
a lot of this has not yet been answered
but radiation is a really significant

2786
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:52,960
but radiation is a really significant
 

2787
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,349
but radiation is a really significant
challenge for that three year journey

2788
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
challenge for that three year journey
 

2789
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,870
challenge for that three year journey
and what are the negative effects of

2790
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:56,880
and what are the negative effects of
 

2791
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,030
and what are the negative effects of
radiation on the human body out in space

2792
00:47:59,030 --> 00:47:59,040
radiation on the human body out in space
 

2793
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,589
radiation on the human body out in space
a higher likelihood to develop cancer at

2794
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:01,599
a higher likelihood to develop cancer at
 

2795
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,109
a higher likelihood to develop cancer at
a younger age

2796
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
a younger age
 

2797
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,470
a younger age
so you'd probably be able to get there

2798
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,480
so you'd probably be able to get there
 

2799
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,349
so you'd probably be able to get there
and get back but you'd find yourself

2800
00:48:07,349 --> 00:48:07,359
and get back but you'd find yourself
 

2801
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:09,349
and get back but you'd find yourself
in the same way if you were exposed to

2802
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:09,359
in the same way if you were exposed to
 

2803
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,870
in the same way if you were exposed to
significant radiation on earth you'd

2804
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:10,880
significant radiation on earth you'd
 

2805
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,630
significant radiation on earth you'd
find significant bad health effects as

2806
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:12,640
find significant bad health effects as
 

2807
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,309
find significant bad health effects as
you age

2808
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:14,319
you age
 

2809
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,750
you age
what do you think about

2810
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:15,760
what do you think about
 

2811
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,950
what do you think about
like decades do you think about decades

2812
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
like decades do you think about decades
 

2813
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,750
like decades do you think about decades
or is this like an entire i think about

2814
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:21,760
or is this like an entire i think about
 

2815
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,069
or is this like an entire i think about
centuries especially for myspace but

2816
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:24,079
centuries especially for myspace but
 

2817
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,670
centuries especially for myspace but
yeah for decades

2818
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
yeah for decades
 

2819
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,270
yeah for decades
i think as soon as we get past the

2820
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,280
i think as soon as we get past the
 

2821
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,430
i think as soon as we get past the
three-year mark we'll absolutely want

2822
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
three-year mark we'll absolutely want
 

2823
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,549
three-year mark we'll absolutely want
somewhere between three years and a

2824
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
somewhere between three years and a
 

2825
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,510
somewhere between three years and a
decade we'll want artificial gravity

2826
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,520
decade we'll want artificial gravity
 

2827
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,349
decade we'll want artificial gravity
and we know how to do that actually the

2828
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:35,359
and we know how to do that actually the
 

2829
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,950
and we know how to do that actually the
engineering questions still need to be

2830
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:36,960
engineering questions still need to be
 

2831
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,309
engineering questions still need to be
tweaked for how we'd really implement it

2832
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:38,319
tweaked for how we'd really implement it
 

2833
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,990
tweaked for how we'd really implement it
but the science is there to know how we

2834
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,000
but the science is there to know how we
 

2835
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,270
but the science is there to know how we
would spin

2836
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:41,280
would spin
 

2837
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,150
would spin
habitats in orbit generate that force so

2838
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:44,160
habitats in orbit generate that force so
 

2839
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,670
habitats in orbit generate that force so
even if the entire habitat's not

2840
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:45,680
even if the entire habitat's not
 

2841
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,589
even if the entire habitat's not
spinning you at least have a treadmill

2842
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:47,599
spinning you at least have a treadmill
 

2843
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,430
spinning you at least have a treadmill

00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:49,440
part of the space station that is
 

2845
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,349
part of the space station that is
spinning and you can spend some fraction

2846
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:51,359
spinning and you can spend some fraction
 

2847
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,309
spinning and you can spend some fraction
of your day in a near to one g

2848
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:54,319
of your day in a near to one g

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,549
wait literally from just spinning from
spinning yeah centripetal force so you

2854
00:49:00,549 --> 00:49:00,559
spinning yeah centripetal force so you
 

2855
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:01,910
spinning yeah centripetal force so you
generate this force if you've ever been

2856
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:01,920
generate this force if you've ever been
 

2857
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,510
generate this force if you've ever been
in those um carnival rides the

00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
gravitrons that spin you up around the
 

2861
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,750
gravitrons that spin you up around the
side that's the concept and this is

00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:07,760
side that's the concept and this is
 

2863
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,589
side that's the concept and this is
actually one of the reasons why we are

2864
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:09,599
actually one of the reasons why we are
 

2865
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,109
actually one of the reasons why we are
spinning out a new company from my mit

2866
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:13,119

well noted space pun is a composition

2872
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,520
well noted space pun is a composition
 

2873
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,150
well noted space pun is a composition
all right um but yeah we're spinning out

2874
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,160
all right um but yeah we're spinning out
 

2875
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,230
all right um but yeah we're spinning out
a new company to look at next generation

2876

space architecture and how do we

2878
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:28,160
space architecture and how do we
 

2879
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,069
space architecture and how do we
actually scale humanity's access to

2880
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:30,079
actually scale humanity's access to
 

2881
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,990
actually scale humanity's access to
space and one of the areas that we want

2882
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,000
space and one of the areas that we want
 

2883
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,990
space and one of the areas that we want
to look at is artificial gravity

2884
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
to look at is artificial gravity
 

2885
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,430
to look at is artificial gravity
is there a name yet yep there's a name

2886
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,440
is there a name yet yep there's a name
 

2887

aurelia institute
 

2897
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,190
aurelia institute
aurelia is an old english word for

2898
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:47,200
aurelia is an old english word for
 

2899
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,510
aurelia is an old english word for
chrysalis and the idea with this is that

2900
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
chrysalis and the idea with this is that
 

2901
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,870
chrysalis and the idea with this is that
we humanity collectively are at this

2902
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:52,880
we humanity collectively are at this
 

2903
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,910
we humanity collectively are at this
next stage of our metamorphosis like a

2904
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:55,920
next stage of our metamorphosis like a
 

2905
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,549
next stage of our metamorphosis like a
chrysalis into a spacefaring species

2906
00:49:58,549 --> 00:49:58,559
chrysalis into a spacefaring species
 

2907
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,790
chrysalis into a spacefaring species
and so we felt that this was a good time

2908
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:00,800
and so we felt that this was a good time
 

2909
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,390
and so we felt that this was a good time
a necessary time

2910
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:02,400
a necessary time
 

2911
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,270
a necessary time
to think about next generation space

2912
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:05,280

difficult of an engineering problem the
 

2957
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,309
difficult of an engineering problem the
whole thing is is that something you

2958
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:54,319
whole thing is is that something you
 

2959
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,430
whole thing is is that something you
think about too how to have generations

2960
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:57,440
think about too how to have generations
 

2961
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,870
think about too how to have generations
of humans

2962
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880

00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,030
yes societies essentially i mean i guess
with micro like if you solve the gravity

2972
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
with micro like if you solve the gravity
 

2973
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,309
with micro like if you solve the gravity
problem you solve a lot of these

2974
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
problem you solve a lot of these
 

2975
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,230
problem you solve a lot of these
problems that's the hope yeah it's like

2976
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:10,240
problems that's the hope yeah it's like
 

2977
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,069
problems that's the hope yeah it's like
this central challenge of microgravity

2978
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:12,079
this central challenge of microgravity
 

2979
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:14,790
this central challenge of microgravity
to human reproduction but we do host a

2980
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:14,800
to human reproduction but we do host a
 

2981
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,549
to human reproduction but we do host a
workshop every year at beyond the cradle

2982
00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:16,559
workshop every year at beyond the cradle
 

2983
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:17,829
workshop every year at beyond the cradle
which is the space event that we run at

2984
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:17,839
which is the space event that we run at
 

2985
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,950
which is the space event that we run at
mit and we always do one on pregnancy in

2986
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:20,960
mit and we always do one on pregnancy in
 

2987
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,750
mit and we always do one on pregnancy in
space or motherhood or raising children

2988
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:23,760
space or motherhood or raising children
 

2989
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,109
space or motherhood or raising children
in space because there are huge

2990
00:51:25,109 --> 00:51:25,119
in space because there are huge
 

2991
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,549
in space because there are huge
questions

2992
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:26,559
questions
 

2993
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,870
questions
there have been a few mammal studies

2994
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880
there have been a few mammal studies
 

2995
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,549
there have been a few mammal studies
that have looked at reproduction in

2996
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:30,559
that have looked at reproduction in
 

2997
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,069
that have looked at reproduction in
space but there are still really major

2998
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:32,079
space but there are still really major
 

2999
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:33,829
space but there are still really major
questions about how does it work how

3000
00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:33,839
questions about how does it work how
 

3001
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,069
questions about how does it work how
does the fetus evolve in microgravity if

3002
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:36,079
does the fetus evolve in microgravity if
 

3003
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,829
does the fetus evolve in microgravity if
you were pregnant in space and i think

3004
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:37,839
you were pregnant in space and i think
 

3005
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,430
you were pregnant in space and i think
the near-term answer is just going to be

3006
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:39,440
the near-term answer is just going to be
 

3007
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,030
the near-term answer is just going to be
we need to be able to give humans a 1-g

3008
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,040
we need to be able to give humans a 1-g
 

3009
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,710
we need to be able to give humans a 1-g
environment for that phase of our

3010
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:44,720
environment for that phase of our
 

3011
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,390
environment for that phase of our
development yeah so there's some studies

3012
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:46,400
development yeah so there's some studies
 

3013
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,750
development yeah so there's some studies
on mice in microgravity it's interesting

3014
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:49,760
on mice in microgravity it's interesting
 

3015
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,670
on mice in microgravity it's interesting
like i think the mice like one of them

3016
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:51,680
like i think the mice like one of them
 

3017
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,430
like i think the mice like one of them
the mice weren't able to walk or like

3018
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:53,440
the mice weren't able to walk or like
 

3019
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,270
the mice weren't able to walk or like
their understanding of physics i guess

3020
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,280
their understanding of physics i guess
 

3021
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,349
their understanding of physics i guess
is off or something like that yeah the

3022
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:57,359
is off or something like that yeah the
 

3023
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,829
is off or something like that yeah the
mental model when you're really young

3024
00:51:59,829 --> 00:51:59,839
mental model when you're really young
 

3025
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,230
mental model when you're really young
and you're kind of getting your mental

3026
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:02,240
and you're kind of getting your mental
 

3027
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,069
and you're kind of getting your mental
model of physics we do think that that

3028
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
model of physics we do think that that
 

3029
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,069
model of physics we do think that that
would change um

3030
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:06,079
would change um
 

3031
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,150
would change um
kids abilities to if they were born in

3032
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,160
kids abilities to if they were born in
 

3033
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,470
kids abilities to if they were born in
microgravity their ability to have that

3034
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:10,480
microgravity their ability to have that
 

3035
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,150
microgravity their ability to have that
intuition around an earth-based 1g

3036
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:12,160
intuition around an earth-based 1g
 

3037
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,910
intuition around an earth-based 1g
environment might be missing because a

00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:13,920
environment might be missing because a
 

3039
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,270
environment might be missing because a
lot of that is really crystallized in

3040
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:15,280
lot of that is really crystallized in
 

3041
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,549
lot of that is really crystallized in
early development early childhood

3042
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:16,559
early development early childhood
 

3043
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,589

development
 

3045
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:18,710
development
so that makes sense that they would see

3046
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:18,720
so that makes sense that they would see
 

3047
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,589
so that makes sense that they would see
that in mice yeah so what about

3048
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:21,599
that in mice yeah so what about
 

3049
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,870
that in mice yeah so what about
life

3050
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880
life
 

3051
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,710
life
when we uh

3052
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:24,720
when we uh
 

3053
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,150
when we uh
choose to park

3054
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,160
choose to park
 

3055
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,390
choose to park
our vehicles on another planet on the

our vehicles on another planet on the
 

3057
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,349

moon but let's go to mars first of all

3058
00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:31,359
moon but let's go to mars first of all
 

3059

is that excite you

3060
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:33,760
is that excite you
 

3061
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,390
is that excite you
humans going to mars like stepping foot

3062
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:36,400
humans going to mars like stepping foot
 

3063
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,150
humans going to mars like stepping foot
on mars and when do you think it'll

3064
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:38,160
on mars and when do you think it'll
 

3065
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,309
on mars and when do you think it'll
happen it does excite me i think

3066
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:40,319
happen it does excite me i think
 

3067
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,390

the road to space
 

3073
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,230
the road to space
we are really excited about building out

3074
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:48,240
we are really excited about building out
 

3075
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,150
we are really excited about building out
the human lived experience of space once

3076
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,160
the human lived experience of space once
 

3077
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,990
the human lived experience of space once
you get there so how are you going to

3078
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,000
you get there so how are you going to
 

3079
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,750
you get there so how are you going to
grow your food what is your habitat

3080
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:53,760
grow your food what is your habitat
 

3081
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,030
grow your food what is your habitat
going to look like

00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:55,040
going to look like
 

3083
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,710
going to look like
i think it's profoundly exciting but i

3084

i think it's profoundly exciting but i
 

3085
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,990
i think it's profoundly exciting but i
do think that there's a little bit of a

00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:58,000
do think that there's a little bit of a
 

3087
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,030
do think that there's a little bit of a

these other pockets of our civilization
that can expand out beyond earth but

00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:10,640
that can expand out beyond earth but
 

3099
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,910
that can expand out beyond earth but
mars is not in its current state a good

mars is not in its current state a good
 

3101

00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:18,480
in the soil you can't use that soil to

certainly can't breathe it but it's also

certainly can't breathe it but it's also
 

3109
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,910
certainly can't breathe it but it's also
just really thin compared to our

a lot of different challenges that would

3114
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
a lot of different challenges that would
 

3115
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,109
a lot of different challenges that would
have to be fundamentally changed on that

3116
00:53:29,109 --> 00:53:29,119
have to be fundamentally changed on that
 

3117
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,430
have to be fundamentally changed on that
planet to make it a good home for a

3118

planet to make it a good home for a
 

3119
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,270
planet to make it a good home for a
large human civilization

3120
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:33,280
large human civilization
 

3121
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,790
large human civilization
how does a large

3122
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:34,800
how does a large
 

3123
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,829
how does a large
civilization of humans get built on mars

3124
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:37,839
civilization of humans get built on mars
 

3125
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,870
civilization of humans get built on mars
and

3126
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:38,880
and
 

3127
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,549
and
what do you think

3128
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:40,559
what do you think
 

3129
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,990
what do you think
where do you think it gets starts being

3130
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
where do you think it gets starts being
 

3131
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,910
where do you think it gets starts being
difficult so can you have a small base

3132
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:43,920
difficult so can you have a small base
 

3133
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,150
difficult so can you have a small base
of like 10 people essentially

3134
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:46,160
of like 10 people essentially
 

3135
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,349
of like 10 people essentially
kind of like the international space

3136
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:47,359
kind of like the international space
 

3137
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,549
kind of like the international space
station kind of

3138
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:48,559
station kind of
 

3139
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,790
station kind of
situation and then can you get it to a

3140
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
situation and then can you get it to a
 

3141
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,270
situation and then can you get it to a
hundred to a thousand to a million are

3142
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,280
hundred to a thousand to a million are
 

3143
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,510
hundred to a thousand to a million are
there some interesting challenges there

3144
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:55,520
there some interesting challenges there
 

3145
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,829
there some interesting challenges there
that worry you saying that mars is just

3146
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
that worry you saying that mars is just
 

3147
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,150
that worry you saying that mars is just
not a good backup at this time yeah for

3148
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:00,160
not a good backup at this time yeah for
 

3149
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,710
not a good backup at this time yeah for
earth i think small outposts absolutely

3150
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:02,720
earth i think small outposts absolutely
 

3151
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,710
earth i think small outposts absolutely
like mcmurdo right so we have these

3152
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:04,720
like mcmurdo right so we have these
 

3153
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,549
like mcmurdo right so we have these
models of really extreme environments on

3154
00:54:06,549 --> 00:54:06,559
models of really extreme environments on
 

3155
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,109
models of really extreme environments on
earth in antarctica for example where

3156
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:09,119
earth in antarctica for example where
 

3157
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,430
earth in antarctica for example where
humans have been able to go and make a

3158
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:11,440
humans have been able to go and make a
 

3159
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,349
humans have been able to go and make a
sustainable settlement

3160
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:13,359
sustainable settlement
 

3161
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:17,030
sustainable settlement
mcmurdo style life on mars probably

3162
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:17,040
mcmurdo style life on mars probably
 

3163
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,510
mcmurdo style life on mars probably
feasible in the 2030s so we want to send

3164
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:19,520
feasible in the 2030s so we want to send
 

3165
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,030
feasible in the 2030s so we want to send
the first human missions to mars and

3166
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,040
the first human missions to mars and
 

3167
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,549
the first human missions to mars and
maybe as early as the end of this decade

3168
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:22,559
maybe as early as the end of this decade
 

3169
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,710
maybe as early as the end of this decade
more likely early 2030s

3170
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
more likely early 2030s
 

3171
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,430
more likely early 2030s
moving anywhere beyond that in terms of

3172
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:27,440
moving anywhere beyond that in terms of
 

3173
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,230
moving anywhere beyond that in terms of
a place where like an entire human life

3174
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:30,240
a place where like an entire human life
 

3175
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,910
a place where like an entire human life
would be lived where it's not just you

3176
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
would be lived where it's not just you
 

3177
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,510
would be lived where it's not just you
go for a three-month deployment and you

3178
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
go for a three-month deployment and you
 

3179
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,510
go for a three-month deployment and you
come back that is actually the big

3180
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:35,520
come back that is actually the big
 

3181
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,150
come back that is actually the big
challenge line is just saying is there

3182
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,160
challenge line is just saying is there
 

3183
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,270
challenge line is just saying is there
enough um technological sophistication

3184
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
enough um technological sophistication
 

3185
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,950
enough um technological sophistication
that can be brought

3186
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
that can be brought
 

3187
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,030
that can be brought
that far out into space if you imagine

3188
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,040
that far out into space if you imagine
 

3189
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,349
that far out into space if you imagine

mind jumps to radio shack but there's no
you know there's no

3196
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:52,400
you know there's no
 

3197
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,789
you know there's no
supply chains on mars that can supply

3198
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:54,799
supply chains on mars that can supply
 

3199
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,270
supply chains on mars that can supply
the level of technological

3200
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:57,280
the level of technological
 

3201
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,710
the level of technological
sophistication for all the products that

3202
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:58,720
sophistication for all the products that
 

3203
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,870
sophistication for all the products that
we rely on on day-to-day life

3204
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:00,880
we rely on on day-to-day life
 

3205
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,309
we rely on on day-to-day life
so you'd be going back to actually a

3206
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:02,319
so you'd be going back to actually a
 

3207
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,630
so you'd be going back to actually a
very simple existence more like pioneer

3208
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:04,640
very simple existence more like pioneer
 

3209
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,829
very simple existence more like pioneer
life out west in the story of the u.s

3210
00:55:07,829 --> 00:55:07,839
life out west in the story of the u.s
 

3211
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,109
life out west in the story of the u.s
for example and i think that the future

3212
00:55:11,109 --> 00:55:11,119
for example and i think that the future
 

3213
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,670
for example and i think that the future
of larger scale gatherings of humans in

3214
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:13,680
of larger scale gatherings of humans in
 

3215
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,589
of larger scale gatherings of humans in
orbit or so in space is actually going

3216
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:15,599
orbit or so in space is actually going
 

3217
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,710
orbit or so in space is actually going
to be in microgravity floating space

3218
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
to be in microgravity floating space
 

3219
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,710
to be in microgravity floating space
cities not so much trying to

3220
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
cities not so much trying to
 

3221
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,430
cities not so much trying to
establish settlements on the surface

3222
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:25,440
establish settlements on the surface
 

3223
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,190
establish settlements on the surface
so you think sort of a significant

3224
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:27,200
so you think sort of a significant
 

3225
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,990
so you think sort of a significant
engineering investment in terms of our

3226
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:30,000
engineering investment in terms of our
 

3227
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,710
engineering investment in terms of our
efforts and money should be on

3228
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,720
efforts and money should be on
 

3229
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,870
efforts and money should be on
large

3230
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:34,880
large
 

3231
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,750
large
um spaceships that perhaps are doing

3232
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:37,760
um spaceships that perhaps are doing
 

3233
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,109
um spaceships that perhaps are doing
this kind of

3234
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:39,119
this kind of
 

3235
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,789
this kind of
self-assembly all these kinds of things

3236
00:55:40,789 --> 00:55:40,799
self-assembly all these kinds of things
 

3237
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,789
self-assembly all these kinds of things
and doing an orbit maybe building a

3238
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:42,799
and doing an orbit maybe building a
 

3239
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,349
and doing an orbit maybe building a
giant donut around the planet over time

3240
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:45,359
giant donut around the planet over time
 

3241
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,789
giant donut around the planet over time
yeah that is the goal and i think the

3242
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:46,799
yeah that is the goal and i think the
 

3243
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,710
yeah that is the goal and i think the
current political climate is such that

3244
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:48,720
current political climate is such that
 

3245
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,430
current political climate is such that
you can't get the trillion dollar

3246
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:51,440
you can't get the trillion dollar
 

3247
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,750
you can't get the trillion dollar
investment to build to start from

3248
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:53,760
investment to build to start from
 

3249
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,510
investment to build to start from
scratch and build the sci-fi

3250
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
scratch and build the sci-fi
 

3251
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,910
scratch and build the sci-fi
megastructure but if you can build it in

3252
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:57,920
megastructure but if you can build it in
 

3253
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,430
megastructure but if you can build it in
fits and starts in little different

3254
00:55:59,430 --> 00:55:59,440
fits and starts in little different
 

3255
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,870
fits and starts in little different
pieces which is another advantage of

3256
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:00,880
pieces which is another advantage of
 

3257
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,950
pieces which is another advantage of
self-assembly it's much more like how

3258
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:02,960
self-assembly it's much more like how
 

3259
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,829
self-assembly it's much more like how
nature works so it's biomimicry inspired

3260
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:05,839
nature works so it's biomimicry inspired
 

3261
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,589
nature works so it's biomimicry inspired
way for humanity to scale out in space

3262
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:09,599
way for humanity to scale out in space
 

3263
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,549
way for humanity to scale out in space
and whether it's out in space or on mars

3264
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:12,559
and whether it's out in space or on mars
 

3265
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,549
and whether it's out in space or on mars
the idea that sort of two people fall in

3266
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:14,559
the idea that sort of two people fall in
 

3267
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,069
the idea that sort of two people fall in
love

3268
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:16,079
love
 

3269
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,870
love
they have sex

3270
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:18,880
they have sex
 

3271
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,430
they have sex
uh a child is born

3272
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:21,440
uh a child is born
 

3273
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,589
uh a child is born
and then that couple has to teach that

3274
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:23,599
and then that couple has to teach that
 

3275
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:24,870
and then that couple has to teach that
child

3276
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:24,880
child
 

3277
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,670
child
that like we that they came from earth i

3278
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:27,680
that like we that they came from earth i
 

3279
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,589
that like we that they came from earth i
i just love the idea that somebody's

3280
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:29,599
i just love the idea that somebody's
 

3281
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,750
i just love the idea that somebody's
born on mars or out in space and you

3282
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:31,760
born on mars or out in space and you
 

3283
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,950
born on mars or out in space and you
have to be like

3284
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:32,960
have to be like
 

3285
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,030
have to be like
that this is not actually like the

3286
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,040
that this is not actually like the
 

3287
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,510
that this is not actually like the
original home right just them looking at

3288
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:37,520
original home right just them looking at
 

3289
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,030
original home right just them looking at
our at earth and being like this is

3290
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:39,040
our at earth and being like this is
 

3291
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,789
our at earth and being like this is
where it came from i don't know that's

3292
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:40,799
where it came from i don't know that's
 

3293
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,630
where it came from i don't know that's
really inspiring to me and the child

3294
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:42,640
really inspiring to me and the child
 

3295
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,150
really inspiring to me and the child
being really confused and then wanting

3296
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
being really confused and then wanting
 

3297
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,710
being really confused and then wanting
to go back to tick-tock or whatever

3298
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:46,720
to go back to tick-tock or whatever
 

3299
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,950
to go back to tick-tock or whatever
they do whatever they do in that area

3300
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
they do whatever they do in that area
 

3301
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,710
they do whatever they do in that area
i mean there's great sci-fi right about

3302
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:50,720
i mean there's great sci-fi right about
 

3303
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,270
i mean there's great sci-fi right about
um people being born on mars and because

3304
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:53,280
um people being born on mars and because
 

3305
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,109
um people being born on mars and because
it's a lower gravity environment they're

3306
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:55,119
it's a lower gravity environment they're
 

3307
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,109
it's a lower gravity environment they're
taller they're more gangly if they were

3308
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:57,119
taller they're more gangly if they were
 

3309
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,309
taller they're more gangly if they were
actually able to develop there and then

3310
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:58,319
actually able to develop there and then
 

3311
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,230
actually able to develop there and then
they come back to earth and they're like

3312
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:00,240
they come back to earth and they're like
 

3313
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,309
they come back to earth and they're like
second-class citizens because they can't

3314
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:02,319
second-class citizens because they can't
 

3315
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,069
second-class citizens because they can't
function here in the same way because

3316
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:04,079
function here in the same way because
 

3317
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,990
function here in the same way because
the gravity is too strong for them you

3318
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:06,000
the gravity is too strong for them you
 

3319
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,829
the gravity is too strong for them you
see this in series like the expanse with

3320
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:07,839
see this in series like the expanse with
 

3321
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,430
see this in series like the expanse with
the belters and these you know different

3322
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
the belters and these you know different
 

3323
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,230
the belters and these you know different
societies that uh if we were to succeed

3324
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:12,240
societies that uh if we were to succeed
 

3325
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,150
societies that uh if we were to succeed
in having human societies grow up in

3326
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:14,160
in having human societies grow up in
 

3327
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,069
in having human societies grow up in
different pockets it's

3328
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:16,079
different pockets it's
 

3329
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,589
different pockets it's
not necessarily going to be easy for

3330
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:17,599
not necessarily going to be easy for
 

3331
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,190
not necessarily going to be easy for
them to always come back to earth as

3332
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:19,200
them to always come back to earth as
 

3333
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,150
them to always come back to earth as
their home

3334
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:20,160
their home
 

3335
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,910
their home
yeah different cultures form which is

3336
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:21,920
yeah different cultures form which is
 

3337
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,589
yeah different cultures form which is
the positive way of phrasing it but it's

3338
00:57:23,589 --> 00:57:23,599
the positive way of phrasing it but it's
 

3339
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:25,190
the positive way of phrasing it but it's
also

3340
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:25,200
also
 

3341
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,870
also
this human history teaches us that we

3342
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:26,880
this human history teaches us that we
 

3343
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,349
this human history teaches us that we
have we like to form the other yeah so

3344
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:29,359
have we like to form the other yeah so
 

3345
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,789
have we like to form the other yeah so
there's this kind of conflict that

3346
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:30,799
there's this kind of conflict that
 

3347
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,309
there's this kind of conflict that
naturally emerges

3348
00:57:32,309 --> 00:57:32,319
naturally emerges
 

3349
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,309
naturally emerges
um let me ask another sort of dark

3350
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:34,319
um let me ask another sort of dark
 

3351
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,150
um let me ask another sort of dark
question uh what do you think about

3352
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:36,160

00:57:48,789 --> 00:57:48,799
space
 

3365
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,190
space
between wars between nations

3366

like from my perspective currently it
 

3369
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,030
like from my perspective currently it
just seems like space is a place for

3370
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
just seems like space is a place for
 

3371
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,030
just seems like space is a place for
scientists and engineers to explore

3372
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,040
scientists and engineers to explore
 

3373
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,750
scientists and engineers to explore
ideas but the more and more progress you

3374
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:01,760
ideas but the more and more progress you
 

3375
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:04,710
ideas but the more and more progress you
make does it worry you that nations

3376
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:04,720
make does it worry you that nations
 

3377
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,109
make does it worry you that nations
start to step in and

00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:07,119
start to step in and
 

3379
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,829
start to step in and
form you know that's that go out and

3380
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:09,839
form you know that's that go out and
 

3381
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,910
form you know that's that go out and
full out military conflict whether it's

3382
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:11,920
full out military conflict whether it's
 

3383
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,150
full out military conflict whether it's
in cyber space

3384
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
in cyber space
 

3385
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,589
in cyber space
in space

3386
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:15,599
in space
 

3387
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,230
in space
or uh actual hot war

3388
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
or uh actual hot war
 

3389
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,990

i am really concerned about that and i
do think for decades the scientific

3392
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
do think for decades the scientific
 

3393
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,390
do think for decades the scientific
community in space has hung on to this

3394
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
community in space has hung on to this
 

3395
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,829
community in space has hung on to this
notion from the 1967 outer space treaty

3396
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:27,839
notion from the 1967 outer space treaty
 

3397
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,430
notion from the 1967 outer space treaty
which is space is the province of all

3398
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,440
which is space is the province of all
 

3399

only
 

3403
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,030
only
but i do think the rise in tensions and

3404
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:35,040
but i do think the rise in tensions and
 

3405
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,670
but i do think the rise in tensions and
the geopolitical scene that we're seeing

3406
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:37,680
the geopolitical scene that we're seeing
 

3407
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,190
the geopolitical scene that we're seeing
um i do

3408
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,200
um i do
 

3409
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,270
um i do
yeah i do harbor a lot of concern about

hot wars following humanity out into

3412
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:43,839
hot wars following humanity out into
 

3413
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,710
hot wars following humanity out into

3414
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
space
 

3415
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,030
space
and it's worth trying

3416
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:47,040
and it's worth trying
 

3417
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,829
and it's worth trying
to

3418
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:47,839
to
 

3419
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,589
to
tie nations together with more

3420
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:49,599
tie nations together with more
 

3421
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,750
tie nations together with more
collaboration to avoid that happening

3422
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
collaboration to avoid that happening
 

3423
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,109
collaboration to avoid that happening
the international space station is a

3424
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:53,119
the international space station is a
 

3425
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,150
the international space station is a
great example i think it's something

3426
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,160
great example i think it's something
 

3427
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,309
great example i think it's something
like 18 countries are party to this

3428
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:56,319
like 18 countries are party to this
 

3429
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,630
like 18 countries are party to this
treaty it might be less it might be more

3430
00:58:58,630 --> 00:58:58,640
treaty it might be less it might be more
 

3431
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,309
treaty it might be less it might be more
um and then of course there's a smaller

3432
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:00,319
um and then of course there's a smaller
 

3433
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:01,589
um and then of course there's a smaller
number of countries that actually send

3434
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:01,599
number of countries that actually send
 

3435
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,829
number of countries that actually send
astronauts but even

3436
00:59:03,829 --> 00:59:03,839
astronauts but even
 

3437
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,990
astronauts but even
at the fall of the soviet union and

3438
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,000
at the fall of the soviet union and
 

3439
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,910
at the fall of the soviet union and
through some tense times with russia the

3440
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:07,920
through some tense times with russia the
 

3441
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,309

between mirror and iss
 

3447
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,190

01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,990
and everywhere else it seems like
collaborating on giant space projects is

3518
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:28,000
collaborating on giant space projects is
 

3519
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,630
collaborating on giant space projects is
one way to escape these wars

3520
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:30,640
one way to escape these wars
 

3521
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,950
one way to escape these wars
uh to escape these sort of geopolitical

3522
01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:32,960
uh to escape these sort of geopolitical
 

3523
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,390
uh to escape these sort of geopolitical
conflicts i mean there's something

3524
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:34,400
conflicts i mean there's something
 

3525
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,710
conflicts i mean there's something
there's so much camaraderie to the whole

3526
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:36,720
there's so much camaraderie to the whole
 

3527
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,670
there's so much camaraderie to the whole
thing and um even in this little

3528
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:41,680

 

3529
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,750

period of human history we're living uh

3530
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:43,760
period of human history we're living uh
 

3531
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,349
period of human history we're living uh
through it seems like that's essential

3532
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:45,359
through it seems like that's essential
 

3533
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,510
through it seems like that's essential
even through this pandemic

3534
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
even through this pandemic
 

3535
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,270
even through this pandemic
there's something so inspiring about

3536
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:49,280
there's something so inspiring about
 

3537
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,349
there's something so inspiring about
those like spacex rockets going on for

3538
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:51,359
those like spacex rockets going on for
 

3539
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,030
those like spacex rockets going on for
example that's true

3540
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,040
example that's true
 

3541
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,109
example that's true
uh this

3542
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:54,119
uh this
 

3543
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:56,630
uh this
re-invigoration of the space exploration

3544
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:56,640
re-invigoration of the space exploration
 

3545
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,789
re-invigoration of the space exploration
efforts by the commercial sector

3546
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
efforts by the commercial sector
 

3547
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,710
efforts by the commercial sector
i don't know that was

3548
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:00,720
i don't know that was
 

3549
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:01,990
i don't know that was
i had some

3550
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:02,000
i had some
 

3551
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,069
i had some
as many of us have sort of some dark

3552
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:04,079
as many of us have sort of some dark
 

3553
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,030
as many of us have sort of some dark
times during the this pandemic just like

3554
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:07,040
times during the this pandemic just like
 

3555
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,549
times during the this pandemic just like
loneliness and

3556
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:08,559
loneliness and
 

3557
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,789
loneliness and
sometimes emotion and anger and just and

3558
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:10,799
sometimes emotion and anger and just and
 

3559
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,829
sometimes emotion and anger and just and
just hopelessness and politics and then

3560
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:13,839
just hopelessness and politics and then
 

3561
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,910
just hopelessness and politics and then
you look at those rockets going up and

3562
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:15,920
you look at those rockets going up and
 

3563
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,150
you look at those rockets going up and
it just gives you hope so i i think

3564
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:18,160
it just gives you hope so i i think
 

3565
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,430
it just gives you hope so i i think
that's an understated sort of value of

3566
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:21,440
that's an understated sort of value of
 

3567
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,309
that's an understated sort of value of
space exploration is a thing that unites

3568
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:24,319
space exploration is a thing that unites
 

3569
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,190
space exploration is a thing that unites
us and gives us hope obviously also

3570
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:27,200
us and gives us hope obviously also
 

3571
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,349
us and gives us hope obviously also

all of science and literature and poetry

3578
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:35,359
all of science and literature and poetry
 

3579
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,789
all of science and literature and poetry
there's something about when you look up

3580
01:01:36,789 --> 01:01:36,799
there's something about when you look up
 

3581
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,589
there's something about when you look up
to the stars that makes you dream

3582
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
to the stars that makes you dream
 

3583
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,870
to the stars that makes you dream
very true and um so that that's a really

3584
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:42,880
very true and um so that that's a really
 

3585
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,870
very true and um so that that's a really
good reason to sort of invest in this

3586
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:44,880
good reason to sort of invest in this
 

3587
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,230
good reason to sort of invest in this
whether it's building giant

3588
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:46,240
whether it's building giant
 

3589
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,309
whether it's building giant
megastructure which is so freaking cool

3590
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:48,319
megastructure which is so freaking cool
 

3591
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,789
megastructure which is so freaking cool
but also uh

3592
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
but also uh
 

3593
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,630
but also uh
colonizing mars

3594
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:52,640
colonizing mars
 

3595
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,390
colonizing mars
yeah it's it's something to look forward

3596
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:54,400
yeah it's it's something to look forward
 

3597
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,910
yeah it's it's something to look forward
to

3598
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:55,920
to
 

3599
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,990
to
something that uh that

3600
01:01:57,990 --> 01:01:58,000
something that uh that
 

3601
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,109
something that uh that
uh

3602
01:01:59,109 --> 01:01:59,119
uh
 

3603
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,910
uh
and not make it a domain of war

3604
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:01,920
and not make it a domain of war
 

3605
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,390
and not make it a domain of war
but a a domain of human collaboration

3606
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:04,400
but a a domain of human collaboration
 

3607
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,829
but a a domain of human collaboration
and human compassion i think yeah you're

3608
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:07,839
and human compassion i think yeah you're
 

3609

01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:14,960
it includes a ton of projects so i just
 

3615
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,630
it includes a ton of projects so i just
wanted to

wanted to
 

3617
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,390
wanted to

from astrobiology like we talked about

3620
01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:20,559
from astrobiology like we talked about
 

3621
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,710
from astrobiology like we talked about
to habitats are there some other

3622
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:22,720
to habitats are there some other
 

3623
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,150
to habitats are there some other
interesting projects part of this

3624
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,160
interesting projects part of this
 

3625
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,150
interesting projects part of this
initiative that you are

3626
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,160
initiative that you are
 

3627
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,910
initiative that you are
that pop to mind that you find

3628
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:27,920
that pop to mind that you find
 

3629
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,029
that pop to mind that you find
particularly cool absolutely one is the

3630
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:31,039
particularly cool absolutely one is the
 

3631
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,430
particularly cool absolutely one is the
future of in-space manufacturing so if

3632
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:33,440
future of in-space manufacturing so if
 

3633
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,109
future of in-space manufacturing so if
we're going to build large-scale space

3634
01:02:35,109 --> 01:02:35,119
we're going to build large-scale space
 

3635
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,870
we're going to build large-scale space
structures yes it's great to ship them

3636
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:36,880
structures yes it's great to ship them
 

3637
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,190
structures yes it's great to ship them
up from earth and self-assemble them but

3638
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:39,200
up from earth and self-assemble them but
 

3639
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,870
up from earth and self-assemble them but
what about extrusion

3640
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:40,880
what about extrusion
 

3641
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,549
what about extrusion
in orbit it's one of the best

3642
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:42,559
in orbit it's one of the best
 

3643
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,190
in orbit it's one of the best
technologies to leverage in microgravity

3644
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,200
technologies to leverage in microgravity
 

3645
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,430
technologies to leverage in microgravity
because you can extrude a particularly

3646
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:47,440
because you can extrude a particularly
 

3647
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,750
because you can extrude a particularly
long beam that would sag in a normal

3648
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:49,760
long beam that would sag in a normal
 

3649
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,589
long beam that would sag in a normal
gravity environment but might be able to

3650
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:51,599
gravity environment but might be able to
 

3651
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,910
gravity environment but might be able to
become the basis of a truss or a large

3652
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:53,920
become the basis of a truss or a large
 

3653
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,069
become the basis of a truss or a large
scale space structure so we're doing

3654
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:56,079
scale space structure so we're doing
 

3655
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,150
scale space structure so we're doing
miniature tests of extrusion and are

3656
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,160
miniature tests of extrusion and are
 

3657
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,829
miniature tests of extrusion and are
excited to fly this on the international

3658
01:02:59,829 --> 01:02:59,839
excited to fly this on the international
 

3659
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,750
excited to fly this on the international
space station in a few months

3660
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:01,760
space station in a few months
 

3661
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,309
space station in a few months
we are working on swarm robots uh we

3662
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:04,319
we are working on swarm robots uh we
 

3663
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,710
we are working on swarm robots uh we
have just announced actually mit's

3664
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:06,720
have just announced actually mit's
 

3665
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,710
have just announced actually mit's
return to the moon

3666
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:08,720
return to the moon
 

3667
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,230
return to the moon
so my organization is leading this

3668
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,240
so my organization is leading this
 

3669
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,069
so my organization is leading this
mission for mit going back to the

3670
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
mission for mit going back to the
 

3671
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,670
mission for mit going back to the
surface of the moon as early as the end

3672
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:13,680
surface of the moon as early as the end
 

3673
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,349
surface of the moon as early as the end
of this year 2022 maybe early 2023

3674
01:03:17,349 --> 01:03:17,359
of this year 2022 maybe early 2023
 

3675
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,990
of this year 2022 maybe early 2023
and trying to take data

3676
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,000
and trying to take data
 

3677
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,910
and trying to take data
from our research payloads at this

3678
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:21,920
from our research payloads at this
 

3679
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,870
from our research payloads at this
historic south pole site where nasa's

3680
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:24,880
historic south pole site where nasa's
 

3681
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,950
historic south pole site where nasa's
supposed to send the first humans back

3682
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:26,960
supposed to send the first humans back
 

3683
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,710
supposed to send the first humans back
on the artemis iii mission so our hope

3684
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
on the artemis iii mission so our hope
 

3685
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,230
on the artemis iii mission so our hope
is to directly support that human

3686
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:30,240
is to directly support that human
 

3687
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,910
is to directly support that human
mission with our data

3688
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:31,920
mission with our data
 

3689
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,829
mission with our data
how does that connect to the swarm uh

3690
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
how does that connect to the swarm uh
 

3691
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,990
how does that connect to the swarm uh
aspects does it connect yes yeah so

3692
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
aspects does it connect yes yeah so
 

3693
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,190
aspects does it connect yes yeah so
we're actually going to fly one of the

3694
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:37,200
we're actually going to fly one of the
 

3695
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,870
we're actually going to fly one of the
little astro ants that's the current

3696
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
little astro ants that's the current
 

3697
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,109
little astro ants that's the current
plan one of the little swarm robots on

3698
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:41,119
plan one of the little swarm robots on
 

3699
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,549
plan one of the little swarm robots on
the top of a rover um that's part of the

3700
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:44,559
the top of a rover um that's part of the
 

3701
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,109
the top of a rover um that's part of the
riding a rover yes and exactly an ant

3702
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:47,119
riding a rover yes and exactly an ant
 

3703
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:49,109
riding a rover yes and exactly an ant
riding a rover that rover gets packed in

3704
01:03:49,109 --> 01:03:49,119
riding a rover that rover gets packed in
 

3705
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,950
riding a rover that rover gets packed in
a lander that lander gets packed in a

01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:50,960
a lander that lander gets packed in a
 

3707
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,870
a lander that lander gets packed in a
spacex rocket so it's a whole nesting

3708
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:52,880
spacex rocket so it's a whole nesting
 

3709
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,029

doll situation to get to to get to the

3710
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:55,039
doll situation to get to to get to the
 

3711
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,710
doll situation to get to to get to the
moon mother of robot dragons yes okay so

3712
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:58,720
moon mother of robot dragons yes okay so
 

3713
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,910
moon mother of robot dragons yes okay so
this one

3714
01:03:59,910 --> 01:03:59,920
this one
 

3715
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,549
this one
uh a swarm of one storm of one exactly

3716
01:04:02,549 --> 01:04:02,559
uh a swarm of one storm of one exactly
 

3717
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,309
uh a swarm of one storm of one exactly
we're testing out it's a tech

3718
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:04,319
we're testing out it's a tech
 

3719
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,150
we're testing out it's a tech
demonstration mission not a true not a

3720
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:06,160
demonstration mission not a true not a
 

3721
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,750
demonstration mission not a true not a
true swarm yeah there they are those are

3722
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:07,760
true swarm yeah there they are those are
 

3723
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,109
true swarm yeah there they are those are
the astro ants

3724
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:09,119
the astro ants
 

3725
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,109
the astro ants
wow and they this was a distributed

3726
01:04:11,109 --> 01:04:11,119
wow and they this was a distributed
 

3727
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,109
wow and they this was a distributed
system and they in in theory you could

3728
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:13,119
system and they in in theory you could
 

3729
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,029
system and they in in theory you could
have a ton of these yes these could also

3730
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:15,039
have a ton of these yes these could also
 

3731
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:16,470
have a ton of these yes these could also
be centralized so they they have

3732
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:16,480
be centralized so they they have
 

3733
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,069
be centralized so they they have
wireless technology that could also talk

3734
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:18,079
wireless technology that could also talk
 

3735
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:20,470
wireless technology that could also talk
to a central base station and we'll be

3736
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:20,480
to a central base station and we'll be
 

3737
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,549
to a central base station and we'll be
assessing kind of case by case whether

3738
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:22,559
assessing kind of case by case whether
 

3739
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,910
assessing kind of case by case whether
it makes sense to operate them in a

3740
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:23,920
it makes sense to operate them in a
 

3741
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,390
it makes sense to operate them in a
decentralized swarm or to command them

3742
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:26,400
decentralized swarm or to command them
 

3743
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,029
decentralized swarm or to command them
in a centralized swarm

3744
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:29,039
in a centralized swarm
 

3745
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,029
in a centralized swarm
each robot is equipped with four

3746
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:31,039
each robot is equipped with four
 

3747
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,109
each robot is equipped with four
magnetic wheels which enable the robot

3748
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:33,119
magnetic wheels which enable the robot
 

3749
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,510
magnetic wheels which enable the robot
to attach to any magnetic surface

3750
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:35,520
to attach to any magnetic surface
 

3751
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,109
to attach to any magnetic surface
so you can operate basically any

3752
01:04:37,109 --> 01:04:37,119
so you can operate basically any
 

3753
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,510
so you can operate basically any

3763
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,470
vomit comet prior to going to the moon
that must look so cool so they're

3764
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
that must look so cool so they're
 

3765
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,630
that must look so cool so they're
basically moving along different

3766
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:50,640
basically moving along different
 

3767
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,990
basically moving along different
like metallic surfaces yeah exactly

3768
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,000
like metallic surfaces yeah exactly
 

3769
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,829
like metallic surfaces yeah exactly
it's interesting when you you know just

3770
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:55,839
it's interesting when you you know just
 

3771
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,109
it's interesting when you you know just
a minute ago talking about the

3772
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:57,119
a minute ago talking about the
 

3773
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,190
a minute ago talking about the
reflection of

3774
01:04:59,190 --> 01:04:59,200
reflection of
 

3775
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,950
reflection of
how space can be so aspirational and so

3776
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:00,960
how space can be so aspirational and so
 

3777

photo that was taken where you see the

3784
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:08,640
photo that was taken where you see the
 

3785
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,390
photo that was taken where you see the
earth coming up over the horizon of the

3786
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:10,400
earth coming up over the horizon of the
 

3787
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,750
earth coming up over the horizon of the
moon and the quote is something along

3788
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:11,760
moon and the quote is something along
 

3789
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,069
moon and the quote is something along
the lines of we came all the way to

3790
01:05:14,069 --> 01:05:14,079
the lines of we came all the way to
 

3791
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,670
the lines of we came all the way to
discover the moon and what we really

3792
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:15,680
discover the moon and what we really
 

3793
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,750
discover the moon and what we really
discovered was the earth

3794
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:17,760
discovered was the earth
 

3795
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,990
discovered was the earth
this really powerful image looking back

3796
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,000
this really powerful image looking back
 

3797
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,190
this really powerful image looking back
and so we're also trying to think for

3798
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
and so we're also trying to think for
 

3799
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,109
and so we're also trying to think for
our lunar mission we realize we're very

3800
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:23,119
our lunar mission we realize we're very
 

3801
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,870
our lunar mission we realize we're very
privileged group at mit to get the

3802
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:24,880
privileged group at mit to get the
 

3803
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,190
privileged group at mit to get the
opportunity to do this how could we

3804
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,200
opportunity to do this how could we
 

3805
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,510
opportunity to do this how could we
bring humanity along with us and so one

3806
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
bring humanity along with us and so one
 

3807
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,950
bring humanity along with us and so one
of the things we're still testing out i

3808
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
of the things we're still testing out i
 

3809
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,150
of the things we're still testing out i
don't know if we're going to be able to

3810
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,160
don't know if we're going to be able to
 

3811
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,670
don't know if we're going to be able to
swing it would be to do something like a

3812
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
swing it would be to do something like a
 

3813
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,430
swing it would be to do something like a
twitch plays pokemon

3814
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:35,440
twitch plays pokemon
 

3815
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,789
twitch plays pokemon
but with the robot

3816
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
but with the robot
 

3817
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,549
but with the robot
so let a lot of people on earth actually

3818
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:38,559
so let a lot of people on earth actually
 

3819
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,470
so let a lot of people on earth actually
control the robot or at least benefit

3820
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,480
control the robot or at least benefit
 

3821
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:41,910
control the robot or at least benefit
from the data that we're gathering and

3822
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:41,920
from the data that we're gathering and
 

3823
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,829
from the data that we're gathering and
try to release the data openly

3824
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:43,839
try to release the data openly
 

3825
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,109
try to release the data openly
so we're exploring a couple different

3826
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
so we're exploring a couple different
 

3827
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,190
so we're exploring a couple different
ideas for how do we engage more people

3828
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:47,200
ideas for how do we engage more people
 

3829
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,270
ideas for how do we engage more people
in this mission that would be surreal to

3830
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:49,280
in this mission that would be surreal to
 

3831
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,270
in this mission that would be surreal to
be able to interact

3832
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,280
be able to interact
 

3833
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,270
be able to interact

um i think about artificial intelligence

3840
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:00,319
um i think about artificial intelligence
 

3841
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,190
um i think about artificial intelligence
in that same way which is like building

3842
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:03,200
in that same way which is like building

puts a mirror to us humans
 

3847
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,349
puts a mirror to us humans
it makes us like wonder about like what

3848
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:09,359
it makes us like wonder about like what
 

3849
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,510
it makes us like wonder about like what
is intelligence what is consciousness

3850
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:11,520
is intelligence what is consciousness
 

3851
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,510
is intelligence what is consciousness
and what is actually valuable about

3852
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:13,520
and what is actually valuable about
 

3853
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,990
and what is actually valuable about
human beings when when uh ai system

3854
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:16,000
human beings when when uh ai system
 

3855
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,150

you start to let go of this idea that

3858
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:19,760
you start to let go of this idea that
 

3859
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,190
you start to let go of this idea that
humans are special because of

humans are special because of
 

3861
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,710
humans are special because of

intelligence
 

3863
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,470

it's it's something else um

3864
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:26,480
it's it's something else um
 

3865
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:29,029
it's it's something else um
maybe the flame of human consciousness

3866
01:06:29,029 --> 01:06:29,039
maybe the flame of human consciousness
 

3867
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,349
maybe the flame of human consciousness
it's the capacity to uh

3868
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:31,359
it's the capacity to uh
 

3869
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,750
it's the capacity to uh
to feel deeply to sort of

to feel deeply to sort of

the poor guy just wanted to maintain the
 

3895
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,829
the poor guy just wanted to maintain the
mission and the astronauts were i mean i

3896
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:03,839
mission and the astronauts were i mean i
 

3897
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,349

i don't know if people often talk about

3898
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:05,359
i don't know if people often talk about
 

3899
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:07,910
i don't know if people often talk about
that but you know um

3900
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:07,920
that but you know um
 

3901
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,430
that but you know um
like doctors have to make difficult

3902
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:09,440
like doctors have to make difficult
 

3903
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,710
like doctors have to make difficult
decisions too when there's limited

3904
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:10,720
decisions too when there's limited
 

3905
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:12,390
decisions too when there's limited
resources you actually do have to

3906
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:12,400
resources you actually do have to
 

3907
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,150
resources you actually do have to
sacrifice human life often because you

3908
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,160
sacrifice human life often because you
 

3909
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:16,630
sacrifice human life often because you
have to make uh decisions

3910
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:16,640
have to make uh decisions
 

3911
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,029
have to make uh decisions
and i think hal was probably making that

3912
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:19,039
and i think hal was probably making that
 

3913
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:21,670
and i think hal was probably making that
kind of decision uh about what

3914
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:21,680
kind of decision uh about what
 

3915
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,270
kind of decision uh about what
what's more important the lives of

3916
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:23,280
what's more important the lives of
 

3917
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,670
what's more important the lives of
individual astronauts or the mission the

3918
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:25,680
individual astronauts or the mission the
 

3919
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,109
individual astronauts or the mission the
mission and i feel like ai's when other

3920
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
mission and i feel like ai's when other
 

3921

humans
 

3923
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,510
humans
will need to make

3924
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:31,520
will need to make
 

3925
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,950

where we'll start to get a little bit
 

4037
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,470
where we'll start to get a little bit
closer to that future

closer to that future
 

4039

like people don't realize this i think

4052
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:27,440
like people don't realize this i think
 

4053
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,269
like people don't realize this i think
that we you know we humans long for

4054
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:29,279
that we you know we humans long for
 

4055
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,630
that we you know we humans long for
connection and when you have even a

4056
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:30,640
connection and when you have even a
 

4057
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,510
connection and when you have even a
basic interaction that's just like

4058
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:33,520
basic interaction that's just like
 

4059
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,269
basic interaction that's just like
supposed to be just like serving you or

4060
01:09:35,269 --> 01:09:35,279
supposed to be just like serving you or
 

4061
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:36,309
supposed to be just like serving you or
something

4062
01:09:36,309 --> 01:09:36,319
something
 

4063
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,749
something
you still project it's still um

4064
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:39,759
you still project it's still um
 

4065
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,470
you still project it's still um
still a source of uh

4066
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,480
still a source of uh
 

4067
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,189
still a source of uh
meaning and connection

4068
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:45,199
meaning and connection
 

4069
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:46,950
meaning and connection
and so you do have to think about that i

4070
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:46,960
and so you do have to think about that i
 

4071
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,189
and so you do have to think about that i
mean hell 9000

4072
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
mean hell 9000
 

4073
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:50,870
mean hell 9000
we you know the movie maybe doesn't

4074
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
we you know the movie maybe doesn't
 

4075
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,709
we you know the movie maybe doesn't
portray it that way but i'm sure there's

4076
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:52,719
portray it that way but i'm sure there's
 

4077
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:54,070
portray it that way but i'm sure there's
a relationship there between the

4078
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
a relationship there between the
 

4079
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,070
a relationship there between the
astronauts and and the robot yeah

4080
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:56,080
astronauts and and the robot yeah
 

4081
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,110
astronauts and and the robot yeah
especially when you have greater and

4082
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,120
especially when you have greater and
 

4083
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:59,110
especially when you have greater and
greater level of intelligence maybe that

4084
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,120
greater level of intelligence maybe that
 

4085
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:00,870
greater level of intelligence maybe that
addresses the

4086
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:00,880
addresses the
 

4087
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,870
addresses the
the happiness question too

4088
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:02,880
the happiness question too
 

4089
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,950
the happiness question too
yeah i think there's a there's a great

4090
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
yeah i think there's a there's a great
 

4091
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,790
yeah i think there's a there's a great
book by kate darling who's one of my

4092
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:06,800
book by kate darling who's one of my
 

4093
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,070
book by kate darling who's one of my
she's colleagues

4094
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:08,080
she's colleagues
 

4095
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,590
she's colleagues
yeah she's amazing we've been she's

4096
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:09,600
yeah she's amazing we've been she's
 

4097
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,350
yeah she's amazing we've been she's
already been on this podcast

4098
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:11,360
already been on this podcast
 

4099
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,270
already been on this podcast
but we talk all the time and we're

4100
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:13,280
but we talk all the time and we're
 

4101
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,709
but we talk all the time and we're
supposed to talk

4102
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
supposed to talk
 

4103
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:16,229
supposed to talk
and we've been missing each other and

4104
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:16,239
and we've been missing each other and
 

4105
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,390
and we've been missing each other and
we're gonna make it happen soon yeah

4106
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:18,400
we're gonna make it happen soon yeah
 

4107
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,470
we're gonna make it happen soon yeah
come uh come down to texas okay all

4108
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:20,480
come uh come down to texas okay all
 

4109
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,470
come uh come down to texas okay all
right anyway yeah she's amazing she has

4110
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:22,480
right anyway yeah she's amazing she has
 

4111
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,390
right anyway yeah she's amazing she has
this book it's just her whole work is

4112
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:24,400
this book it's just her whole work is
 

4113
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,390
this book it's just her whole work is
about this connection with robots yeah

4114
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
about this connection with robots yeah
 

4115
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,750
about this connection with robots yeah
this beautiful connection that we have

4116
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
this beautiful connection that we have
 

4117
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,510
this beautiful connection that we have
with robots but i think it's greater and

4118
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:29,520
with robots but i think it's greater and
 

4119
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,270
with robots but i think it's greater and
greater importance when it's out in

4120
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,280
greater importance when it's out in
 

4121
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,590
greater importance when it's out in
space because it could help alleviate

4122
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:33,600
space because it could help alleviate
 

4123
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,750
space because it could help alleviate
some of the loneliness right one of the

01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:37,199
projects in the book that i gave you
 

4127
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,950
projects in the book that i gave you
which is a catalog of the projects that

01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:38,960
which is a catalog of the projects that
 

4129

4131
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,950
we've worked on over the last five years
is the social robot that was developed

4132
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:42,960
is the social robot that was developed
 

4133
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,030
is the social robot that was developed
at the media lab and we one of the first

4134
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:45,040
at the media lab and we one of the first
 

4135
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,750
at the media lab and we one of the first
years in 2017 that we flew a 0g flight

4136
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:47,760
years in 2017 that we flew a 0g flight
 

4137
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,830
years in 2017 that we flew a 0g flight
we took the social robot along and tried

4138
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:49,840
we took the social robot along and tried
 

4139
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,750
we took the social robot along and tried
to do a little bit of a very scaled-down

4140
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
to do a little bit of a very scaled-down
 

4141
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,990
to do a little bit of a very scaled-down
human study to look at these questions

4142
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:54,000
human study to look at these questions
 

4143
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,669
human study to look at these questions
because you do imagine that we would

4144
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:55,679
because you do imagine that we would
 

4145
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,310
because you do imagine that we would
form a bond a real bond with the social

4146
01:10:58,310 --> 01:10:58,320
form a bond a real bond with the social
 

4147
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,830
form a bond a real bond with the social
robots that might be

4148
01:10:59,830 --> 01:10:59,840
robots that might be
 

4149
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,590
robots that might be
not just serving us on a mission but

4150
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,600
not just serving us on a mission but
 

4151
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,669
not just serving us on a mission but
really be our teammates on a future

4152
01:11:03,669 --> 01:11:03,679
really be our teammates on a future
 

4153
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,270

and then the the single people some of
 

4313
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,390
and then the the single people some of
them went off

4314
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:42,400
them went off
 

4315
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,550
them went off
the cliff and some of them discovered

4316
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:44,560
the cliff and some of them discovered
 

4317
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,229
the cliff and some of them discovered
their new happiness and meaning and so

4318
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:46,239
their new happiness and meaning and so
 

4319
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,630
their new happiness and meaning and so
on it's a beautiful little experiment a

4320
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:48,640
on it's a beautiful little experiment a
 

4321
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,189
on it's a beautiful little experiment a
painful one yeah is there a thorough way

4322
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:51,199
painful one yeah is there a thorough way
 

4323
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,350
painful one yeah is there a thorough way
to really test that

4324
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:53,360
to really test that
 

4325
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,630
to really test that
to

4326
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:54,640
to
 

4327
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,390
to
because it's such a costly experiment

4328
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:58,400
because it's such a costly experiment
 

4329
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,149
because it's such a costly experiment
to send humans up there but i guess you

4330
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
to send humans up there but i guess you
 

4331
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,669
to send humans up there but i guess you
can always return back to earth if it's

4332
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:01,679
can always return back to earth if it's
 

4333
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,149
can always return back to earth if it's
not working out that's what we hope

4334
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159
not working out that's what we hope
 

4335
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,510
not working out that's what we hope
you hope you don't have like a you know

4336
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:05,520
you hope you don't have like a you know
 

4337
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,350
you hope you don't have like a you know
apollo 13 situation that doesn't quite

4338
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
apollo 13 situation that doesn't quite
 

4339
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,189
apollo 13 situation that doesn't quite
make it back but yeah the

4340
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:09,199
make it back but yeah the
 

4341
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,030
make it back but yeah the
this is also why mars is such a

4342
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:11,040
this is also why mars is such a
 

4343
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,950
this is also why mars is such a
challenge the moon is only three days

4344
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:12,960
challenge the moon is only three days
 

4345
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,870
challenge the moon is only three days
away that's a lot quicker to recover

4346
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
away that's a lot quicker to recover
 

4347
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,470
away that's a lot quicker to recover
from if there's a psychological problem

4348
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
from if there's a psychological problem
 

4349
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,910
from if there's a psychological problem
with the crew or any type of maintenance

4350
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:17,920
with the crew or any type of maintenance
 

4351
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,430
with the crew or any type of maintenance
problem anything

4352
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:19,440
problem anything
 

4353
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,750
problem anything
three years is

4354
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:21,760
three years is
 

4355
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:22,950
three years is
such a

4356
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:22,960
such a
 

4357
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,470
such a
challenge compared to these other

4358
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
challenge compared to these other
 

4359
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,669
challenge compared to these other
domains that we've been getting more

4360
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:25,679
domains that we've been getting more
 

4361
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,910
domains that we've been getting more
used to in terms of human space flight

4362
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:27,920
used to in terms of human space flight
 

4363
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,669
used to in terms of human space flight
so this is a question that we will need

4364
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:29,679
so this is a question that we will need
 

4365
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:31,189
so this is a question that we will need
to have explored more before we start

4366
01:14:31,189 --> 01:14:31,199
to have explored more before we start
 

4367
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,550
to have explored more before we start
really sending crews to mars so you're a

4368
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:34,560
really sending crews to mars so you're a
 

4369
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,430
really sending crews to mars so you're a
young scientist do you think in your

4370
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:37,440
young scientist do you think in your
 

4371
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,669
young scientist do you think in your
lifetime

4372
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:39,679
lifetime
 

4373
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,430
lifetime
you will go out into orbit

4374
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,440
you will go out into orbit
 

4375
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,870
you will go out into orbit
you will

4376
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:44,880
you will
 

4377
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,350
you will
go out beyond into deep space and

4378
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:47,360
go out beyond into deep space and
 

4379
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,510
go out beyond into deep space and
potentially step

4380
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:49,520
potentially step
 

4381
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,830
potentially step
you i i don't know if you can call

4382
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:51,840
you i i don't know if you can call
 

4383
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,669
you i i don't know if you can call
yourself a civilian i don't know if

4384
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:53,679
yourself a civilian i don't know if
 

4385
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:55,910
yourself a civilian i don't know if
that's what you count as but you as

4386
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:55,920
that's what you count as but you as
 

4387

01:14:58,709 --> 01:14:58,719
as a curious aunt
 

4389
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:02,149
as a curious aunt

01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
uh from mit uh land
 

4391
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:05,910
uh from mit uh land
step on mars yes

4392
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:05,920

 

4393
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,510

the firm that's the first coming back

4394
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:07,520
the firm that's the first coming back
 

4395
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,110
the firm that's the first coming back
firm yes yeah i'm coming back i don't

4396
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:09,120
firm yes yeah i'm coming back i don't
 

4397
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,310
firm yes yeah i'm coming back i don't
want that one-way mission i want the

4398
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:10,320
want that one-way mission i want the
 

4399
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,790
want that one-way mission i want the
two-way mission um but yes i mean i

4400
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:12,800
two-way mission um but yes i mean i
 

4401
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,470
two-way mission um but yes i mean i
think we're already talking about a

4402
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:14,480
think we're already talking about a
 

4403
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:16,550
think we're already talking about a
pretty near-term opportunity where i

4404
01:15:16,550 --> 01:15:16,560
pretty near-term opportunity where i
 

4405
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,990
pretty near-term opportunity where i
could send graduate students to the

4406
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:18,000
could send graduate students to the
 

4407
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,110
could send graduate students to the
international space station yeah

4408
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:21,120
international space station yeah
 

4409
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,990
international space station yeah
not that not as you know not a sacrifice

4410
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:24,000
not that not as you know not a sacrifice
 

4411
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,790
not that not as you know not a sacrifice
no but send graduates

4412
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:26,800
no but send graduates
 

4413
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,550
no but send graduates
send graduate students to the iss to do

4414
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:28,560
send graduate students to the iss to do
 

4415
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:30,709
send graduate students to the iss to do
their research i do think you and i both

4416
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:30,719
their research i do think you and i both
 

4417
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:32,550
their research i do think you and i both
would have an opportunity to go to a

4418
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:32,560
would have an opportunity to go to a
 

4419
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,030
would have an opportunity to go to a
lunar base of some sort within our

4420
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:35,040
lunar base of some sort within our
 

4421
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,590
lunar base of some sort within our
lifetime and there's a good chance

4422
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:37,600
lifetime and there's a good chance
 

4423
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,990
lifetime and there's a good chance
if we really wanted to we might have to

4424
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:40,000
if we really wanted to we might have to
 

4425
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,990
if we really wanted to we might have to
really advocate for it you know apply to

4426
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:42,000
really advocate for it you know apply to
 

4427
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,910
really advocate for it you know apply to
an astronaut program there will be some

4428
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:43,920
an astronaut program there will be some
 

4429
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,750
an astronaut program there will be some
avenues for humans in our lifetime to go

4430
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:45,760
avenues for humans in our lifetime to go
 

4431
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,750
avenues for humans in our lifetime to go
to mars what's the bar for like

4432
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:49,760
to mars what's the bar for like
 

4433
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,950
to mars what's the bar for like
health

4434
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:50,960
health
 

4435
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,390
health
do you do you think that bar will keep

4436
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:52,400
do you do you think that bar will keep
 

4437
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,990
do you do you think that bar will keep
getting lower and lower in terms of how

4438
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
getting lower and lower in terms of how
 

4439
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,550
getting lower and lower in terms of how
healthy how athletic like how yes or the

4440
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:56,560
healthy how athletic like how yes or the
 

4441
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,390
healthy how athletic like how yes or the
psychological profile all those kinds of

4442
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
psychological profile all those kinds of
 

4443
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,310
psychological profile all those kinds of
things yeah for one we're going to build

4444
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:00,320
things yeah for one we're going to build
 

4445
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,310
things yeah for one we're going to build
more robust habitats that don't depend

4446
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,320
more robust habitats that don't depend
 

4447
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,790
more robust habitats that don't depend
on astronauts being so impeccably well

flights and get them access to engaging

4610
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:51,360
flights and get them access to engaging
 

4611
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,110
flights and get them access to engaging
in the space industry so it's become

4612
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:53,120
in the space industry so it's become
 

4613
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,350
in the space industry so it's become
cheap enough um and the prices have

4614
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:55,360
cheap enough um and the prices have
 

4615
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,950
cheap enough um and the prices have
dropped enough to consider even that so

4616
01:18:56,950 --> 01:18:56,960
dropped enough to consider even that so
 

4617
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,390
dropped enough to consider even that so
that's amazing it definitely doesn't

4628
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:08,800
sure you need a nasa allocation budget
 

4629
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,870
sure you need a nasa allocation budget
you know you need billions but for a lot

4630
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:10,880
you know you need billions but for a lot
 

4631
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,550
you know you need billions but for a lot
of the stuff in the book uh and our

4632
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:12,560
of the stuff in the book uh and our
 

4633
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,990
of the stuff in the book uh and our
research portfolio it's actually

4634
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:14,000
research portfolio it's actually
 

4635
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,470
research portfolio it's actually
becoming far more accessible so that's

4636
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:16,480
becoming far more accessible so that's
 

4637
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,350
becoming far more accessible so that's
uh commercial what about nasa

4638
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:19,360
uh commercial what about nasa
 

4639
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:22,790
uh commercial what about nasa
and mit academia yeah i think you know

4640
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:22,800
and mit academia yeah i think you know
 

4641
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,070
and mit academia yeah i think you know
people have been

4642
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:24,080
people have been
 

4643
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,630
people have been
worried about nasa the last few years

4644
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:26,640
worried about nasa the last few years
 

4645
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,709
worried about nasa the last few years
because in some people's minds they are

4646
01:19:28,709 --> 01:19:28,719
because in some people's minds they are
 

4647
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,790
because in some people's minds they are
seeding ground to these commercial

4648
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:30,800
seeding ground to these commercial
 

4649
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,189
seeding ground to these commercial
efforts but that's really not that's

4650
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:33,199
efforts but that's really not that's
 

4651
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:34,709
efforts but that's really not that's
really not what's happening nasa

4652
01:19:34,709 --> 01:19:34,719
really not what's happening nasa
 

4653
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:37,430
really not what's happening nasa
empowered these commercial efforts

4654
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:37,440
empowered these commercial efforts
 

4655
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,950
empowered these commercial efforts
because they want to free themselves up

4656
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:38,960
because they want to free themselves up
 

4657
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,149
because they want to free themselves up
to go to mars and go to europa and

4658
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,159
to go to mars and go to europa and
 

4659
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:44,790
to go to mars and go to europa and
continue being that really aspirational

4660
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:44,800
continue being that really aspirational
 

4661
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,709
continue being that really aspirational
force for humanity of pushing the

4662
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
force for humanity of pushing the
 

4663
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,790
force for humanity of pushing the
boundary always pushing the boundary and

4664
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:48,800
boundary always pushing the boundary and

if they were anchored in low earth orbit

4666
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:50,719
if they were anchored in low earth orbit
 

4667
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,030
if they were anchored in low earth orbit
maintaining a space station indefinitely

4668
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:53,040
maintaining a space station indefinitely
 

4669
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,550
maintaining a space station indefinitely
that's so much a part of their budget

4670
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:54,560
that's so much a part of their budget
 

4671
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,990
that's so much a part of their budget
that it was keeping them from being able

4672
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:56,000
that it was keeping them from being able
 

4673
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,750
that it was keeping them from being able
to do more so it actually is really

4674
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:57,760
to do more so it actually is really
 

4675
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,590
to do more so it actually is really
fantastic for nasa to have grown this

4676
01:19:59,590 --> 01:19:59,600
fantastic for nasa to have grown this
 

4677
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,350
fantastic for nasa to have grown this
commercial ecosystem and then that frees

4678
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,360
commercial ecosystem and then that frees
 

4679
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,830
commercial ecosystem and then that frees
nasa up to go further and in academia we

4680
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:03,840
nasa up to go further and in academia we
 

4681
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,750
nasa up to go further and in academia we
like to think that we will be able to do

4682
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
like to think that we will be able to do
 

4683
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,270
like to think that we will be able to do
the provocative next generation research

4684
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:09,280
the provocative next generation research
 

4685
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,910
the provocative next generation research
that is going to unlock things at that

4686
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:11,920
that is going to unlock things at that
 

4687
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,709
that is going to unlock things at that
frontier and uh we can partner with nasa

4688
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:14,719
frontier and uh we can partner with nasa
 

4689
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:16,070
frontier and uh we can partner with nasa
we can go through a program if we want

4690
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,080
we can go through a program if we want
 

4691
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,149
we can go through a program if we want
to send a probe out really far but we

4692
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:18,159
to send a probe out really far but we
 

4693
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:19,669
to send a probe out really far but we
can also partner with spacex and see

4694
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
can also partner with spacex and see
 

4695
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,070
can also partner with spacex and see
what human life in a spacex mars

4696
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
what human life in a spacex mars
 

4697
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,350
what human life in a spacex mars
settlement might look like and how we

4698
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:23,360
settlement might look like and how we
 

4699
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,709
settlement might look like and how we
could design for that

4700
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:24,719
could design for that
 

4701
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,950
could design for that
speaking of projects maybe other other

4702
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:26,960
speaking of projects maybe other other
 

4703
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,950
speaking of projects maybe other other
projects that pop to mind from the space

4704
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:28,960
projects that pop to mind from the space
 

4705
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,470
projects that pop to mind from the space
exploration initiative or maybe stuff

4706
01:20:30,470 --> 01:20:30,480
exploration initiative or maybe stuff
 

4707
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,790
exploration initiative or maybe stuff
from the book the that you can mention

4708
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:32,800
from the book the that you can mention
 

4709
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,550
from the book the that you can mention
something super cool i mean everything

4710
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:34,560
something super cool i mean everything
 

4711
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,750
something super cool i mean everything
we've been talking about is cool but

4712
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:35,760
we've been talking about is cool but
 

4713
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,669
we've been talking about is cool but
just something that pops to mind again

4714
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:37,679
just something that pops to mind again
 

4715
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,310
just something that pops to mind again
yeah um so we talked about life in space

4716
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,320
yeah um so we talked about life in space
 

4717
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,470
yeah um so we talked about life in space
and you might need more arms than legs

4718
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,480
and you might need more arms than legs
 

4719
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,229
and you might need more arms than legs
uh one of the projects by valentina

4720
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:44,239
uh one of the projects by valentina
 

4721
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:48,550
uh one of the projects by valentina
sumini was a air-powered robotics tail

4722
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:48,560
sumini was a air-powered robotics tail
 

4723
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,390
sumini was a air-powered robotics tail
so it's a soft robotics tail that

4724
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400
so it's a soft robotics tail that
 

4725
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,910
so it's a soft robotics tail that
essentially has a little camera on the

4726
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
essentially has a little camera on the
 

4727
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,149
essentially has a little camera on the
back end of it can do computer vision

4728
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:54,159
back end of it can do computer vision
 

4729
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,830
back end of it can do computer vision
and knows where to grapple so it's

4730
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:55,840
and knows where to grapple so it's
 

4731
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,990
and knows where to grapple so it's
behind you it grapples onto something

4732
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
behind you it grapples onto something
 

4733
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,669
behind you it grapples onto something
and holds you in space and then you can

4734
01:20:59,669 --> 01:20:59,679
and holds you in space and then you can
 

4735
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:01,270
and holds you in space and then you can
actually free up both of your hands to

4736
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:01,280
actually free up both of your hands to
 

4737
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,950
actually free up both of your hands to
work so we're already starting to think

4738
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:02,960
work so we're already starting to think
 

4739
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,229
work so we're already starting to think
about the design of bionic humans or

4740
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
about the design of bionic humans or
 

4741
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,590
about the design of bionic humans or
prosthetics or things that would make

4742
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:07,600
prosthetics or things that would make
 

4743
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,310
prosthetics or things that would make
you kind of like a cyborg to augment

4744
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
you kind of like a cyborg to augment
 

4745
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,550
you kind of like a cyborg to augment
your capabilities when you're in a space

4746
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:12,560
your capabilities when you're in a space
 

4747
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:14,070
your capabilities when you're in a space
environment would you control something

4748
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,080
environment would you control something
 

4749
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,830
environment would you control something
like that so it's kind of like a

4750
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
like that so it's kind of like a
 

4751
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,750
like that so it's kind of like a
i mean you can't call it a leg

4752
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,760
i mean you can't call it a leg
 

4753
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,149
i mean you can't call it a leg
but whatever it's a additional appendage

4754
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:20,159
but whatever it's a additional appendage
 

4755
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:22,070
but whatever it's a additional appendage
appendage so how would you what are

4756
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,080
appendage so how would you what are
 

4757
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,350
appendage so how would you what are
ideas for controlling something like

4758
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:23,360
ideas for controlling something like
 

4759
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,590
ideas for controlling something like
that yeah so right now it's super yes

4760
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:25,600
that yeah so right now it's super yes
 

4761
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,510
that yeah so right now it's super yes
there you go that's cool right now it's

4762
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:27,520
there you go that's cool right now it's
 

4763
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,590
there you go that's cool right now it's
super manual um

4764
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:29,600
super manual um
 

4765
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,430
super manual um
it's uh basically just like a kind of a

4766
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:31,440
it's uh basically just like a kind of a
 

4767
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,189
it's uh basically just like a kind of a
set pattern of inflating as we're

4768
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:33,199
set pattern of inflating as we're
 

4769
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,189
set pattern of inflating as we're
testing it but in the future if we had a

4770
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:35,199
testing it but in the future if we had a
 

4771
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,790
testing it but in the future if we had a
neurolink i mean this is something that

4772
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:36,800
neurolink i mean this is something that
 

4773
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,870
neurolink i mean this is something that
you could imagine directly controlling

4774
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
you could imagine directly controlling
 

4775
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,550
you could imagine directly controlling
just thinking thoughts and controlling

4776
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:40,560
just thinking thoughts and controlling
 

4777
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,470
just thinking thoughts and controlling
it that's a ways away

4778
01:21:42,470 --> 01:21:42,480
it that's a ways away
 

4779
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,950
it that's a ways away
yeah so we talked about on the biology

4780
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:44,960
yeah so we talked about on the biology
 

4781
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,550
yeah so we talked about on the biology
side astrobiology there's probably

4782
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:46,560
side astrobiology there's probably
 

4783
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,070
side astrobiology there's probably
agriculture stuff

4784
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:48,080
agriculture stuff
 

4785
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,910
agriculture stuff
uh is there other things that kind of

4786
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:49,920
uh is there other things that kind of
 

4787
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,390
uh is there other things that kind of
feed the ecosystem of out in space for

4788
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:52,400
feed the ecosystem of out in space for
 

4789
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,470
feed the ecosystem of out in space for
survival or or the robotics

4790
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:54,480
survival or or the robotics
 

4791
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,629
survival or or the robotics
architectures the self-assemblies so

4792
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:56,639
architectures the self-assemblies so
 

4793
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:57,830
architectures the self-assemblies so
kind of combining something we were

4794
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:57,840
kind of combining something we were
 

4795
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,510
kind of combining something we were
talking about you can form these

4796
01:21:59,510 --> 01:21:59,520
talking about you can form these
 

4797
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,950
talking about you can form these
relationships with objects and

4798
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:00,960
relationships with objects and
 

4799
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,110
relationships with objects and
anthropomorphize yes one of the things

4800
01:22:03,110 --> 01:22:03,120
anthropomorphize yes one of the things
 

4801
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:03,910
anthropomorphize yes one of the things
that we're thinking about for

4802
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:03,920
that we're thinking about for
 

4803
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,390
that we're thinking about for
agriculture created by um manway and

4804
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:06,400
agriculture created by um manway and
 

4805
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,950
agriculture created by um manway and
somu so two students at mit was this

4806
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:08,960
somu so two students at mit was this
 

4807
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,790
somu so two students at mit was this
little it looks like a planet uh but

4808
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:10,800
little it looks like a planet uh but
 

4809
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,110
little it looks like a planet uh but
it's inspired by i think a mandala or

4810
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:13,120
it's inspired by i think a mandala or
 

4811
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,430
it's inspired by i think a mandala or
nepalese spinning wheel and you plant

4812
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:15,440
nepalese spinning wheel and you plant
 

4813
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,270
nepalese spinning wheel and you plant
plants on the inside and that astronaut

4814
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:17,280
plants on the inside and that astronaut
 

4815
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,430
plants on the inside and that astronaut
has to spin it every day to help the

4816
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:19,440
has to spin it every day to help the
 

4817
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,750
has to spin it every day to help the
plants survive so it's a way to give the

4818
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:21,760
plants survive so it's a way to give the
 

4819
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,669
plants survive so it's a way to give the
astronauts something to care about

4820
01:22:23,669 --> 01:22:23,679
astronauts something to care about
 

4821
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:25,350
astronauts something to care about
something that they are responsible for

4822
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:25,360
something that they are responsible for
 

4823
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,350
something that they are responsible for
keeping alive and can really

4824
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
keeping alive and can really
 

4825
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,270
keeping alive and can really
invest themselves in and it's not

4826
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:29,280
invest themselves in and it's not
 

4827
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,350
invest themselves in and it's not
necessary right we have other ways to

4828
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:31,360
necessary right we have other ways to
 

4829
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,270
necessary right we have other ways to
grow in orbit

4830
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:33,280
grow in orbit
 

4831
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,350
grow in orbit

hydroponics liquid medium trying to keep
the liquid around the plant roots is

4834
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:36,880
the liquid around the plant roots is
 

4835
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,470
the liquid around the plant roots is
hard because there's no gravity to pull

4836
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:38,480
hard because there's no gravity to pull
 

4837
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,229
hard because there's no gravity to pull
it down in a particular direction but

4838
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,239
it down in a particular direction but

said
 

4843
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,229
said
sure we have ways that the plants could

4844
01:22:44,229 --> 01:22:44,239
sure we have ways that the plants could
 

4845
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,149
sure we have ways that the plants could
grow on their own but the astronauts

4846
01:22:46,149 --> 01:22:46,159
grow on their own but the astronauts
 

4847
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:48,070
grow on their own but the astronauts
might want to care for it in the same

4848
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,080
might want to care for it in the same
 

4849
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,750
might want to care for it in the same
way that we have little plants that come

4850
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:49,760
way that we have little plants that come
 

4851
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,669
way that we have little plants that come
to be important to us little plant

4852

friends
yeah so there's agrifuge that's an early

4856
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
yeah so there's agrifuge that's an early

i guess this is the best of um

4862
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:00,560
i guess this is the best of um
 

4863
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:02,229
i guess this is the best of um
academic research is you can do these

4864
01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:02,239
academic research is you can do these
 

4865
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:05,189
academic research is you can do these
kinds of wild wild ideas yeah well you

4866
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:05,199
kinds of wild wild ideas yeah well you
 

4867
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,189
kinds of wild wild ideas yeah well you
know i get to spend quite a bit of time

4868
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:07,199
know i get to spend quite a bit of time
 

4869
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:12,310
know i get to spend quite a bit of time
with mr elon musk and he's very stressed

4870
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:12,320
with mr elon musk and he's very stressed
 

4871
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,709
with mr elon musk and he's very stressed
especially about um starship and all

4872
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:14,719
especially about um starship and all
 

4873
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,750
especially about um starship and all
those kinds of engineering efforts yeah

4874
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:17,760
those kinds of engineering efforts yeah
 

4875
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,669
those kinds of engineering efforts yeah
what do you think about how damn hard it

4876
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:19,679
what do you think about how damn hard it
 

4877
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:21,270
what do you think about how damn hard it
is

4878
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:21,280
is
 

4879
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,430
is
to get up

4880
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:23,440
to get up
 

4881
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,030
to get up
like are we humans gonna be able to do

4882
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,040
like are we humans gonna be able to do
 

4883
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,870
like are we humans gonna be able to do
this

4884
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:26,880
this
 

4885
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,870
this
i don't know i i think it feels like

4886
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:28,880
i don't know i i think it feels like
 

4887
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,470
i don't know i i think it feels like
it's an engineering problem it's a

4888
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:30,480
it's an engineering problem it's a
 

4889
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,470
it's an engineering problem it's a
scientific problem but it's also just a

4890
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:32,480
scientific problem but it's also just a
 

4891
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,470
scientific problem but it's also just a
motivation problem for the entire

4892
01:23:34,470 --> 01:23:34,480
motivation problem for the entire
 

4893
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,470
motivation problem for the entire
human species and you also need to have

4894
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
human species and you also need to have
 

4895
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,550
human species and you also need to have
superstar

4896
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:38,560
superstar
 

4897
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,629
superstar
uh researchers and engineers working on

4898
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:40,639
uh researchers and engineers working on
 

4899
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:41,910
uh researchers and engineers working on
it so you have to get like the best

4900
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920
it so you have to get like the best
 

4901
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,310
it so you have to get like the best
people in the world inspire them and

4902
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:44,320
people in the world inspire them and
 

4903
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,189
people in the world inspire them and
starting from a young age and kind of uh

4904
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:47,199
starting from a young age and kind of uh
 

4905
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:49,270
starting from a young age and kind of uh
what's inculcating us into why i guess

4906
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,280
what's inculcating us into why i guess
 

4907
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,790
what's inculcating us into why i guess
this way it's exciting you don't know if

4908
01:23:50,790 --> 01:23:50,800
this way it's exciting you don't know if
 

4909
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,430
this way it's exciting you don't know if
we're going to be able to pull this off

4910
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:53,440
we're going to be able to pull this off
 

4911
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,709
we're going to be able to pull this off
that we can like fail miserably and that

4912
01:23:56,709 --> 01:23:56,719
that we can like fail miserably and that
 

4913
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,470
that we can like fail miserably and that
i suppose i mean that's where the best

4914
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
i suppose i mean that's where the best
 

4915
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,270
i suppose i mean that's where the best
of engineering is done it's like success

4916
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:01,280
of engineering is done it's like success
 

4917
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,390
of engineering is done it's like success
is not guaranteed and even if it happens

4918
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:04,400
is not guaranteed and even if it happens
 

4919
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,149
is not guaranteed and even if it happens
it might be very painful

4920
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:06,159
it might be very painful
 

4921
01:24:06,159 --> 01:24:07,270
it might be very painful
i think that's what's so special about

4922
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:07,280
i think that's what's so special about
 

4923
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,189
i think that's what's so special about
what elon is doing with spacex is he

4924
01:24:09,189 --> 01:24:09,199
what elon is doing with spacex is he
 

4925
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,790
what elon is doing with spacex is he
takes these risks and he tests

4926
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
takes these risks and he tests
 

4927
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,430
takes these risks and he tests
iteratively and he'll will see the

4928
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:13,440
iteratively and he'll will see the
 

4929
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,910
iteratively and he'll will see the
spectacular failures on the path to a

4930
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:15,920
spectacular failures on the path to a
 

4931
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,990
spectacular failures on the path to a
successful starship it's something that

4932
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:18,000
successful starship it's something that
 

4933
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,350
successful starship it's something that
you know people have said why isn't nasa

4934
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:19,360
you know people have said why isn't nasa
 

4935
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,110
you know people have said why isn't nasa
doing that well that's because nasa is

4936
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:21,120
doing that well that's because nasa is
 

4937
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,550
doing that well that's because nasa is
doing that with taxpayer dollars and we

4938
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:22,560
doing that with taxpayer dollars and we
 

4939
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,030
doing that with taxpayer dollars and we
would all revolt if we saw nasa failing

4940
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:25,040

inspire
 

5099
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:08,470
inspire
uh young people to uh

5100
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:08,480
uh young people to uh
 

5101
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,550
uh young people to uh
to show off their stuff to show their

5102
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
to show off their stuff to show their
 

5103
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,149
to show off their stuff to show their
true self the rawness of it because i

5104
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:12,159
true self the rawness of it because i
 

5105
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:13,830
true self the rawness of it because i
think that's where engineering is best

5106
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:13,840
think that's where engineering is best
 

5107
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,990
think that's where engineering is best
and i think that will inspire people

5108
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:16,000
and i think that will inspire people
 

5109
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,310
and i think that will inspire people
about all the cool stuff we could do out

5110
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:18,320
about all the cool stuff we could do out
 

5111
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,830
about all the cool stuff we could do out
in space i should say i couldn't agree

5112
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:19,840
in space i should say i couldn't agree
 

5113
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,030
in space i should say i couldn't agree
more and i actually think that this is

5114
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:21,040
more and i actually think that this is
 

5115
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,270
more and i actually think that this is
why we need a real life starfleet

5116
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:23,280
why we need a real life starfleet
 

5117
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,510
why we need a real life starfleet
academy right now it was the place where

5118
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:25,520
academy right now it was the place where
 

5119
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,070
academy right now it was the place where
the space cadets got to go to learn

5120
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:28,080
the space cadets got to go to learn
 

5121
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:30,149
the space cadets got to go to learn
about how to engage in in a future of

5122
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:30,159
about how to engage in in a future of
 

5123
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:33,189
about how to engage in in a future of
life and space and uh we can do it in a

5124
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:33,199
life and space and uh we can do it in a
 

5125
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,229
life and space and uh we can do it in a
much better way there are a bunch of

5126
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:34,239
much better way there are a bunch of
 

5127
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,510
much better way there are a bunch of
groups that traditionally haven't

5128
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:35,520
groups that traditionally haven't
 

5129
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,790
groups that traditionally haven't
thought that they could engage in

5130
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:36,800
thought that they could engage in
 

5131
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,550
thought that they could engage in
aerospace whether it's because you were

5132
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:38,560
aerospace whether it's because you were
 

5133
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,629
aerospace whether it's because you were
told you had to be into math and science

5134
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:40,639
told you had to be into math and science
 

5135
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:42,709
told you had to be into math and science
now we need space lawyers we need space

5136
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:42,719
now we need space lawyers we need space
 

5137
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:45,030
now we need space lawyers we need space
artists like grimes right we need really

5138
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:45,040
artists like grimes right we need really
 

5139
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,070
artists like grimes right we need really
creative profoundly interesting people

to want to see themselves in that future

5142
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:51,440
to want to see themselves in that future
 

5143
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,189
to want to see themselves in that future
i think it's a big challenge to us in

5144
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:53,199
i think it's a big challenge to us in
 

5145
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:54,790
i think it's a big challenge to us in
the space industry to also do some more

5146
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:54,800
the space industry to also do some more
 

5147
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,350
the space industry to also do some more
diversity equity and inclusion and show

5148

diversity equity and inclusion and show
 

5149
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,110
diversity equity and inclusion and show
a broader swath of society that there's

5150
01:27:59,110 --> 01:27:59,120
a broader swath of society that there's
 

5151
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,110
a broader swath of society that there's
a future for them in this space

5152
01:28:01,110 --> 01:28:01,120
a future for them in this space
 

5153
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,189
a future for them in this space
exploration push back on one thing we

5154
01:28:03,189 --> 01:28:03,199
exploration push back on one thing we
 

5155
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:04,629
exploration push back on one thing we
don't need space lawyers i'm just

5156
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:04,639
don't need space lawyers i'm just
 

5157
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:05,830
don't need space lawyers i'm just
kidding okay

yeah okay uh let me ask a big ridiculous

5166
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:13,360
yeah okay uh let me ask a big ridiculous
 

5167
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,470
yeah okay uh let me ask a big ridiculous
question what is the most beautiful idea

question what is the most beautiful idea
 

5169
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:19,350
question what is the most beautiful idea
to you about space exploration whether

01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:46,560
it's just that at really really small
 

5193
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,110
it's just that at really really small
scales like particle physics and really

5194

scales like particle physics and really
 

5195
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,350
scales like particle physics and really
really big scales like astrophysics

01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,669
there are similarities in the way that
those systems behave and look and

there's a certain beautiful symmetry in
 

5203
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:00,550
there's a certain beautiful symmetry in
the universe that's just kind of waiting

5204
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:00,560
the universe that's just kind of waiting
 

5205
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,709
the universe that's just kind of waiting
for us to tie together the physics and

5206
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:02,719
for us to tie together the physics and
 

5207
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,790
for us to tie together the physics and
really understand it that is something

5208
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:04,800
really understand it that is something
 

5209
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,310
really understand it that is something
that just um

5210
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:06,320
that just um
 

5211
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,149
that just um
just really captivates me and i would

5212
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:08,159
just really captivates me and i would
 

5213
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:09,910
just really captivates me and i would
love to even though i'm now much more on

5214
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:09,920
love to even though i'm now much more on
 

5215
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,470
love to even though i'm now much more on
the applied space exploration side i

5216
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:12,480
the applied space exploration side i
 

5217
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,750
the applied space exploration side i
really try to keep up with what's

5218
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:13,760
really try to keep up with what's
 

5219
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,189
really try to keep up with what's
happening in those physics areas because

5220
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:15,199
happening in those physics areas because
 

5221
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,270
happening in those physics areas because
i think that will be a huge answer for

5222
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,280
i think that will be a huge answer for
 

5223
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:20,470
i think that will be a huge answer for

5416
01:32:36,629 --> 01:32:36,639
no
 

5417
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:37,590
no
um

5418
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:37,600
um
 

5419
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,950
um
but it's still a really important part

5420
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:38,960
but it's still a really important part
 

5421
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,229
but it's still a really important part
of our understanding of these

5422
01:32:40,229 --> 01:32:40,239
of our understanding of these
 

5423
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:41,590
of our understanding of these
fundamental laws of physics and so i

5424
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:41,600
fundamental laws of physics and so i
 

5425
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,950
fundamental laws of physics and so i
don't know that it's always immediate

5426
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:42,960
don't know that it's always immediate
 

5427
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,149
don't know that it's always immediate
but i think it is really critical

5428
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:44,159
but i think it is really critical
 

5429
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:46,870
but i think it is really critical
knowledge for humanity to seek

5430
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:46,880
knowledge for humanity to seek
 

5431
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,149
knowledge for humanity to seek
it might just

5432
01:32:48,149 --> 01:32:48,159
it might just
 

5433
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,470
it might just
shake up understanding of the world yeah

5434
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:50,480
shake up understanding of the world yeah
 

5435
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,310
shake up understanding of the world yeah
what scares me is it might help us

5436
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:52,320
what scares me is it might help us
 

5437
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,110
what scares me is it might help us
create more dangerous weapons so um and

5438
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:55,120
create more dangerous weapons so um and
 

5439
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,870
create more dangerous weapons so um and
then we'll figure out that great filter

5440
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:56,880
then we'll figure out that great filter
 

5441
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,350
then we'll figure out that great filter
situation and i still believe that human

5442
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
situation and i still believe that human
 

5443
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,510
situation and i still believe that human
compassion and love

5444
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:01,520
compassion and love
 

5445
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,510
compassion and love
uh is actually the way to defend against

5446
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:03,520
uh is actually the way to defend against
 

5447
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,189
uh is actually the way to defend against
all these greater and greater and more

5448
01:33:05,189 --> 01:33:05,199
all these greater and greater and more
 

5449
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:06,229
all these greater and greater and more
impressive

5450
01:33:06,229 --> 01:33:06,239
impressive
 

5451
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:09,990
impressive
weapons yeah let me ask a weird question

5452
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
weapons yeah let me ask a weird question
 

5453
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,390
weapons yeah let me ask a weird question
in terms of you disagreeing with others

5454
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:12,400
in terms of you disagreeing with others
 

5455
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,390
in terms of you disagreeing with others
what important idea do you believe is

5456
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:14,400
what important idea do you believe is
 

5457
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,590
what important idea do you believe is
true

5458
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:15,600
true
 

5459
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,550
true
that

5460
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:16,560
that
 

5461
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:20,229
that
many others uh don't agree with you on

5462
01:33:20,229 --> 01:33:20,239
many others uh don't agree with you on
 

5463
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,229
many others uh don't agree with you on
maybe uh it's a tough question you might

5464
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:22,239
maybe uh it's a tough question you might
 

5465
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:24,629
maybe uh it's a tough question you might
have to think about that one but it was

5466
01:33:24,629 --> 01:33:24,639
have to think about that one but it was
 

5467
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,229
have to think about that one but it was
very specific

5468
01:33:26,229 --> 01:33:26,239
very specific
 

5469
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:28,629
very specific
like which material to use or something

5470
01:33:28,629 --> 01:33:28,639
like which material to use or something
 

5471
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:30,629
like which material to use or something
about a particular project

5472
01:33:30,629 --> 01:33:30,639
about a particular project
 

5473
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,390
about a particular project
or um

5474
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:32,400
or um
 

5475
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,030
or um
it could be grand priorities on missions

5476
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,040
it could be grand priorities on missions
 

5477
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,390
it could be grand priorities on missions
i think one you actually mentioned is

5478
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
i think one you actually mentioned is
 

5479
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,229
i think one you actually mentioned is
interesting is like

5480
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:38,239
interesting is like
 

5481
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:39,270
interesting is like
um

5482
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:39,280
um
 

5483
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:40,629
um
the thing we should be looking for is

5484
01:33:40,629 --> 01:33:40,639
the thing we should be looking for is
 

5485
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,189
the thing we should be looking for is
like colonization of space versus

5486
01:33:43,189 --> 01:33:43,199
like colonization of space versus
 

5487
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,950
like colonization of space versus
colonization of planets

5488
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:44,960
colonization of planets
 

5489
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,470
colonization of planets
meaning like

5490
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:46,480
meaning like
 

5491
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,830
meaning like
my best hot take that people would

5492
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:47,840
my best hot take that people would
 

5493
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,550
my best hot take that people would
disagree with me on is life

5494
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:50,560
disagree with me on is life
 

5495
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,910
disagree with me on is life
in floating cities as opposed to life on

5496
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:53,920
in floating cities as opposed to life on
 

5497
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,830
in floating cities as opposed to life on
on the surface how do you envision that

5498
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:55,840
on the surface how do you envision that
 

5499
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,950
on the surface how do you envision that
like

5500
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:56,960
like
 

5501
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,110
like
spread of humans because you said at the

5502
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
spread of humans because you said at the
 

5503
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:00,870
spread of humans because you said at the
beginning of the conversation something

5504
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:00,880
beginning of the conversation something
 

5505
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:01,910
beginning of the conversation something
about like

5506
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:01,920
about like
 

5507
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,149
about like
scale increasing the scale of basically

5508
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:04,159
scale increasing the scale of basically
 

5509
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:06,629
scale increasing the scale of basically
humans in space are they just

5510
01:34:06,629 --> 01:34:06,639
humans in space are they just
 

5511
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:07,430
humans in space are they just
like

5512
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:07,440
like
 

5513
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,070
like
in um they're in orbit and then they get

5514
01:34:10,070 --> 01:34:10,080
in um they're in orbit and then they get
 

5515
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,669
in um they're in orbit and then they get
a little farther and farther out like do

5516
01:34:11,669 --> 01:34:11,679
a little farther and farther out like do
 

5517
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,189
a little farther and farther out like do
you see this kind of

5518
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:13,199
you see this kind of
 

5519
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,550
you see this kind of
uh

5520
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:14,560
uh
 

5521
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,550
uh
floating cities just getting farther and

5522
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:16,560
floating cities just getting farther and
 

5523
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,070
floating cities just getting farther and
far from earth they can always kind of

5524
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
far from earth they can always kind of
 

5525
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:21,110
far from earth they can always kind of
return but like if you look a few

5526
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:21,120
return but like if you look a few
 

5527
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,870
return but like if you look a few
centuries from now do you just see us

5528
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:22,880
centuries from now do you just see us
 

5529
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,709
centuries from now do you just see us
all these like floating

5530
01:34:24,709 --> 01:34:24,719
all these like floating
 

5531
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:25,669
all these like floating
yes

5532
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
yes
 

5533
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,310
yes
and it just kind of envelops

5534
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:28,320
and it just kind of envelops
 

5535
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:30,550
and it just kind of envelops
uh the space around us

5536
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:30,560
uh the space around us
 

5537
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,310
uh the space around us
and it's like neighborhoods

5538
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:32,320
and it's like neighborhoods
 

5539
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,629
and it's like neighborhoods
yeah yeah it's like rural and there's

5540
01:34:34,629 --> 01:34:34,639
yeah yeah it's like rural and there's
 

5541
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:35,430
yeah yeah it's like rural and there's
like

5542
01:34:35,430 --> 01:34:35,440
like
 

5543
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:37,830
like
giant structures and there's small

5544
01:34:37,830 --> 01:34:37,840
giant structures and there's small
 

5545
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,189
giant structures and there's small
pirates structures and that kind of

5546
01:34:39,189 --> 01:34:39,199
pirates structures and that kind of
 

5547
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,350
pirates structures and that kind of
stuff structures yeah i think low earth

5548
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:41,360
stuff structures yeah i think low earth
 

5549
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,350
stuff structures yeah i think low earth
orbit might come to look like that and

5550
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:43,360
orbit might come to look like that and
 

5551
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,870
orbit might come to look like that and
it's a really interesting regulatory

5552
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:44,880
it's a really interesting regulatory
 

5553
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,350
it's a really interesting regulatory
challenge to make sure that um

5554
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:47,360
challenge to make sure that um
 

5555
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,910
challenge to make sure that um
there's some cross purposes so the more

5556
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:49,920
there's some cross purposes so the more
 

5557
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,590
there's some cross purposes so the more
cool space cities we have in orbit the

5558
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:51,600
cool space cities we have in orbit the
 

5559
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,750
cool space cities we have in orbit the
more shiny objects in the night sky the

5560
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:53,760
more shiny objects in the night sky the
 

5561
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,669
more shiny objects in the night sky the
worse it is for astronomers in a really

5562
01:34:55,669 --> 01:34:55,679
worse it is for astronomers in a really
 

5563
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,990
worse it is for astronomers in a really
kind of overly simplified case

5564
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,000
kind of overly simplified case
 

5565
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,669
kind of overly simplified case
so there's some push pushback to this

5566
01:34:59,669 --> 01:34:59,679
so there's some push pushback to this
 

5567
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,629
so there's some push pushback to this
like amoebaeing where we just grow kind

5568
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
like amoebaeing where we just grow kind
 

5569
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,270
like amoebaeing where we just grow kind
of um incongruously uh or

5570
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:05,280
of um incongruously uh or
 

5571
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,950
of um incongruously uh or
indiscriminately as an amoeba in

5572
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:06,960
indiscriminately as an amoeba in
 

5573
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,109
indiscriminately as an amoeba in
low-earth orbit beyond that though i

5574
01:35:09,109 --> 01:35:09,119
low-earth orbit beyond that though i
 

5575
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:10,790
low-earth orbit beyond that though i
think we'll grow in pockets where there

5576
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:10,800
think we'll grow in pockets where there
 

5577
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,830
think we'll grow in pockets where there
are resources so we won't just expand

5578
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:13,840
are resources so we won't just expand
 

5579
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,750
are resources so we won't just expand
around the gravity well of earth

5580
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:15,760
around the gravity well of earth
 

5581
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:16,950
around the gravity well of earth
we'll do

5582
01:35:16,950 --> 01:35:16,960
we'll do
 

5583
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,629
we'll do
some development around the moon some

5584
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:18,639
some development around the moon some
 

5585
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:20,310
some development around the moon some
development around asteroids some

5586
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:20,320
development around asteroids some
 

5587
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,149
development around asteroids some
development around mars because there'll

5588
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:22,159
development around mars because there'll
 

5589
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:23,750
development around mars because there'll
always be purposes for which we want to

5590
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:23,760
always be purposes for which we want to
 

5591
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,830
always be purposes for which we want to
go down to a physical object and study

5592
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:25,840
go down to a physical object and study
 

5593
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,229
go down to a physical object and study
it or extract something or learn from it

5594
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:28,239
it or extract something or learn from it
 

5595
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:29,830
it or extract something or learn from it
but i think we'll grow in fits and

5596
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:29,840
but i think we'll grow in fits and
 

5597
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,550
but i think we'll grow in fits and
starts in pockets um some of the coolest

5598
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:32,560
starts in pockets um some of the coolest
 

5599
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,950
starts in pockets um some of the coolest
pockets are the gravity balanced pockets

5600
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:34,960
pockets are the gravity balanced pockets
 

5601
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:37,030
pockets are the gravity balanced pockets
like the lagrange points which is where

5602
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,040
like the lagrange points which is where
 

5603
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,870
like the lagrange points which is where
we just sent we not me personally but

5604
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:38,880
we just sent we not me personally but
 

5605
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,270
we just sent we not me personally but
nasa just sent james webb

5606
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:41,280
nasa just sent james webb
 

5607
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,830
nasa just sent james webb
the big telescope i think it's at l2

5608
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
the big telescope i think it's at l2
 

5609
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,350
the big telescope i think it's at l2
so uh what's the nice feature about

5610
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:45,360
so uh what's the nice feature about
 

5611
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,310
so uh what's the nice feature about
those pockets so it's a stable orbit um

5612
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:48,320
those pockets so it's a stable orbit um
 

5613
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,510
those pockets so it's a stable orbit um
there are several different lagrange

5614
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:49,520
there are several different lagrange
 

5615
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,669
there are several different lagrange
points and so it just requires less

5616
01:35:51,669 --> 01:35:51,679
points and so it just requires less
 

5617
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:53,669
points and so it just requires less
energy to stay where you're trying to

5618
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:53,679
energy to stay where you're trying to
 

5619
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,030
energy to stay where you're trying to
stay

5620
01:35:55,030 --> 01:35:55,040
stay
 

5621
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,390
stay
yeah

5622
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:56,400
yeah
 

5623
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:57,910
yeah
that's fascinating what's also

5624
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:57,920
that's fascinating what's also
 

5625
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,790
that's fascinating what's also
fascinating is the interaction between

5626
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:00,800
fascinating is the interaction between
 

5627
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,910
fascinating is the interaction between
nations

5628
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:03,920

 

5629
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,550

regard like who owns that do you would

5630
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:06,560
regard like who owns that do you would
 

5631
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,550
regard like who owns that do you would
you would you say in those floating

5632
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:08,560
you would you say in those floating
 

5633
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,470
you would you say in those floating
cities do you envision

5634
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:10,480
cities do you envision
 

5635
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,870
cities do you envision
independent governments

5636
01:36:12,870 --> 01:36:12,880
independent governments
 

5637
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,229
independent governments
that was going to be my next answer to

5638
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:14,239
that was going to be my next answer to
 

5639
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,390
that was going to be my next answer to
you which pushed me harder for a more

5640
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:16,400
you which pushed me harder for a more
 

5641
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,910
you which pushed me harder for a more
provocative question where i might

5642
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:17,920
provocative question where i might
 

5643
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,149
provocative question where i might
disagree with other people i don't yet

5644
01:36:20,149 --> 01:36:20,159
disagree with other people i don't yet
 

5645
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:21,910
disagree with other people i don't yet
have my own opinions fully formed on

5646
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:21,920
have my own opinions fully formed on
 

5647
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,669
have my own opinions fully formed on
this but we are trying to figure out

5648
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
this but we are trying to figure out
 

5649
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:25,990
this but we are trying to figure out
right now what happens to the moon with

5650
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:26,000
right now what happens to the moon with
 

5651
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,030
right now what happens to the moon with
all of these first-come first-served

5652
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
all of these first-come first-served
 

5653
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,750
all of these first-come first-served
actors just arriving and setting

5654
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:31,760
actors just arriving and setting
 

5655
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,109
actors just arriving and setting
precedence that might really affect

5656
01:36:33,109 --> 01:36:33,119
precedence that might really affect
 

5657
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:35,830
precedence that might really affect
future access and one example is

5658
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:35,840
future access and one example is
 

5659
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,790
future access and one example is
property rights we do want companies

5660
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:38,800
property rights we do want companies
 

5661
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,390
property rights we do want companies
that have the expertise to go to the

5662
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:40,400
that have the expertise to go to the
 

5663
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,109
that have the expertise to go to the
moon and mine stuff that will help us

5664
01:36:43,109 --> 01:36:43,119
moon and mine stuff that will help us
 

5665
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:45,669
moon and mine stuff that will help us
uh you know develop a human settlement

5666
01:36:45,669 --> 01:36:45,679
uh you know develop a human settlement
 

5667
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:48,310
uh you know develop a human settlement
there or a gateway but companies need to

5668
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:48,320
there or a gateway but companies need to
 

5669
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,910
there or a gateway but companies need to
know generally that they have rights to

5670
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:49,920
know generally that they have rights to
 

5671
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:51,430
know generally that they have rights to
a certain area or that they have some

5672
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:51,440
a certain area or that they have some
 

5673
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,030
a certain area or that they have some
legal right to sell things that they're

5674
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,040
legal right to sell things that they're
 

5675
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,310
legal right to sell things that they're
getting does that mean we're going to

5676
01:36:54,310 --> 01:36:54,320
getting does that mean we're going to
 

5677
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,390
getting does that mean we're going to
grant property rights on the moon to

5678
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
grant property rights on the moon to
 

5679
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,430
grant property rights on the moon to
companies who has the right to give that

5680
01:36:59,430 --> 01:36:59,440
companies who has the right to give that
 

5681
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,669
companies who has the right to give that
right away so there's a bunch of really

5682
01:37:01,669 --> 01:37:01,679
right away so there's a bunch of really
 

5683
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:02,870
right away so there's a bunch of really
kind of gnarly questions we have to

5684
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:02,880
kind of gnarly questions we have to
 

5685
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,070
kind of gnarly questions we have to
think about which is why i think we need

5686
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:04,080
think about which is why i think we need
 

5687
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,149
think about which is why i think we need
space lawyers maybe that's the true

5688
01:37:06,149 --> 01:37:06,159
space lawyers maybe that's the true
 

5689
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:07,990
space lawyers maybe that's the true
provocative answer is i think we need

5690
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:08,000
provocative answer is i think we need
 

5691
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,830
provocative answer is i think we need
space true i mean

5692
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:09,840
space true i mean
 

5693
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,910
space true i mean
yeah yeah i mean but those questions

5694
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:11,920
yeah yeah i mean but those questions
 

5695
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,510
yeah yeah i mean but those questions
again as you said

5696
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:13,520
again as you said
 

5697
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,229
again as you said
eloquently will help us answer questions

5698
01:37:16,229 --> 01:37:16,239
eloquently will help us answer questions
 

5699
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:18,629
eloquently will help us answer questions
about here we hope so yeah it is a

5700
01:37:18,629 --> 01:37:18,639
about here we hope so yeah it is a
 

5701
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:19,510
about here we hope so yeah it is a
little

5702
01:37:19,510 --> 01:37:19,520
little
 

5703
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:20,790
little
strange

5704
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:20,800
strange
 

5705
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,550
strange
i mean it's obvious but it's also

5706
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:22,560
i mean it's obvious but it's also
 

5707
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,550
i mean it's obvious but it's also
strange if you look at the big picture

5708
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:24,560
strange if you look at the big picture
 

5709
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,950
strange if you look at the big picture
of it all that we draw these like

5710
01:37:26,950 --> 01:37:26,960
of it all that we draw these like
 

5711
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,950
of it all that we draw these like
borders around geographical areas and we

5712
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:28,960
borders around geographical areas and we
 

5713
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:31,350
borders around geographical areas and we
say this is mine

5714
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:31,360
say this is mine
 

5715
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,750
say this is mine
like and then we fight wars over what's

5716
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:33,760
like and then we fight wars over what's
 

5717
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,510
like and then we fight wars over what's
mine and not there there it seems like

5718
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:35,520
mine and not there there it seems like
 

5719
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,189
mine and not there there it seems like
they're

5720
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:37,199
they're
 

5721
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:39,590
they're
there's possible alternatives but also

5722
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
there's possible alternatives but also
 

5723
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,870
there's possible alternatives but also
it seems like

5724
01:37:40,870 --> 01:37:40,880
it seems like
 

5725
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,950
it seems like
there needs to be a public ownership of

5726
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:42,960
there needs to be a public ownership of
 

5727
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:44,390
there needs to be a public ownership of
some parts

5728
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:44,400
some parts
 

5729
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,470
some parts
um like you know what is it central park

5730
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:46,480
um like you know what is it central park
 

5731
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,790
um like you know what is it central park
in new york is there something

5732
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:48,800
in new york is there something
 

5733
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:51,270
in new york is there something
like preserving

5734
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:51,280
like preserving
 

5735
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,669
like preserving
the commons yeah the commons commons

5736
01:37:53,669 --> 01:37:53,679
the commons yeah the commons commons
 

5737
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,910
the commons yeah the commons commons
that's why we titled the book into the

5738
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:55,920
that's why we titled the book into the
 

5739
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,470
that's why we titled the book into the
anthropo cosmos we know it's a long kind

5740
01:37:58,470 --> 01:37:58,480
anthropo cosmos we know it's a long kind
 

5741
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,830
anthropo cosmos we know it's a long kind
of a mouthful but this notion of the

5742
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:00,840
of a mouthful but this notion of the
 

5743
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:03,750
of a mouthful but this notion of the
anthropocene we have a lot of commons

5744
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:03,760
anthropocene we have a lot of commons
 

5745
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,430
anthropocene we have a lot of commons
problems in humanity how are we treating

5746
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:05,440
problems in humanity how are we treating
 

5747
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,030
problems in humanity how are we treating
the earth global climate change how are

5748
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:07,040
the earth global climate change how are
 

5749
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,030
the earth global climate change how are
we going to treat and behave in space

5750
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:09,040
we going to treat and behave in space
 

5751
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,350
we going to treat and behave in space
how can we be responsible stewards of

5752
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:11,360
how can we be responsible stewards of
 

5753
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,510
how can we be responsible stewards of
the space commons and i would love to

5754
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:13,520
the space commons and i would love to
 

5755
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,590
the space commons and i would love to
see an approach to the moon that is

5756
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:15,600
see an approach to the moon that is
 

5757
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,470
see an approach to the moon that is
commons based but it's hard to know who

5758
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:18,480
commons based but it's hard to know who
 

5759
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,030
commons based but it's hard to know who
would be the protector or the enforcer

5760
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:21,040
would be the protector or the enforcer
 

5761
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,990
would be the protector or the enforcer
of that and if it's which it will be

5762
01:38:23,990 --> 01:38:24,000
of that and if it's which it will be
 

5763
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,430
of that and if it's which it will be
probably in the early days a lot of

5764
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:25,440
probably in the early days a lot of
 

5765
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,910
probably in the early days a lot of
companies sort of working on the moon

5766
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:27,920
companies sort of working on the moon
 

5767
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:30,709
companies sort of working on the moon
working on mars working out in space

5768
01:38:30,709 --> 01:38:30,719
working on mars working out in space
 

5769
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:32,950
working on mars working out in space
it feels like there still needs to be

5770
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:32,960
it feels like there still needs to be
 

5771
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,590
it feels like there still needs to be
a civilian representation

5772
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:35,600
a civilian representation
 

5773
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,669
a civilian representation
of like the greater effort or something

5774
01:38:37,669 --> 01:38:37,679
of like the greater effort or something
 

5775
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,590
of like the greater effort or something
like that like where there should be a

5776
01:38:39,590 --> 01:38:39,600
like that like where there should be a
 

5777
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:41,669
like that like where there should be a
president there should be a democracy

5778
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:41,679
president there should be a democracy
 

5779
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,750
president there should be a democracy
yeah of some kind where people can vote

5780
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:43,760
yeah of some kind where people can vote
 

5781
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,590
yeah of some kind where people can vote
some representative government those are

5782
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:45,600
some representative government those are
 

5783
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,669
some representative government those are
all again the same the same human

all again the same the same human
questions

5786
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:49,199
questions
 

5787
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:50,709
questions
what advice

5788
01:38:50,709 --> 01:38:50,719
what advice
 

5789
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:53,910
what advice
would you give to a young person today

5790
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:53,920
would you give to a young person today
 

5791
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,669

so somebody in high school somebody in

5796
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:00,400
so somebody in high school somebody in
 

5797
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,629
so somebody in high school somebody in
college maybe somebody that looks up to

5798
01:39:02,629 --> 01:39:02,639
college maybe somebody that looks up to
 

5799
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:05,030
college maybe somebody that looks up to
the stars and dreams to one day

5800
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:05,040
the stars and dreams to one day
 

5801
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,350
the stars and dreams to one day
take a one-way ticket to mars or to

5802
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:07,360
take a one-way ticket to mars or to
 

5803
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,750
take a one-way ticket to mars or to
contribute something to the effort

5804
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:09,760
contribute something to the effort
 

5805
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,709
contribute something to the effort
i'd say you should feel empowered

5806
01:39:12,709 --> 01:39:12,719
i'd say you should feel empowered
 

5807
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,270
i'd say you should feel empowered
because it's really the first time in

5808
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,280
because it's really the first time in
 

5809
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:18,149
because it's really the first time in
human history that we're at this cusp of

5810
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:18,159
human history that we're at this cusp of
 

5811
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,149
human history that we're at this cusp of
interplanetary civilization and i don't

5812
01:39:20,149 --> 01:39:20,159
interplanetary civilization and i don't
 

5813
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,149
interplanetary civilization and i don't
think we're gonna lapse back from it

5814
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:22,159
think we're gonna lapse back from it
 

5815
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:24,229
think we're gonna lapse back from it
so the future is incredibly bright for

5816
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
so the future is incredibly bright for
 

5817
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,229
so the future is incredibly bright for
young people that even younger than you

5818
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:26,239
young people that even younger than you
 

5819
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:27,430
young people that even younger than you
and i who will actually really get a

5820
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:27,440
and i who will actually really get a
 

5821
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,590
and i who will actually really get a
chance to go to mars for certain

5822
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:29,600
chance to go to mars for certain
 

5823
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,830
chance to go to mars for certain
um the other thing i would say is be

5824
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:31,840
um the other thing i would say is be
 

5825
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,510
um the other thing i would say is be
open-minded about what your own

5826
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:33,520
open-minded about what your own
 

5827
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,109
open-minded about what your own
interests are i don't think you anymore

5828
01:39:35,109 --> 01:39:35,119
interests are i don't think you anymore
 

5829
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:37,350
interests are i don't think you anymore
have to be shoehorned into a particular

5830
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
have to be shoehorned into a particular
 

5831
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,669
have to be shoehorned into a particular
career to be welcomed into the future of

5832
01:39:39,669 --> 01:39:39,679
career to be welcomed into the future of
 

5833
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:41,189
career to be welcomed into the future of
space exploration

just as much as we need space scientists
 

5851
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,149
just as much as we need space scientists
and space engineers so well when you

5852
01:39:58,149 --> 01:39:58,159
and space engineers so well when you
 

5853
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:00,070
and space engineers so well when you
look at your own life

5854

01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:47,510
it on camera but i'm sitting here with
my co-founder and ceo danielle dalat

5898
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:47,520
my co-founder and ceo danielle dalat
 

5899
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,669
my co-founder and ceo danielle dalat
and that is really what makes these

5900
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:49,679
and that is really what makes these
 

5901
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:51,669
and that is really what makes these
large-scale challenges for humanity

5902
01:40:51,669 --> 01:40:51,679
large-scale challenges for humanity
 

5903
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:53,990
large-scale challenges for humanity
possible is really fantastic teams

5904
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,000
possible is really fantastic teams
 

5905
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,149
possible is really fantastic teams
working together to scale more than what

5906
01:40:56,149 --> 01:40:56,159
working together to scale more than what
 

5907
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:57,910
working together to scale more than what
i could do alone so i think that's an

5908
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:57,920
i could do alone so i think that's an
 

5909
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,270
i could do alone so i think that's an
important model that we don't talk about

5910
01:40:59,270 --> 01:40:59,280
important model that we don't talk about
 

5911
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:00,950
important model that we don't talk about
enough in academia there's a big push

5912
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:00,960
enough in academia there's a big push
 

5913
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,750
enough in academia there's a big push
for this like lone wolf genius figure in

for this like lone wolf genius figure in
 

5915
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,510
for this like lone wolf genius figure in
academia but that's certainly not been

open call for art to go to the iss and
 

5973
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,669
open call for art to go to the iss and
that was thanks to shang and artists

consciousness there does seem to be
 

5987
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:18,470
consciousness there does seem to be
something quite special about us humans

5995
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,109
what's consciousness what
what are we trying to preserve here

5996
01:42:27,109 --> 01:42:27,119
what are we trying to preserve here
 

5997
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:30,629
what are we trying to preserve here
what is it about humans that should be

5998
01:42:30,629 --> 01:42:30,639
what is it about humans that should be
 

5999
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:31,990
what is it about humans that should be
preserved

6000
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:32,000
preserved
 

6001
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,790
preserved
or life here on earth

6002
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:34,800
or life here on earth
 

6003
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,629
or life here on earth
they would gives you hope to try to

6004

they would gives you hope to try to
 

6005
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:40,550
they would gives you hope to try to
expand it out farther and farther like

6006
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:40,560
expand it out farther and farther like
 

6007
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:43,910

6010
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:46,320
i think we're a remarkable species that
 

6011
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,669
i think we're a remarkable species that
we are aware of our own thoughts

6012
01:42:49,669 --> 01:42:49,679
we are aware of our own thoughts
 

6013
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,910
we are aware of our own thoughts
we are meta aware of our own thoughts

6014
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:51,920
we are meta aware of our own thoughts
 

6015
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,750
we are meta aware of our own thoughts
and of ourselves and are able to speak

6016
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:53,760
and of ourselves and are able to speak
 

6017
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,910
and of ourselves and are able to speak
on a podcast about a matter of awareness

6018
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:55,920
on a podcast about a matter of awareness
 

6019
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,430
on a podcast about a matter of awareness
about our own thoughts about our own

6020
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:57,440
about our own thoughts about our own
 

6021
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,510
about our own thoughts about our own
thoughts yeah turtles all the way down

6022
01:42:59,510 --> 01:42:59,520
thoughts yeah turtles all the way down
 

6023
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:00,709
thoughts yeah turtles all the way down
um

6024
01:43:00,709 --> 01:43:00,719
um
 

6025
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:02,229
um
i think that that is a really

6026
01:43:02,229 --> 01:43:02,239
i think that that is a really
 

6027
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:03,910
i think that that is a really
special gift that we have been given as

6028
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:03,920
special gift that we have been given as
 

6029
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,629
special gift that we have been given as
a species and that there's a worth to

6030
01:43:06,629 --> 01:43:06,639
a species and that there's a worth to
 

6031
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:09,510
a species and that there's a worth to
expanding our circles of awareness so

6032
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:09,520
expanding our circles of awareness so
 

6033
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,189
expanding our circles of awareness so
we're very aware of as an earth-based

6034
01:43:11,189 --> 01:43:11,199
we're very aware of as an earth-based
 

6035
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:13,270
we're very aware of as an earth-based
species we've become a little bit more

6036
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:13,280
species we've become a little bit more
 

6037
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,950
species we've become a little bit more
aware of the fragility of earth and how

6038
01:43:14,950 --> 01:43:14,960
aware of the fragility of earth and how
 

6039
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,629
aware of the fragility of earth and how
special a place it is when we go to the

6040
01:43:16,629 --> 01:43:16,639
special a place it is when we go to the
 

6041
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:18,950
special a place it is when we go to the
moon and we look back what would it mean

6042
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:18,960
moon and we look back what would it mean
 

6043
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:21,830
moon and we look back what would it mean
for us to have a presence

6044
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:21,840
for us to have a presence
 

6045
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,390
for us to have a presence
and our purpose in life as a

6046
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:24,400
and our purpose in life as a
 

6047
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,629
and our purpose in life as a
inter-solar system species or eventually

6048
01:43:26,629 --> 01:43:26,639
inter-solar system species or eventually
 

6049
01:43:26,639 --> 01:43:28,790
inter-solar system species or eventually
an intergalactic species i think it's a

6050
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:28,800
an intergalactic species i think it's a
 

6051
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,950
an intergalactic species i think it's a
really profound opportunity for

6052
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:30,960
really profound opportunity for
 

6053
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,390
really profound opportunity for
exploration for the sake of exploration

6054
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:34,400
exploration for the sake of exploration
 

6055

a real gift for the human mind yeah
 

6057
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,750
a real gift for the human mind yeah
if we're for anything we're curious

creatures

6060
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:40,880
creatures
 

6061
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,189
creatures
you see do believe we might one day

6062
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:43,199
you see do believe we might one day
 

6063
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:44,109
you see do believe we might one day
become

6064
01:43:44,109 --> 01:43:44,119
become
 

6065
01:43:44,119 --> 01:43:47,030
become
intergalactic civilization long long

6066
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:47,040
intergalactic civilization long long
 

6067
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,149
intergalactic civilization long long
time from now we have a lot of

6068
01:43:48,149 --> 01:43:48,159
time from now we have a lot of
 

6069
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:49,270
time from now we have a lot of
propulsion

6070
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:49,280
propulsion
 

6071
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,510
propulsion
challenges to answer to get that far so

6072
01:43:51,510 --> 01:43:51,520
challenges to answer to get that far so
 

6073
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:54,310
challenges to answer to get that far so
you have a hope for this yeah

6074

you have a hope for this yeah
 

6075
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,470
you have a hope for this yeah
uh another big ridiculous question

01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:56,480
uh another big ridiculous question
 

6077
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,830
uh another big ridiculous question
building on top of that what do you

6078
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:57,840
building on top of that what do you
 

6079
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,270
building on top of that what do you
think is the meaning

6080
01:43:59,270 --> 01:43:59,280
think is the meaning
 

6081
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,149
think is the meaning
of life this individual life of ours

6082
01:44:02,149 --> 01:44:02,159
of life this individual life of ours
 

6083
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:03,750
of life this individual life of ours
your life

6084
01:44:03,750 --> 01:44:03,760
your life
 

6085
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,149
your life
that unfortunately has to come to an end

6086

that unfortunately has to come to an end
 

6087
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:07,910
that unfortunately has to come to an end
as far as we know for now

6088
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:07,920
as far as we know for now
 

6089
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:12,550
as far as we know for now
yeah um and our life here together

6090
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:12,560
yeah um and our life here together
 

6091
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:17,109
yeah um and our life here together
is there a why or do we just kind of

6092
01:44:17,109 --> 01:44:17,119
is there a why or do we just kind of
 

6093
01:44:17,119 --> 01:44:20,550
is there a why or do we just kind of
like let our curiosity carry us away

6094
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:20,560
like let our curiosity carry us away
 

6095
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,790
like let our curiosity carry us away
oh interesting is there a

6096
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:22,800
oh interesting is there a
 

6097
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,350
oh interesting is there a
single kind of driving purpose why or

6098
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:25,360
single kind of driving purpose why or
 

6099
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,910
single kind of driving purpose why or
can it just be curiosity-based

6100
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:27,920
can it just be curiosity-based
 

6101
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,070
can it just be curiosity-based
i certainly feel and this is not the

6102
01:44:30,070 --> 01:44:30,080
i certainly feel and this is not the
 

6103
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,830
i certainly feel and this is not the
scientist in me talking but just more of

6104
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:31,840
scientist in me talking but just more of
 

6105
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,470
scientist in me talking but just more of
like a human soul talking i certainly

6106
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:34,480
like a human soul talking i certainly
 

6107
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:36,470
like a human soul talking i certainly
feel some sense

6108
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:36,480
feel some sense
 

6109
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:37,669
feel some sense
of

6110
01:44:37,669 --> 01:44:37,679
of
 

6111
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:39,510
of
purpose and meaning in my life and

6112
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:39,520
purpose and meaning in my life and
 

6113
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:40,950
purpose and meaning in my life and
there's a version of that that's a very

6114
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:40,960
there's a version of that that's a very
 

6115
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,430
there's a version of that that's a very
local level within my family which is

6116
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:43,440
local level within my family which is
 

6117
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,709
local level within my family which is
funny because this whole conversation

6118
01:44:44,709 --> 01:44:44,719
funny because this whole conversation
 

6119
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,629
funny because this whole conversation
has been big grand space exploration

6120
01:44:46,629 --> 01:44:46,639
has been big grand space exploration
 

6121
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,229
has been big grand space exploration
themes but you asked me this question my

6122
01:44:48,229 --> 01:44:48,239
themes but you asked me this question my
 

6123
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:49,830
themes but you asked me this question my
first thought is what really matters to

6124
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:49,840
first thought is what really matters to
 

6125
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,590
first thought is what really matters to
me my family my

6126
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:51,600
me my family my

me my family my
biological reproducing unit

6128
01:44:54,709 --> 01:44:54,719
biological reproducing unit
 

6129
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:55,990
biological reproducing unit
um

6130
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:56,000
um
 

6131
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,750
um
but then there's also another purpose

6132
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:57,760
but then there's also another purpose
 

6133
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:59,189
but then there's also another purpose
like another version of the meaning in

6134
01:44:59,189 --> 01:44:59,199
like another version of the meaning in
 

6135
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,030
like another version of the meaning in
my life that is trying to do good things

6136
01:45:01,030 --> 01:45:01,040
my life that is trying to do good things
 

6137
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,750
my life that is trying to do good things
for humanity so that sense that we can

6138
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:03,760
for humanity so that sense that we can
 

6139
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,830
for humanity so that sense that we can
be individual humans and have our local

6140
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:05,840
be individual humans and have our local
 

6141
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,470
be individual humans and have our local
meaning and we can also be global humans

6142
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:08,480
meaning and we can also be global humans
 

6143
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:10,390
meaning and we can also be global humans
maybe someday like the star trek utopia

6144
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:10,400
maybe someday like the star trek utopia
 

6145
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,229
maybe someday like the star trek utopia
we'll all be global citizens

6146
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:12,239
we'll all be global citizens
 

6147
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:13,669
we'll all be global citizens
i don't want to sound too

6148
01:45:13,669 --> 01:45:13,679
i don't want to sound too
 

6149
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:15,270
i don't want to sound too
naive

6150
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:15,280
naive
 

6151
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,870
naive
but there is i think that beauty to a

6152
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:16,880
but there is i think that beauty to a
 

6153
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,070
but there is i think that beauty to a
meaning and a purpose of your life

6154
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,080
meaning and a purpose of your life
 

6155
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,390
meaning and a purpose of your life
that's bigger than yourself working on

6156
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:20,400
that's bigger than yourself working on
 

6157
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,990
that's bigger than yourself working on
something that's bigger and grander than

6158
01:45:21,990 --> 01:45:22,000
something that's bigger and grander than
 

6159
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,430
something that's bigger and grander than
just yourself

6160
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:23,440
just yourself
 

6161
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,510
just yourself
the deepest meaning is from the local

6162
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:25,520
the deepest meaning is from the local
 

6163
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,310
the deepest meaning is from the local
biological reproduction unit and then it

6164
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:28,320
biological reproduction unit and then it
 

6165
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,990
biological reproduction unit and then it
goes to the engineering scientific um

6166
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:32,000
goes to the engineering scientific um
 

6167
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,390
goes to the engineering scientific um
what is it uh corporate like company

6168
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:34,400
what is it uh corporate like company
 

6169
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,709
what is it uh corporate like company
unit that can actually produce and

6170
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:36,719
unit that can actually produce and
 

6171
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:38,629
unit that can actually produce and
compete and interact with the world and

6172
01:45:38,629 --> 01:45:38,639
compete and interact with the world and
 

6173
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,189
compete and interact with the world and
then there's the the giant human unit

6174
01:45:41,189 --> 01:45:41,199
then there's the the giant human unit
 

6175
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:42,229
then there's the the giant human unit
that's

6176
01:45:42,229 --> 01:45:42,239
that's
 

6177
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,709
that's
struggling with pandemics and commons

6178
01:45:44,709 --> 01:45:44,719
struggling with pandemics and commons
 

6179
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:47,910
struggling with pandemics and commons
and and together struggling against the

6180
01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:47,920
and and together struggling against the
 

6181
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,990
and and together struggling against the
forces of nature that keeps wanting to

6182
01:45:49,990 --> 01:45:50,000
forces of nature that keeps wanting to
 

6183
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,070
forces of nature that keeps wanting to
kill us yeah there'd be nothing like an

6184
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:52,080
kill us yeah there'd be nothing like an
 

6185
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,149
kill us yeah there'd be nothing like an
alien invasion to unite the planet we

6186
01:45:54,149 --> 01:45:54,159
alien invasion to unite the planet we
 

6187
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:54,950
alien invasion to unite the planet we
think

6188
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:54,960
