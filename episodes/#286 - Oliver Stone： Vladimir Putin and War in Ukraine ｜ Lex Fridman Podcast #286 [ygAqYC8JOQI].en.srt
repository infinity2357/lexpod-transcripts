a gap of building
 

273
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,150
a gap of building
a huge amount of reactors over the next

274
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
a huge amount of reactors over the next
 

275
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,590
a huge amount of reactors over the next
30 years

276
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
30 years
 

277
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,310
30 years
and

278
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
and
 

279
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,469
and
starting now

280
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
starting now
 

281
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,110
starting now
uh they make that point over and over

282
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
uh they make that point over and over
 

283
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,070
uh they make that point over and over
again

284
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
again
 

285
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,830

so obviously this country the united
 

289
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,550
so obviously this country the united

states is not going to go in that
 

291
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,710
states is not going to go in that
direction because it just

energy that were
 

325
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,189
energy that were
exaggerated

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,430
hour and 40 minutes and that was a hard
part getting it down from

338
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
part getting it down from
 

339
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,189
part getting it down from
about three and a half hours to about

340
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
about three and a half hours to about
 

341
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,430
about three and a half hours to about
this something more manageable and is it

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
this something more manageable and is it

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,230
this something more manageable and is it

346
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
but essentially we went to russia we
 

347
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,550
but essentially we went to russia we
went to france which is the most perhaps

348
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
went to france which is the most perhaps
 

349
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,670
went to france which is the most perhaps
advanced

350
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
nuclear country in the world russia
 

353
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,710
nuclear country in the world russia
and the united states we went to the

354
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
and the united states we went to the
 

355
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,550
and the united states we went to the
idaho laboratory

356
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
idaho laboratory
 

357
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,469
idaho laboratory
and talked to the

358
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
and talked to the
 

359
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,189
and talked to the
the scientists there as well as the

360
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
the scientists there as well as the
 

361
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,710
the scientists there as well as the
department of energy people that are

362
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
department of energy people that are
 

363
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,230
department of energy people that are
handling this idaho is one of the

364
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
handling this idaho is one of the
 

365
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,909
handling this idaho is one of the
experimental labs the united states is

366
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
experimental labs the united states is
 

367
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,270
experimental labs the united states is
probably one of the most advanced and

368
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
probably one of the most advanced and
 

369
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,870
probably one of the most advanced and
they're doing a lot of advanced nuclear

370
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
they're doing a lot of advanced nuclear
 

371
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,749
they're doing a lot of advanced nuclear
there

372
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
there
 

373
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,830
there
we also uh

374
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
we also uh
 

375
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,710
we also uh
we studied well russia gave us a lot of

376
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
we studied well russia gave us a lot of
 

377
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,390
we studied well russia gave us a lot of
uh insight

378
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
uh insight
 

379
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,390
uh insight
we're very cooperative because they have

380
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
we're very cooperative because they have
 

381
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,950
we're very cooperative because they have
some of the most advanced uh nuclear

382
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
some of the most advanced uh nuclear
 

383
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,309
some of the most advanced uh nuclear
actually the probably most advanced

384
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
actually the probably most advanced
 

385
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,550
actually the probably most advanced
nuclear reactor in the world at bellairs

386
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
nuclear reactor in the world at bellairs
 

387
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,309

the ural mountains

388
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
the ural mountains
 

389
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,909
the ural mountains
so we we did an investigation there

390
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
so we we did an investigation there
 

391
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,309
so we we did an investigation there
and uh in france they haven't they have

392
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
and uh in france they haven't they have
 

393
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,390
and uh in france they haven't they have
some very advanced uh

394
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
some very advanced uh
 

395
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,390
some very advanced uh
nuclear reactors and their building and

396
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
nuclear reactors and their building and
 

397
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,309
nuclear reactors and their building and
now they're building again

398
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
now they're building again
 

399
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,230
now they're building again
they had a little the green party came

400
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,240
they had a little the green party came
 

401
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,390
they had a little the green party came
into power and just not into power but

402
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
into power and just not into power but
 

403
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,870
into power and just not into power but
became a factor in france and there was

404
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
became a factor in france and there was
 

405
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,029
became a factor in france and there was
a motion when hollande was president

406
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
a motion when hollande was president
 

407
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,790
a motion when hollande was president
they started to move away from it

408
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
they started to move away from it
 

409
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,110
they started to move away from it
actually they were beginning to just

410
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
actually they were beginning to just
 

411
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,110
actually they were beginning to just
abandon

412
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
abandon
 

413
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,150
abandon
they let not complete their in other

414
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
they let not complete their in other
 

415
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,070
they let not complete their in other
words let close down some of the nuclear

416
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
words let close down some of the nuclear
 

417
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,150
words let close down some of the nuclear
reactors there was talk of that but

418
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
reactors there was talk of that but
 

419
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,629
reactors there was talk of that but
thank god france did not do that and uh

420
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
thank god france did not do that and uh
 

421
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,469
thank god france did not do that and uh
macron came in and

422
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
macron came in and
 

423
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,950
macron came in and
recently reversed it it reversed it and

424
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
recently reversed it it reversed it and
 

425
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,710
recently reversed it it reversed it and
they're building as fast as they can now

426
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
they're building as fast as they can now
 

427
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,029
they're building as fast as they can now
especially with the ukraine war

428
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
especially with the ukraine war
 

429
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,790
especially with the ukraine war
uh going on there's

430
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
uh going on there's
 

431
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,309
uh going on there's
an awareness that

432
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
an awareness that
 

433
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,950
an awareness that
russia will not be providing or may not

434
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
russia will not be providing or may not
 

435
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,749
russia will not be providing or may not
be providing the energy europe needs

436
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
be providing the energy europe needs
 

437
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,710
be providing the energy europe needs
so

438
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
so
 

439
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,230
so
and then china is the other one too

440
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
and then china is the other one too
 

441
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,830
and then china is the other one too
that's the other factor i'm talking

442
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
that's the other factor i'm talking
 

443
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,510
that's the other factor i'm talking
about the big boys

444
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
about the big boys
 

445
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,550
about the big boys
they have doing tremendous work and fast

446
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
they have doing tremendous work and fast
 

447
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,309
they have doing tremendous work and fast
which is very hopeful

448
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
which is very hopeful
 

449
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,070
which is very hopeful
but of course china is building in all

450
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
but of course china is building in all
 

451
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,950
but of course china is building in all
directions at once the coal continues to

452
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
directions at once the coal continues to
 

453
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,029
directions at once the coal continues to
be huge in china

454
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
be huge in china
 

455
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,629
be huge in china
and

456
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:00,639

 

457
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,909

methane too but to basically colder coal

458
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
methane too but to basically colder coal
 

459
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,230
methane too but to basically colder coal
and india in china are the biggest users

460
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
and india in china are the biggest users
 

461
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,629
and india in china are the biggest users
of coal

462
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
of coal
 

463
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,309
of coal
and we know as you know germany went

464
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:10,319
and we know as you know germany went
 

465
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,270
and we know as you know germany went
back to coal a few years ago so all

466
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
back to coal a few years ago so all
 

467
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,350
back to coal a few years ago so all
these factors it's fascinating picture

468
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
these factors it's fascinating picture
 

469
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,510
these factors it's fascinating picture
globally so we try to achieve a

470
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
globally so we try to achieve a
 

471
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,710
globally so we try to achieve a
consensus that where nuclear can work

472
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
consensus that where nuclear can work
 

473
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,510
consensus that where nuclear can work
and where it will be working where and

474
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
and where it will be working where and
 

475
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,950
and where it will be working where and
it will be used more and more the

476
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
it will be used more and more the
 

477
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,270
it will be used more and more the
question is how much carbon dioxide

478
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
question is how much carbon dioxide
 

479
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,309
question is how much carbon dioxide
china

480
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
china
 

481
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,110
china
and russia will be putting out france is

482
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
and russia will be putting out france is
 

483
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,029
and russia will be putting out france is
the only one that's not putting it out

484
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
the only one that's not putting it out
 

485
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,709
the only one that's not putting it out
the united states has not changed with

486
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
the united states has not changed with
 

487
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,350
the united states has not changed with
all the talk and all the nonsense about

488
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
all the talk and all the nonsense about
 

489
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,509
all the talk and all the nonsense about
renewables and

490
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
renewables and
 

491
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,750
renewables and
the new lifestyle and all this it's it's

492
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
the new lifestyle and all this it's it's
 

493
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,430
the new lifestyle and all this it's it's
great for your guilt complex but it

494
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
great for your guilt complex but it
 

495
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,070
great for your guilt complex but it
doesn't do anything for the total commun

496
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
doesn't do anything for the total commun
 

497
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,230
doesn't do anything for the total commun

accumulation of carbon dioxide in the
 

499
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,910

to be a uni united nations kind of thing
because the world doesn't seem capable

510
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
because the world doesn't seem capable
 

511
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,509
because the world doesn't seem capable
of uniting we don't we go to these

actually enforce so i don't think it can

520
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
actually enforce so i don't think it can
 

521
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,870
actually enforce so i don't think it can
happen that way i think it's

522
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
happen that way i think it's
 

523
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,470
happen that way i think it's
going to be an individual race with

going to be an individual race with
 

525
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,230
going to be an individual race with
countries they're going to just be do it

countries they're going to just be do it
 

527
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,630

529
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,990
for their own self-interest like china
is doing it

530
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
is doing it
 

531
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,430
is doing it
china

532
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
china
 

533
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,269
china
the thing is if it works and i'm praying

534
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
the thing is if it works and i'm praying
 

535
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,509
the thing is if it works and i'm praying
that it will really work on a big scale

536
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
that it will really work on a big scale
 

537
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,990
that it will really work on a big scale
china will back away from coal naturally

538
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
china will back away from coal naturally
 

539
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,750
china will back away from coal naturally
the same thing will be true of india

540
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
the same thing will be true of india
 

541
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,990
the same thing will be true of india
they will see the benefits

542
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
they will see the benefits
 

543
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,509
they will see the benefits
because if you go to india you see the

544
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
because if you go to india you see the
 

545
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,750
because if you go to india you see the
cities the pollution you walk around in

546
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:33,760
cities the pollution you walk around in
 

547
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,509
cities the pollution you walk around in
that stuff and you know you get

548
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
that stuff and you know you get
 

549
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,389
that stuff and you know you get
it's not there's no hope in this and you

550
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
it's not there's no hope in this and you
 

551
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,470
it's not there's no hope in this and you
sense it so people will move in this

552
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
sense it so people will move in this
 

553
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,030
sense it so people will move in this
direction naturally because nuclear is

554
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
direction naturally because nuclear is
 

555
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,710
direction naturally because nuclear is
clean energy

556
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
clean energy
 

557
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,870
clean energy
and the amount of

558
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
and the amount of
 

559
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,190
and the amount of
casualties of nuclear is the lowest on

560
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
casualties of nuclear is the lowest on
 

561
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,190
casualties of nuclear is the lowest on
the industrial scale for energy

562
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
the industrial scale for energy
 

563
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,389
the industrial scale for energy
producing

564
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
producing
 

565
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,310
producing
from coal down to oil everything the

566
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
from coal down to oil everything the
 

567
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,949
from coal down to oil everything the
lowest casualty rate

568
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
lowest casualty rate
 

569
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,790
lowest casualty rate
very low is .002 or something is nuclear

570
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,800
very low is .002 or something is nuclear
 

571
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,750
very low is .002 or something is nuclear
so

572
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
so
 

573
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,269
so
not that many people have died from

574
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
not that many people have died from
 

575
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,590
not that many people have died from
nuclear not that many i think

576
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
nuclear not that many i think
 

577
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,829
nuclear not that many i think
50 people at chernobyl which was the

it's just not true

it's just not true
 

669

it's just not true
but it it tilted the scale back in the

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,670
but it it tilted the scale back in the
50s 60s and started the question

672
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:53,680
50s 60s and started the question
 

673
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,430
50s 60s and started the question
questioning the nuclear

674
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
questioning the nuclear
 

675
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,949
questioning the nuclear
business do you think that was

676
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:56,959
business do you think that was
 

677
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,190
business do you think that was
malevolence or incompetence no i think

678
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
malevolence or incompetence no i think
 

679
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,949
malevolence or incompetence no i think
it was competition

680
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
it was competition
 

681
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,629

i don't think it was conspiracy as much
 

683
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,949
i don't think it was conspiracy as much

the world
 

695
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,470
the world
will have to learn through

when the fukushima happened they went
 

723
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,310
when the fukushima happened they went
out of the nuclear business that was

724
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:44,320
out of the nuclear business that was
 

725
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,069
out of the nuclear business that was
shocking to me

726
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
shocking to me
 

727
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,509

destroyed uh
 

731
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,949
destroyed uh
destructed several of their nuclear

732
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959
destructed several of their nuclear
 

733
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,949
destructed several of their nuclear
reactors that were still functioning and

reactors that were still functioning and
 

735
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,870

put up coal
 

737
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,750

or yeah put up coal and oil
 

741
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,790
or yeah put up coal and oil
replaced it and as a result

happen it's very well
i think many of us thought that the

3354
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:51,599
i think many of us thought that the
 

3355
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,589
i think many of us thought that the
united states is building this up into

3356
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:53,599
united states is building this up into
 

3357
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,670
united states is building this up into
an invasion in other words that's that

3358
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:55,680
an invasion in other words that's that
 

3359
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,150
an invasion in other words that's that
is the nature of false flag operations

3360
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
is the nature of false flag operations
 

3361
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,950
is the nature of false flag operations
when you you create this propaganda they

3362
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:00,960
when you you create this propaganda they
 

3363
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,230
when you you create this propaganda they
are going to invade they are going to

3364

3367
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,710
invade and then when they invaded the
united states was completely ready and

3368
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:06,720
united states was completely ready and
 

3369
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,230

all their allies were completely ready
 

3371
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,390

for the invasion correct so why did
 

3373
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,309
for the invasion correct so why did
putin do that he fell into this

3374
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:12,319
putin do that he fell into this
 

3375
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,470
putin do that he fell into this
theoretically into this trap set by the

00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:14,480
theoretically into this trap set by the
 

3377
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,990
theoretically into this trap set by the
united states that

3378
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:16,000
united states that
 

3379
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,510
united states that
here you're telling all your allies

before 2022 in donbass than have been
 

3765
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,630
before 2022 in donbass than have been
killed in this latest so we can't talk

01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:16,640
killed in this latest so we can't talk
 

3767
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,710

the invasion ukraine without considering

01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:20,480
the invasion ukraine without considering
 

3771
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,710
the invasion ukraine without considering
the full war between russia and ukraine

3772
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:22,720
the full war between russia and ukraine
 

3773
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,390
the full war between russia and ukraine
since 2014. that's correct absolutely

3774
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
since 2014. that's correct absolutely
 

3775
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,990
since 2014. that's correct absolutely
and

3776
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:28,000
and
 

3777
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,069
and
take the toll on both sides and you

3778
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:30,079
take the toll on both sides and you
 

3779
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,789
take the toll on both sides and you
might be surprised by the result uh i

3780
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:32,799
might be surprised by the result uh i
 

3781
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,870
might be surprised by the result uh i
think the russian military of course i'm

3782
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:34,880
think the russian military of course i'm
 

3783
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,710
think the russian military of course i'm
not there and i'm not this could be this

3784
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:36,720
not there and i'm not this could be this
 

3785
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,470
not there and i'm not this could be this
is speculation the russian military has

3786
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:38,480
is speculation the russian military has
 

3787
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,630
is speculation the russian military has
slowed down and part of that reason is

3788
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:40,640
slowed down and part of that reason is
 

3789
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,109
slowed down and part of that reason is
not to keep the civilian corridors open

3790
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,119
not to keep the civilian corridors open
 

3791
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,190
not to keep the civilian corridors open
and i think the ukrainian military has

3792
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,200
and i think the ukrainian military has
 

3793
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,510
and i think the ukrainian military has
made it more difficult on purpose

3794
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:47,520
made it more difficult on purpose
 

3795
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,190
made it more difficult on purpose
especially some of these battalions that

3796
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
especially some of these battalions that
 

3797
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,870
especially some of these battalions that
are death squad battalions have gone out

3798
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:50,880
are death squad battalions have gone out
 

3799
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,950
are death squad battalions have gone out
of their way to keep the civilians

3800
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:52,960
of their way to keep the civilians
 

3801
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,589
of their way to keep the civilians
locked into these cities in danger

3802
01:06:55,589 --> 01:06:55,599
locked into these cities in danger
 

3803
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,309
locked into these cities in danger
because it's in their interest to do so

3804
01:06:58,309 --> 01:06:58,319
because it's in their interest to do so
 

3805
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,789
because it's in their interest to do so
so there's no reason why ukrainian

3806
01:07:00,789 --> 01:07:00,799
so there's no reason why ukrainian
 

3807
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,710
so there's no reason why ukrainian
military who have killed ukrainian

3808
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:02,720
military who have killed ukrainian
 

3809
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,870
military who have killed ukrainian
civilians for years would change their

3811
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,990
civilians for years would change their
policies

3812
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,000
policies
 

3813
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,589
policies
they would have no compunctions about

3814
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:07,599
they would have no compunctions about
 

3815
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,910
they would have no compunctions about
wiping out for example people with white

3816
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:09,920
wiping out for example people with white
 

3817

3880
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:15,520
and that's that would be a reasonable
 

3881
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,349
and that's that would be a reasonable
approach so you take it to the next

3882
01:08:17,349 --> 01:08:17,359
approach so you take it to the next
 

3883
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,030
approach so you take it to the next
stage as putin's thinking you take it to

3884
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:19,040
stage as putin's thinking you take it to
 

3885
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,550
stage as putin's thinking you take it to
the next stage you

3886
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:20,560
the next stage you
 

3887
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,990
the next stage you
you stall

3888
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:22,000
you stall
 

3889
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,990
you stall
it's harder for your people of course

3890
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:24,000
it's harder for your people of course
 

3891
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,590
it's harder for your people of course
there's pressure on putin from inside

3892
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:25,600
there's pressure on putin from inside
 

3893
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,269
there's pressure on putin from inside
his own government

3894
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:27,279
his own government
 

3895
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,709
his own government
to say what are you going to do you mean

3896
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:28,719

01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:30,149
to say what are you going to do you mean
you can't do this there's a lot of

3898
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:30,159
you can't do this there's a lot of
 

3899
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:32,149
you can't do this there's a lot of
nationalists in russia they would

3900
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159

it would be to his they'd say putin is

3904
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:35,359
it would be to his they'd say putin is
 

3905
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,510
it would be to his they'd say putin is
weak and that's the biggest rap you can

3906
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:37,520
weak and that's the biggest rap you can

weak you can't get anything done
 

3911
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,870
weak you can't get anything done
so there would have been some damage but

3912
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:42,880
so there would have been some damage but
 

3913
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,709
so there would have been some damage but

what would you do now

4674
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:40,320
what would you do now
 

4675
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,550
what would you do now
what's the what's the us next move

4676
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:42,560
what's the what's the us next move
 

4677
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,189
what's the what's the us next move
and in your opinion how are you gonna

4678
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:45,199
and in your opinion how are you gonna
 

4679
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:46,709
and in your opinion how are you gonna
okay where are we gonna go that's that

4680
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
okay where are we gonna go that's that
 

4681
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,830
okay where are we gonna go that's that
would be the key question because it's

4682
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:49,840
would be the key question because it's
 

4683
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,149
would be the key question because it's

4684
01:21:52,149 --> 01:21:52,159
but he didn't go that way he chose to
 

4685
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,990
but he didn't go that way he chose to
take the sanctions and

4686
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
take the sanctions and
 

4687
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,030
take the sanctions and
and to go this way why he did that is a

4688
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:57,040
and to go this way why he did that is a
 

4689
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,870
and to go this way why he did that is a
key question for our time

4690
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:58,880
key question for our time
 

4691
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,310
key question for our time
uh

4692
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:00,320
uh
 

4693
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,070
uh
perhaps it was a mistake perhaps it was

4694
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,080
perhaps it was a mistake perhaps it was
 

4695
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,310
perhaps it was a mistake perhaps it was
his judgment perhaps as i said but i

4696
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
his judgment perhaps as i said but i
 

4697
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,189
his judgment perhaps as i said but i
don't

4698
01:22:05,189 --> 01:22:05,199
don't
 

4699
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:07,270
don't
knowing the man i did i don't think so i

4700
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:07,280
knowing the man i did i don't think so i
 

4701
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,350
knowing the man i did i don't think so i
think it was calculated

4702
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
think it was calculated
 

4703
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,229
think it was calculated
now this is projection and speculation

4704
01:22:12,229 --> 01:22:12,239
now this is projection and speculation
 

4705
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,830
now this is projection and speculation

actually
so perhaps

4762
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:05,360
so perhaps
 

4763
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,430
so perhaps
there was a calculation and he

4764
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:07,440
there was a calculation and he
 

4765
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,030

01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,229
invade
perhaps there was a calculation perhaps

4772
01:23:14,229 --> 01:23:14,239
perhaps there was a calculation perhaps
 

4773
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,709
perhaps there was a calculation perhaps
he had a calm and clear mind

4774

he had a calm and clear mind
 

4775
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,950
he had a calm and clear mind
and he calculated wrong well he also

4776
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:18,960
and he calculated wrong well he also
 

4777
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,870
and he calculated wrong well he also
made the point that he had there the

01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:20,880
made the point that he had there the
 

4779
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,790
made the point that he had there the
talk of zelinski saying

4780

ukraine there was talk about that right
before the invasion too and certainly

4786
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:28,400
before the invasion too and certainly
 

4787
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,870
before the invasion too and certainly
that would have set off alarms

4788
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:30,880
that would have set off alarms
 

4789

kind of doing that by not only putting

01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,990
kind of doing that by not only putting

01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:42,719
the next question that comes up the most
 

4801
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,550
the next question that comes up the most
immediate question is

4802
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:44,560
immediate question is
 

4803
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,310
immediate question is
is the united states

4804
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:46,320
is the united states
 

4805
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,590
is the united states
going to start

4806

going to start
 

4807
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,550
going to start
and i'm saying this is good

4808
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:50,560
and i'm saying this is good
 

4809

01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:00,719
again going back to my analogy when the
 

4819
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,790
again going back to my analogy when the
united states starts that it starts the

united states starts that it starts the
 

4821
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,950
united states starts that it starts the

01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:07,280
of the united states
 

4825
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:12,310
of the united states
for russia to be pinned with any kind of
